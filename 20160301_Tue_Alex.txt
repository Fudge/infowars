[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:05.273]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we're cutting in at the start of the show because this is so important.
[00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:09.616]  I am in contact with Trump insiders, not just with Roger Stone.
[00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:16.021]  There is massive election fraud happening all over the country in Super Tuesday against Trump, including here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:22.125]  NewsRadio 590 that we're closely affiliated with has had scores of calls coming in, and it's all the same thing.
[00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.288]  It's flipping from Trump to Rubio en masse.
[00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:26.248]  We've got a special report.
[00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:28.050]  We're coming down after that to break it down.
[00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:43.077]  The racial division flaring up in the United States, imposed on the average non-racist American by the self-anointed leaders of the African-American community, based on the color of our skin, appears to be imploding.
[00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:57.584]  Whether it's Hollywood's Academy Awards, the annual self-important spectacle crashed by the cloud of racism lurking over its proceedings, awarding Chris Rock's Black Host Matters monologue style with ratings reaching an eight-year low.
[00:00:58.264 --> 00:00:59.985]  Is Hollywood racist?
[00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:05.186]  Yeah, damn right Hollywood's racist, but it ain't that racist that you've grown accustomed to.
[00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:09.127]  Hollywood is sorority racist.
[00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:12.188]  We're MSNBC, Racebaiters Central.
[00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:20.411]  Nothing less than a government-funded megaphone for the media prostitutes launching their New World Order division diatribe on a nightly basis.
[00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:27.440]  Well, I think many people would like to see an African American on the Supreme Court.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.906]  We don't really need to go into Clarence Thomas's background or his behavior.
[00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:38.916]  Steve Watson writes, what Sharpton and Bass are really implying is that they want to see someone nominated to the Supreme Court
[00:01:39.156 --> 00:01:45.220]  Who will play the race card and will make decisions based not on whether or not they're consistent with the U.S.
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.983]  Constitution, but based on the color of his or her skin.
[00:01:48.983 --> 00:02:01.612]  Indeed, Justice Thomas recently asserted that the nation is far too obsessed with racial differences, prompting liberals to hurl racist slurs, while others implied that the black judge was himself being racist.
[00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:14.697]  MSNBC's Rachel Maddow blog responded to Thomas' speech by attempting to argue that more race consciousness was a good thing because nobody wanted to return to the 1960s Jim Crow era.
[00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:18.418]  A CNN segment also implied that Thomas himself was racist.
[00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.139]  for wanting to move on from race even being an issue.
[00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:34.384]  Sharpton also suggested that Senate resistance to confirming a new justice is another sign that the Senate does not consider Obama to be a legitimate president due to his race.
[00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:41.427]  And now a major mouthpiece of weaponized inequality has been relieved of her post, Melissa Harris Perry.
[00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:55.820]  But I want us to be super careful when we use the language hard worker because, I mean, I actually keep an image of folks working in cotton fields on my office wall because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:05.769]  We have to create a safety net for poor people and when we won't because they happen to look different from us, it is the pervasive of ugliness!
[00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.134]  was dismissed from MSNBC on February 28th due to these comments from an email.
[00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:16.617]  She wrote, I will not be used as a tool for management's purposes.
[00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:20.520]  I am not a token mammy or a little brown bobblehead.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:32.149]  Perry wanted to continue her platform of division in the glorification of New World Order policy, whether it was opiating the masses with the Obama administration's plan to install a government worker
[00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:43.020]  To oversee every child in America, believe it or not, the deceptive Black Lives Matter movement is a counterfeit movement, funded by billionaire George Soros.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:52.089]  And it's the brainchild of the New World Order establishment, intended to divide America and drive us towards their vision of a civil war.
[00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.333]  The irony is that millions of Americans are descended from many races.
[00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:10.003]  That reason clearly dictates that all Americans should resolve and finally overcome these issues together, and not as divided sheep to be led by the lunacy revered by the elitist social engineers.
[00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:18.210]  Since the 1970s, we were already making progress on equality without the help of genocidal eugenics-touting psychopaths.
[00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.292]  So much so, that they had to intervene.
[00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:22.453]  Millennial generation.
[00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:32.319]  Where is the grassroots movement of true American racial equality to counter the force-fed, billionaire-backed Black Lives Matter movement?
[00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:46.148]  Until that happens, a xenophobic stupidity of racial division will slowly increase and your generation and future generations will be completely consumed by the New World Order agenda.
[00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:48.090]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Super Tuesday.
[00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:57.174]  Massive election fraud against Donald Trump appears to be taking place from Ohio to Texas.
[00:04:57.174 --> 00:04:58.254]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.254 --> 00:04:59.575]  Trap yourselves in and get ready.
[00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.235]  Shock poll!
[00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:05.696]  Hillary could lose to Trump in Democratic New York.
[00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:06.297]  That's right.
[00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:14.140]  Polling data shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York, a Democratic stronghold, to Donald Trump, as the GOP frontrunner gains broad support across party lines.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:23.984]  The poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have surprised virtually all the leading Democrats who have endorsed Clinton, while also energizing GOP leaders who are now warming up to Trump.
[00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:30.147]  And the results found that Clinton has higher negative ratings with New York voters than Trump, despite the fact she served as a New York senator.
[00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:35.330]  Some of the polls also found much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters than along Clinton's.
[00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.732]  A finding that mirrors the record-breaking GOP turnouts in state primaries so far.
[00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:43.134]  In other words, Trump supporters will actually show up to the voting booth.
[00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:47.837]  This past weekend, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump during a campaign rally.
[00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:55.101]  During the rally, Sessions lashed out at the Trans-Pacific Partnership and promised that amnesty will not be granted to illegals during a Trump presidency.
[00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:57.763]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:05.715]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:07:57.553 --> 00:07:59.435]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:15.787]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:26.411]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:30.132]  It is Super Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:36.315]  And at about 8 o'clock in the morning, my former producer, Mike Hanson, called me.
[00:08:38.148 --> 00:08:40.529]  I've been working with him for 20 years.
[00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.991]  And he said, you better tune into 590 News Radio.
[00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:46.533]  They're having call after call after call.
[00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:50.555]  Saying, we're trying to vote for Trump, but it's flipping to Rubio.
[00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:56.118]  A few of the callers said it was flipping to Cruz.
[00:08:56.118 --> 00:09:03.982]  And then by the time I went to their website on my iPhone, because I was exercising, started listening, I heard a few calls.
[00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:06.344]  Then I had to go back in, get ready for the show, come into work.
[00:09:08.024 --> 00:09:22.052]  And then CJ Oden, cool last name, one of our producers, he tuned in when he was driving into work at about 8.45 and in just 15-20 minutes he heard four phone calls saying it.
[00:09:22.052 --> 00:09:32.058]  Now I've called 590, I've talked to a few other people, I'm trying to talk to their news director, Mark Caesar, I've been friends with for 20 years, of course we've been on that station as well, off and on over 20 years, and
[00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:40.170]  We are trying to find out the exact number, but it's also now calls to other news radio channels.
[00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.970]  That's the dominant one.
[00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.331]  It is calls into election judges.
[00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:55.474]  We have reporters now going downtown to try to talk to some people and to talk to some exit polls and get people's responses coming out because there's heavy, heavy voting in this Super Tuesday primary.
[00:09:55.894 --> 00:10:05.785]  Imagine Austin, Texas with Bernie Sanders and Hillary and then Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich and others.
[00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:11.091]  Roger Stone was already scheduled, again the consummate Trump insider and confidant of more than 40 years.
[00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:15.078]  I mean, these guys are like best buddies.
[00:10:15.078 --> 00:10:19.721]  They hang out and go out to dinner and play golf together on a weekly basis.
[00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:21.382]  And I was just talking to Roger before the show.
[00:10:21.382 --> 00:10:24.964]  He told me a bunch of stuff I can't repeat.
[00:10:24.964 --> 00:10:27.906]  But he is joining us and he said Ohio is the big one.
[00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:40.494]  He said their sources, their people on the ground, they're being flooded with calls and confirmations that in Ohio, where he has gone ahead of the governor,
[00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:48.875]  Kasich that they are stealing it from Trump and from another campaign source close to Trump.
[00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:54.577]  Trump is really concerned right now and now they know why Karl Rove and the Republicans have been so cocky.
[00:10:54.577 --> 00:11:05.260]  You don't just think they were going to steal the election or try to from Bernie Sanders in Iowa or in New Hampshire with six coin tosses, one in a row to break the tie.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.907]  With 20 points win in New Hampshire, but Hillary gets the delegates, most of the delegates.
[00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:14.928]  The fix is in.
[00:11:14.928 --> 00:11:19.253]  The problem is if there's a tsunami, and I've interviewed all the top election fraud experts.
[00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.868]  We're going to get a whole raft of them on, obviously, going into this election.
[00:11:22.868 --> 00:11:24.428]  We're lining that up now.
[00:11:24.428 --> 00:11:26.229]  When there's a tsunami, they can't beat it.
[00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:42.433]  And the fact that Trump, in most states, has double-digit leads over Rubio, who they've now foisted in a number two position with CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ABC, CBS, all of them behind him.
[00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:45.554]  Despite that, Trump has got double-digit leads and is gaining.
[00:11:47.335 --> 00:12:00.381]  And if he doesn't win in almost every state by large, large portions, because these states aren't winner-take-all, you know there's fraud going on, and get ready for the attempt at a brokerage invention.
[00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:14.347]  And that's why Roger Stone said he needs everybody, the grassroots, to really focus on what he's about to cover in 15 minutes, when he joins us, 17, 18 minutes to be technical, at the bottom of the hour, 33 after, when we come in from break.
[00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:24.415]  Because he's the guy that James Baker and the Bushes brought in to be second in command of the recount in Florida.
[00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:24.995]  He's the guy.
[00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:32.943]  He says he's ashamed of it, and ashamed of George W. Bush, and that's when he turned against him when they attacked Iraq, started writing books against him at that time.
[00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:38.088]  And to his credit, he's done nothing but attack him for 14, 13 years over.
[00:12:38.088 --> 00:12:39.510]  But he knows what he's talking about.
[00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:43.409]  And he said it is happening.
[00:12:43.409 --> 00:12:45.749]  That means everybody's got to turn out for Trump.
[00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:51.611]  And if you were going to vote for Carson, or if you were going to vote for somebody else, or Kasich, you're throwing it away.
[00:12:51.611 --> 00:13:07.615]  And clearly, the Chinese government, the British government, the former Mexican president, all the elite publications, the Davos group, the Bilderberg group, are all saying, Obama is saying, the Republican leadership is saying, Fox News is saying, you can't have Donald Trump.
[00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.462]  And they're making up all this Klan garbage.
[00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:14.868]  Hillary said, oh my mentor Robert Byrd, I loved him so much when he died.
[00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:20.397]  The former head of the entire Ku Klux Klan, nationwide, back when they were killing people.
[00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:30.184]  And they play all these games, even though he's now put down the Klan three different times, twice years ago, another time.
[00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:33.065]  They keep saying, no, say you're against it again, say you're against it again.
[00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:35.927]  I can't tell you how many times the media stopped this because it doesn't work anymore.
[00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:37.348]  They'd say, are you a racist?
[00:13:37.348 --> 00:13:38.949]  What do you think of the Ku Klux Klan?
[00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:40.270]  I used to get those questions all the time.
[00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.173]  When I caught bribery at the Capitol, they asked if I was racist.
[00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:46.675]  And at a certain point, it's like saying, do you rape your wife?
[00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.636]  You just don't even want to answer it.
[00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:51.638]  You want to slap somebody upside the head.
[00:13:51.638 --> 00:13:53.139]  That's what these people are doing.
[00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.371]  And it is amazing to see them pulling out all the stops.
[00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.392]  But the story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:04.314]  It's the top middle column.
[00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:05.775]  Top story on the middle column.
[00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:06.595]  Report.
[00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:12.058]  Trump supporters in Texas see votes switched to Rubio.
[00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:17.440]  Callers to KLBJ report ballot irregularities.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.002]  And I would just point out NewsRadioKLBJ for folks that don't know.
[00:14:22.002 --> 00:14:23.383]  People voting for Trump
[00:14:24.943 --> 00:14:29.845]  In today's Super Tuesday, Primary are seeing their ballots changed to show a vote for Marco Rubio.
[00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:37.567]  Numerous callers flooded Austin-based station KLBJ this morning with reports of mistakes after they tried to vote for Trump.
[00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:41.209]  And then it's got the tweets and people talking and 590's got an article out on it.
[00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:44.770]  According to KLBJ, computer freeze-ups and other glitches, that's when you know.
[00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:53.033]  I went early, voted, worked fine, voted a straight ticket on all the single Republicans that were running, and then voted for a few people that were running as Libertarians.
[00:14:55.745 --> 00:15:00.488]  But unopposed Republicans who are going against Democrats have voted for them.
[00:15:00.488 --> 00:15:02.730]  Trump supporters, but no glitch, no problem.
[00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.672]  But notice, oh, there's a glitch, and then it gives you something else.
[00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.073]  That's the program laid in there.
[00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.934]  That's how it works.
[00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:15.819]  Trump supporters previously accused the Rubio campaign of stealing votes in Iowa after the Florida senator achieved a surprise third place finish.
[00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:23.044]  If Rubio fails to secure a strong finish in today's primaries, he could be forced to drop out of the race altogether.
[00:15:23.044 --> 00:15:25.266]  So this is a desperate attempt to keep him in.
[00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:36.678]  Rubio's Super PAC has poured $1.5 million of its budget into Texas in an effort to take delegates away from the home state favorite Ted Cruz, and we're updating that right now with the info that Roger Stone gave us.
[00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:43.761]  Now, I need to add here that we're going to cover this later.
[00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:56.087]  The Koch brothers came out yesterday in the New York Times and in Town Hall and in BuzzFeed and in a bunch of other places and said, we aren't involved in the Republican primary.
[00:15:58.151 --> 00:16:04.635]  That's like Clinton saying he's not involved with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, sexually.
[00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:08.678]  And that they're not giving any money and they're out of this race for the Republicans.
[00:16:08.678 --> 00:16:13.441]  Well, they're on record financing it the whole time, trying to get certain people in.
[00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:16.563]  They've given money to Rubio and others.
[00:16:16.563 --> 00:16:17.003]  So what?
[00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.351]  So I've got their quotes.
[00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:20.851]  That's coming up as well.
[00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:29.797]  They say Roger Stone is wrong, but their top campaign operative has now gone over to run the Rubio campaign because they give him all this money last Friday.
[00:16:29.797 --> 00:16:32.799]  Last Thursday, they had a super PAC meeting in New York.
[00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.819]  That was in the news.
[00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:34.700]  The details were secret.
[00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:38.616]  We're good to go.
[00:16:52.406 --> 00:16:56.127]  Coke guys send their man in, right as this is announced, to run it.
[00:16:56.127 --> 00:16:57.128]  Oh no!
[00:16:57.128 --> 00:16:58.508]  They didn't give any money.
[00:16:58.508 --> 00:17:02.269]  And there's no corruption and no election stealing going on.
[00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:05.310]  And I am a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.430]  And I believe in Santa Claus.
[00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.111]  And I want to go to CJ.
[00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:13.237]  Odin, one of our great producers, who heard a lot of these calls today as well.
[00:17:13.237 --> 00:17:14.298]  We've called 590.
[00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:16.641]  We're trying to get the calls.
[00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.862]  I think their podcast will be up soon.
[00:17:17.862 --> 00:17:20.886]  We'll be able to grab it and put some of the calls up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:20.886 --> 00:17:23.449]  We're going to send some reporters over there in a little while.
[00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:26.793]  But this is a big deal because this is being reported all over Austin.
[00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.154]  Another friend of mine's wife
[00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:30.657]  He called me and said, no, it happened to her.
[00:17:30.657 --> 00:17:32.879]  This is before I even had a story out.
[00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:34.781]  I'm driving into work and I'm getting these calls.
[00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:36.983]  So, I'm getting texts, I'm getting calls.
[00:17:36.983 --> 00:17:38.925]  This is widespread.
[00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:41.427]  CJ, tell us exactly what you heard on NewsRadio 590 KLBJ today.
[00:17:42.961 --> 00:18:03.623]  Well, after leaving my polling place, after voting this morning, I was running a little bit late, so I heard more of the show than normal, and there were at least three callers, one from Georgetown and two from Round Rock, that said they had indicated Trump on their, I guess, computerized voting machine, and by the time they got to review, they noticed that their vote had been changed to Rubio.
[00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:07.146]  And when I voted this morning, I noticed one anomaly.
[00:18:07.146 --> 00:18:09.647]  I voted no on one proposition.
[00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:14.410]  When I went to review, it indicated I voted yes on all four propositions that I was voting on.
[00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.451]  That is incredible.
[00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:18.172]  So I did review the presidential candidates.
[00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:24.376]  There was no change there, but it was awkward that right off the bat I noticed a problem where it indicated the wrong.
[00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:26.157]  Did it let you reverse?
[00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:27.118]  It did let me go back.
[00:18:27.118 --> 00:18:30.800]  And each caller reported that they were able to go back and fix it.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.341]  But it makes me worry about people that aren't able to go back and fix it.
[00:18:34.341 --> 00:18:40.304]  Well, I probably interviewed 30 of the top experts like Bev Harris and countless others and the Diebold fellow that went public.
[00:18:41.718 --> 00:18:44.200]  The Florida Legislature and others, and that's what they say.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:51.445]  There's different systems, but it'll show, it'll glitch, and then change it, and then you go back and think you've changed it, but it's already been done.
[00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:54.728]  And that's one of the most classic hack frauds they do.
[00:18:54.728 --> 00:18:56.069]  This doesn't sound too good, CJ.
[00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:56.489]  Right.
[00:18:56.489 --> 00:19:01.533]  There's no way of going back and fully vetting code if it's been tampered with.
[00:19:01.533 --> 00:19:08.158]  At least with dimpled chads, you can hire some people that can clearly see what paper's been meddled with and what hasn't.
[00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:13.500]  Wow, and again, you just heard part of the four-hour radio show.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:21.304]  Reportedly, this was just ongoing until the station that is very conservative with what they run with, very respected news radio channel.
[00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:26.767]  It's won all sorts of national awards, formerly owned by, obviously, the Johnson family, now owned by Emmes.
[00:19:28.648 --> 00:19:36.271]  I mean, they got so many calls and so many tweets and so many people and so many of the reporters got called that they went ahead and put a story out saying, it appears this is really going on.
[00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:39.432]  And again, it's not like they're getting glitches for everybody.
[00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:41.132]  Oh, I voted for Rubio and it went for Trump.
[00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:43.713]  It's all, I voted for Trump, it went for Rubio.
[00:19:43.713 --> 00:19:45.594]  I voted for Trump, it went for Rubio.
[00:19:45.594 --> 00:19:47.094]  I voted for Trump, it went for Rubio.
[00:19:47.094 --> 00:19:49.195]  I voted for Trump, it went for Cruz.
[00:19:49.195 --> 00:19:54.777]  And the same thing, calls about the propositions going the way the establishment wants.
[00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:57.338]  And of course, they don't want to get rid of the state income tax.
[00:19:58.459 --> 00:20:02.744]  Or they don't want to get rid of the state property tax.
[00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:05.248]  Folks are saying that was flipping the wrong way.
[00:20:05.248 --> 00:20:07.931]  So it really looks like there is some manipulation going on.
[00:20:07.931 --> 00:20:12.117]  What do you make of the reports coming in from Roger Stone that joins us in 13 minutes?
[00:20:12.117 --> 00:20:14.500]  The massive election fraud taking place in Ohio.
[00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.923]  I think it's what we feared, but we expected it.
[00:20:17.923 --> 00:20:20.064]  It's happened before.
[00:20:20.064 --> 00:20:30.591]  I encourage everyone out there to either vote on paper or thoroughly check their electronic review form before they submit the ballot.
[00:20:30.591 --> 00:20:34.514]  And that's why I became involved in elections and became a
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.327]  Alternate judge one time and I was down there at the main center where they were bringing in all the ballots from the precincts.
[00:20:40.327 --> 00:20:45.696]  We would stack them in the right order and put them in the scantrons and almost everybody there were Pat Buchanan supporters.
[00:20:45.696 --> 00:20:46.677]  It was the Republican primary.
[00:20:47.677 --> 00:20:47.877]  This is
[00:21:09.377 --> 00:21:18.003]  And places like Arizona, where he was winning by huge majorities in the exit polls, but still lost massively.
[00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:20.124]  So they do not want these type of people in.
[00:21:20.124 --> 00:21:25.588]  I wonder if they've got the huevos to steal this from Trump in front of everybody.
[00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:26.388]  I think they do.
[00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:26.848]  I think they do.
[00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:29.250]  It's happened on a grand scale in Scotland.
[00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.891]  It's something that's pretty widespread.
[00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:35.074]  I think for an election this important, it would not surprise me.
[00:21:35.074 --> 00:21:36.955]  And it's a lot easier to hide being digital.
[00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:38.789]  Unfortunately.
[00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:55.315]  Well, Trump is not going to put up with it, and he has the money to, if they still have paper ballots, to pull him out and have him recounted, but they're going to call him a shower puss and everything, but you can't have him with 45 leads, 40 leads, and the next guy's 20 points, and then have him lose.
[00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.856]  I mean, they just can't do it when it's a landslide, CJ.
[00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.252]  I don't think so.
[00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.294]  I don't think so.
[00:22:02.294 --> 00:22:05.078]  It could be trying to skew votes more in Cruz's favor.
[00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:10.165]  I can't quite tell what adding to Rubio's count is going to do for them.
[00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.468]  David Knight wasn't for Trump.
[00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:16.750]  Lee Ann McEnany wasn't for Trump.
[00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.132]  I wasn't sure about it, but I knew they were against him.
[00:22:19.132 --> 00:22:25.639]  But now the whole world, the Chinese Communists, everybody says you can't have Trump, and now it looks like fraud going on.
[00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:28.101]  And Stone says it's coming in from all over the country.
[00:22:28.101 --> 00:22:29.342]  How could we not then?
[00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:31.312]  Behind Trump?
[00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:55.805]  The Chinese and Indian and Mexican internal tariffs that are fraudulent tariffs that make it impossible for us to have jobs.
[00:22:55.805 --> 00:23:02.793]  I mean they are scared of him because he's not perfect but he does want to turn the engine back on of the nation.
[00:23:02.793 --> 00:23:07.018]  He doesn't want us going into cardiac arrest and he's not a globalist and they want to run the country.
[00:23:07.498 --> 00:23:08.858]  And so they're scared to death of him?
[00:23:08.858 --> 00:23:10.799]  He's the most significant threat against Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:13.280]  I think that's the big reason why you're going to mess with Trump.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:13.980]  Polls show it!
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.161]  I don't think Ted Cruz or Rubio would stand a chance.
[00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:22.583]  People would accept that victory that Clinton's going to have over them if they're the nominees or if one of them is the nominee.
[00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:25.844]  Trump is by far the popular favorite in the country.
[00:23:25.844 --> 00:23:30.285]  It's not just his politics but his business sense that people are rallying behind.
[00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:33.486]  Everyone I know is voting for him except a few people for Cruz.
[00:23:33.486 --> 00:23:34.967]  I know Democrats that are voting for Trump.
[00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:38.943]  Absolutely, they're sick of it.
[00:23:38.943 --> 00:23:40.445]  And what happens when they steal it from Sanders?
[00:23:40.445 --> 00:23:41.787]  They're totally stealing it.
[00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:46.492]  He gets 50, 100,000 people, Hillary gets 1,000, and then magically she's winning everywhere.
[00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:47.714]  Baloney!
[00:23:47.714 --> 00:23:49.977]  And, you know, those folks need to give capitalism a chance.
[00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:51.859]  They've been getting crony capitalism.
[00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:53.020]  I want to invite the Socialists.
[00:23:53.581 --> 00:23:57.846]  Who are going for Sanders because he says a lot of good things about spying and war and the banks.
[00:23:57.846 --> 00:23:59.008]  Come over to Trump, folks.
[00:23:59.008 --> 00:24:02.352]  It's never been more obvious what's going on.
[00:24:02.352 --> 00:24:03.853]  I'm not mad at folks that don't want to be for Trump.
[00:24:03.853 --> 00:24:04.514]  That's fine.
[00:24:04.514 --> 00:24:07.157]  I normally say presidential stuff's a diversion.
[00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:10.441]  We want to run good candidates to educate people about liberty.
[00:24:10.441 --> 00:24:12.063]  But now we've got a real shot at this.
[00:24:13.476 --> 00:24:20.600]  They tried to steal it from Reagan in 80, but the landslide was so big in the Super Tuesday and in the general election that they couldn't do it.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.902]  But they're going to fight him all the way down to the wire.
[00:24:23.902 --> 00:24:25.803]  CJ, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:25.803 --> 00:24:26.424]  You're welcome.
[00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:27.364]  Thank you.
[00:24:27.364 --> 00:24:33.248]  And if any of the other crew wants to pop in, or any of the reporters want to come in and pop in with their view on this, go ahead.
[00:24:33.248 --> 00:24:36.770]  But I'm sure about Trump now, and I'm really concerned about his safety.
[00:24:39.468 --> 00:24:52.098]  And I happen to know the inside baseball, not from Stone, but from someone else, that literally they did cut off Trump's audio, because he's decried before that, you know, David Duke twice saying, I don't like him, on his own, before he was criticized.
[00:24:52.098 --> 00:24:55.021]  I'm leaving the Reform Party because it's got David Duke Klansman in it.
[00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:56.422]  I don't want your nomination.
[00:24:56.422 --> 00:24:57.923]  And they did it again.
[00:24:57.923 --> 00:25:03.468]  They did that classic thing, turn your audio off, say David Duke and other white supremacist groups and other groups.
[00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:05.389]  He goes, Duke groups?
[00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:06.850]  You know, what groups?
[00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:10.022]  And then I just come out and said, yeah, I decry it.
[00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:15.407]  And then he says, you know, internal folks, he goes, and next they're going to say, what do I think about this person or that person?
[00:25:15.407 --> 00:25:16.989]  Or they'll have bad people endorse me.
[00:25:16.989 --> 00:25:19.551]  And then I'm going to have to keep coming out and saying, I'm sorry.
[00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.692]  No, I'm going to look strong.
[00:25:20.692 --> 00:25:22.174]  I'm done.
[00:25:22.174 --> 00:25:23.335]  You know, I'm done.
[00:25:24.594 --> 00:25:27.496]  That little Freudian slip there, because I think that's dumb.
[00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:32.480]  He can sit there after a while and say, hey, I'm not going to sit there and decry everybody because you tell me to.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.122]  I'm going to be strong.
[00:25:34.122 --> 00:25:35.343]  I don't think that's the smartest move.
[00:25:35.343 --> 00:25:39.066]  I actually agree with Ted Cruz when he says, there's a few things you don't say you're with.
[00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:46.872]  The Nazis, the white supremacists, the Klan, or the new Black Panther movement, or I guess you're allowed to be in Mecha and La Raza.
[00:25:46.872 --> 00:25:48.934]  They're just racial groups as well.
[00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:51.407]  I do have a problem with Freudian slips.
[00:25:51.407 --> 00:25:52.729]  I just say what I'm really thinking.
[00:25:52.729 --> 00:25:54.250]  I just cannot control myself.
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.472]  I'm totally teleprompter free.
[00:25:56.472 --> 00:26:01.277]  But that's more endearing that Trump is so pig-headed.
[00:26:01.277 --> 00:26:02.978]  I already did it.
[00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:03.999]  I decried him years ago.
[00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:06.362]  I'm going to have to do this over and over again with everybody.
[00:26:06.362 --> 00:26:08.263]  They could be pulling this stunt on me.
[00:26:08.263 --> 00:26:08.964]  I'm sick of it.
[00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:09.965]  The voters have figured it out.
[00:26:09.965 --> 00:26:11.747]  I'm done.
[00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:13.588]  I just heard that Trump said that.
[00:26:13.588 --> 00:26:14.710]  But the point is,
[00:26:16.002 --> 00:26:17.644]  That maybe he's right.
[00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:22.770]  Maybe people are sick of everyone apologizing and totally sick of political correctness.
[00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.453]  I'm inviting David Duke back on the show.
[00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:31.120]  I'm not going to have a two-hour so-called debate with him where he complains the whole time that I'm not letting him talk.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.121]  I'm going to have a stopwatch.
[00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:32.681]  He will come on.
[00:26:33.863 --> 00:26:36.905]  And I'll let him talk five minutes, and then I'll talk two minutes.
[00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:37.885]  He's got a deal.
[00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:40.727]  You know, he can have two-thirds more time than me, and then some.
[00:26:40.727 --> 00:26:44.929]  For every five minutes, I will get two minutes with a stopwatch on television.
[00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:52.113]  We will aim a camera at a digital stopwatch, and then we can, you know, debate and discuss this whole situation.
[00:26:52.113 --> 00:26:57.556]  And I'll be honest with you, I'm not going to sit here and demonize David Duke, because that'd be hypocritical.
[00:26:57.556 --> 00:27:02.199]  Mecha and La Raza and Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter's leadership
[00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:08.213]  And that whole group is just as racist or more so than the Ku Klux Klan is today.
[00:27:08.213 --> 00:27:09.553]  And they're just, they're more violent.
[00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:12.574]  They're out attacking white people and veterans and it's supposedly okay.
[00:27:12.574 --> 00:27:16.396]  And shooting, you know, groups affiliated with them are shooting cops in the back of the head.
[00:27:16.396 --> 00:27:23.778]  And it's the same mindless racial tribal garbage that the Klan was doing in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:25.559]  And some since then.
[00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:31.161]  But David Duke has reformed himself 90% just like Louis Farrakhan has changed a lot of what he has to say.
[00:27:31.809 --> 00:27:33.830]  I don't want to fight with Louis Farrakhan or David Duke.
[00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:41.095]  I think Louis Farrakhan is a more open, serious, more intellectual person than David Duke.
[00:27:41.095 --> 00:27:41.876]  I've talked to both of them.
[00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:51.316]  I recoiled from Duke when I was interviewing him because he just seemed calculating and cold and spider-like.
[00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:54.798]  And Farrakhan was like magnetic and I just wanted to hug him.
[00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:58.080]  And it was like, man, this guy is super, super charismatic.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.082]  I was just like, whoa, like superhero level.
[00:28:01.082 --> 00:28:02.303]  I'm not even saying that's a good thing.
[00:28:02.303 --> 00:28:05.625]  I was like getting tears in my eyes when he was, you know, speaking and stuff.
[00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:11.669]  I was just like, whoa, dude, this guy is like, maybe, maybe he's like the, you know, what's the snake's name?
[00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.831]  The Jungle Book, you know, the eyes spinning.
[00:28:15.831 --> 00:28:20.553]  But no, I mean, I think he genuinely cares about people and is angry and didn't like being kicked around when he was young.
[00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:23.115]  And I can really identify with that.
[00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:25.196]  But he says a lot of stuff I disagree with.
[00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:30.918]  But I had a real forum with him and he wanted to bring people together and said he'd grown.
[00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:33.379]  And maybe, maybe, you know what?
[00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:35.160]  I thought of this.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.262]  I'd pay for it in a really nice hotel somewhere in a conference room to videotape it.
[00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:55.361]  Myself, Louis Farrakhan, and David Duke, and I could be the mediator, and give each person equal time, and not even really a debate, but a discussion, to really see what people thought about that.
[00:28:55.361 --> 00:28:57.343]  People say, what do you associate it with, David Duke, or...
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.300]  That's political correctness, folks.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.801]  I don't hold their views.
[00:29:02.801 --> 00:29:05.443]  I don't get into a lot of this race politics stuff.
[00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:10.547]  But I would want to try to actually have a real open debate.
[00:29:10.547 --> 00:29:12.007]  They don't want us discussing.
[00:29:12.007 --> 00:29:14.049]  They don't want us going to barbecues together.
[00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:15.950]  They don't want us going to church together.
[00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.932]  It's like Diamonds and Lace said yesterday.
[00:29:18.932 --> 00:29:21.554]  They don't want us actually speaking.
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:23.135]  That's what political correctness is, by the way.
[00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:25.433]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:26.795]  Huge Super Tuesday coverage.
[00:29:26.795 --> 00:29:34.242]  Before I go any further, we are ending the leap year sale because we sold out of nine items, just for the nutraceuticals alone.
[00:29:35.655 --> 00:29:41.258]  But we are extending it for a Super Tuesday sale for all items still in stock.
[00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:47.961]  Whether it's water filters, high quality nutraceuticals, non-GMO seeds, books, videos, you name it.
[00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:49.381]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:49.381 --> 00:29:50.062]  It's extended.
[00:29:50.062 --> 00:29:51.462]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.462 --> 00:29:53.984]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.984 --> 00:29:56.665]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:16.558]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:29.104]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[00:30:29.264 --> 00:30:30.685]  Who announced the findings?
[00:30:30.685 --> 00:30:37.752]  These predators desecrated a sacred trust and preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe.
[00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:38.913]  Kane said in a statement,
[00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:50.363]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case, because some abusers have died.
[00:30:50.363 --> 00:30:56.569]  The statute of limitations has expired, and in some cases, the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[00:30:56.569 --> 00:31:00.593]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:04.977]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:31:05.237 --> 00:31:10.003]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:31:10.003 --> 00:31:11.324]  Talk about the effects.
[00:31:11.324 --> 00:31:12.846]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:14.768]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:15.890]  I feel like I look better.
[00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.591]  I feel better.
[00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:17.992]  I feel sexier.
[00:31:17.992 --> 00:31:18.633]  I love it.
[00:31:18.633 --> 00:31:21.617]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.780]  Consult your physician.

[00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:30.581]  This is life-changing.
[00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:31.481]  Shower filters.
[00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:33.102]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:31:33.102 --> 00:31:37.282]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.

[00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:52.806]  We're good.
[00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.412]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:32:05.412 --> 00:32:13.157]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:32:13.157 --> 00:32:21.782]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:32:21.782 --> 00:32:25.804]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:32:26.184 --> 00:32:36.010]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.433]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:50.460]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.460]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.

[00:33:12.024 --> 00:33:18.265]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:34.462]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com.
[00:33:34.462 --> 00:33:37.464]  It is February 29th, 2016.
[00:33:37.464 --> 00:33:42.107]  Tomorrow is Super Tuesday and we had a special guest come in today.
[00:33:42.107 --> 00:33:44.088]  We had Miriam Witcher come in.
[00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:56.816]  She is the lady that became famous in Las Vegas when Donald Trump had an event back in the fall and Donald Trump spotted her and brought her up on stage and she's jumping and shouting, I love Donald Trump.
[00:33:57.216 --> 00:33:59.917]  I'm Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump!
[00:33:59.917 --> 00:34:04.699]  We vote for Mr. Trump!
[00:34:04.699 --> 00:34:04.779]  Yes!
[00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:05.960]  Mr. Trump!
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.741]  We love you!
[00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:12.323]  So what do you expect to see here with the folks here at UT?
[00:34:12.323 --> 00:34:20.286]  Well, first of all I want to say Texas, I love you and I'm here to support Donald J. Trump.
[00:34:21.121 --> 00:34:22.902]  Hi ladies, are you going to vote tomorrow?
[00:34:22.902 --> 00:34:24.784]  Sorry, I'm on my way over there.
[00:34:24.784 --> 00:34:27.145]  Hi, are you going to vote tomorrow?
[00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:29.407]  Hey ladies, are you going to vote tomorrow?
[00:34:29.407 --> 00:34:30.988]  Come here.
[00:34:30.988 --> 00:34:32.969]  Don't be scared, we are only fixing the ground.
[00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.491]  Look at these dehumanized trendies, they don't talk to anybody.
[00:34:35.491 --> 00:34:36.152]  They have no social skills.
[00:34:36.152 --> 00:34:37.212]  Are you going to vote tomorrow?
[00:34:37.212 --> 00:34:37.873]  Definitely.
[00:34:37.873 --> 00:34:40.755]  Okay darling, for who you are going to vote tomorrow?
[00:34:40.755 --> 00:34:41.635]  Marco Rubio.
[00:34:41.635 --> 00:34:43.457]  You're in favor of Bernie Sanders here today?
[00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:44.297]  Yes sir.
[00:34:44.297 --> 00:34:45.898]  Are you going to be voting tomorrow?
[00:34:45.898 --> 00:34:46.819]  Yes.
[00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:48.860]  So who do you like?
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.541]  Voting tomorrow?
[00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:50.571]  I don't know.
[00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:54.093]  I would basically vote for anybody besides Trump.
[00:34:54.093 --> 00:34:56.934]  I'd rather go for Bernie Sanders because he's more of a human.
[00:34:56.934 --> 00:34:59.215]  I voted for Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:59.215 --> 00:35:00.076]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:35:00.076 --> 00:35:04.157]  So, a lot of your comrades here on campus voted for Bernie Sanders, evidently, right?
[00:35:04.157 --> 00:35:06.198]  That is the impression I get, yes.
[00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:09.760]  So, I honestly thought this was a joke.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.761]  Like, I didn't know you guys were actually Trump supporters.
[00:35:12.761 --> 00:35:14.682]  This is hilarious to me.
[00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:15.643]  I really gotta get to lunch.
[00:35:16.983 --> 00:35:18.204]  Gotta get to lunch?
[00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:18.904]  Okay.
[00:35:18.904 --> 00:35:20.525]  Alright, lunch is definitely more important.
[00:35:20.525 --> 00:35:22.366]  And Bernie will give you a free lunch.
[00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:23.226]  What'd you say, sir?
[00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:26.228]  I said you are too brown to vote for Trump.
[00:35:26.228 --> 00:35:28.769]  So you think she's way off base supporting Trump?
[00:35:28.769 --> 00:35:29.729]  Yes.
[00:35:29.729 --> 00:35:31.850]  From what I heard, I just don't really like what he has to offer.
[00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:37.433]  And the things that he says I don't think are very educated for who we need in running this country.
[00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:39.434]  Tell us a couple of those things.
[00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:42.155]  Well... Let's see.
[00:35:43.607 --> 00:35:47.910]  You know, they just seem so... I can't really remember, like, specifically what they are.
[00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.093]  I just told you I could cite many examples when he spewed hate.
[00:35:51.093 --> 00:35:56.617]  Can you cite some examples of when he has spewed inclusivity towards people of color?
[00:35:56.617 --> 00:36:00.139]  The only thing Donald J. Trump has is love in his heart.
[00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:01.961]  This is the only... He's a humble man.
[00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:02.841]  I love Trump.
[00:36:02.841 --> 00:36:03.782]  Let me ask you.
[00:36:03.782 --> 00:36:04.783]  Let me ask you.
[00:36:09.348 --> 00:36:12.770]  When did you come to the United States?
[00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:19.113]  I came to the United States more than 35 years ago, but I came here legally.
[00:36:19.113 --> 00:36:24.456]  So why don't we vet the radical Christians who are coming to his rallies with KKK gear on?
[00:36:25.527 --> 00:36:27.788]  Well, I haven't personally seen that, but... You haven't?
[00:36:27.788 --> 00:36:29.069]  Oh, you're interviewing for him?
[00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:30.949]  Well, maybe you should do some research.
[00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:33.351]  Well, I've been to quite a few rallies.
[00:36:33.351 --> 00:36:36.332]  Who doesn't know anything about what's going on?
[00:36:36.332 --> 00:36:37.953]  Just, ah, go Trump!
[00:36:37.953 --> 00:36:39.453]  You sound like a voice recorder.
[00:36:39.453 --> 00:36:41.834]  If someone's born in America, it doesn't make a difference.
[00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:44.515]  They could still be a rapist or a murderer or something.
[00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:47.717]  If they were born in America, come from an all-white family, it doesn't make a difference.
[00:36:47.717 --> 00:36:49.938]  Stop more people from coming over to add to that pool?
[00:36:50.678 --> 00:36:51.139]  But we need...
[00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:12.379]  We're good to go.
[00:37:27.958 --> 00:37:28.298]  All right.
[00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:55.947]  That report is up on Infowars.com.
[00:37:55.947 --> 00:38:00.610]  Liberal trendies freak out on Hispanic Trump supporter.
[00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.091]  And it gets worse.
[00:38:02.091 --> 00:38:04.212]  And really, they're anti-white.
[00:38:04.212 --> 00:38:06.674]  And that's what MSNBC, the Democratic Party, has done.
[00:38:06.674 --> 00:38:12.577]  They've created an anti-white sentiment, just as the Democratic Party ran the Klan, created it.
[00:38:12.577 --> 00:38:13.298]  That didn't work.
[00:38:13.298 --> 00:38:17.481]  The Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act in the late 50s, Eisenhower.
[00:38:17.481 --> 00:38:20.963]  And my grandfather was involved in that, elected to state office.
[00:38:22.802 --> 00:38:24.243]  He switched from Democrat to Republican.
[00:38:24.243 --> 00:38:25.384]  Some of his family got mad at him.
[00:38:25.384 --> 00:38:26.945]  They were, you know, Southern Democrats.
[00:38:26.945 --> 00:38:28.726]  He said, listen, we're going to have civil rights.
[00:38:28.726 --> 00:38:32.328]  So the Democrats knew they couldn't beat it anymore, so they switched over.
[00:38:32.328 --> 00:38:34.630]  And the Republicans said, OK, we'll do the Southern strategy.
[00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.632]  But it is just the ignorance of these people is incredible.
[00:38:37.632 --> 00:38:38.633]  But here's the breaking news.
[00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:39.974]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:40.994 --> 00:38:48.177]  Right now, it's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson's story, and we can click on that.
[00:38:48.177 --> 00:38:55.280]  We've now updated it with information that Roger Stone has given us about huge evidence of fraud going on in Ohio, pouring in.
[00:38:56.496 --> 00:39:03.022]  He is an election fraud expert, you know, helped run Bush's recount there in Florida, so he knows what he's looking for.
[00:39:03.022 --> 00:39:12.211]  And so we're going to be talking to Roger Stone, the consummate confidant and Trump insider, here in just a moment about Super Tuesday from StoneZone.com.
[00:39:12.211 --> 00:39:20.599]  Before I go any further, though, I promised you that I was not going to extend the leap year sale past basically the start of the show today, and we didn't.
[00:39:22.094 --> 00:39:34.839]  And I was saying, you know, sometimes we extend stuff, and I said I wouldn't, but I said we can't because 10 items, it's about to be 11 or 12, of just the nutraceuticals have sold out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.860]  And a lot of other items are selling out.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.162]  In fact, I've never had a sale this successful, and I know why.
[00:39:40.162 --> 00:39:42.663]  We've never had 30% off on top of the discounts.
[00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.212]  And free shipping!
[00:39:45.212 --> 00:39:47.593]  And these are really good Hillary for President t-shirts.
[00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:50.014]  These are really powerful books and videos.
[00:39:50.014 --> 00:39:52.295]  These are really powerful water filtration systems.
[00:39:52.295 --> 00:39:53.475]  The very best out there.
[00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:54.856]  At the highest quality.
[00:39:54.856 --> 00:39:57.417]  Lower for the same units than you get at Amazon.
[00:39:57.417 --> 00:39:58.737]  It's insane.
[00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:00.038]  And it helps fund the operation.
[00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:04.447]  So a lot of stuff is selling out, but a lot of great stuff is still there.
[00:40:04.447 --> 00:40:07.049]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:40:07.049 --> 00:40:20.858]  I'm calling it the Super Tuesday Sale, and it will have to end by tomorrow, because I can't sell out of everything at this discount, because then we'll lose money.
[00:40:20.858 --> 00:40:23.840]  You can't do a sale that's so good you sell out everything when some of it's lost liters.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.041]  You've got to keep some goods back.
[00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:34.490]  So we're going to have some other big specials later in the week on individual items that we do have a lot of, but extended 30% off of in-stock products at m4store.com.
[00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.732]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:40:37.732 --> 00:40:42.714]  Some products have sold out, but we are extending the sale to most of our in-stock products.
[00:40:43.854 --> 00:40:47.178]  Get AutoShip, though, for guaranteed delivery on stuff that's even out of stock.
[00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:51.582]  We keep a surplus back of that, and you get 10% off on top of the 30% in free shipping.
[00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.224]  That is just insane.
[00:40:53.224 --> 00:40:58.269]  What we've already sold out of is Super Mel Vitality, Secret 12, DNA Force, Living Defense, and a bunch of other items.
[00:40:58.269 --> 00:40:59.791]  LiverShield is back in stock.
[00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:00.852]  You can get that.
[00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:02.113]  OxyPowder back in stock.
[00:41:02.974 --> 00:41:04.355]  Super Female did sell out.
[00:41:04.355 --> 00:41:06.957]  Anthroplex, the truck just arrived yesterday.
[00:41:06.957 --> 00:41:08.479]  That's basically like Super Mel Vitality.
[00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:10.560]  It's excellent, but even more affordable.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.322]  It is discounted right now, 30% off.
[00:41:13.322 --> 00:41:17.626]  So there's also some silver linings there of some items that have come back into stock.
[00:41:17.626 --> 00:41:21.249]  InfoWars Select, high quality, sortable foods, 30% off.
[00:41:21.249 --> 00:41:22.990]  I mean, it's just the best deals ever.
[00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.431]  And thank you all for your support.
[00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:26.272]  Go read the five-star reviews and more.
[00:41:26.272 --> 00:41:27.133]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:41:28.413 --> 00:41:35.219]  Or InfoWarsLive.com takes you directly to the New Jersey articles or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:41:35.219 --> 00:41:38.762]  There's also amazing, we're going to Roger Stone right now.
[00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:41.884]  Take that call, that's from Trump, if you need to sir, go ahead.
[00:41:41.884 --> 00:41:45.967]  I can see him there on the TV and his wife handing him the phone.
[00:41:45.967 --> 00:41:47.889]  Just so much going on, so much happening.
[00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:50.811]  Now, let's go back to that Drudge Report article.
[00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:52.593]  Top story, Drudge Report, middle column.
[00:41:55.319 --> 00:42:03.331]  Callers flood news radio stations, we now learn TV stations, you name it, saying that they try to vote for Trump and flips to Rubio.
[00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:08.919]  And it's coming in now from other counties across Texas and other areas like Ohio.
[00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:13.061]  And he has literally just been working 20 hours a day.
[00:42:13.061 --> 00:42:15.061]  And I called him this morning.
[00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:19.162]  He said, absolutely, the reports are pouring in here from our political operatives on the ground.
[00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:23.203]  I don't know how much I can repeat that he told me, because some of it's major inside baseball.
[00:42:23.203 --> 00:42:27.145]  Roger Stone, StoneZone.com, bestselling author, Trump insider.
[00:42:27.145 --> 00:42:28.425]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[00:42:29.085 --> 00:42:37.469]  Alex, just to be very clear, what I'm getting from Ohio are complaints about their absentee ballot process and their early voting process.
[00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:40.891]  Their contest is not today, it's on March 15th.
[00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:55.338]  I have authorized a team that is on its way to Ohio, two attorneys, a mathematician, and a lawyer, pardon me, two attorneys, a mathematician, and someone who is a political activist with experience in this area to try to see what is going on.
[00:42:55.598 --> 00:42:59.562]  And Paul Watson's writing an article, so we need to make sure it's clear, because the media will go with this.
[00:42:59.562 --> 00:43:03.647]  We know Ohio isn't now, but it's key for Casey to keep him in.
[00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:09.753]  This is with the absentee and early voting, and Stone is sending a team, is launching an investigation.
[00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:10.494]  Please continue.
[00:43:10.494 --> 00:43:12.055]  Which is dominant in Ohio.
[00:43:12.055 --> 00:43:16.660]  I must tell you, Alex, the one thing the Ohio Republican Party really knows how to do
[00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:17.861]  I don't know.
[00:43:37.568 --> 00:43:42.150]  And John Kasich is using the state Republican Party like a super PAC.
[00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.972]  They are doing the mailing and the chasing, looking into the legality of that.
[00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:51.793]  But what's more disturbing to me is the complaints I'm getting today.
[00:43:51.793 --> 00:44:00.797]  We've just gotten some complaints from the Boston area, people attempting to vote today, telling us that the lever will not go down over Donald J. Trump's name.
[00:44:01.497 --> 00:44:04.100]  So, we are on top of this.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:11.430]  We're going to be establishing an 800 number shortly so that anyone who experiences a difficulty can contact us.
[00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.955]  I have contacted and we are bringing on as a consultant
[00:44:16.536 --> 00:44:27.006]  Richard Charnin, who is a mathematician and probably the world's foremost expert on computerized voter fraud.
[00:44:27.006 --> 00:44:35.974]  We saw the massive cheating in Ohio that most likely delivered the state to George Bush over John Kerry.
[00:44:35.974 --> 00:44:38.297]  There's a lot of evidence the machines were tampered with then.
[00:44:39.412 --> 00:44:51.920]  Four years later, under Mitt Romney, you may recall, Alex, that Karl Rove was incensed on Fox when he was told that Romney would lose Ohio.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.621]  He was incensed.
[00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:54.162]  He said it had to be wrong.
[00:44:54.162 --> 00:44:57.884]  That's because Karl thought that he had taken care of that problem.
[00:44:57.884 --> 00:45:02.267]  Evidently, Barack Obama came in with a higher bid to the local poobahs.
[00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:13.933]  Well, the machinery, but those Diebold machinery, those Diebold voting machines, you know, the Diebold, all their executives, the family, they're all major donors to the Bush machine.
[00:45:13.933 --> 00:45:16.514]  So there's plenty of reason for cause here.
[00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:20.576]  We are not going to let this nomination be stolen from Donald Trump.
[00:45:20.576 --> 00:45:22.217]  We don't have the politicians.
[00:45:22.217 --> 00:45:23.318]  We have more volunteers.
[00:45:23.318 --> 00:45:24.558]  We have more first timers.
[00:45:24.558 --> 00:45:26.019]  We have more enthusiasm.
[00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:28.380]  He's setting records in these crowds.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.942]  But I am trying to pull together a lot of my old colleagues.
[00:45:31.622 --> 00:45:44.434]  From the Goldwater campaign, as far back as Goldwater, from the Reagan campaigns, from conservative campaigns, from Ron Paul's campaign, various campaigns, we are going to get together and see if we can dig into these charges.
[00:45:44.434 --> 00:45:51.060]  Roger Stone, they have had top political science professors and others come out that have never really called an election improperly.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.862]  We can put it up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:45:52.862 --> 00:45:55.044]  I'll read the headline for listeners on radio.
[00:45:56.593 --> 00:46:02.275]  That Trump has a 97 to 99 percent chance of winning the presidency.
[00:46:02.275 --> 00:46:06.556]  And again, this is top political scientists that are hired by the major parties.
[00:46:06.556 --> 00:46:10.378]  This is what the odds makers are saying in London and in Vegas now.
[00:46:10.378 --> 00:46:12.819]  So if he doesn't win, they're stealing it.
[00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:19.621]  I mean, in polls, he surged from 40 percent in most Super Tuesday states to 45 percent.
[00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:20.901]  NASCAR has endorsed him.
[00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:22.382]  The top drivers have endorsed him.
[00:46:22.802 --> 00:46:24.244]  Senator Sessions has endorsed him.
[00:46:24.244 --> 00:46:26.007]  Chris Christie's endorsed him.
[00:46:26.007 --> 00:46:28.551]  Obviously he is the nominee, as Drudge said a week ago.
[00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.831]  Are they willing to steal this in front of everybody when it's not close?
[00:46:33.831 --> 00:46:40.213]  Because all the fraud experts I've talked to over my 20 years on air say they have trouble stealing landslides and tsunamis.
[00:46:40.213 --> 00:46:41.394]  Is this a tsunami?
[00:46:41.394 --> 00:46:43.294]  And do they have the will to try to steal it?
[00:46:43.294 --> 00:46:45.055]  But remember, we have two different things here.
[00:46:45.055 --> 00:46:51.717]  You're addressing the question of the popular vote in the primaries, which is going to be overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump.
[00:46:51.717 --> 00:46:54.918]  But this system operates on the basis of delegates.
[00:46:55.498 --> 00:47:07.601]  And if Donald Trump gets to Cleveland with short of the magic number to be nominated, then I think there's a high probability that when you go to a second ballot, you're up for a real battle.
[00:47:07.601 --> 00:47:09.302]  Here's why.
[00:47:09.302 --> 00:47:15.143]  On the first ballot, a number of these delegates are bound by state law by the results of the primary.
[00:47:15.143 --> 00:47:21.745]  So the Republican bosses fill the delegation with people who are actually anti-Trump, or more precisely, controlled.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:29.046]  And they've been bragging that they're controlled, and a lot of them have government or corporate jobs, that their whole job is based on being that delegate.
[00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:29.627]  They're hacks.
[00:47:29.627 --> 00:47:30.908]  They're organization people.
[00:47:30.908 --> 00:47:31.669]  They're insiders.
[00:47:31.669 --> 00:47:32.490]  They do what they're told.
[00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.752]  Particularly in New York, we're followed the boss.
[00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:37.875]  This is the home of boss Thomas Platt.
[00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:39.597]  This is the home of boss Tweed.
[00:47:39.597 --> 00:47:42.479]  Politics in New York, in both parties, everyone follows the boss.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.003]  The boss can switch to another candidate on the second ballot because they're his people.
[00:47:48.003 --> 00:47:56.967]  In other words, after the first ballot, everyone is unbound by state law and no longer required to vote on the basis of the percentages of the primaries.
[00:47:56.967 --> 00:48:00.429]  So there is real room for mischief.
[00:48:00.429 --> 00:48:03.791]  There's also room for mischief in the convention rules.
[00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:15.518]  Where you could, for example, put a requirement that the nominee have a majority of the delegates in 15 states.
[00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:23.183]  Otherwise, all names, even those including people who had never won any delegates in any primary, could be put into play.
[00:48:24.263 --> 00:48:32.308]  So, they're going to monkey with this to try to come up with various anti-Trump angles and to try to hang us up.
[00:48:32.308 --> 00:48:36.731]  This, by the way, is something the Bushies really excel at.
[00:48:36.731 --> 00:48:38.693]  In politics, there's one of Stone's rules.
[00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:41.755]  He who knows the rules, rules.
[00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:44.216]  And we've got a hell of a fight on our hands.
[00:48:44.216 --> 00:48:53.202]  This is why we have set up StopTheSteal.org, this project, to start looking into voter fraud and also begin preparing for the convention.
[00:48:53.562 --> 00:48:58.097]  And just with the money you've raised so far, you're already deploying a team to Ohio, trying to head them off at the pass.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.501]  I want to come back and talk about the Koch brothers.
[00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:06.766]  They came out in the New York Times, in BuzzFeed, Politico, you name it, saying, Roger Stone, Alex Jones are wrong.
[00:49:06.766 --> 00:49:09.068]  Grudge is wrong.
[00:49:09.068 --> 00:49:12.350]  We aren't funding anybody in the campaign.
[00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.371]  We're not involved in the primary.
[00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:15.913]  They're on record giving millions in the primary.
[00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:21.278]  But then their top political strategist goes over to just, quote, run the Rubio campaign.
[00:49:21.278 --> 00:49:23.319]  That's in the news the same day.
[00:49:23.319 --> 00:49:25.041]  How obvious is it that they're lying?
[00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.313]  Yeah, I know that was agreed to at the meeting last week in New York.
[00:49:29.313 --> 00:49:32.515]  Now, there is some conflation here, to be very clear.
[00:49:32.515 --> 00:49:40.842]  A meeting was held in New York in which the Koch brothers, so I always imagine looking like Ralph Bellamy and Don Amici, I don't know why.
[00:49:41.742 --> 00:49:54.387]  But the Koch brothers give Marco Rubio $25 million with the admonition, you can have our political guy, but you have to show legs before March 15th.
[00:49:57.143 --> 00:50:14.191]  If he loses on March 15th, Kasich wins Ohio on March 15th, which he is still favored to do, although I think Rubio is in trouble, big trouble in Florida, then he gets the hook and Mitt Romney is all suited up and in the wings.
[00:50:14.191 --> 00:50:23.816]  Alex, I ask you, why suddenly is Mitt Romney, after months and months and months of no political commentary, he's now starting to launch these zingers at Donald Trump?
[00:50:24.096 --> 00:50:24.776]  Well, sure.
[00:50:24.776 --> 00:50:26.538]  You live in New York and also in Florida.
[00:50:26.538 --> 00:50:28.259]  You're the consulate insider.
[00:50:28.259 --> 00:50:28.779]  I was there.
[00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:30.800]  You were on the phone with these people that were at the meeting.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.741]  I was there with you Friday.
[00:50:31.741 --> 00:50:32.862]  It happened Thursday.
[00:50:32.862 --> 00:50:34.063]  You got the intel.
[00:50:34.063 --> 00:50:37.325]  This is what was openly discussed.
[00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:40.887]  I've spent 40 years in the corroded rectum of the Republican Party.
[00:50:42.288 --> 00:50:44.730]  I've been there for the recounts and the battles.
[00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.712]  I will have been to every Republican National Convention since 1964.
[00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:49.013]  I will have worked there.
[00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:49.574]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:50.715]  See you were there with Barry Goldwater.
[00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:51.195]  Stay there.
[00:50:51.195 --> 00:51:00.983]  We're going to go back into the Stone Zone straight ahead as it appears they're trying to shield enough delegates, because remember, these aren't winner-take-all, to try to cheat Trump and have a broker convention.
[00:51:01.203 --> 00:51:02.744]  Tired of the cold this winter?
[00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:05.747]  Are you prepared for the next blizzard or snowstorm?
[00:51:05.747 --> 00:51:08.269]  What will you do when the power and heat go off?
[00:51:08.269 --> 00:51:09.890]  That could be our future.

[00:52:01.058 --> 00:52:11.967]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[00:52:18.292 --> 00:52:23.756]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:52:23.916 --> 00:52:33.941]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:40.424]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:43.786]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[00:52:43.786 --> 00:52:45.826]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:52:45.826 --> 00:52:48.948]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:52:48.968 --> 00:52:51.449]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:53:00.395 --> 00:53:03.837]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:04.637 --> 00:53:05.258]  It's true.
[00:53:05.258 --> 00:53:09.402]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:09.402 --> 00:53:11.804]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:11.804 --> 00:53:16.588]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:53:16.588 --> 00:53:25.096]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[00:53:25.276 --> 00:53:29.461]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:33.246]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:35.909]  The gold standard in water purification.

[00:53:40.234 --> 00:53:44.499]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[00:54:09.287 --> 00:54:12.508]  Central, we're here live, day to night, quarterbacks, the fourth hour today.
[00:54:13.901 --> 00:54:21.607]  And we've got our great intrepid crew Leanne McAdoo and of course Rob Dew and the rest of the amazing reporters.
[00:54:21.607 --> 00:54:22.728]  I'm going to be here tonight as well.
[00:54:22.728 --> 00:54:24.089]  This is just too important.
[00:54:24.089 --> 00:54:32.715]  I'm going to go home and spend some time with the children after school and do some activities and then I'm going to come back up here tonight and cover it right through Super Tuesday.
[00:54:32.715 --> 00:54:34.397]  This is just too important.
[00:54:35.277 --> 00:54:42.020]  But I'll be here for relief for the folks up here and then to give them a break during the coverage.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.320]  But that'll be coming up tonight.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:52.783]  Infowars.com forward slash show for all the free feed stations, TV stations and radio stations all over are requesting every week new ones.
[00:54:52.783 --> 00:54:53.644]  Hey, can we carry your show?
[00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:54.424]  Is there a contract?
[00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.205]  And I go, it's free to air.
[00:54:56.205 --> 00:54:59.646]  Run any ads you want over the ad spaces, preempt us, do whatever you want.
[00:55:01.049 --> 00:55:03.330]  That's why I do the TV nightly news.
[00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:04.391]  The radio's great.
[00:55:04.391 --> 00:55:05.891]  We get half the ads, you get half the ads.
[00:55:05.891 --> 00:55:06.972]  That's the network deal.
[00:55:06.972 --> 00:55:09.573]  With my TV show, free to air.
[00:55:09.573 --> 00:55:10.793]  Free to air.
[00:55:10.793 --> 00:55:12.234]  A public service.
[00:55:12.234 --> 00:55:13.595]  And it's always an hour, weeknights.
[00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:24.539]  Seven to eight, but during special events, elections, terror attacks, earthquakes, whatever, we go live for hour after hour after hour with our amazing crew.
[00:55:24.539 --> 00:55:27.302]  And that's where your support of this broadcast comes in.
[00:55:27.302 --> 00:55:34.649]  When you buy the great nutraceuticals, the non-GMO seeds, the Patriot t-shirts, the books, the films, Roger Stone's books, the profit we make from that.
[00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:49.921]  Which is good, because we sell stuff for such low prices, at such high quality, we sell more of it, that's free market, and we're able to fund this operation so morally, without a bunch of weird sponsors, without a bunch of weird corporations, and big, you know, establishment money.
[00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:53.804]  This is you funding media that protects and defends the Republic.
[00:55:53.804 --> 00:55:57.507]  So we've got the extended leap year sale is limited, the sale's gone.
[00:55:58.715 --> 00:56:05.402]  But what's left, the products that haven't sold out, and there's a lot of them, only sold out of a fraction of the products, we're calling it the Super Tuesday sale.
[00:56:05.402 --> 00:56:07.785]  But it's got to end tomorrow because I can't sell out of everything.
[00:56:07.785 --> 00:56:09.346]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.688]  Roger Stone getting back to this.
[00:56:10.688 --> 00:56:13.390]  People got to put their time, their energy, and their money behind this.
[00:56:14.091 --> 00:56:18.374]  If people want to see election fraud exposed, they've got to go to StopTheSteal.org.
[00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.775]  They've got to support it.
[00:56:19.775 --> 00:56:22.137]  They've got to call you and offer to be volunteers.
[00:56:22.137 --> 00:56:24.159]  They've got to report what they see happening.
[00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:25.420]  This is a fight.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.361]  This is the animating contest of liberty.
[00:56:27.361 --> 00:56:37.129]  Other points you'd like to make about what's currently happening today, what you expect to see happen, because obviously there's a tsunami here, but you're saying they're going to try to steal it at the convention.
[00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:42.092]  Well, look, I think that it's situational at this point.
[00:56:42.092 --> 00:56:48.574]  I mean, I do think we have to live a little, in a sense, because you're asking me what kind of hand Trump will have until the cards have been dealt.
[00:56:48.574 --> 00:56:49.795]  Let's look Wednesday morning.
[00:56:49.795 --> 00:56:51.716]  I'm very, very confident.
[00:56:51.716 --> 00:56:54.397]  He has been drawing some of the largest crowds of the campaign.
[00:56:55.417 --> 00:57:05.704]  But he is taking it, I don't have to tell you, from the Pope, from the Mexican President, from all these institutions.
[00:57:05.704 --> 00:57:20.414]  He's got Marco Rubio in a puerile, childish rant about the fact that he can't seem to, no matter what he does, he will never have the gravitas, or the stature, or the record, or the capability to be President.
[00:57:20.414 --> 00:57:22.695]  He looks like a boy standing next to a man.
[00:57:22.695 --> 00:57:23.416]  Well, you know what's funny?
[00:57:23.996 --> 00:57:28.097]  His voice went out and it sounded like a squeaky Mickey Mouse and he has the ears.
[00:57:28.097 --> 00:57:34.359]  And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just he shouldn't be making comments about physical appearance when he looks like a space alien.
[00:57:34.359 --> 00:57:37.860]  Yeah, no, look, it's become a real, it's degenerated into a slugfest.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:44.742]  The thing people need to remember, Alex, is Marco is just an attractive new vessel for the same old crap.
[00:57:44.742 --> 00:57:47.363]  This is the Bush New World Order agenda.
[00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:50.064]  It's just... Same crap, different bag.
[00:57:50.484 --> 00:57:51.385]  Right.
[00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:54.707]  It's neoconism on steroids.
[00:57:54.707 --> 00:57:57.229]  This guy wants to march off to war every place.
[00:57:57.229 --> 00:58:00.131]  He will open our borders no matter what he says today.
[00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:07.596]  He's been caught once trying to get our borders opened as one of the notorious Gang of Eight, which is mutiny.
[00:58:07.596 --> 00:58:08.296]  That's treason.
[00:58:08.296 --> 00:58:10.658]  And then he lies about it when he's on record doing it.
[00:58:11.658 --> 00:58:21.504]  Which doesn't make him different than Ted Cruz, who also lies about it when he's on record, because no matter what he will say, he's got that Nixonian ability to lie with a straight face.
[00:58:21.504 --> 00:58:22.264]  Well, that's it.
[00:58:22.264 --> 00:58:22.624]  That's it.
[00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:23.905]  He also voted for it.
[00:58:23.905 --> 00:58:25.106]  That's it, because that's so key.
[00:58:26.215 --> 00:58:27.736]  Cruz was bad before he got elected.
[00:58:27.736 --> 00:58:31.359]  He's been good since he was, but he was one of the engineers of amnesty for the Bushes.
[00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:32.420]  He's such an insider.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.361]  It's really creepy.
[00:58:33.361 --> 00:58:34.342]  Do five more minutes with us.
[00:58:34.342 --> 00:58:35.323]  I think I gotta go, Mr. Stone.
[00:58:35.323 --> 00:58:36.864]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:36.864 --> 00:58:37.624]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.624 --> 00:58:39.946]  Tell your friends and family and tune in right now.
[00:58:39.946 --> 00:58:41.267]  History's being made.
[00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:50.335]  The new media, the resurgence of liberty versus the Pope, the communist Chinese, Obama, the neocons, and every other turd in the basket.
[00:58:50.635 --> 00:58:54.136]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:54.136 --> 00:59:02.399]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:02.399 --> 00:59:07.820]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.341]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:10.341 --> 00:59:12.442]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:23.183 --> 00:59:27.245]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[00:59:27.245 --> 00:59:32.068]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:39.152]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[00:59:53.163 --> 01:00:03.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:10.034]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:10.034 --> 01:00:13.016]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.619 --> 01:00:21.424]  I'm going to take on China and I'm going to take on Mexico and they're going to bring back those jobs.
[01:00:21.424 --> 01:00:28.371]  But he doesn't tell you that all that clothes that says Donald J. Trump on it, it's not just tacky, it's made in China and in Mexico.
[01:00:37.248 --> 01:00:41.952]  If Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back to America from China and Mexico, he can start today.
[01:00:41.952 --> 01:00:47.997]  Why don't you announce that from now on, no products will be sold that say Donald J. Trump on them, unless they're made in America.
[01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:57.558]  Alright folks, so there he is going into Mickey Mouse.
[01:00:57.558 --> 01:00:59.099]  By the way, total transparency here.
[01:00:59.099 --> 01:01:03.883]  We're going to be thinking about mounting cameras with live feeds all the time behind the scenes because we have nothing to hide here.
[01:01:03.883 --> 01:01:04.923]  Nobody else has ever done this.
[01:01:04.923 --> 01:01:07.105]  Real reality, radio, TV.
[01:01:07.105 --> 01:01:13.629]  Mark Caesar, the news director, is ready at 590 to give us access to all the tapes and to interview his hosts that were on air and got all the calls.
[01:01:13.629 --> 01:01:15.671]  And to tell you about their newsroom getting flooded.
[01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:21.475]  So if you could talk to the two hosts that were there in the morning hosting the show with the dozens of calls.
[01:01:21.475 --> 01:01:22.996]  Then we can play a few clips.
[01:01:22.996 --> 01:01:23.936]  And then you can talk to
[01:01:25.157 --> 01:01:27.258]  People in their newsroom that got flooded as well.
[01:01:27.258 --> 01:01:31.360]  So if you like, talk to them two minutes, then show the newsroom two minutes, and just tell folks what happened.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.481]  Put a quick package together as fast as you can.
[01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:37.502]  I know we're stressed here and we got most of our teams already in the field due.
[01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:40.901]  Okay, send Biggs and Josh.
[01:01:40.901 --> 01:01:49.563]  They don't even need to be on the shot, just if they want to get the news station on record that they've seen the fraud happening or the reports pouring in to add to the drudge story.
[01:01:49.563 --> 01:01:50.623]  Great job, thank you.
[01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:53.484]  And you also have, we got the MP3s from them.
[01:01:53.484 --> 01:01:54.284]  Okay, great, we'll do it.
[01:01:54.284 --> 01:01:55.224]  Great job, thank you.
[01:01:55.224 --> 01:01:56.424]  Sorry to cut into your time, Roger.
[01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:57.125]  I know you're busy.
[01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.685]  I'm just having to war game this in live time.
[01:01:59.685 --> 01:02:05.186]  We're seeing evidence of massive fraud in Austin going for Rubio, and that's the establishment candidate.
[01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:06.707]  Who would be pulling the strings?
[01:02:06.707 --> 01:02:08.127]  This is one of the Democrats here in Austin.
[01:02:09.132 --> 01:02:16.695]  This is, but everybody knows that the Harris County Bushies are in touch and close allies to the Harris County Democrats.
[01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:18.395]  Does this really surprise you?
[01:02:18.395 --> 01:02:20.616]  We're talking about the belly of the chest.
[01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:22.597]  The Travis County Party, I misspoke.
[01:02:22.597 --> 01:02:24.738]  Hey, how could you know all the thousands of counties in the country?
[01:02:24.738 --> 01:02:26.558]  You're right, absolutely.
[01:02:26.558 --> 01:02:29.419]  This is the most liberal county in Texas, I believe.
[01:02:29.419 --> 01:02:30.400]  Yes.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.760]  And therefore, it's not surprising that they're in bed together.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.442]  Never lose sight of the fact that the Bushes and the Clintons are joined at the hip.
[01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:41.684]  Earlier in the race, remember, Hillary Clinton kept attacking Jeb while Jeb was foundering.
[01:02:41.684 --> 01:02:44.686]  That was an attempt to elevate Jeb among the Republicans.
[01:02:44.686 --> 01:02:55.592]  So, as I outline in my book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, and in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, these two families apologize for each other, rehabilitate each other, and they profiteer.
[01:02:55.592 --> 01:02:56.913]  They steal together.
[01:02:58.467 --> 01:03:13.192]  Alex, one other point I would make that I think is absolutely key, and that is that we have all these late primaries where you've got some big winner-take-all states.
[01:03:13.692 --> 01:03:16.314]  You can see why Romney is maneuvering for that.
[01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:30.225]  So, even though I think Trump is going to do great today, and even though I've never seen a political uprising like this, an insurgency if you will, but the fear in the eyes of the establishment is like nothing I've ever seen.
[01:03:30.225 --> 01:03:33.207]  Because some people are going to get prosecuted and go to jail.
[01:03:33.207 --> 01:03:36.970]  So will they double down and pull out all the stops and get caught even worse?
[01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.153]  Or will they snatch victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:03:40.153 --> 01:03:41.394]  Will they steal it all yet again?
[01:03:42.054 --> 01:03:45.616]  Well, that's why we see these ridiculous attacks on Trump University.
[01:03:45.616 --> 01:03:52.940]  Look, 98% of the people who went to Trump University, which was a real estate course, were satisfied and they went on to make money.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.521]  Presumably.
[01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:55.562]  It's one of the top real estate guys in history.
[01:03:55.562 --> 01:03:58.584]  I mean, if you don't get something out of a course, that's your problem, Dumbo.
[01:03:59.564 --> 01:04:00.785]  Exactly.
[01:04:00.785 --> 01:04:11.873]  And this went to court, even though there are multiple suits, the Attorney General's fought consolidations into all one suit, so it's already going to trial in New York.
[01:04:11.873 --> 01:04:27.163]  The New York Democrat Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, tried to hold Donald and his daughter, Ivanka, who's an amazing person, up for campaign contributions, and when they refused to come up and spit out big dollars, he brought an action.
[01:04:27.423 --> 01:04:31.064]  Well, if he wasn't my daughter, I'd date her too.
[01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:33.405]  He got ignominiously defeated in court.
[01:04:33.405 --> 01:04:35.866]  He lost on every count.
[01:04:35.866 --> 01:04:37.086]  Roger, I know you've got to go.
[01:04:37.086 --> 01:04:41.088]  You're busier than a one-legged man and you know what, but your call.
[01:04:41.088 --> 01:04:42.888]  I know there's a lot of... I've been steering the show here.
[01:04:42.888 --> 01:04:44.709]  Is there any other key points you want to impart to people?
[01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:57.184]  You know, we're going to start, we're going to begin sending people out to these various states that are voting today for the poll closings to check where there is a paper trail.
[01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.187]  Roger Stone, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.189]  Thank you for your tireless work.
[01:05:02.287 --> 01:05:09.631]  The British government is pushing the Investigory Powers Bill, or Snoopers Charter, that will effectively end internet privacy.
[01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:24.380]  The proposed legislation targets popular chat and message services such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and FaceTime, outlaws end-to-end encryption, and will force Apple to rewrite its iOS from the ground up to accommodate surveillance by the state.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.623]  It would also force tech companies to provide back doors accessible to government.
[01:05:28.923 --> 01:05:34.947]  Additionally, the law requires ISPs to keep records of all Internet activity of its customers.
[01:05:34.947 --> 01:05:38.390]  The data would be available to the government for a year.
[01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:51.218]  In 2015, the British Home Secretary, Theresa May, admitted that a 1983 Telecom Act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5, and the agency has done so since September 2001.

[01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:05.257]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:05.257 --> 01:08:08.019]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:13.512]  We're now into the second hour of our four hours here from 11 a.m.
[01:08:13.512 --> 01:08:14.093]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:20.557]  Central of coverage of Super Tuesday and other geopolitical events and economic events that are taking place.
[01:08:20.557 --> 01:08:32.966]  We have investigative journalist Wayne Madsen who works for Infowars.com who put out the investigations that have now gone national in the Inquirer and other places about connections to Marco Rubio and the gay mafia in Florida.
[01:08:32.966 --> 01:08:35.547]  We're going to be talking to him at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:36.528 --> 01:09:00.676]  But right now, just for the next 15 minutes, Phyllis Schlafly, who is literally one of the longest-serving, hardest-fighting, paleoconservative-slash-constitutionalist out there, constitutional lawyer, truly someone that's helped lead and empower women and men as well, the founder of Eagle Forum, and she wrote the best-selling book, A Choice on an Echo, that's back in print now.
[01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:05.639]  And she's worked in major administrations, Ronald Reagan, you name it.
[01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:14.344]  I am not going to go over her whole bio, but it's basically like interviewing Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan here on the show in her tireless fight.
[01:09:14.344 --> 01:09:16.146]  Talk about breaking through glass ceilings.
[01:09:16.146 --> 01:09:17.767]  She was doing that before they called it that.
[01:09:19.107 --> 01:09:21.968]  And she, of course, testified before Congress.
[01:09:21.968 --> 01:09:30.469]  You name it, she's been named one of the most honored, important women of the 20th century by the Ladies Home Journal, eagleforum.org, Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:09:30.469 --> 01:09:31.809]  Phyllis, thank you for coming on.
[01:09:31.809 --> 01:09:34.930]  What a circus was Super Tuesday.
[01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:46.092]  The Pope and the Chinese government, communists, and the former Mexican president, and the Democrats, and the Republicans, and the Koch brothers, and the whole Republican establishment coming out against Trump.
[01:09:47.212 --> 01:09:48.954]  I mean, why are they so scared of him?
[01:09:48.954 --> 01:09:51.155]  I know you've tacitly endorsed him.
[01:09:51.155 --> 01:09:56.019]  NASCAR's come out, Chris Christie, Senator Sessions, so many others.
[01:09:56.019 --> 01:09:58.561]  It seems like the camps are forming.
[01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.863]  Phyllis Schlafly, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.424]  Well, thanks so much, Alex.
[01:10:02.424 --> 01:10:04.105]  Always good to join you.
[01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:05.126]  You're the expert on this.
[01:10:05.126 --> 01:10:08.909]  What is front and center for you watching this campaign and what's on the table?
[01:10:08.909 --> 01:10:14.573]  Well, it's the most fun I've had with TV in years, watching the absolute
[01:10:15.037 --> 01:10:16.178]  Does he smell like Reagan to you?
[01:10:44.128 --> 01:10:48.192]  And not intimidated by the establishment.
[01:10:48.192 --> 01:10:50.394]  And we like that.
[01:10:50.394 --> 01:10:59.763]  And I like him especially because he made immigration the top issue.
[01:10:59.763 --> 01:11:03.186]  And nobody else wanted to talk about it except Ann Coulter.
[01:11:03.186 --> 01:11:05.148]  Donald Trump is a true game changer.
[01:11:05.148 --> 01:11:08.331]  So let's walk through as a political expert and a societal expert.
[01:11:09.329 --> 01:11:11.491]  What is front and center for you, fellas?
[01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:12.752]  Give us your marching orders.
[01:11:12.752 --> 01:11:15.314]  Break down what the stakes are for us.
[01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:28.746]  Well, I'm with Jeff Sessions, and you know what he said the other day was that the candidate has got to be right on immigration, and he's got to be right on these phony trade deals.
[01:11:28.746 --> 01:11:32.209]  And if you're not right on that, he's not going to vote for you.
[01:11:33.809 --> 01:11:35.730]  And I agree with Jeff Sessions.
[01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:39.111]  That's the sovereignty of our country in the balance.
[01:11:39.111 --> 01:11:40.311]  That's right.
[01:11:40.311 --> 01:11:43.492]  And I remember the last one of these trade deals they put through.
[01:11:43.492 --> 01:11:47.593]  They promised it was going to make 30,000 jobs.
[01:11:47.593 --> 01:11:49.774]  Well, it did, but they were all in South Korea.
[01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:57.397]  It's simply incredible that we've gotten to this point.
[01:11:57.397 --> 01:12:03.341]  What do you think of the world leaders piling on and lecturing Americans about what we should do internally?
[01:12:03.341 --> 01:12:05.343]  That's always been a no-no.
[01:12:05.343 --> 01:12:08.325]  Well, they think they are really the kingmakers.
[01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:11.967]  You know, that's what I named them during the Barry Goldwater days.
[01:12:11.967 --> 01:12:19.433]  And they really enjoy that role and think they should tell the rest of those dumb people what to do.
[01:12:20.619 --> 01:12:23.000]  But I don't think that's the way it ought to be.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.861]  Our Constitution says we're governed by we the people.
[01:12:26.861 --> 01:12:36.545]  And I encourage everybody to get busy and vote for your conscience and not be intimidated by what the grassroots are trying to dictate to you.
[01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:39.826]  You knew Barry Goldwater well, and I've studied him.
[01:12:39.826 --> 01:12:46.068]  What an amazing patriot who exposed the whole globalist agenda decades before it was even known.
[01:12:46.068 --> 01:12:49.249]  How different would this country be today if we would have elected Barry Goldwater?
[01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:56.451]  A, I know he influenced Reagan greatly, but B, what would Barry Goldwater say today if he saw where this country was?
[01:12:56.451 --> 01:13:03.073]  Well, he would be disappointed at the people we've put up to run for office.
[01:13:03.073 --> 01:13:06.234]  You know, Reagan wasn't
[01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.551]  Uh, perfect in every way.
[01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.833]  Uh, but he did believe in America.
[01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:15.636]  And, uh, he did, uh, obey the Constitution.
[01:13:15.636 --> 01:13:24.161]  And something that is definitely, uh, uh, right, the right way to behave.
[01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:27.143]  He was a nationalist and an anti-communist.
[01:13:27.143 --> 01:13:30.385]  He was, and he meant what he said.
[01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:33.867]  And, uh, you know, I, I, I asked, um,
[01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:40.884]  Walker, who was running for president earlier, and dropped out.
[01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:44.825]  What was the most important decision Reagan made?
[01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:50.928]  And he said, the decision to fire the air traffic controllers.
[01:13:50.928 --> 01:13:52.349]  And they all snickered and laughed.
[01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:54.350]  They thought that was a dumb answer.
[01:13:54.350 --> 01:14:01.473]  And then they went over and asked the authority on economics, is his name Schmidt?
[01:14:04.167 --> 01:14:06.308]  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.389]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:14:07.389 --> 01:14:08.910]  And he gave the same answer.
[01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:16.574]  And the thing was that that's when the Russians understood what kind of a man they were dealing with.
[01:14:16.574 --> 01:14:18.836]  And they couldn't push him around.
[01:14:18.836 --> 01:14:23.118]  And he was going to mean what he said and say what he means.
[01:14:23.118 --> 01:14:27.741]  And so that's what we like about him.
[01:14:27.741 --> 01:14:29.182]  And that's what we like about Trump.
[01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:37.022]  Well the arrogance of all these other countries saying we've got to have open borders and we've got to give everybody free stuff, none of them do that.
[01:14:37.022 --> 01:14:38.562]  Oh no, of course they didn't.
[01:14:38.562 --> 01:14:42.384]  And you know the good example of what's happening is Germany.
[01:14:42.384 --> 01:14:45.886]  Now I thought Germany, the Germans are pretty tough people.
[01:14:45.886 --> 01:14:54.149]  But they let all these immigrants into their country and they regret it now and they're trying to get rid of them.
[01:14:56.906 --> 01:14:58.468]  We've only got five minutes left with you.
[01:14:58.468 --> 01:14:59.909]  We really appreciate your time.
[01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:03.333]  You have the floor to talk about the state of the world, Donald Trump.
[01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:06.596]  Well, I think immigration is the number one issue.
[01:15:06.596 --> 01:15:09.319]  And these trade deals also.
[01:15:09.319 --> 01:15:11.701]  And these trade deals are all bad.
[01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:16.286]  And it's such a mistake that they call it free trade.
[01:15:16.286 --> 01:15:18.648]  It's free for the other countries, but not for us.
[01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:28.118]  They have really destroyed our jobs and our opportunities for the middle class.
[01:15:28.118 --> 01:15:31.441]  It's just terrible what they've done to our country.
[01:15:31.441 --> 01:15:40.789]  We had a great country built on the middle class and the trade deals have really destroyed that.
[01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:47.383]  Well, the elites think driving down the wages and turning us into a third world country will give them control.
[01:15:47.383 --> 01:15:50.907]  Instead, they're soiling their own nest, killing the golden goose.
[01:15:50.907 --> 01:15:52.548]  What does your gut tell you about Trump?
[01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.871]  Will they be able to manufacture more attacks or steal the election?
[01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:58.514]  Or does your gut tell you the poll shows he'll destroy...
[01:15:58.974 --> 01:16:01.716]  They're going to do everything they possibly can.
[01:16:01.716 --> 01:16:06.398]  They're going to pull every dirty trick they can possibly do.
[01:16:06.398 --> 01:16:10.420]  And I hope they're not going to be successful.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.963]  But you've got to give them me forever for trying for the last 10 years.
[01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:15.883]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:16:15.883 --> 01:16:18.544]  Do you think he's going to actually get the nomination?
[01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:19.164]  That's pretty clear now?
[01:16:19.164 --> 01:16:21.685]  Yes, I do think he's going to get the nomination.
[01:16:21.685 --> 01:16:27.487]  Because I think so many people are fed up with the Kingmakers.
[01:16:27.487 --> 01:16:30.008]  And the polls show he will destroy Hillary.
[01:16:30.008 --> 01:16:32.529]  The polls show he will destroy Hillary.
[01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:33.649]  Yeah.
[01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:39.951]  And so the polls are showing
[01:16:40.393 --> 01:16:43.518]  That Trump is leading, and I think that's true.
[01:16:43.518 --> 01:16:48.466]  I think the people really want him.
[01:16:48.466 --> 01:16:51.912]  They want somebody who's going to stand up for America.
[01:16:51.912 --> 01:16:54.756]  They like his slogan, we're going to make America great again.
[01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:57.772]  He's even got liberals like Howard Stern endorsing him.
[01:16:57.772 --> 01:17:00.153]  People are sick of America being put down.
[01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:03.195]  They're sick of America being put 10th.
[01:17:03.195 --> 01:17:10.780]  They're sick of all of it, and they love somebody that's plain spoken, who doesn't apologize and doesn't back down, even if they disagree with some of what he says.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.283]  And the fact that we're faced with Hillary looking at the Bushes and closing.
[01:17:14.283 --> 01:17:20.667]  You were there when they tried to broker that convention in 1980 and made Reagan take George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:22.588]  Are you concerned about a broker convention this time?
[01:17:22.588 --> 01:17:25.150]  Because the Koch brothers and others say they're lining up to do that.
[01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:30.195]  Well, I don't think they'll convince Trump to go along with them.
[01:17:30.195 --> 01:17:32.497]  I think he'll stand firm.
[01:17:32.497 --> 01:17:37.942]  That's his reputation, and I think it's true that he won't give in.
[01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:49.298]  But you know, they worked on Reagan all night, and he thought that he couldn't get through the night with the pressure that was being put on him.
[01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:56.502]  And so that's, you remember, he called George W. Bush at 11.30 p.m.
[01:17:56.502 --> 01:18:00.944]  and said, get on over here, I'm introducing you as vice president.
[01:18:00.944 --> 01:18:07.127]  And, well, history was made because they felt they could, they,
[01:18:10.505 --> 01:18:22.618]  They really wanted the other guy, but at any rate, they couldn't get him, and that's how we got the Bush as a successor.
[01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:24.958]  Amazing.
[01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:30.961]  Well, I believe we can defeat globalism, restore nationalism, and break this trench and say we're allowed to have a country.
[01:18:30.961 --> 01:18:32.462]  We're allowed to have sovereignty.
[01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:33.983]  We're allowed to be proud of ourselves.
[01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:35.383]  We're allowed to do this.
[01:18:35.383 --> 01:18:36.744]  We don't have to go under globalism.
[01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:39.985]  We don't have to sign our rights over the TPP or NAU.
[01:18:39.985 --> 01:18:44.407]  And I mean, and I think that Trump is helping break the hoax.
[01:18:44.407 --> 01:18:47.409]  Of course, standing on the shoulders of people like you and Ron Paul and
[01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:52.570]  Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and countless others that came before them.
[01:18:52.570 --> 01:19:01.772]  It's got to be satisfying, fellas, in closing, though, to see such a strong, true conservative movement that you and Barry Goldwater and others helped found.
[01:19:01.772 --> 01:19:04.573]  And I don't want to just give credit here, but history's important.
[01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:10.954]  Who else would you like to credit as being the founders of what we see today as a real shot of saving America?
[01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:14.617]  Well, it was really Reagan who did it.
[01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:19.462]  He was the flag carrier for the whole conservative movement.
[01:19:19.462 --> 01:19:28.731]  And Barry Goldwater did a great job, but then he kind of wandered off the reservation after that.
[01:19:29.389 --> 01:19:36.453]  But at any rate, the movement that was created by Barry Goldwater has retained, and we've built it.
[01:19:36.453 --> 01:19:39.414]  And Eagle Forum has played a big role in that.
[01:19:39.414 --> 01:19:44.837]  And I encourage people to be active in politics, because that's where the action is.
[01:19:44.837 --> 01:19:45.517]  Absolutely.
[01:19:45.517 --> 01:19:46.878]  And if you think there's an election fraud, fine.
[01:19:46.878 --> 01:19:48.479]  And I want them all to go to Cleveland.
[01:19:48.479 --> 01:19:48.859]  Absolutely.
[01:19:48.859 --> 01:19:49.599]  Get involved.
[01:19:49.599 --> 01:19:50.680]  Take over the system.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.581]  Phyllis Schlafly, EagleForum.org.
[01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:54.862]  Thank you so much for joining us on Super Tuesday.
[01:19:55.302 --> 01:19:56.566]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:56.566 --> 01:19:59.233]  We'll be back with breaking news information on Alex Jones.
[01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:03.852]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:20:03.852 --> 01:20:06.492]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:20:06.492 --> 01:20:07.233]  Croix River.
[01:20:07.233 --> 01:20:09.453]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:20:09.453 --> 01:20:12.414]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:20:12.414 --> 01:20:13.294]  His excuse?
[01:20:13.294 --> 01:20:14.634]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:20:14.634 --> 01:20:16.235]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:20:16.235 --> 01:20:21.996]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:20:21.996 --> 01:20:23.036]  Don't wait.

[01:21:00.518 --> 01:21:02.178]  Are you looking to sell body armor?
[01:21:02.178 --> 01:21:05.119]  Want to make extra money selling body armor at your local gun shows?

[01:21:22.743 --> 01:21:23.904]  Or go to kdarmor.com.
[01:21:23.904 --> 01:21:24.944]  Come and take it.
[01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.913]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[01:21:33.913 --> 01:21:37.236]  So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:21:37.236 --> 01:21:41.499]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[01:21:41.499 --> 01:21:46.123]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[01:21:51.827 --> 01:21:52.168]  GoBerkey.com
[01:22:00.294 --> 01:22:04.676]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[01:22:04.676 --> 01:22:07.717]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[01:22:07.717 --> 01:22:10.678]  One World Whey is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[01:22:10.678 --> 01:22:19.101]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:22.242]  One World Whey also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[01:22:22.242 --> 01:22:27.604]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[01:22:27.864 --> 01:22:32.286]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:38.928]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, dryness, and stamina.
[01:22:38.928 --> 01:22:42.810]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:49.092]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:49.092 --> 01:22:51.994]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:56.958]  988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:22:56.958 --> 01:23:00.021]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:23:00.021 --> 01:23:07.387]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:11.611]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:17.177]  Now revealing FEMA's plaque could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[01:23:17.817 --> 01:23:23.441]  I just created a free video presentation at 123fema.com that exposes the truth.
[01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:30.146]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[01:23:30.146 --> 01:23:40.174]  Go to 123fema.com to see the number one item to hoard and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:45.836]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[01:23:45.836 --> 01:23:51.418]  Go to 123fema.com and discover the number one item most critical in a crisis.
[01:23:51.418 --> 01:23:56.880]  Go watch my video now at 123fema.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.120]  Again, that's 123fema.com.
[01:24:07.915 --> 01:24:09.836]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:12.158]  to 3 p.m.
[01:24:12.158 --> 01:24:13.438]  You will find us.
[01:24:13.438 --> 01:24:18.681]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, part of the InfoWars live system.
[01:24:18.681 --> 01:24:21.703]  Tonight, 7 o'clock Central, right through 10 o'clock Central.
[01:24:21.703 --> 01:24:25.605]  We're gonna have live coverage of the Super Tuesday results as they come in.
[01:24:25.605 --> 01:24:31.128]  We'll be watching for fraud, and we also tonight probably should give out our own studio number and take calls.
[01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:37.090]  Specifically on exit polling, what people experienced, what happened.
[01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:38.291]  That's an idea of a meeting to add.
[01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:41.373]  I don't know if we can get that done in this short time, but we'll see.
[01:24:41.373 --> 01:24:44.134]  That way it's not just our great crew having to sit there for five hours and talk.
[01:24:45.958 --> 01:24:59.382]  I mean, it's informative, and we analyze the mainstream media as it unfolds, but it's even more grueling than just covering a debate, because you can sit back and let them talk and then cover the debate, but actually sitting for four or five hours is very, very tiring at times.
[01:24:59.382 --> 01:25:05.064]  So I'm going to be up here helping as well and going over all the latest information.
[01:25:06.324 --> 01:25:13.989]  We do have another guest popping in, Wayne Madsen, on the whole gay mafia angle with Marco Rubio.
[01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:21.333]  And every time I mention something like this, I see news articles going, Alex Jones is bashing gay people.
[01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:23.675]  Well, I'm not against people they call gay.
[01:25:23.675 --> 01:25:25.976]  I am against you taking over the language.
[01:25:25.976 --> 01:25:27.557]  It's called homosexual.
[01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:30.659]  It's called heterosexual between a man and a woman.
[01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:34.641]  And two women, you know, it's lesbians from the Isle of Lesbos.
[01:25:36.062 --> 01:25:38.564]  Connotation there is just the island of women.
[01:25:38.564 --> 01:25:42.166]  As you can say, Islas Mujeres in Spanish.
[01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:44.988]  Isla Mujeres, if you want to talk about Mexico.
[01:25:44.988 --> 01:25:50.152]  And I'm not on your back, I don't care, whatever.
[01:25:50.152 --> 01:25:55.636]  Just don't, whether you're a heterosexual or a homosexual, try to control language and tell me how to talk.
[01:25:55.636 --> 01:26:00.279]  And don't try to go into the schools and recruit the kids and try to act like they're parents.
[01:26:01.311 --> 01:26:02.111]  And go beyond.
[01:26:02.111 --> 01:26:06.473]  I mean, as a parent, I don't talk about sex to my kids until they're like 12 or 13.
[01:26:06.473 --> 01:26:11.294]  I've only talked about it a little bit with my son so far.
[01:26:11.294 --> 01:26:12.974]  I have younger daughters.
[01:26:12.974 --> 01:26:15.735]  It's like the school does it, though.
[01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:19.816]  And then you get into all this stuff that isn't even the basics.
[01:26:19.816 --> 01:26:22.577]  It's not your business and it's sick.
[01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:28.079]  And then I look at Marco Rubio, who gets arrested at this bathroom in the middle of the night.
[01:26:29.278 --> 01:26:48.903]  They hide the records, the guy gets arrested with, gets caught running a gay porn site, and a gay porn production company, and a house, and he's got this family member he's close to with the drug dealing and all this stuff, and I'm just saying, whoa, that's blackmailable material.
[01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:56.665]  Quite frankly, this is how they control Congress, whether it's homosexual or heterosexual,
[01:26:58.001 --> 01:27:01.983]  They control people through the sexual stuff.
[01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:15.150]  And that's why I wish these politicians would break the back of the political system that uses this and come out and not get into lurid details, but say, I partied a lot when I was in college, did a lot of wild stuff.
[01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:19.292]  I'm a loving family man with a wife and kids now.
[01:27:19.292 --> 01:27:22.794]  And so I'm not going to talk about people's personal lives and what they're into.
[01:27:22.794 --> 01:27:23.654]  But here's the deal.
[01:27:23.654 --> 01:27:25.895]  Marco Rubio and others have done that themselves.
[01:27:25.895 --> 01:27:26.856]  They've opened the door up.
[01:27:28.697 --> 01:27:35.282]  So let's be clear, I'm not here judging this guy, because Lord knows none of us are perfect.
[01:27:35.282 --> 01:27:47.531]  And I don't have these type of escapades that it looks like he's involved in, but let me tell you, I'm certainly not going to sit up here and tell you that I'm not Pepe Le Pew in some points of my life when it comes to women.
[01:27:47.531 --> 01:27:49.632]  And so I'm just not on a high horse.
[01:27:49.632 --> 01:27:56.858]  Here's the deal though, I don't screw anybody over, I don't cheat anybody, I don't hurt innocent people, and I treat people like I want to be treated.
[01:27:56.858 --> 01:27:58.139]  And I am a good family man today.
[01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:06.660]  But this idea that stuff you've done in your past then enslaves you and controls you is wrong.
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.102]  Unless it's murdering people or ripping people off.
[01:28:09.102 --> 01:28:13.026]  If it's victimless, then I don't say it's a crime.
[01:28:13.026 --> 01:28:16.810]  It may be a crime in God's eyes, but I'm not here to judge stuff that...
[01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:22.722]  I see you beating old ladies brains out with a baseball bat, I know you're a murderer, and I'm going to try to stop you.
[01:28:22.722 --> 01:28:28.808]  But when it comes to all this nebulous stuff, I'm going to get the beam out of my eye before I try to get the beam out of your eye to quote Christ.
[01:28:28.808 --> 01:28:33.872]  He says, oh, I got a speck in my eye, I got a beam in yours.
[01:28:33.872 --> 01:28:40.138]  But that said, that's how they control people in these secret societies, these sex societies.
[01:28:40.138 --> 01:28:42.080]  It's one of the biggest, it's how they've done it for thousands of years.
[01:28:43.368 --> 01:28:47.992]  And so these things are used as tools, and so Marco Rubio is fair game.
[01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:51.034]  And I tell you, the evidence is pretty strong.
[01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.175]  The smell is strong.
[01:28:52.175 --> 01:28:56.759]  Kind of like, you don't know what your neighbor's grilling, but it smells like hamburgers.
[01:28:56.759 --> 01:28:58.661]  And you go over there, sure enough, it's hamburgers.
[01:28:58.661 --> 01:29:00.783]  There's some meat smoke blowing over here.
[01:29:00.783 --> 01:29:03.024]  Or let's use a gross analogy.
[01:29:03.024 --> 01:29:04.325]  You smell the dead possum.
[01:29:04.325 --> 01:29:06.207]  You know, there's something dead in the air conditioning vents.
[01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.649]  You don't know what, but it stinks, you know.
[01:29:08.649 --> 01:29:09.670]  Something's going on here.
[01:29:12.344 --> 01:29:16.325]  Something is unfolding here.
[01:29:16.325 --> 01:29:22.747]  And Obama had the same background, clearly, with the whole bisexual stuff going on.
[01:29:22.747 --> 01:29:24.728]  And that's how they controlled him.
[01:29:24.728 --> 01:29:26.369]  And so for me, that's the issue.
[01:29:26.369 --> 01:29:26.949]  With Hillary...
[01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:36.821]  How blackmailable is that, that she's seen more tail than a bicycle seat or a toilet seat, to quote Bill Clinton.
[01:29:36.821 --> 01:29:37.661]  Now that's a quote.
[01:29:37.661 --> 01:29:39.362]  He said both of those.
[01:29:39.362 --> 01:29:46.204]  I mean, imagine, they've got her and all her girlfriends, and she's so arrogant she stays in the same room with them on the campaign trail.
[01:29:46.204 --> 01:29:47.725]  Reportedly, sometimes a couple of women.
[01:29:47.725 --> 01:29:50.045]  I mean, she's partying hard, folks.
[01:29:50.045 --> 01:29:51.446]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.446 --> 01:29:53.967]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.967 --> 01:29:56.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:16.507]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[01:30:16.507 --> 01:30:29.052]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[01:30:29.192 --> 01:30:30.333]  Who announced the findings?
[01:30:45.845 --> 01:30:50.310]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died.
[01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:56.516]  The statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[01:30:56.516 --> 01:31:00.100]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[01:31:01.181 --> 01:31:08.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here to announce the biggest single sale in InfoWars 21-year history.

[01:31:57.527 --> 01:31:59.409]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[01:32:00.191 --> 01:32:01.112]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:32:01.112 --> 01:32:01.692]  Good, brother.
[01:32:01.692 --> 01:32:03.634]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:03.634 --> 01:32:05.356]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:05.356 --> 01:32:09.400]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.002]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:12.002 --> 01:32:14.424]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:14.424 --> 01:32:22.332]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:22.612 --> 01:32:25.834]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:25.834 --> 01:32:27.376]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:30.418]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:30.418 --> 01:32:32.059]  They've got a ton of money there.
[01:32:32.059 --> 01:32:37.483]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:32:37.543 --> 01:32:38.764]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.349 --> 01:33:07.192]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight.
[01:33:07.192 --> 01:33:10.554]  Something you'll never forget.
[01:33:10.554 --> 01:33:16.279]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.279 --> 01:33:19.141]  Turn me on, I'm alive tonight.
[01:33:19.141 --> 01:33:21.503]  Out on the streets again.
[01:33:21.503 --> 01:33:24.986]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight.
[01:33:24.986 --> 01:33:26.367]  Something you'll never forget.
[01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.691]  Better turn me loose.
[01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:37.033]  Better set me free.
[01:33:37.033 --> 01:33:40.134]  A little bit better than I used to be, because I'm alive.
[01:33:40.134 --> 01:33:43.856]  I'm a live wire, baby!
[01:33:43.856 --> 01:33:45.497]  I love it!
[01:33:45.497 --> 01:33:47.678]  Only Alive once, going toe-to-toe with the Globals.
[01:33:48.891 --> 01:33:49.791]  Standing up for the little guys.
[01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:52.253]  Because I can't stand bullies and trash.
[01:33:52.253 --> 01:33:54.594]  I don't like violence, but I tell you.
[01:33:54.594 --> 01:33:58.936]  It's a good feeling when you knock a bully upside the head and their jaw breaks.
[01:33:58.936 --> 01:34:02.918]  And you see them fall like a sack of potatoes and their head hits that concrete.
[01:34:02.918 --> 01:34:07.541]  Because they know they've been run over.
[01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:11.142]  They always think they're invincible when they start the fight.
[01:34:11.142 --> 01:34:12.103]  Until they start losing.
[01:34:15.459 --> 01:34:17.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:17.860]  to 3 p.m.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.220]  Central.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.221]  Weeknights we're back 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock.
[01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:21.822]  But tonight, extended coverage.
[01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.703]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:34:23.703 --> 01:34:25.944]  We're going to have Wayne Madsen popping in with his analysis.
[01:34:25.944 --> 01:34:28.465]  We're going to have Richard Reeves covering Super Tuesday from the ground.
[01:34:28.465 --> 01:34:29.085]  I'll be there.
[01:34:29.085 --> 01:34:40.791]  Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, Joe Biggs, Rob Dew, Darren McBreen, Kit Danielson, anybody else in this great office, my writers, my crew, they've all got great points to make.
[01:34:41.906 --> 01:34:43.147]  So much coming up tonight.
[01:34:43.147 --> 01:34:49.010]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find all the coverage and you can share the links with everybody.
[01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:53.012]  We've also got backups on YouTube and we're getting Facebook mentions and so much more.
[01:34:53.012 --> 01:34:58.655]  I had an idea yesterday and I was going to do it again on this show, but it's too serious.
[01:34:58.655 --> 01:34:59.116]  I don't know.
[01:34:59.116 --> 01:35:07.800]  I might do it at like 1.30 and just let you know it's a joke because it freaked out people too much.
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.462]  Even though I started laughing at the first and said, this is not sincere.
[01:35:12.312 --> 01:35:13.933]  Because I couldn't.
[01:35:13.933 --> 01:35:15.254]  Rob was in the background with Cameron.
[01:35:15.254 --> 01:35:17.235]  He goes, be strong Alex.
[01:35:17.235 --> 01:35:18.116]  You can do it.
[01:35:18.116 --> 01:35:19.116]  Be brave.
[01:35:19.116 --> 01:35:19.917]  So I started laughing.
[01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:20.817]  McAdoo's off camera.
[01:35:20.817 --> 01:35:21.538]  She starts laughing.
[01:35:21.538 --> 01:35:26.801]  We're going to repost it to the front page of Infowars.com and send it out on Twitter at Real Alex Jones.
[01:35:26.801 --> 01:35:28.462]  So be sure and follow us at Real Alex Jones.
[01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:30.657]  Yes, scroll down on Facebook.
[01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:50.564]  And I said, that's it, I'm against Trump.
[01:35:50.564 --> 01:35:51.265]  He's horrible.
[01:35:51.265 --> 01:35:52.185]  The establishment's right.
[01:35:52.185 --> 01:35:56.626]  I mean, my gosh, he's saying vaccines are dangerous and 9-11 truth and sovereignty is good.
[01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:57.767]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[01:35:57.767 --> 01:35:58.667]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:35:58.667 --> 01:36:00.728]  And then McAdoo comes in and basically roughs me up.
[01:36:00.728 --> 01:36:01.428]  It's not real.
[01:36:01.428 --> 01:36:03.488]  People think it's actually real.
[01:36:03.488 --> 01:36:08.130]  It's like Looney Tunes, you know, level humor or Three Stooges-esque.
[01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:09.130]  It's fun.
[01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.390]  It's gone super viral.
[01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:15.072]  I think both videos together, it's like a half million views since last night when we shot it live.
[01:36:16.494 --> 01:36:23.982]  You can see the low-res version up there, but under it, I'm going to have him post the high-res YouTube of it.
[01:36:23.982 --> 01:36:28.306]  So it's pretty funny, and Leanne, we talked about it like a minute before we shot it.
[01:36:28.306 --> 01:36:31.910]  She was literally in here about to go out and do a man on the street interview, and I said, hey, let's do this.
[01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:34.052]  She said, sure, sounds fun.
[01:36:34.052 --> 01:36:37.396]  And it just illustrates how crazy it is to get on the anti-Trump bandwagon.
[01:36:38.356 --> 01:36:43.338]  It's not that he's perfect, but he's the symbol now of the uprising against the Bush and Clinton crime family.
[01:36:43.338 --> 01:36:48.500]  We're going to Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:56.384]  Now, obviously, we're going to get into the gay mafia stories that he wrote three years ago, a year ago, and a week ago that got put in the National Enquirer.
[01:36:58.271 --> 01:37:01.834]  And obviously we're going to get into that, but wow, how vindicated does he feel?
[01:37:01.834 --> 01:37:23.429]  Because he went out there, and I said, this is near the border, drug dealers, he's dead, the key Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, it's connected to black cops, Obama, the fellow over the head, no autopsy, and Wayne and Beggs go, we feel like an occultic Bohemian Grove thing.
[01:37:23.429 --> 01:37:24.349]  They even put tweets out.
[01:37:26.312 --> 01:37:29.233]  Instagram's saying that, both of them.
[01:37:29.233 --> 01:37:31.494]  And, you know, I feel Dick Cheney's out here.
[01:37:31.494 --> 01:37:33.194]  This just really fits with the occult.
[01:37:33.194 --> 01:37:38.876]  In Washington Post last week, he died at part of a secret society.
[01:37:38.876 --> 01:37:40.236]  It claims it's a hunting society.
[01:37:40.236 --> 01:37:40.996]  No, it's not.
[01:37:40.996 --> 01:37:45.338]  It's a spinoff of the Bavarian Illuminati, like Skull and Bones, like Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:45.338 --> 01:37:51.379]  And they admit it was founded by Bohemian Grove, itself a chapter of the Bavarian Illuminati.
[01:37:51.379 --> 01:37:52.940]  It's a German death cult.
[01:37:54.667 --> 01:38:03.930]  People always accuse me, the white supremacists especially, they go, you're anti-German, you say it's a death cult, you piece of trash, quit bashing Germans!
[01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:09.532]  If I'm anything, of my Heinz 57, of European lineage, and some Native American, it is German.
[01:38:09.532 --> 01:38:13.394]  I got more German in me than anything.
[01:38:13.394 --> 01:38:17.095]  Brevarian, Alsatian, Prussian.
[01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:22.567]  I mean, my mom's side of the family, both sides, it's almost all Germans.
[01:38:22.567 --> 01:38:28.589]  My dad's, you know, English and Irish and Scottish and American Indian.
[01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:30.690]  But it's just wild that they spin it all.
[01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:40.233]  I'm not saying Germans run the world and it's a Germanic... I'm saying, when you get to the bottom of the barrel over and over again and do occultism, you just keep hitting Germanic death cult.
[01:38:40.233 --> 01:38:41.373]  That's what the Illuminati is.
[01:38:41.373 --> 01:38:42.193]  And it's in the news!
[01:38:42.193 --> 01:38:42.733]  Notice!
[01:38:42.733 --> 01:38:43.054]  Boom!
[01:38:45.367 --> 01:38:51.010]  We'll talk about that with Wayne Madsen, but it's not a German bashing exercise.
[01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:53.111]  The Germans were dumb to be suckered into World War II.
[01:38:53.111 --> 01:38:53.771]  They were set up.
[01:38:53.771 --> 01:38:55.212]  It was wrong.
[01:38:55.212 --> 01:38:56.773]  20 million Germans died.
[01:38:56.773 --> 01:38:58.074]  Now, let's move on from there.
[01:38:58.074 --> 01:39:00.035]  We're running the biggest sale in our history.
[01:39:00.035 --> 01:39:03.396]  The leap year, the 29th, has come and gone.
[01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:04.377]  Now, March 1st.
[01:39:04.377 --> 01:39:05.618]  Ides of March coming up.
[01:39:05.618 --> 01:39:06.218]  Super Tuesday.
[01:39:07.622 --> 01:39:08.943]  We have to end it, okay?
[01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:11.464]  Because 10 items at least have sold out.
[01:39:11.464 --> 01:39:14.986]  They tell me another five or six are set to sell out in the next few hours.
[01:39:14.986 --> 01:39:18.728]  Some of them are books, videos, t-shirts, but a lot of them are nutraceuticals.
[01:39:18.728 --> 01:39:21.670]  We can't just be completely run out because the sale's so good.
[01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:23.011]  30% off and free shipping.
[01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:27.453]  Some of these we're losing money on, but it does help fund the operation of the products we do make money on.
[01:39:27.453 --> 01:39:28.834]  Liver Shield's back in stock.
[01:39:28.834 --> 01:39:33.136]  AnthroPlex, which is basically the pill form of super male or female vitality.
[01:39:33.136 --> 01:39:33.776]  It's excellent.
[01:39:33.776 --> 01:39:34.377]  It just came in.
[01:39:34.377 --> 01:39:35.958]  The truck came in yesterday in limited supply.
[01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:37.778]  Oxy-Powder is in.
[01:39:37.778 --> 01:39:42.239]  A whole bunch of great items, non-GMO seeds, they're there.
[01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:44.780]  30% off, free shipping, and this is our Super Tuesday sale.
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:47.780]  It has to end tomorrow before showtime.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:50.201]  It has to, because we're going to sell out of everything.
[01:39:50.201 --> 01:39:55.082]  I had no idea we went this low on the already discounted prices that this would happen.
[01:39:55.082 --> 01:39:59.063]  And that's good that we're bringing some funds in, because we're spending so much money sending reporters around the country.
[01:39:59.063 --> 01:40:00.783]  I want to send Wayne to Davos and Bilderberg.
[01:40:01.638 --> 01:40:03.119]  I want Wayne to go to Bilderberg this year.
[01:40:03.119 --> 01:40:04.280]  I want to send like five people.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.661]  I may even go.
[01:40:05.661 --> 01:40:07.083]  I'm just so busy holding down the fort here.
[01:40:07.083 --> 01:40:09.244]  Believe me, I want to go to Europe.
[01:40:09.244 --> 01:40:14.369]  So it's good to have that capital, help build this media institution that continues to win.
[01:40:14.369 --> 01:40:18.772]  Our story about Texas and votes going to Marco Rubio, that's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:40:18.772 --> 01:40:19.853]  Top of Drudge right now.
[01:40:19.853 --> 01:40:20.394]  Middle column.
[01:40:21.476 --> 01:40:26.022]  Point is, we're not just effective, we're super effective, thanks to your prayers, your support, you name it.
[01:40:26.022 --> 01:40:28.405]  InfoWarsLife.com, patients and nutraceuticals.
[01:40:28.405 --> 01:40:32.130]  InfoWarsStore.com, one word, is the umbrella site, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:34.093]  Go read the right reviews for yourself.
[01:40:37.813 --> 01:40:39.594]  Here's a review on LiverShield.
[01:40:39.594 --> 01:40:41.095]  Lily May in St.
[01:40:41.095 --> 01:40:42.896]  Catharines, Ontario.
[01:40:42.896 --> 01:40:44.476]  I would buy this LiverShield again.
[01:40:44.476 --> 01:40:45.837]  I use LiverShield every day.
[01:40:45.837 --> 01:40:50.579]  On the sixth day, and that's when she had the cleanse, all kinds of black crud came out.
[01:40:50.579 --> 01:40:54.281]  I'm 63 years old and feel 35 again, Alex.
[01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.822]  Thanks, Alex, for your great products.
[01:40:55.822 --> 01:40:57.003]  Here's another one I'm going to stop plugging.
[01:40:58.124 --> 01:40:59.425]  Inskey in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:59.425 --> 01:41:00.246]  Liver Shield.
[01:41:00.246 --> 01:41:00.886]  Feeling great.
[01:41:00.886 --> 01:41:01.547]  Physically fit.
[01:41:01.547 --> 01:41:02.128]  Satisfied.
[01:41:02.128 --> 01:41:03.389]  I use this product daily.
[01:41:03.389 --> 01:41:04.110]  Taste is great.
[01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:05.251]  I believe this product is working.
[01:41:05.251 --> 01:41:09.275]  Always follow instructions via any product for best results.
[01:41:09.275 --> 01:41:10.596]  And that's another five-star review.
[01:41:10.596 --> 01:41:11.837]  There's thousands of them.
[01:41:11.837 --> 01:41:14.820]  Tens of thousands for all the products on third-party power reviews.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.882]  And that's how we're funding our operation.
[01:41:16.882 --> 01:41:18.724]  Not with taxpayer money like MSNBC or
[01:41:19.685 --> 01:41:23.589]  NPR, but with your support, thank you for supporting us and being right beside us.
[01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:24.930]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:34.378]  All right, you can go to WayneMadsenReport.com or InfoWars.com, but WayneMadsenReport.com is a great place to go to find it all archived neatly.
[01:41:34.378 --> 01:41:41.144]  And here's the headline, Cover Up Rubio Establishment, Try to Bury Rubio's Gay Past, close quote reports.
[01:41:41.144 --> 01:41:45.148]  Here's another one, Rubio's Cuban Mafia Connections in Miami-Dade.
[01:41:46.041 --> 01:41:51.042]  Now, he wrote articles about him years ago in his investigations of Obama and blackmail.
[01:41:51.042 --> 01:41:52.583]  And I want to be clear, because I know Wayne's views on this.
[01:41:52.583 --> 01:41:55.044]  We're not bashing him if he's bisexual.
[01:41:55.044 --> 01:41:55.744]  Okay?
[01:41:55.744 --> 01:41:56.584]  That's not what we do.
[01:41:56.584 --> 01:41:57.244]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:57.884]  I am a Christian.
[01:41:57.884 --> 01:42:00.265]  I have my own views, but I do not judge people.
[01:42:00.265 --> 01:42:05.246]  As long as you leave people's kids alone, whether you're heterosexual or homosexual, whatever.
[01:42:05.246 --> 01:42:10.488]  That said, they can blackmail him with this, and he's got the Koch brothers behind him, the whole power structure behind him.
[01:42:12.463 --> 01:42:14.946]  It shows that there's some serious issues here.
[01:42:14.946 --> 01:42:18.911]  We're going to cover that and then get into the Washington Post headline.
[01:42:31.932 --> 01:42:34.734]  Being on the air 21 years, it didn't used to feel like this.
[01:42:34.734 --> 01:42:39.376]  Now every day feels like Outer Limits, surreal, Twilight Zone.
[01:42:39.376 --> 01:42:42.418]  Are you feeling like that in your 30 years as a reporter?
[01:42:42.418 --> 01:42:45.139]  Before that a high-level officer at the National Security Agency?
[01:42:45.139 --> 01:42:48.201]  I mean, is this not getting too crazy?
[01:42:48.201 --> 01:42:55.545]  I've covered a lot of presidential campaigns and this one is almost like Don Rickles running against Rodney Dangerfield.
[01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:57.994]  It is.
[01:42:57.994 --> 01:42:59.635]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:42:59.635 --> 01:43:13.804]  I know in the past candidates would, you know, throw some barbs, but I mean, when we had Marco Rubio in Virginia just the other day question Donald Trump's hand size, and he says, well, you know, guys with small hands, you know what that means?
[01:43:13.804 --> 01:43:15.665]  No, Marco, why don't you let us know?
[01:43:15.665 --> 01:43:17.746]  I mean, Marco sounds like he's an expert.
[01:43:17.746 --> 01:43:20.328]  Rubio's an expert on men's members.
[01:43:20.328 --> 01:43:21.429]  He knows how to scope them out.
[01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:26.593]  He said he was staring at Trump in the green room before the Houston debate.
[01:43:26.593 --> 01:43:29.876]  Notice, he says, I was wondering whether Donald thought he wet his pants.
[01:43:29.876 --> 01:43:35.260]  Well, why was Rubio staring, looking for... Well, that's an amazing thought, Wayne.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:38.543]  Why is Rubio obsessed with Donald Trump's package, is the headline.
[01:43:38.931 --> 01:43:42.412]  That's the real headline, I think, here.
[01:43:42.412 --> 01:43:44.392]  He can't contain himself.
[01:43:44.392 --> 01:43:59.876]  Since I reported Rubio and the phone bath, by the way, it's been confirmed that when he was going to those phone parties in South Beach in the 90s, in South Beach, they were exclusively gay events.
[01:43:59.876 --> 01:44:03.657]  These people are coming out and saying, oh, I went to a phone party and it wasn't.
[01:44:03.657 --> 01:44:05.497]  Well, if it's in Poughkeepsie, New York,
[01:44:05.977 --> 01:44:14.503]  Maybe not, but if it was in South Beach, Miami-Dade County, Florida, it was.
[01:44:14.503 --> 01:44:18.106]  He's got all these people coming to his defense.
[01:44:18.106 --> 01:44:24.210]  You've got photos on your site, you might direct folks where they go to see those, that look like Rubio at these parties.
[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:25.030]  That is Rubio.
[01:44:26.051 --> 01:44:27.613]  See, that's another thing.
[01:44:27.613 --> 01:44:34.942]  That was a thing they did for his high school, but it was so popular in South Beach, they took that on the road.
[01:44:34.942 --> 01:44:35.302]  Sure, sure.
[01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:36.023]  And that is Rubio.
[01:44:36.023 --> 01:44:36.524]  Look at his ears.
[01:44:36.524 --> 01:44:40.048]  But let's go back to him, admittedly, as a male cheerleader like Bush and...
[01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:43.491]  Perry and everybody.
[01:44:43.491 --> 01:44:45.473]  I mean, it's so rare to be a male cheerleader.
[01:44:45.473 --> 01:44:47.616]  It's known about half of them are usually gay.
[01:44:47.616 --> 01:44:50.899]  I mean, he's a male cheerleader jumping around in a Chippendales outfit.
[01:44:50.899 --> 01:44:52.801]  Most of the Chippendales it's known are gay.
[01:44:52.801 --> 01:44:55.423]  And then, boom, he looks like he's at gay phone parties.
[01:44:55.423 --> 01:44:56.825]  Explain what phone parties are.
[01:44:57.333 --> 01:45:08.040]  A foam party, they held them at these gay clubs in South Beach, where a bunch of gay guys would get on the dance floor, and then they would spray foam in.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:19.288]  Where the foam would go, as that one photo showed, right up to basically their chest level, and then all kinds of unsavory things would happen underneath the foam.
[01:45:19.288 --> 01:45:26.753]  Now it's been said, he actually said, he actually, in this case, right up to between their chest and their necks.
[01:45:27.713 --> 01:45:31.874]  And Rubio said he met his wife at one of these foam parties.
[01:45:31.874 --> 01:45:48.340]  So I inquired about that and what I got in response was a lot of women used to go to these events, they were spectators, and they basically got off on watching these gay guys, you know, cavorting in the suds.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:46:05.067]  Now, I think after the Christie endorsement of Trump, I now understand why Chris Christie kept referring to Marco Rubio as the boy in the bubble.
[01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:07.368]  He said, you gotta get out of the bubble.
[01:46:07.368 --> 01:46:10.369]  I think what he meant was the bubble bath.
[01:46:10.369 --> 01:46:12.230]  Wow, wow, wow, wow.
[01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:16.832]  So, it looks like he's connected to public sex parties.
[01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:32.903]  Yeah, not only that, I just found out, I just posted this about an hour ago, Christy and some of his big, I mean, I'm sorry, not Christy, but Rubio, Rubio and some of his campaign contributors, all part of this what I call the Cuban Mafia.
[01:46:33.873 --> 01:46:38.474]  in Miami-Dade County.
[01:46:38.474 --> 01:46:55.839]  They have been seen at Miami's most well-known swingers club called Miami Velvet, which is only a few exits down the Palmetto Expressway from where Rubio established just last week his Florida campaign headquarters.
[01:46:55.839 --> 01:47:00.761]  Well, I've talked to high-level Republicans and they say the word even before this is that Rubio is a switch hitter.
[01:47:02.139 --> 01:47:09.449]  Yeah, it was well known back when he was first running for the Florida House of Representatives.
[01:47:09.449 --> 01:47:15.978]  Of course, he was taken under the wings of a lot of these wealthy Cubans in Miami.
[01:47:18.281 --> 01:47:20.362]  They're parentage.
[01:47:20.362 --> 01:47:26.124]  It was like a lot of these guys were part of the Bay of Pigs invasion.
[01:47:26.124 --> 01:47:27.964]  So this is what we're dealing with here.
[01:47:27.964 --> 01:47:30.325]  And so in 2005, Rubio bought a house for $550,000.
[01:47:30.325 --> 01:47:31.625]  And in 37 days, it had appreciated
[01:47:40.248 --> 01:47:47.418]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, that's the classic scam is property deals where you suddenly are able to sell it for way more than it's worth.
[01:47:53.683 --> 01:48:03.153]  Well, and he's almost a carbon copy of what Obama did with Tony Resco in Chicago when they flipped that real estate Obama's house.
[01:48:03.153 --> 01:48:06.257]  Well, now what you first started reporting on is coming out in the news.
[01:48:06.257 --> 01:48:09.100]  They're looking at it very seriously.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.001]  Is this damaging him?
[01:48:11.311 --> 01:48:17.736]  Well, you would think so, but the establishment Republicans seem to be drifting towards Rubio.
[01:48:17.736 --> 01:48:24.622]  I see it as basically as support is coming from the log cabin Republicans, and they try to say that's a minority in the party.
[01:48:24.622 --> 01:48:25.963]  It's no minority.
[01:48:25.963 --> 01:48:27.984]  I was about to say, I mean, I'm just saying.
[01:48:29.265 --> 01:48:30.386]  Look at Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:30.386 --> 01:48:35.530]  Republicans tend to lean more homosexual at the leadership level than Democrats.
[01:48:35.530 --> 01:48:37.171]  The Democrats tend to rape women a lot.
[01:48:37.171 --> 01:48:38.272]  I just noticed it.
[01:48:38.272 --> 01:48:38.852]  They're into women.
[01:48:38.852 --> 01:48:39.893]  They like to rape and hurt women.
[01:48:39.893 --> 01:48:40.673]  I don't know why.
[01:48:40.673 --> 01:48:44.236]  It just seems they're mainly heterosexual and like to beat women.
[01:48:44.236 --> 01:48:45.277]  I'm sure you've noticed that.
[01:48:45.277 --> 01:48:46.277]  You've talked about it before.
[01:48:46.277 --> 01:48:50.881]  But with the Republicans, it then rears off into men and men dressing like women.
[01:48:51.661 --> 01:48:54.484]  I mean, I've seen the photo inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:54.484 --> 01:48:58.708]  I was there with John Ronson of Henry Kissinger bent over shoving his hands in his pants.
[01:48:58.708 --> 01:49:01.990]  I'm not going to say what he was doing, but I mean, no, Ronson wrote about it in his book.
[01:49:02.796 --> 01:49:02.996]  Yeah.
[01:49:02.996 --> 01:49:05.377]  I wasn't even going to talk about it until Ronson put it in his book.
[01:49:05.377 --> 01:49:06.877]  That's a bad visual on that.
[01:49:06.877 --> 01:49:07.998]  I'm just thinking about it.
[01:49:07.998 --> 01:49:13.500]  It was Kissinger as dressed as a woman, with his butt up in the air, yeah.
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.441]  Trying to be like Madeleine Albright, apparently.
[01:49:18.441 --> 01:49:22.283]  I think what we have in Rubio, we have a similar situation with Barack Obama.
[01:49:22.283 --> 01:49:28.025]  We got a guy who was born, when he was born in Florida, his parents were not American citizens.
[01:49:28.025 --> 01:49:31.506]  Again, we got an issue here with that natural born caveat.
[01:49:31.926 --> 01:49:33.447]  In the Constitution.
[01:49:33.447 --> 01:49:35.748]  What did the Founders actually mean?
[01:49:35.748 --> 01:49:38.269]  We've never had a decision on that.
[01:49:38.269 --> 01:49:45.232]  And a lot of people think that Scalia, if he were still on the court, would have had a very strict interpretation.
[01:49:45.232 --> 01:49:45.852]  I agree.
[01:49:45.852 --> 01:49:48.974]  Let's come back and talk about Scalia in one more segment after that with you, Wayne.
[01:49:48.974 --> 01:49:50.775]  But getting back, I don't mean to say gross things on air.
[01:49:50.775 --> 01:49:51.535]  I don't normally.
[01:49:51.535 --> 01:49:52.836]  We're talking about world figures.
[01:49:52.836 --> 01:49:54.316]  We're talking about things that are being said and done.
[01:49:54.316 --> 01:49:55.957]  Rubio's talking about his hand size.
[01:49:55.957 --> 01:49:56.858]  And you know what that means.
[01:49:56.858 --> 01:49:57.678]  So we have to go there.
[01:49:57.898 --> 01:50:01.120]  Because these are grown men talking about this at a level never before seen.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.821]  So I talk about what I saw at Bohemian Grove.
[01:50:02.821 --> 01:50:04.882]  And I never told anybody until Ronson wrote this book.
[01:50:04.882 --> 01:50:06.303]  And I said, no, I was with him.
[01:50:06.303 --> 01:50:08.585]  Ronson didn't want it known until the book came out that he was there with me.
[01:50:08.585 --> 01:50:10.386]  Then it was spun like I lied and he was with me.
[01:50:10.386 --> 01:50:11.787]  No, it was called being a journalist.
[01:50:11.787 --> 01:50:15.049]  But correct me if I'm wrong, because you say this as well.
[01:50:15.049 --> 01:50:18.651]  Doesn't it seem Democrats lean more hetero but claim they're more pro-gay?
[01:50:18.651 --> 01:50:22.073]  But then they tend to abuse women and I see them killing more women.
[01:50:22.073 --> 01:50:23.534]  Look at the Pope with the dead woman.
[01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:24.194]  He's more of a liberal.
[01:50:26.155 --> 01:50:30.327]  Have you found overall, covering Capitol Hill for 30 years, that that's an accurate generalization?
[01:50:31.283 --> 01:50:38.550]  Yeah, what I found is Democrats largely, when they get caught in a sex scandal, it's with a member of the opposite sex.
[01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:42.974]  When it's Republicans, it's usually a member of the same sex.
[01:50:42.974 --> 01:50:53.423]  And the ones, the Republicans that wake up in the morning and are worried there's gays in their closet and under their bed and around the corner, these are the guys that are usually the ones that get caught.
[01:50:53.423 --> 01:50:55.966]  But am I right saying though, a lot of the Democrats like to beat women though?
[01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:58.531]  Oh yeah, there's been a lot of cases.
[01:50:58.531 --> 01:51:00.132]  Yeah, they're into bondage and stuff.
[01:51:00.132 --> 01:51:00.712]  We'll be back.

[01:54:06.667 --> 01:54:10.709]  All right, I want to get into Scalia with our guest Wayne Madsen in this segment and the next.
[01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:16.091]  Then we have Patrick Wood, who's written a very important book on the technocracy to understand where we're all really going.
[01:54:16.091 --> 01:54:20.652]  We'll have updates almost unfolding the latest news as well, interspersed.
[01:54:20.652 --> 01:54:34.218]  And in the fourth hour, we're going to have open phones with David Knight, and then we're going to try to take calls tonight off and on during our four hours plus live coverage that's going to be taking place, kicking off seven o'clock central time, InfoWars.
[01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:43.623]  News.com takes you over to the nightly news, but the feeds are free for everybody at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:43.623 --> 01:54:52.825]  Wayne, looking at this election just briefly and what you see happening with Trump, I think a lot of it is he's never been in the insider billionaire club.
[01:54:52.825 --> 01:54:54.986]  He has always been a maverick, whether he's good or bad.
[01:54:54.986 --> 01:54:57.086]  He's extremely heterosexual.
[01:54:57.086 --> 01:54:58.606]  I know people that know him up in New York.
[01:55:01.687 --> 01:55:06.410]  I would expect down the road that's something they're going to raise, you know, the fact that he's Pepe Le Pew.
[01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:08.191]  But he's never really covered any of that up.
[01:55:08.191 --> 01:55:09.311]  He's not really hiding it.
[01:55:09.311 --> 01:55:11.733]  So what power does that have over him?
[01:55:11.733 --> 01:55:13.334]  What else do you expect him to do?
[01:55:13.334 --> 01:55:15.255]  And what's your view of Trump right now as things stand?
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:27.325]  Well, I mean, I think tonight we're going to see the sort of the Trump Express continuing to bulldoze through the Republican establishment.
[01:55:27.325 --> 01:55:38.631]  What I'm hearing is in Virginia, the turnout is considered very high for a primary election, and that may be Republicans coming out to vote there.
[01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:43.393]  That's, by the way, that's an open primary, so you can have crossover votes.
[01:55:44.073 --> 01:55:51.143]  And there's a lot of, especially in Southwest Virginia, that's where you'll find a lot of the old quote-unquote Reagan Democrats.
[01:55:51.143 --> 01:56:01.597]  This was a coal mining area where, you know, there's a lot of blighted cities and towns there, but of course that anti-free trade
[01:56:02.438 --> 01:56:03.378]  I don't think so.
[01:56:21.135 --> 01:56:28.001]  Comfortably or slightly, and that would be Texas and also Arkansas.
[01:56:28.001 --> 01:56:30.904]  Rubio, as we know, hasn't won anything yet.
[01:56:30.904 --> 01:56:35.528]  He might win Minnesota, but we'll have to see.
[01:56:35.528 --> 01:56:39.451]  Trump was very, very close behind him in the polls there.
[01:56:39.451 --> 01:56:42.214]  So we'll also have to see how this
[01:56:43.495 --> 01:56:47.057]  Well, he's already come out and repudiated it on Twitter and years ago did it.
[01:56:47.057 --> 01:56:48.938]  But they keep saying he needs to repudiate.
[01:57:01.866 --> 01:57:02.606]  People always do that to me.
[01:57:02.606 --> 01:57:07.950]  They go, you need to repudiate that you work for ABC News, or you need to repudiate that you work for the Koch Brothers.
[01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:11.972]  Never worked for ABC News, never gotten anything from the Koch Brothers.
[01:57:11.972 --> 01:57:14.093]  People, you need to repudiate it again to me.
[01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:16.274]  And that's reportedly what I've been told by folks that know Trump.
[01:57:16.274 --> 01:57:19.516]  He's like, I've done it, I'm done, I'm not doing what they want anymore.
[01:57:19.516 --> 01:57:23.839]  Because he goes, next it'll be repudiate this, repudiate that, and then he's out there apologizing.
[01:57:23.839 --> 01:57:25.219]  I don't know if that strategy's right.
[01:57:25.219 --> 01:57:27.501]  Part of me tells me it's smart, other part tells me it's dumb.
[01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:30.413]  Well, it's a straw man they throw up there.
[01:57:30.413 --> 01:57:35.877]  You know, they want to get him to go after it, and it happens in a lot of these campaigns.
[01:57:35.877 --> 01:57:45.444]  But if he wins, there's 11 states either voting in the primary or caucusing.
[01:57:45.444 --> 01:57:50.408]  If he wins, I'd say nine of those, I think there's no way they're going to stop him.
[01:57:50.408 --> 01:57:57.814]  Sure, if he wins 350 delegates, which is a low number, and the other two split 300, and the others get like 30, then I think he clearly is the nominee.
[01:57:58.314 --> 01:58:03.658]  Yeah, because then the next ones are Ohio and Florida, where they're both winner-take-all.
[01:58:03.658 --> 01:58:08.782]  And if he's ahead in Florida, he's also slightly ahead of Kasich in his home state.
[01:58:08.782 --> 01:58:09.143]  Sure, sure.
[01:58:09.143 --> 01:58:12.105]  And that's where the real fraud we're told is going on against him.
[01:58:12.105 --> 01:58:14.026]  What do you make of the Ides of March option?
[01:58:14.026 --> 01:58:15.628]  I think that's the next primary.
[01:58:15.628 --> 01:58:16.929]  I'm afraid they're going to go after him physically.
[01:58:16.929 --> 01:58:18.070]  The New York Times called for his death.
[01:58:19.282 --> 01:58:34.876]  Uh, you know, as someone who was pretty young at the time and I was up watching in the morning Robert Kennedy's, you know, I turn on the TV and he's giving this like we're going to go on to Chicago and win the nomination.
[01:58:34.876 --> 01:58:35.597]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:58:35.597 --> 01:58:37.379]  I'm going to let you host the next five minutes.
[01:58:37.379 --> 01:58:43.424]  We're going to come back and let you segue out of the assassination of Trump, they try it, into what happened with the Secret Society and Scalia.
[01:58:43.424 --> 01:58:44.565]  You've got the next five minutes.
[01:58:44.565 --> 01:58:45.186]  You're going to host it.
[01:58:45.666 --> 01:58:49.308]  I want to watch what you have to say, but I've got emergency news to research here.
[01:58:49.308 --> 01:58:51.229]  You're taking over for five.
[01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:58.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here to announce the biggest single sale in InfoWars' 21-year history.

[01:59:13.342 --> 01:59:13.402]  The
[01:59:28.897 --> 01:59:31.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.123 --> 02:00:07.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.586 --> 02:00:29.746]  Alright, I'm going to hand the baton for the next five minutes to Wayne Madsen to get into all this talk of assassinating Trump, New York Times writer coming out, people on the street calling for it, we've talked to, how that ties into Scalia and the bazaar, Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, Bavarian Illuminati connected group, in the Washington Post admitting that, again, Twilight Zone is here, Wayne Madsen.
[02:00:31.055 --> 02:00:33.598]  Well Alex, I mean it's absolutely the case.
[02:00:33.598 --> 02:00:40.665]  What we have now is a situation where Trump is having to deal with protesters.
[02:00:40.665 --> 02:00:51.095]  There was an altercation just yesterday in Virginia between a photographer and a Secret Service agent protecting Trump.
[02:00:51.816 --> 02:01:04.892]  Obviously, Secret Service agents are getting very worried now, and they only get worried when they're getting intelligence on people near Duells, people that they're tracking showing up on the campaign trail.
[02:01:04.892 --> 02:01:06.935]  Now, I covered the Donald Trump
[02:01:07.575 --> 02:01:23.557]  Uh, rally in Tampa, and I can tell you the Secret Service was very emphatic that once the candidate comes into the area, the arena or wherever it's being held, the press is in a sort of a walled off area with these fences, metal fences.
[02:01:23.997 --> 02:01:28.621]  And we're not to step out of those, even though we have press passes, we're not to step out of those.
[02:01:28.621 --> 02:01:34.745]  So what happened apparently was this photographer stepped out of that area and there was an altercation.
[02:01:34.745 --> 02:01:41.511]  So, you know, they're trying to say, well, this is a case where, look, Trump is going to beat up on members of the press.
[02:01:41.511 --> 02:01:43.172]  Trump didn't call the shots on that one.
[02:01:43.172 --> 02:01:44.313]  That was the Secret Service.
[02:01:45.053 --> 02:01:50.818]  You basically, even when you're a candidate, you do what the Secret Service tells you to do.
[02:01:50.818 --> 02:01:58.404]  And that's a very important aspect of now all these candidates getting Secret Service protection.
[02:01:58.404 --> 02:02:02.388]  They have to, you know, everybody's got to follow the rules.
[02:02:02.388 --> 02:02:09.494]  But as far as the Antonin Scalia situation, that Cibola Creek Ranch did not
[02:02:10.074 --> 02:02:11.415]  We're good to go.
[02:02:31.095 --> 02:02:40.482]  But it's tied in with all these other secret orders, Catholic secret orders, Knights of Malta type stuff.
[02:02:40.482 --> 02:02:52.890]  And you can see here, this was a figurine statuette that was not too far outside of Scalia's room where he is said to have died of a heart attack.
[02:02:52.890 --> 02:02:55.772]  And this International Order of St.
[02:02:55.772 --> 02:02:56.253]  Hubertus,
[02:02:56.929 --> 02:02:57.509]  We're good to go.
[02:03:17.259 --> 02:03:24.681]  And he was like the head of all these wildlife preservation groups, the Elephant and Endangered Species.
[02:03:24.681 --> 02:03:32.783]  And here the head of that secret society is pictured in front of a dead endangered species, elephant.
[02:03:32.783 --> 02:03:36.504]  So this is what we're dealing with, this St.
[02:03:36.504 --> 02:03:39.905]  Hubertus Society, this get-together, how many
[02:03:41.026 --> 02:03:45.629]  These are run by this guy that owns the ranch, John B. Poindexter.
[02:03:45.629 --> 02:03:46.650]  We don't know.
[02:03:46.650 --> 02:03:52.354]  We know the identities of two other people who were there at the time at this event, at Baby Crib.
[02:03:52.354 --> 02:04:02.622]  I mean, that was so out of place at this particular ranch, which hosts mainly stag events, although my sources told me that
[02:04:03.122 --> 02:04:15.586]  At least one prostitute was sighted at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, not when Scalia was there, but in past gatherings sponsored by this owner, John Koindex.
[02:04:15.586 --> 02:04:22.728]  Wayne, for me, it's the fact that we know Skull & Bones was founded in 1832 out of the Bavarian Illuminati.
[02:04:22.728 --> 02:04:23.869]  That's in the encyclopedia.
[02:04:24.409 --> 02:04:26.311]  And then they found the Bohemian Grove.
[02:04:26.311 --> 02:04:31.557]  It was founded by Mark Twain and others, but it got taken over by 1900 by Taft, a skull and bones, or they kicked them out.
[02:04:31.557 --> 02:04:36.122]  And then this group, it says, founded this, you know, brought this group back to life.
[02:04:36.122 --> 02:04:38.385]  So it sounds like it's a satellite of that.
[02:04:38.385 --> 02:04:39.706]  I mean, you couldn't make this up.
[02:04:40.487 --> 02:04:41.027]  Absolutely.
[02:04:41.027 --> 02:04:42.969]  I'll be following the returns too, yes.
[02:05:02.245 --> 02:05:09.591]  The British government is pushing the Investigory Powers Bill, or Snoopers Charter, that will effectively end internet privacy.
[02:05:09.591 --> 02:05:24.343]  The proposed legislation targets popular chat and message services such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and FaceTime, outlaws end-to-end encryption, and will force Apple to rewrite its iOS from the ground up to accommodate surveillance by the state.
[02:05:24.343 --> 02:05:28.586]  It would also force tech companies to provide back doors accessible to government.
[02:05:28.866 --> 02:05:34.892]  Additionally, the law requires ISPs to keep records of all internet activity of its customers.
[02:05:34.892 --> 02:05:38.355]  The data would be available to the government for a year.
[02:05:38.355 --> 02:05:51.186]  In 2015, the British Home Secretary, Theresa May, admitted that a 1983 telecom act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5, and the agency has done so since September 2001.
[02:05:51.186 --> 02:05:55.130]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:09.714]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:06:09.714 --> 02:06:11.056]  Talk about the effects.
[02:06:11.056 --> 02:06:12.557]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:06:12.557 --> 02:06:14.499]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:06:14.499 --> 02:06:15.600]  I feel like I look better.
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:16.321]  I feel better.
[02:06:16.321 --> 02:06:17.362]  I feel sexier.
[02:06:17.362 --> 02:06:18.343]  I love it.
[02:06:18.343 --> 02:06:21.326]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[02:08:41.135 --> 02:08:45.439]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:45.439 --> 02:08:53.085]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:53.085 --> 02:08:55.286]  Check, check, check your privilege.
[02:08:55.286 --> 02:08:57.208]  Leanne McAdoo here in Austin, Texas.
[02:08:57.208 --> 02:09:00.150]  It's the day after the whitest show on earth.
[02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:04.173]  Oscars so white, I just want to find out what people thought of that lecture fest.
[02:09:04.173 --> 02:09:05.514]  Is the Oscars racist?
[02:09:05.514 --> 02:09:06.695]  And how weird is that?
[02:09:06.695 --> 02:09:08.036]  Because it's all liberals.
[02:09:09.258 --> 02:09:17.506]  Well, I'm here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the White People's Choice Awards.
[02:09:17.506 --> 02:09:20.789]  We're wondering about people's opinion on the Oscars.
[02:09:20.789 --> 02:09:22.850]  The Oscars so white.
[02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:23.951]  Did you tune in?
[02:09:23.951 --> 02:09:24.952]  What do you think about that?
[02:09:24.952 --> 02:09:25.793]  I didn't tune in.
[02:09:25.793 --> 02:09:29.176]  I'm a film major and I didn't tune in and protest for it.
[02:09:30.297 --> 02:09:31.498]  So I don't know what happened at all.
[02:09:31.498 --> 02:09:36.341]  I've been reading articles all day on Facebook, and the results were less than satisfactory.
[02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:37.402]  So of course they were.
[02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:39.423]  That's why I didn't watch them.
[02:09:39.423 --> 02:09:48.389]  I'm not really interested anymore in what goes on, and I'm kind of interested to see where the actors and things of that sort go this year with how they do their movies and their work.
[02:09:48.389 --> 02:09:50.351]  So we'll stay tuned for next year.
[02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:58.216]  And so he also pointed out, you know, this is the 88th year, whereas 71 at least other years there haven't been any other black actors nominated.
[02:09:58.216 --> 02:09:59.216]  So why this year?
[02:10:01.977 --> 02:10:04.758]  I think, you know, why this year is so much controversy?
[02:10:04.758 --> 02:10:06.439]  I think people are just finally upset.
[02:10:06.439 --> 02:10:17.661]  I think with Trayvon Martin and all that stuff resurfacing this year, not just that it just started happening again, but resurfacing in the media this year, I think people are just above all years fed up.
[02:10:17.661 --> 02:10:20.362]  So I think that's where the frustration comes from.
[02:10:20.362 --> 02:10:23.663]  People are finally just like, you know what, this is like ridiculous.
[02:10:23.663 --> 02:10:27.264]  Yeah, I watched the beginning where Chris Rock was like talking.
[02:10:28.304 --> 02:10:30.826]  And what, did you agree with his monologue?
[02:10:30.826 --> 02:10:41.834]  Mmm, I don't feel like we should boycott because, I mean, then we would boycott a lot of things, but I do feel like there hasn't been a lot of black nominees in nearly anything, and I do feel like it should change, I guess.
[02:10:41.834 --> 02:10:43.975]  Maybe I'm kind of saying it because I am black.
[02:10:43.975 --> 02:10:45.356]  But yeah.
[02:10:45.356 --> 02:10:50.040]  You see all these writers and producers and actors?
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:51.461]  They don't hire black people.
[02:10:52.904 --> 02:10:56.807]  And they're the nicest white people on Earth!
[02:10:56.807 --> 02:10:58.628]  They're liberals!
[02:10:58.628 --> 02:10:59.528]  Jeez!
[02:10:59.528 --> 02:11:01.049]  Do you think we should boycott that?
[02:11:01.049 --> 02:11:03.871]  Do you think Hollywood is racist?
[02:11:03.871 --> 02:11:07.274]  Um... No, I don't think Hollywood is racist.
[02:11:07.274 --> 02:11:10.956]  I think that they're just choosing what they think is best.
[02:11:10.956 --> 02:11:12.437]  At least, I hope so.
[02:11:12.437 --> 02:11:13.798]  As far as the films?
[02:11:13.798 --> 02:11:14.979]  As far as the films go, yeah.
[02:11:14.979 --> 02:11:16.780]  I mean, I think it was fine.
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:20.022]  They deserve her, Leonardo DiCaprio.
[02:11:20.022 --> 02:11:22.063]  I'm a big fan, so I think that he deserved it.
[02:11:23.024 --> 02:11:23.545]  Absolutely.
[02:11:23.545 --> 02:11:32.440]  Do you agree, though, with what Chris Rock said when he said, you know, we're here in liberal Hollywood, like, you guys are supposed to be the nice white people.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:34.724]  Why aren't you giving us good roles?
[02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:36.575]  Yeah, I guess that's very true.
[02:11:36.575 --> 02:11:45.063]  I mean, I guess that Hollywood already has kind of predestined roles for black people, I guess, because they feel like black people play the same kind of roles in movies.
[02:11:45.063 --> 02:11:50.208]  But, I don't know, maybe some people will push the boundaries of that.
[02:11:50.208 --> 02:11:52.570]  I'd imagine there's racism everywhere, honestly.
[02:11:52.570 --> 02:11:55.132]  I mean, I don't follow the Oscars that much.
[02:11:55.132 --> 02:11:56.874]  I'm just glad Leo finally got one.
[02:11:56.874 --> 02:11:58.476]  I can say that much.
[02:11:59.296 --> 02:12:09.004]  What do you think about the fact that he used his one Oscar-winning shot to talk to people about climate change, and it seemed to be a very politically motivated event last night.
[02:12:09.004 --> 02:12:10.746]  He's always been that kind of guy, though.
[02:12:10.746 --> 02:12:21.274]  I'm pretty sure he also has his own charity for things like that as well, so it's good to see that at least someone in Hollywood actually cares about what's going on with other people other than their money.
[02:12:21.274 --> 02:12:25.158]  Hollywood is sorority racist.
[02:12:26.616 --> 02:12:33.242]  It's like, we like you, Rhonda, but you're not a Kappa.
[02:12:33.242 --> 02:12:36.224]  Do you think that Hollywood is racist?
[02:12:36.224 --> 02:12:37.666]  Um, yeah.
[02:12:37.666 --> 02:12:37.986]  You do?
[02:12:37.986 --> 02:12:39.007]  Yeah, no, I definitely do.
[02:12:39.007 --> 02:12:43.911]  And I don't think it's just about, like, people not getting nominated.
[02:12:43.911 --> 02:12:47.814]  It's also about there not being opportunities for black people.
[02:12:47.814 --> 02:12:54.000]  There aren't stories given for blacks, I mean, like, from the black narrative and whatnot.
[02:12:55.126 --> 02:12:59.608]  So what about what about Asian actors or like Indian actors?
[02:12:59.608 --> 02:13:06.792]  I mean, clear across the board of any other minority other than, you know, what's the majority, which is white.
[02:13:06.792 --> 02:13:10.213]  I think, I mean, there should be more representation.
[02:13:10.213 --> 02:13:13.595]  First of all, I don't even like Oscars anymore.
[02:13:13.595 --> 02:13:14.955]  I grew up in the old days.
[02:13:14.955 --> 02:13:17.317]  OK, I grew up when it comes to
[02:13:18.692 --> 02:13:20.695]  The romantic era, so to say.
[02:13:20.695 --> 02:13:28.624]  I don't know any of the controversies because first of all, I don't want to give them any power because when we thrust all this
[02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:32.512]  Energy into the negative.
[02:13:32.512 --> 02:13:38.557]  The negative becomes more powerful, more solid, as Alex Jones many times talks about, okay?
[02:13:38.557 --> 02:13:42.240]  So when it comes to them, they're always going to have an agenda.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:42.721]  But you know what?
[02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:43.642]  We're better than that.
[02:13:43.642 --> 02:13:50.087]  Because we stand together as a crowd and if they want to create controversies or whatever, they're going to do it one way or another.
[02:13:54.104 --> 02:14:03.230]  Now we have Patrick Wood joining us, investigative reporter, researcher, about his new book, Technocracy Rising with Trojan Horse of Global Transformation.
[02:14:03.230 --> 02:14:05.071]  This is so key.
[02:14:05.071 --> 02:14:06.091]  But his Skype just drops.
[02:14:06.091 --> 02:14:07.992]  We're going to him in a moment.
[02:14:07.992 --> 02:14:19.860]  Some of the big news that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now is obviously extremely important.
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:23.122]  Media savages Trump over Duke, ignores Hillary.
[02:14:24.144 --> 02:14:28.769]  Praising former KKK member Robert Byrd.
[02:14:28.769 --> 02:14:34.195]  And I just want to tell you, in the next 48 hours we're set to have a very big guest on air dealing with all of this.
[02:14:34.195 --> 02:14:37.878]  I'm just going to leave that as it is and probably in studio.
[02:14:39.011 --> 02:14:51.700]  So you want to watch this feed, whether it's on a local AM and FM station, UHF, VHF cable, whether you download the podcast or listen on the free iPhone or Droid apps and then fullworks.com forward slash show.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:58.964]  But you want to go there and get those free apps, get those links and send those to everybody you know on a routine basis.
[02:14:58.964 --> 02:15:01.446]  That's how we're exploding.
[02:15:01.446 --> 02:15:05.229]  I'm risking my name, my treasure and everything doing this because there's no future if we don't.
[02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:06.189]  So please don't praise me.
[02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:07.910]  But I do want to win.
[02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:08.611]  I am committed.
[02:15:10.171 --> 02:15:14.935]  So that is unfolding as well.
[02:15:14.935 --> 02:15:18.559]  Report Trump supporters in Texas see votes switch to Rubio.
[02:15:18.559 --> 02:15:21.841]  That's been reported by news and TV now.
[02:15:21.841 --> 02:15:33.232]  We've got reports being posted into our article as we speak, beefing it up, adding more research as it develops to the article linked top middle column DrudgeReport.com.
[02:15:34.551 --> 02:15:48.205]  You want to get that out there so people know what they're watching for, and so that people that it happens to don't feel alone, and so we build a momentum to expose fraud ahead of the Ides of March, March 15th event.
[02:15:48.205 --> 02:15:50.688]  Trump has also called on Rubio to drop out.
[02:15:50.688 --> 02:15:55.313]  Little Marco Rubio, let me tell you, he has been a disaster for Florida, Trump said.
[02:15:55.313 --> 02:15:56.714]  That's from ABC.
[02:15:59.591 --> 02:16:11.897]  National Review says Jeff Sessions is a prostitute for endorsing Donald Trump, who is against the TPP, the NAU, and these other sovereignty-destroying situations like open borders.
[02:16:11.897 --> 02:16:13.677]  I mean, there's no country if you don't have that.
[02:16:13.677 --> 02:16:14.578]  That's the globalist plan.
[02:16:17.099 --> 02:16:24.805]  And now National Review, this is one of the most respected, paleo-conservative senators there are, nobody says this guy is anything but honorable.
[02:16:24.805 --> 02:16:31.611]  He even said Donald Trump isn't perfect, disagree with him on some things, but he's right about sovereignty, he's right about borders, he's right about the TPP.
[02:16:31.611 --> 02:16:36.074]  Just exactly what David Knight keeps saying.
[02:16:36.074 --> 02:16:39.477]  And nobody else is out there really doing that.
[02:16:39.477 --> 02:16:41.498]  So, it's a big deal.
[02:16:41.498 --> 02:16:44.421]  Even Newt Gingrich has come out in Politico and said Trump's unstoppable.
[02:16:45.828 --> 02:16:47.570]  Need to get behind him!
[02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:53.956]  All this fraternal fighting, all this infighting, fratricide, is that the word?
[02:16:53.956 --> 02:16:56.218]  It's only going to get Hillary elected.
[02:16:56.218 --> 02:16:59.401]  And look, if you don't like Trump and don't trust him, I'm not mad at you.
[02:16:59.401 --> 02:17:01.944]  Don't be mad at me if I don't support Hillary or Bernie Sanders.
[02:17:03.467 --> 02:17:08.268]  I've done the research, though, and I don't usually put everything on a presidential candidate, and I still don't.
[02:17:08.268 --> 02:17:13.909]  I say get good states elected, get good governors elected, good legislatures, vote with your dollars what you buy.
[02:17:13.909 --> 02:17:17.390]  That's how you change culture.
[02:17:17.390 --> 02:17:19.731]  Now, I wanted to have this guest on.
[02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:25.932]  Nico asked me a few days ago, he said, you still want to have Patrick Wood on with all this huge election news?
[02:17:25.932 --> 02:17:30.653]  We're making national news every hour or so, just with what we're doing here, in the info war, what you're doing.
[02:17:31.770 --> 02:17:33.211]  You're the real power of this operation.
[02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:34.592]  He said, you wanna move it next week or something?
[02:17:34.592 --> 02:17:36.654]  And I said, no.
[02:17:36.654 --> 02:17:39.777]  Technocracy is the most important issue.
[02:17:39.777 --> 02:17:42.359]  And people need to understand why we shouldn't be fighting with each other.
[02:17:42.359 --> 02:17:48.504]  We need to understand what we're facing as a culture, what we're facing as a society.
[02:17:48.504 --> 02:17:50.506]  And that it needs to happen sooner rather than later.
[02:17:50.506 --> 02:17:55.610]  And understand there is a global government of technocrats that have formed a plan and they're integrating it.
[02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:58.393]  We're already probably 70% into this radical transformation.
[02:17:59.611 --> 02:18:07.599]  And it's designed to end human individualism, where humans can actually be sustainable.
[02:18:07.599 --> 02:18:10.542]  So it's the opposite of sustainability, they call it sustainability.
[02:18:10.542 --> 02:18:14.586]  And it's all been announced by the Davos and the Bilderberg and the Club of Rome, what they're bringing in.
[02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:15.607]  So I really appreciate
[02:18:16.877 --> 02:18:19.399]  Mr. Wood, Patrick M. Wood, for coming on with us.
[02:18:19.399 --> 02:18:20.400]  This is election time.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:23.423]  I've been cutting back on skipping breaks, but I am skipping this one.
[02:18:23.423 --> 02:18:28.107]  Technocracy Rising, the Trojan Horse of Global Transformation, Patrick M. Wood.
[02:18:28.107 --> 02:18:29.648]  I told him when I read the book, I want to carry it.
[02:18:29.648 --> 02:18:31.790]  I don't even know if we're carrying it in full or store.
[02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:32.450]  Doesn't matter.
[02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:34.312]  Just get the book.
[02:18:34.312 --> 02:18:35.813]  Aren't we carrying it?
[02:18:35.813 --> 02:18:39.136]  The Dark Horse of the New World Order is not Communism, Socialism, or Fascism.
[02:18:39.136 --> 02:18:42.139]  When I have a special guest in studio, I think I'm going to read this to him.
[02:18:42.139 --> 02:18:43.320]  It is technocracy.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.140]  Yes.
[02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:44.361]  Yes.
[02:18:45.649 --> 02:18:53.893]  Started in the 30s, it's really eugenics from 1855, and reintroduced by the Toronto Commission in 73 as the New International Economic Order.
[02:18:53.893 --> 02:18:57.315]  That's in the Technotronic Era by Brzezinski, co-founder of the Toronto Commission.
[02:18:57.315 --> 02:19:01.137]  It is now known by names like Sustainable Development and Green Economy.
[02:19:01.137 --> 02:19:01.917]  And he goes over it.
[02:19:01.917 --> 02:19:04.338]  Folks, this is what agenda 21 is.
[02:19:07.459 --> 02:19:10.140]  One Swiss Army Knife Blade of.
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:14.882]  This book, I read it in two days, and quite frankly, I knew everything in it.
[02:19:14.882 --> 02:19:15.963]  But almost no one else does.
[02:19:15.963 --> 02:19:16.863]  That's what's so frustrating.
[02:19:16.863 --> 02:19:21.585]  It's super accurate, it ties it all together, it's 100% true, from my research.
[02:19:21.585 --> 02:19:29.329]  And what's scary is, in-game, it's one of the only other things out there, it's free online, three hour long film, buy the DVD at Infowarsstore.com, that breaks this down.
[02:19:29.329 --> 02:19:31.030]  The book does it in even more detail.
[02:19:31.932 --> 02:19:32.733]  And it's updated.
[02:19:32.733 --> 02:19:34.053]  I made the endgame 8 years ago.
[02:19:34.053 --> 02:19:35.674]  So I want to carry this book if we're not carrying it.
[02:19:35.674 --> 02:19:36.815]  That's a message to my crew.
[02:19:36.815 --> 02:19:38.676]  Because we do most of the stuff just on air.
[02:19:38.676 --> 02:19:40.818]  Most of the planning's on air.
[02:19:40.818 --> 02:19:47.602]  And pair it with technocracy because you know the iPhones and iPads Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids use them.
[02:19:47.602 --> 02:19:48.883]  They were brain-damaging everybody.
[02:19:48.883 --> 02:19:50.544]  They know that.
[02:19:50.544 --> 02:19:57.749]  We know they've already put modems in troops' brains 20 years ago and have cross-human animal chimeras 30 years ago and now they announced it last week.
[02:19:59.608 --> 02:20:00.689]  It's in the medical papers.
[02:20:00.689 --> 02:20:03.810]  It's in the MIT stuff for the academics, PhDs.
[02:20:03.810 --> 02:20:07.812]  But the general public doesn't know there's a whole breakaway civilization.
[02:20:07.812 --> 02:20:13.955]  What I know about is 30 years old and most people can't even believe it when I tell them.
[02:20:13.955 --> 02:20:15.696]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[02:20:15.696 --> 02:20:21.798]  We are in a science fiction movie and it's run by technocrats who are eugenicists or social Darwinists.
[02:20:21.798 --> 02:20:28.642]  And you better find out what those terms are because you can forget... That's why I don't want to fight with David Duke or Louis Farrakhan.
[02:20:29.676 --> 02:20:31.017]  And let George Soros stir us up.
[02:20:31.017 --> 02:20:31.718]  He's a technocrat.
[02:20:31.718 --> 02:20:33.039]  He plays everybody off against each other.
[02:20:33.039 --> 02:20:34.660]  He's totally cold-blooded.
[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:35.761]  He was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:20:35.761 --> 02:20:36.842]  Now he's a socialist.
[02:20:36.842 --> 02:20:37.623]  He's really a billionaire.
[02:20:37.623 --> 02:20:39.364]  He destroys countries.
[02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:41.206]  They're devils.
[02:20:41.206 --> 02:20:43.528]  And I know it's fun to be tribal and fight with each other.
[02:20:43.528 --> 02:20:44.088]  It feels good.
[02:20:44.088 --> 02:20:45.910]  We're designed to do it.
[02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:52.935]  But the big invisible takeover, or almost invisible takeover, is coming for everybody.
[02:20:52.935 --> 02:20:55.377]  So that's my message, and that's what I'm trying to get across to people.
[02:20:56.946 --> 02:21:01.651]  I'm going to stop now and go to our guest.
[02:21:01.651 --> 02:21:02.512]  Amazing book.
[02:21:02.512 --> 02:21:03.833]  We've got to get Patrick Wood on.
[02:21:03.833 --> 02:21:06.056]  He's only been on a few times and I always say, why is he on more?
[02:21:06.056 --> 02:21:09.679]  I need to remember this because he's such a great brain.
[02:21:09.679 --> 02:21:13.924]  He's an author and lecturer who has studied elite globalization policy since the late 70s when he
[02:21:16.069 --> 02:21:24.232]  ...partnered with the late Anthony C. Sutton, that was the top congressional investigator that had the church committees and all of it, to co-author Trilaterals Over Washington Volume 1 and 2.
[02:21:24.232 --> 02:21:31.795]  He remains a leading expert on the elite Trilateral Commission, their policies and achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic order.
[02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:42.352]  An economist by education, a finance analyst, and a writer by profession, and an American constitutional by choice, Wood has deep historical insights on the modern attacks on sovereignty.
[02:21:42.352 --> 02:21:46.556]  I'm going to stop right there, but he joins us right now.
[02:21:46.556 --> 02:21:51.821]  And so much of what we know about today is from him and Anthony Sutton, and of course Charlotte Isserby that leaked him the information.
[02:21:52.581 --> 02:21:56.223]  So it's great to have him here with us today on the same day we had Phyllis Schlafly on.
[02:21:56.223 --> 02:21:59.145]  Mr. Wood, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:21:59.145 --> 02:22:00.925]  We've got nine minutes or eight minutes to break.
[02:22:00.925 --> 02:22:07.429]  You've got the floor to start with what's currently happening or where it began or why technocracy is so important.
[02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:11.671]  I mean, how do we raise the alarm for people out there that it's game over?
[02:22:11.671 --> 02:22:15.813]  You know, you want to say it's the Vatican or the Jews or the whatever's that run everything and all this stuff.
[02:22:15.813 --> 02:22:21.336]  It's the technocrats and they've got a religion and it means we're dead in the end, sir.
[02:22:22.418 --> 02:22:26.301]  Well, there's two things at play here, Alex, and thank you for having me on.
[02:22:26.301 --> 02:22:27.122]  I do appreciate it.
[02:22:27.122 --> 02:22:28.263]  Thank you, sir.
[02:22:28.263 --> 02:22:35.448]  You know, the Constitution, which was written by, of course, the founding fathers of our country, was a system.
[02:22:35.448 --> 02:22:51.381]  We need to look at it as a system, because all of the writers are dead now, but the system lived on, and it was a great system of checks and balances that would corral society into something that would be good for the people in the long run.
[02:22:51.621 --> 02:22:54.662]  And we can understand that, I think, in pretty simple terms.
[02:22:54.662 --> 02:23:00.305]  What's happening today is that another system is being created.
[02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:03.106]  That is the system of technocracy.
[02:23:03.106 --> 02:23:11.711]  The people who are bringing it to us are, indeed, as you exclaim, the technocrats, or technocrats in general.
[02:23:11.711 --> 02:23:20.295]  And it's hard to get a head around this, but the system is not primarily politically driven.
[02:23:21.286 --> 02:23:22.987]  It's driven by economics.
[02:23:22.987 --> 02:23:26.810]  I think this is one reason it's missed everybody's radar.
[02:23:26.810 --> 02:23:28.251]  Economics is boring.
[02:23:28.251 --> 02:23:34.095]  You know, you think of Ben Stein, you know, like, well, you know, just boring stuff like that.
[02:23:34.095 --> 02:23:38.779]  People just, or Alan Greenspan, people just don't respond to economics.
[02:23:38.779 --> 02:23:40.860]  But this has been an economic coup.
[02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:53.929]  Of global proportions and all of the things we're talking about, green economy, sustainable development, those sorts of things that are being pushed by the United Nations today, are all economic terms.
[02:23:53.929 --> 02:24:03.196]  The fact that you have to have some system controlling it or some layer of governance, not government, but governance controlling it,
[02:24:04.436 --> 02:24:10.700]  It's almost incidental to the fact that it's a new economic system being put into place.
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:11.261]  That's key.
[02:24:11.261 --> 02:24:17.905]  They're forcing us into a total new system that's artificial, that they control the inputs of.
[02:24:17.905 --> 02:24:20.467]  That is full-spectrum dominance in the Pentagon's own words.
[02:24:21.269 --> 02:24:22.230]  It really is.
[02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:34.100]  And if we go back to the 1930s and let technocrats speak for themselves, here's how the Technocrat magazine defined technocracy in 1938.
[02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:37.562]  That was four years after its founding in New York City.
[02:24:38.283 --> 02:24:39.504]  This is the direct quote.
[02:24:39.504 --> 02:24:39.785]  It said,
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.402]  That's it, in a nutshell.
[02:24:57.402 --> 02:25:01.827]  That's what they wanted to do done, and that's exactly what's happening now.
[02:25:01.827 --> 02:25:09.415]  And as we read things like the 2030 Agenda document that was released last, well at the beginning of winter of last year.
[02:25:09.415 --> 02:25:11.418]  And that's a 2.0 upgrade for the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Global Goals, Agenda 21.
[02:25:17.403 --> 02:25:18.444]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:18.444 --> 02:25:23.248]  As you look at that document, you see all of the utopian promises.
[02:25:23.248 --> 02:25:26.530]  You see, we're going to end poverty everywhere.
[02:25:26.530 --> 02:25:30.593]  We're going to provide jobs with dignity for everyone.
[02:25:30.593 --> 02:25:36.238]  We're going to have lifelong learning opportunities and all the wonderful stuff.
[02:25:36.238 --> 02:25:38.780]  But if you go down into the fine print,
[02:25:39.756 --> 02:25:43.458]  And look at what they actually want to do.
[02:25:43.458 --> 02:25:49.502]  The cost of that, according to the United Nations, it's their document, not mine, not yours.
[02:25:49.502 --> 02:25:59.327]  You get down on the fine print, and all we have to do is turn over 100% of the means of production and consumption.
[02:25:59.327 --> 02:26:00.368]  That's all.
[02:26:00.368 --> 02:26:01.248]  That's all they ask for.
[02:26:01.248 --> 02:26:03.910]  And look, computers programmed by the elite, the technocrats.
[02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:15.046]  In other words, program our entire lives, the end of free will, just like the Soviets advertised in Russia, but also in China in the 30s, 40s, 50s.
[02:26:15.046 --> 02:26:18.471]  Heavenly spaceships, living forever, not having to work.
[02:26:18.471 --> 02:26:19.412]  Of course, that didn't really happen.
[02:26:20.839 --> 02:26:23.381]  Well, none of it has ever worked.
[02:26:23.381 --> 02:26:26.943]  You know, the dream of Utopia has just been a myth.
[02:26:26.943 --> 02:26:31.466]  I don't know why anybody would even entertain it today, except they still want a free lunch.
[02:26:31.466 --> 02:26:35.789]  And, you know, my mama told me early on, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
[02:26:35.789 --> 02:26:38.251]  Yours probably did, too.
[02:26:38.251 --> 02:26:42.414]  But people are still grasping at this stuff by the billions around the world.
[02:26:42.414 --> 02:26:44.495]  They think it's the greatest thing that ever happened to them.
[02:26:46.817 --> 02:26:52.823]  They're going to get a shock as they feel the manacle tighten around their neck.
[02:26:52.823 --> 02:26:56.407]  Obama said you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:26:57.802 --> 02:27:04.887]  Well, you know, whatever is prescribed by science, quote-unquote, will be what's dictated.
[02:27:04.887 --> 02:27:09.890]  And science is, of course, the great god at this point for these people.
[02:27:09.890 --> 02:27:13.292]  Because if science says something is true, well, it must be true.
[02:27:13.292 --> 02:27:15.854]  You know, Al Gore told us that time and time again.
[02:27:15.854 --> 02:27:16.915]  Now, the science is settled.
[02:27:17.555 --> 02:27:18.816]  And you just need to believe me.
[02:27:18.816 --> 02:27:20.818]  And if you don't believe me, you're a denier.
[02:27:20.818 --> 02:27:23.259]  And if you're a denier, you deserve to be punished.
[02:27:23.259 --> 02:27:23.620]  Sure.
[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:27.383]  And of course, the Grand Poobah of these guys is Galton.
[02:27:27.383 --> 02:27:32.406]  And then by 1900, things to come with, of course, H.G.
[02:27:32.406 --> 02:27:36.770]  Wells, head of the Fabian Society, who literally talks about
[02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:44.436]  World government bombers going and nuking everyone, Bertrand Russell called for this, who didn't submit to planetary government.
[02:27:44.436 --> 02:27:46.958]  When they attack you and conquer you though, it's for peace.
[02:27:46.958 --> 02:27:54.224]  And then they basically end the family, raise everybody in incubators like Brave New World, which Huxley admitted was actually real science they were planning.
[02:27:54.224 --> 02:28:00.009]  And then the elite literally, the dream of Plato, is realized that the state raises us like animals.
[02:28:01.573 --> 02:28:02.995]  That, honestly, that's it.
[02:28:02.995 --> 02:28:07.361]  And the definition I read earlier of technocracy is exactly that.
[02:28:07.361 --> 02:28:08.963]  The science of social engineering.
[02:28:08.963 --> 02:28:10.225]  Well, what's social engineering?
[02:28:10.225 --> 02:28:14.891]  It means that somebody else is going to tell you what you can and cannot do.
[02:28:14.891 --> 02:28:16.253]  That's social engineering.
[02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:28.561]  And doing it as a science project, using the scientific method and using systems theory and stuff like that, you know, that puts you in a straitjacket because there's no compassion in science.
[02:28:28.561 --> 02:28:29.842]  There's no compassion.
[02:28:29.842 --> 02:28:30.762]  There's no feeling.
[02:28:30.762 --> 02:28:38.687]  But then they're not even honest with the public that they're establishing a total world government with Trojan horse surveillance and everything and total control.
[02:28:38.687 --> 02:28:40.828]  And then we see what the technocracy is doing.
[02:28:40.828 --> 02:28:41.969]  It's making us poor.
[02:28:41.969 --> 02:28:43.269]  It's making us dumb.
[02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:44.590]  It's dehumanizing us.
[02:28:44.590 --> 02:28:45.971]  Boy, this is not a good road to go down.
[02:28:47.031 --> 02:28:49.252]  Well, it isn't, no.
[02:28:49.252 --> 02:28:54.554]  That's why we're screaming bloody murder out here in Arizona right now over this.
[02:28:54.554 --> 02:29:12.443]  We have literally declared war on technocracy as an ideology, and the people that are promoting technocracy around the world, and by the way, in virtually every community in America today, there's some amount of Agenda 21 and sustainable development being applied in local communities.
[02:29:13.403 --> 02:29:15.505]  Which also picks winners and losers.
[02:29:15.505 --> 02:29:19.389]  What it really is is a high-tech form of feudalism in their own words, as you know.
[02:29:19.389 --> 02:29:19.889]  It is.
[02:29:19.889 --> 02:29:29.478]  And so, you know, people have an opportunity to rise up in their own locales, in their own towns and cities and whatever, and take these people to task.
[02:29:29.478 --> 02:29:32.201]  Anywhere you find this ideology, slap it.
[02:29:32.201 --> 02:29:33.642]  Slap it down.
[02:29:33.642 --> 02:29:35.985]  And, you know, you can get rid of politicians.
[02:29:36.605 --> 02:29:37.406]  What?
[02:29:37.406 --> 02:29:39.088]  Technocrats are not politicians.
[02:29:39.088 --> 02:29:39.648]  They hate politicians.
[02:29:39.648 --> 02:29:42.091]  Let's talk about how they've dug in and how we dig them out.
[02:29:42.091 --> 02:29:46.075]  Because they play games in the New York Times like saying, there is no Agenda 21.
[02:29:46.075 --> 02:29:46.595]  There isn't.
[02:29:46.595 --> 02:29:47.416]  It doesn't exist.
[02:29:47.416 --> 02:29:48.117]  None of this is real.
[02:29:48.117 --> 02:29:49.699]  But that game doesn't work anymore.
[02:29:49.699 --> 02:29:51.360]  Augustforecast.com.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:53.883]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.883 --> 02:29:56.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.615 --> 02:30:16.442]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[02:30:16.442 --> 02:30:28.967]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[02:30:29.127 --> 02:30:29.948]  We're good to go.
[02:30:45.763 --> 02:30:50.226]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died.
[02:30:50.226 --> 02:30:56.430]  The statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[02:30:56.430 --> 02:31:00.012]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[02:31:01.770 --> 02:31:05.553]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:31:05.553 --> 02:31:13.278]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:13.278 --> 02:31:21.884]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:31:21.884 --> 02:31:26.306]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:26.306 --> 02:31:31.610]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:33.010]  We're good to go.
[02:32:00.197 --> 02:32:03.718]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:03.718 --> 02:32:11.959]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:11.959 --> 02:32:17.381]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:17.381 --> 02:32:19.901]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:19.901 --> 02:32:22.002]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:32:31.049 --> 02:32:32.790]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:36.850]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[02:32:36.850 --> 02:32:41.651]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:32:41.651 --> 02:32:48.753]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[02:33:10.646 --> 02:33:17.433]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:17.433 --> 02:33:19.194]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.410 --> 02:33:40.991]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:33:40.991 --> 02:33:44.332]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[02:33:44.332 --> 02:34:02.417]  Our guest is with us another 15 minutes, and then I'm going to get into the economic news, political news I haven't covered yet, but I really want to get Mr. Wood here in studio sometime, or to make a documentary around his book, Technocracy Rising, the Trojan Horse of Global Transformation.
[02:34:02.417 --> 02:34:05.478]  What's crazy, he has hundreds of quotes, their own documents, their statements,
[02:34:06.854 --> 02:34:10.257]  Which I've seen before and read, some of them I hadn't seen, so I guess I did learn a lot from it.
[02:34:10.257 --> 02:34:18.806]  The point is, I know this book to be true, from their own words, and you can find it at Augustforecast.com or Amazon, you name it.
[02:34:18.806 --> 02:34:21.509]  But, they're building a world
[02:34:23.035 --> 02:34:34.828]  That dominates us, and totally controls us, and now when they appoint presidents and prime ministers in Europe, Goldman Sachs does, at the top of the technocratic pyramid, they just say, oh it's scientific!
[02:34:34.828 --> 02:34:38.292]  That's like the UN-supported, New York Times-supported Zeitgeist Movement.
[02:34:38.292 --> 02:34:41.236]  A computer decides when you eat, what you do, and where you live!
[02:34:42.267 --> 02:34:49.671]  And then they're teaching British school kids in their megapolis cartoons that we decide where you work, what you do, and you get meat one day a year.
[02:34:49.671 --> 02:34:53.813]  But the elite, though, they're all allowed to be rich and powerful and fry around on jumbo jets.
[02:34:53.813 --> 02:34:56.234]  So it is an Elysium system.
[02:34:56.234 --> 02:34:57.135]  And it must be resisted.
[02:34:58.476 --> 02:35:14.744]  Before I go any further, I want to just remind listeners that we ran the biggest sale in our history through the weekend until yesterday and was the most successful ever in gross sales, but not so much even in profit because things were discounted so much, but it still helped us fund the operation.
[02:35:14.744 --> 02:35:23.349]  A bunch of the items, books, videos, t-shirts, nutraceuticals, sold out, like Super Female Vitality and other things.
[02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:27.791]  But a lot of the items are still there, and so we're now calling it the Super Tuesday Sale.
[02:35:28.783 --> 02:35:36.550]  Now, everything still in stock is discounted, with the biggest sales numbers ever.
[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:38.472]  It's just that not everything is still available.
[02:35:38.472 --> 02:35:45.739]  But the non-GMO, high-quality, storable foods, discounted 30% and free shipping, on orders of $50, unprecedented.
[02:35:45.739 --> 02:35:48.702]  We have the nootropic rainforest.
[02:35:48.702 --> 02:35:53.707]  We have AnthroPlex, which works synergistically with super mineral, super phenyl vitality.
[02:35:54.207 --> 02:35:57.148]  To get your hormones in balance according to the research.
[02:35:57.148 --> 02:35:58.529]  Simply incredible.
[02:35:58.529 --> 02:35:59.729]  Grave reviews.
[02:35:59.729 --> 02:36:01.570]  And a whole bunch of other great items.
[02:36:01.570 --> 02:36:06.072]  Liver Shield, the Liver Cleanse, Bell Butter Cleanse, and the Oxy Powder is back in stock.
[02:36:06.072 --> 02:36:06.792]  And so much more.
[02:36:06.792 --> 02:36:09.413]  But Anthroplex is now back in.
[02:36:09.413 --> 02:36:12.794]  Infowarslife.com to find the nutraceuticals.
[02:36:12.794 --> 02:36:15.976]  But for the whole Umbrella Store, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:17.236 --> 02:36:20.600]  And again, that special will end because we're going to sell out.
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:21.822]  It's like 12 or 13 things.
[02:36:21.822 --> 02:36:23.284]  It was 10 things last hour.
[02:36:23.284 --> 02:36:24.646]  It was 12 or 13 things that were sold.
[02:36:24.646 --> 02:36:27.750]  That'll be 20 or 30 items, best-selling items, that are sold out by tomorrow.
[02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:33.357]  And I've just got to keep some stuff back for people that are signed up for auto ship because that can never sell out.
[02:36:33.777 --> 02:36:49.524]  We have to hold back enough so anytime you sign up for AutoShip, something that's sold out will still be available because we keep a little surplus in there and you get 10% off as well when you sign up for AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:49.524 --> 02:36:58.428]  You can find all the great vitamins and minerals and supplements and nutraceuticals as well that we don't produce but are also very high quality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:00.103 --> 02:37:05.987]  Health.com, and that's the longevity products, are InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:37:05.987 --> 02:37:11.730]  But we are InfoWarsLife.com, and of course, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:11.730 --> 02:37:14.892]  The joint formula's back in stock.
[02:37:14.892 --> 02:37:17.014]  Secret 12, I'm told, is sold out.
[02:37:17.014 --> 02:37:19.175]  Just a lot of stuff is selling out as we speak.
[02:37:19.175 --> 02:37:25.399]  Whether it's a Hillary for Prison t-shirt, or a big old group of non-GMO seeds at the highest quality, lowest price.
[02:37:26.019 --> 02:37:26.699]  It's fantastic.
[02:37:26.699 --> 02:37:36.982]  You see, technocracy is about every plant, every seed, every animal being engineered where it couldn't naturally reproduce and live without the computerized technocracy.
[02:37:36.982 --> 02:37:40.403]  So it's a computerized takeover of reality and creation.
[02:37:40.403 --> 02:37:42.004]  It's an elite playing God.
[02:37:42.004 --> 02:37:44.284]  Boy, it sounds like something out of Revelations.
[02:37:44.284 --> 02:37:46.185]  All right, you've got the floor for the next 10 minutes.
[02:37:46.185 --> 02:37:47.625]  I'm not going to interrupt.
[02:37:47.625 --> 02:37:49.346]  Patrick M. Wood has put out the
[02:37:50.518 --> 02:37:55.024]  Masterwork, technocracy rising that everyone should get.
[02:37:55.024 --> 02:37:56.226]  We're not even selling it yet.
[02:37:56.226 --> 02:37:59.971]  You really should get it to understand what you and your family and all of us are up against.
[02:37:59.971 --> 02:38:03.776]  So how to identify it, how to stop it, what it is, what its endgame is.
[02:38:03.776 --> 02:38:05.058]  Patrick M. Wood, you've got the floor.
[02:38:05.768 --> 02:38:11.910]  We'll take care of that, Alex, and I do hope you will interact as well.
[02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:20.312]  I want to stress the importance, I know you've covered a lot of other stuff over time on your program, but I want to stress the economic aspect of this again.
[02:38:20.312 --> 02:38:23.633]  The reason is, is that America is founded
[02:38:25.154 --> 02:38:34.399]  Well, America was made great based on its economic model of private property, free enterprise, and then later what we now call capitalism.
[02:38:34.399 --> 02:38:35.980]  And yes, it has problems.
[02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:37.000]  Everybody knows it does.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.823]  There's excesses, there's collusion, there's corruption.
[02:38:40.823 --> 02:38:42.063]  Those things are not right.
[02:38:42.063 --> 02:38:44.605]  They need to be, you know, ridden out of the system.
[02:38:46.118 --> 02:38:52.800]  If it were not for our economic system since the founding of our country, we would not be where we are today.
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:54.760]  You would not have a studio.
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.181]  You would not have a store online.
[02:38:57.181 --> 02:39:02.462]  I would not have a house to live in, probably, nor maybe not even have the money to live in a house.
[02:39:02.462 --> 02:39:12.785]  I'd probably be farming somewhere, you know, on somebody's back 40, where you say, you can have these three acres to do something, but you got to give me 90% of whatever you produce.
[02:39:12.785 --> 02:39:13.966]  That's called the Dark Ages.
[02:39:13.966 --> 02:39:14.746]  That's where we're headed.
[02:39:15.755 --> 02:39:21.319]  So technology's not bad, but they've hijacked it and are building it to create a new feudalism, as you were just saying.
[02:39:21.319 --> 02:39:22.300]  That's exactly right.
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:23.941]  I am not anti-technology.
[02:39:23.941 --> 02:39:25.022]  I love technology.
[02:39:25.022 --> 02:39:29.626]  I made my living off of technology for an entire career.
[02:39:29.626 --> 02:39:34.689]  So I am not, and I'm not anti-scientist, and I'm not anti-engineer.
[02:39:34.689 --> 02:39:40.314]  There are many good scientists and good engineers who were not bought into this idea of controlling the world.
[02:39:40.774 --> 02:39:43.177]  In other words, they don't want to be social engineers.
[02:39:43.177 --> 02:39:48.303]  If they're physicists, they want to be physicists, and they do good work.
[02:39:48.303 --> 02:39:59.096]  But these technocrats, they get this idea in their head that they're somehow better than everybody else, and their science is somehow the gospel truth that everybody needs to obey.
[02:39:59.096 --> 02:39:59.797]  This is nuts!
[02:40:00.478 --> 02:40:14.406]  But listen, last year, Christiana Figueres, who's stepping down, by the way, as the head of climate change at the United Nations, she said this last year at a press conference.
[02:40:14.406 --> 02:40:15.687]  Get this, guys.
[02:40:16.667 --> 02:40:35.332]  Quote, this is the first time in the history of mankind that we're setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years since the Industrial Revolution.
[02:40:36.212 --> 02:40:37.312]  Let that sink in.
[02:40:37.312 --> 02:40:39.853]  You don't need to read between the lines.
[02:40:39.853 --> 02:40:58.438]  She went on to say, and she understands the issue here, she went on to say, quote, this is probably the most difficult task we've ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.
[02:40:58.438 --> 02:41:00.939]  This is huge.
[02:41:00.939 --> 02:41:02.419]  Absolutely huge.
[02:41:05.174 --> 02:41:26.938]  And people need to understand that these technocrats, if you will, are intending to completely take over the economic system and replace it with something that has never been tried, never been proven, never been analyzed by anybody with the same mind, and this is what they intend to do with us.
[02:41:29.997 --> 02:41:30.818]  Please continue.
[02:41:30.818 --> 02:41:35.221]  Your Skype's frozen but your audio's coming across great, Patrick, because this is their own admissions.
[02:41:35.221 --> 02:41:36.322]  Your book is just full of it.
[02:41:36.322 --> 02:41:39.063]  What's crazy is they admit all this so nakedly.
[02:41:39.063 --> 02:41:45.108]  When I've talked to some of these elitists, on and off air, they go, well, see, the public's too dumb to even care.
[02:41:45.108 --> 02:41:46.969]  They deserve to be overwritten, phased out.
[02:41:46.969 --> 02:41:48.270]  We're merging with machines.
[02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:48.951]  We're gods.
[02:41:48.951 --> 02:41:49.691]  You won't stop us.
[02:41:49.691 --> 02:41:50.492]  You know, Ray Kurzweil.
[02:41:51.331 --> 02:41:53.475]  And you just sit here and look at it.
[02:41:53.475 --> 02:41:55.779]  It's so selfish, their attitude.
[02:41:55.779 --> 02:42:00.066]  But then they sell collectivism to get standardization and control.
[02:42:00.066 --> 02:42:02.671]  I mean, this really is the final trap for humanity.
[02:42:02.671 --> 02:42:03.673]  We've got to escape this.
[02:42:03.673 --> 02:42:04.213]  Please continue.
[02:42:05.148 --> 02:42:15.672]  Well, I like to use the catchphrase that the inmates have taken over the asylum.
[02:42:15.672 --> 02:42:19.854]  And in a very real way, these people look normal.
[02:42:19.854 --> 02:42:21.834]  They wear suits and ties, many of them.
[02:42:21.834 --> 02:42:25.956]  Some of them wear flip-flops and jeans in the tech industry.
[02:42:25.956 --> 02:42:28.077]  But these people
[02:42:29.002 --> 02:42:36.128]  Look normal on the outside, but on the inside, Alex, their brains are just fried.
[02:42:36.128 --> 02:42:40.832]  And they come up with this cockeyed stuff, and nobody questions it.
[02:42:40.832 --> 02:42:48.599]  You know, it's full of logical disconnects, it's full of holes, and yet nobody challenges these people, you know, amongst their peers.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:55.826]  It's like incredible to me that people don't see through this as the biggest scam in human history.
[02:42:55.826 --> 02:43:12.461]  And what's being offered to the world by the United Nations now, sustainable development and the green economy, if you will, all of this plan originally came from policies set by the Trilateral Commission back in the 1970s and 80s.
[02:43:12.461 --> 02:43:13.142]  This is incredible.
[02:43:16.152 --> 02:43:18.174]  You can look at the book, Our Common Future.
[02:43:18.174 --> 02:43:20.576]  I don't have the video up, so I guess I can't show that.
[02:43:20.576 --> 02:43:30.845]  But Our Common Future was written by a lady by the name of, or at least architected by a lady by the name of Gro Bruntland, who chaired the Bruntland Commission in the 1980s.
[02:43:30.845 --> 02:43:31.465]  It terminated in 1987.
[02:43:31.465 --> 02:43:33.987]  This book was the book that set the tone for Agenda 21 in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.
[02:43:43.735 --> 02:43:49.059]  This book was architected by Gro Bruntland, who was a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:43:49.059 --> 02:43:50.820]  She was a head of the committee.
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:52.241]  She steered the whole committee.
[02:43:52.241 --> 02:43:53.662]  She steered the book.
[02:43:53.662 --> 02:44:02.368]  And Our Common Future is acknowledged as the singular book that made Agenda 21 possible in 1992.
[02:44:02.368 --> 02:44:03.249]  And here we are today.
[02:44:03.249 --> 02:44:03.929]  We have it today.
[02:44:04.955 --> 02:44:10.218]  So, you know, we look at these policies over time in history, we say we know exactly where they came from.
[02:44:10.218 --> 02:44:14.400]  There's no doubt, not one shred of doubt, where these policies came from.
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:17.061]  And there's not one shred of doubt as to what they're doing today.
[02:44:17.061 --> 02:44:23.404]  They're trying to take over the entire means of production and consumption on a global basis.
[02:44:23.404 --> 02:44:23.985]  That's it.
[02:44:25.264 --> 02:44:29.868]  Everything they're doing meets the original requirements of technocracy that were written down in 1934.
[02:44:29.868 --> 02:44:32.870]  That's incredible to think, but it does.
[02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:51.185]  All the total awareness society, all the stuff about Smart Grid, all the stuff about Common Core, all the stuff about land use and abuse around our country and around the world, all of these things are tied directly to technocracy and the implementation of technocracy.
[02:44:51.485 --> 02:45:02.069]  That's right, and all the tribalism, the British played folks off in India and China and the Americas, I'm not bashing the British, they just used divide and conquer like Rome did.
[02:45:02.069 --> 02:45:17.634]  All of that now is a sideshow to the fact that our food, our water, our culture, everything is being Trojan horse, we are being engineered, we are being manipulated through GMO, they admit it's getting into our DNA, we are mutating in a bad way, our IQs are dropping.
[02:45:17.634 --> 02:45:20.135]  We are in the beginning stages, the beginning clutches.
[02:45:21.604 --> 02:45:25.548]  of a technological woodchipper.
[02:45:25.548 --> 02:45:27.470]  And we just lost the Skype with our guest.
[02:45:27.470 --> 02:45:29.232]  I'm trying to get him back and say bye to him.
[02:45:29.232 --> 02:45:31.054]  We'll reconnect right now.
[02:45:31.054 --> 02:45:33.577]  Oh, his Skype did just come back.
[02:45:33.577 --> 02:45:37.501]  The book, Technocracy Rising, the Trojan Horse of Global Transformation.
[02:45:37.501 --> 02:45:40.725]  We're going to buy a bunch of your books, sir, and carry them at Infowarstore.com.
[02:45:40.725 --> 02:45:43.508]  Where's the best place for people to find Technocracy Rising?
[02:45:44.349 --> 02:45:48.312]  Well, technocracy.news is my current website.
[02:45:48.312 --> 02:45:54.196]  All of my previous websites are now wrapped into one single website, technocracy.news.
[02:45:54.196 --> 02:45:57.619]  Do you decide to go all out against this?
[02:45:57.619 --> 02:45:58.039]  I am.
[02:45:58.039 --> 02:46:03.664]  I've dropped the love of my life, if you will, with economic forecasting and market forecasting.
[02:46:03.664 --> 02:46:08.127]  And I'm diving into this, Alex, because there is nothing more important than this.
[02:46:08.127 --> 02:46:08.968]  This is the big one.
[02:46:09.568 --> 02:46:11.650]  If we miss this, we've missed everything.
[02:46:11.650 --> 02:46:15.073]  Well, I know that you and Sutton pioneered exposing the enemy's Operation Boss.
[02:46:15.073 --> 02:46:24.000]  They wrote books admitting it in the 70s and kind of launched this new term from the 30s on the backs of previous social Darwinism and feudalist models with a high-tech overlay.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:38.972]  But I hope that in your research and experience, our work here at InfoWars with our listeners and everybody has helped you reach more of the public and has helped raise awareness because I could not concur enough that this is undoubtedly, in their own words, the global takeover program and system
[02:46:40.267 --> 02:46:40.389]  And?
[02:46:41.949 --> 02:46:43.890]  It is absolutely discriminatory.
[02:46:43.890 --> 02:46:46.351]  It creates a permanent breakaway civilization.
[02:46:46.351 --> 02:46:50.293]  Forget a breakaway superclass or an upper class.
[02:46:50.293 --> 02:46:53.314]  This is the ultimate classism in their own words.
[02:46:53.314 --> 02:46:56.095]  It is the equivalent of an alien invasion.
[02:46:56.095 --> 02:47:10.322]  I'm not saying they're aliens, but they see themselves, as you know, you've researched them as a breakaway species, better than us, and that they're breaking away using our resources, our funds, our best and brightest working class and middle class brains to build their Elysium.
[02:47:10.822 --> 02:47:11.783]  Yes.
[02:47:11.783 --> 02:47:24.872]  And they just need to know we're going to have a public debate about it, and we're going to have a public debate about how global government is meant to implement this, and if there is a debate about it, it's so discriminatory, so evil, there's no way they're going to get away with it.
[02:47:24.872 --> 02:47:27.874]  They need to be challenged, and I agree.
[02:47:27.874 --> 02:47:30.276]  There's no reason they say they should get away with it.
[02:47:30.276 --> 02:47:32.378]  Their whole model is cracked.
[02:47:35.959 --> 02:47:39.782]  And yet, if we don't challenge it, they will stand and we will fall.
[02:47:39.782 --> 02:47:53.471]  Does it scare you, for your children and for your family, to think, because most people think as an intellectual or as a real patriot, not a pseudo, that, oh, it's fun to be the trailblazer, it's fun to be one of the few that really knows what's going on.
[02:47:53.471 --> 02:47:57.894]  Because a lot of folks think they know what's going on, but I mean, we're right, this is the elites on words, they're playing.
[02:47:57.894 --> 02:48:00.996]  We're here with the enemy's blueprint, we see them implementing it over 30, 40 years,
[02:48:03.348 --> 02:48:08.150]  Integrating all their previous systems into it, this is the most important thing out there.
[02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:10.290]  And people are like, ehhh.
[02:48:10.290 --> 02:48:14.672]  I mean, is it scary to know this and to think there's not many of us that know this?
[02:48:14.672 --> 02:48:16.072]  Because I want everybody to hear me now.
[02:48:16.072 --> 02:48:18.593]  This is so important.
[02:48:18.593 --> 02:48:23.715]  It is disturbing that more people don't pick up on this.
[02:48:24.730 --> 02:48:27.271]  But we don't need 100% of the people.
[02:48:27.271 --> 02:48:31.553]  Maybe only 3% of the people would be enough probably to turn this thing on its head.
[02:48:31.553 --> 02:48:40.357]  I'd be happy with 3% or 5% of passive and aggressive patriots who would go after this stuff.
[02:48:41.357 --> 02:48:41.437]  Yeah.
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:03.961]  At birth of the devices and the systems to totally rig the entire world.
[02:49:03.961 --> 02:49:14.983]  They've rigged the stock market, they've rigged the forex, the currency, they've rigged the LIBOR currencies, the LIBOR interest rates, and now they want to rig the species itself.
[02:49:14.983 --> 02:49:17.664]  Is that not a good way to boil it down?
[02:49:17.664 --> 02:49:20.905]  It is a final corporate takeover.
[02:49:20.905 --> 02:49:21.725]  That's about it.
[02:49:21.725 --> 02:49:26.986]  And I want to point out that you cannot win over an enemy you do not know.
[02:49:27.791 --> 02:49:29.275]  We fought over the 40 years.
[02:49:29.275 --> 02:49:33.185]  We fought communism, fascism, socialism, every ism under the sun.
[02:49:33.185 --> 02:49:33.846]  We fought them all.
[02:49:36.797 --> 02:49:43.522]  Billions of hours have been spent by good men and women fighting these things, and they fought the wrong enemy all this time.
[02:49:43.522 --> 02:49:44.903]  That's right.
[02:49:44.903 --> 02:49:51.967]  Notice we're fighting communism, socialism, fascism, and in Quigley, their top globalist on words, they all control all sides of that.
[02:49:51.967 --> 02:49:54.469]  But notice, we're fighting an idiocracy.
[02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:56.290]  We're fighting a technocracy.
[02:49:56.290 --> 02:49:58.952]  We're fighting a dystopia.
[02:49:58.952 --> 02:49:59.953]  I mean, that's really what they're doing.
[02:50:00.413 --> 02:50:01.554]  That's right, that's right.
[02:50:01.554 --> 02:50:08.279]  We need to see the enemy for who it is and who they are and what the system is as an enemy.
[02:50:08.279 --> 02:50:10.120]  And that's what we need to fight.
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:14.524]  And the good news is, it is possible to fight that.
[02:50:14.524 --> 02:50:16.765]  Because these people are within our grasp.
[02:50:16.765 --> 02:50:19.127]  We can discover who they are.
[02:50:19.127 --> 02:50:24.151]  We can discover the policies and stuff in our own local communities and go in and challenge these people.
[02:50:24.151 --> 02:50:25.172]  I want to have you back up.
[02:50:25.512 --> 02:50:26.894]  I want to have you back up for a full hour.
[02:50:26.894 --> 02:50:29.999]  It sent us a synopsis of a battle plan you've got.
[02:50:29.999 --> 02:50:33.624]  Stoppage in the 21 and the technocrats behind it in the next few weeks, sir.
[02:50:33.624 --> 02:50:35.026]  We're gonna have you back on.
[02:50:35.026 --> 02:50:37.369]  Patrick M. Wood, thank you so much, sir.
[02:50:37.369 --> 02:50:38.311]  You're totally welcome, Alex.
[02:50:38.311 --> 02:50:38.892]  Thank you.
[02:50:38.892 --> 02:50:40.734]  And folks, if you want to know why this is such an endgame,
[02:50:42.213 --> 02:50:45.394]  Once they have all robots and autonomous systems, the troops say no to tyranny?
[02:50:45.394 --> 02:50:46.234]  They don't care.
[02:50:46.234 --> 02:50:51.276]  It takes human decision-making out of the process for 99.9% of us.
[02:50:51.276 --> 02:50:58.539]  And the Googles and the Apples and the Microsofts are at the heads of the technocracy with an organized UN plan.
[02:51:01.109 --> 02:51:12.000]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.184]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:16.184 --> 02:51:18.346]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:18.346 --> 02:51:23.791]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:23.951 --> 02:51:33.978]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:33.978 --> 02:51:40.482]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:40.482 --> 02:51:43.805]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:43.805 --> 02:51:45.886]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:45.886 --> 02:51:48.828]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:49.008 --> 02:51:51.489]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:52:00.493 --> 02:52:01.733]  Attention citizens.
[02:52:01.733 --> 02:52:07.656]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[02:52:07.656 --> 02:52:08.376]  His name is Harry Dent.
[02:52:10.217 --> 02:52:18.022]  And in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.

[02:53:27.009 --> 02:53:29.390]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:53:30.089 --> 02:53:37.932]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[02:53:37.932 --> 02:53:40.673]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.
[02:53:40.673 --> 02:53:47.015]  Freedom Project Academy is government-free, doesn't accept any government funding, and is a fully accredited private school.
[02:53:47.015 --> 02:53:50.337]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[02:53:50.337 --> 02:53:53.818]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.
[02:53:53.818 --> 02:53:56.719]  Check them out at fpeusa.org.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:53:58.720]  That's fpeusa.org.
[02:54:10.586 --> 02:54:20.852]  By the way, I remember like 20 years ago, 18 years ago, they'd have national press call me after the New York Times would mention my name in an article and go, what is it like to be in the New York Times?
[02:54:20.852 --> 02:54:24.354]  Like it was some Valhalla heaven.
[02:54:24.354 --> 02:54:32.458]  But the last decade or so, they've kind of had an unwritten rule to never say my name in the New York Times.
[02:54:32.458 --> 02:54:34.019]  Even though I'm in thousands of other publications.
[02:54:34.019 --> 02:54:37.721]  Well, they had two articles yesterday attacking me and Donald Trump.
[02:54:39.923 --> 02:54:42.044]  I'm talking about my conspiracy theories.
[02:54:42.044 --> 02:54:43.945]  Again, that means questioning known liars.
[02:54:43.945 --> 02:54:45.905]  Not being an idiot is being a conspiracy theorist.
[02:54:45.905 --> 02:54:52.388]  And they're also attacking Roger Stone and people saying the Koch brothers are involved with Rubio.
[02:54:52.388 --> 02:54:54.769]  I mean, the Koch brothers don't run Rubio's campaign.
[02:54:54.769 --> 02:54:58.270]  That was announced two days ago.
[02:54:58.270 --> 02:55:04.913]  But we're going to be watching all of this and what happens on Super Tuesday throughout the afternoon and tonight, kicking off at seven o'clock central.
[02:55:06.474 --> 02:55:08.235]  Infowarsnews.com.
[02:55:08.235 --> 02:55:12.578]  You can also go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:55:12.578 --> 02:55:22.286]  There's a YouTube link at the top of our YouTube page that also will go live at seven tonight as a backup, but Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:55:22.286 --> 02:55:28.090]  And we do have our own feeds that hundreds of thousands of people an hour tune into.
[02:55:29.315 --> 02:55:34.143]  Not just AM and FM stations and all the rest of it, so that we do have our own platforms, so it's not as easy to censor us.
[02:55:34.143 --> 02:55:39.411]  But we are on third-party platforms like Facebook and YouTube, knowing full well they can censor us and have before.
[02:55:40.356 --> 02:55:52.960]  But it's very expensive to have our own platforms and bandwidth and reporters and all of this, so please continue to pray for us, spread the word about the broadcast, and take advantage of the 30% off sale and free shipping, the biggest sale in our history.
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:56:01.142]  It's no longer the Leap Year sale, it's now the Super Tuesday sale, and it will only go until tomorrow morning because we will just be sold out of so many of our top items and I just can't do it.
[02:56:02.742 --> 02:56:20.638]  I just because sometimes I have sales that are so good we sell a lot of stuff they don't have some things for months then I lose money because some of the things are even lost leaders so I'm trying to gauge how to fund the operation but also give you the best deals but you cannot lose because these are really high quality products and it helps fund the operation so there I really want to thank you all and salute you.
[02:56:20.638 --> 02:56:25.382]  How the GOP insiders plan to steal the nod from Trump.
[02:56:25.382 --> 02:56:28.385]  Very important Breitbart article up on Infowars.com by
[02:56:30.049 --> 02:56:33.692]  Mr. Stone, Roger Stone, who will be back with us tomorrow.
[02:56:33.692 --> 02:56:39.318]  Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.
[02:56:39.318 --> 02:56:40.599]  Eric Hoffer.
[02:56:40.599 --> 02:56:45.343]  And he goes over how they're planning, and I'm sure that David Knight, coming up in the next hour, will cover some of that.
[02:56:45.343 --> 02:56:50.749]  Roger Stone sells himself as Trump inside man to gathering of conspiracy theorists.
[02:56:51.707 --> 02:57:03.113]  Media Matters makes a big deal about myself introducing him to a bookstore capacity house, like Stone hadn't been friends with him for 40 years or hadn't been.
[02:57:03.113 --> 02:57:05.774]  His campaign head didn't get him to run.
[02:57:05.774 --> 02:57:06.575]  That's in Politico.
[02:57:06.575 --> 02:57:09.837]  They got him to run with the key people.
[02:57:09.837 --> 02:57:19.802]  His buddy, they go out to, you know, on double dates together for decades with their wives, plays golf with him, goes shooting with him.
[02:57:21.325 --> 02:57:31.771]  And then Trump put out this weekend that Roger Stone's the best, his best friend, and strong, and loyal, and tough.
[02:57:31.771 --> 02:57:35.193]  And he got Trump on the show, and Trump said, you know, thank Roger Stone.
[02:57:35.193 --> 02:57:41.276]  And then the media acts like Stone is like, doesn't know Trump.
[02:57:41.276 --> 02:57:44.678]  Again, they prey on people's ignorance here.
[02:57:44.678 --> 02:57:46.779]  Like some media said I was a liar,
[02:57:49.022 --> 02:57:54.147]  That the new X-Files, Chris Carter didn't say it was based on me, a character, and InfoWars material.
[02:57:54.147 --> 02:57:55.469]  It's in hundreds of newspapers.
[02:57:55.469 --> 02:58:00.955]  Or they go, Matt Drudge wasn't really, I saw a few articles, Matt Drudge wasn't really announced to studios, it's a lie.
[02:58:00.955 --> 02:58:02.756]  No one listens to him.
[02:58:02.756 --> 02:58:11.365]  Really, we just have 50-something crew members and tens of millions of views every week on InfoWars and 28 million listeners or viewers globally every week.
[02:58:12.572 --> 02:58:14.794]  Donald J. Trump on his Twitter, you know.
[02:58:14.794 --> 02:58:16.315]  Roger Stone was just banned on CNN.
[02:58:16.315 --> 02:58:16.856]  They're lost.
[02:58:16.856 --> 02:58:17.696]  Tough, loyal guy.
[02:58:17.696 --> 02:58:19.278]  Yeah, but doesn't know him.
[02:58:19.278 --> 02:58:22.300]  He sold himself as Trump's inside man.
[02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:24.582]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:24.582 --> 02:58:28.826]  I've just been sitting there repeatedly when Donald Trump calls up and he goes, oh, I gotta go talk to Donald for about 10 minutes.
[02:58:32.982 --> 02:58:34.263]  Oh my goodness, it's incredible.
[02:58:34.263 --> 02:58:36.385]  I'm going to come back and do five minutes on some other news.
[02:58:36.385 --> 02:58:38.727]  I'm going to pass the baton to David Knight.
[02:58:38.727 --> 02:58:39.827]  Hey, I'm not even Alex Jones.
[02:58:39.827 --> 02:58:42.589]  It's like a lady at that voting place said, are you an Alex Jones?
[02:58:42.589 --> 02:58:43.370]  And I go, yeah, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:44.611]  She goes, no, you're not.
[02:58:44.611 --> 02:58:46.392]  Are you one of the Alex Joneses?
[02:58:46.392 --> 02:58:47.873]  And I went, yeah, I'm a clone, lady.
[02:58:49.134 --> 02:58:50.495]  I'm not even Alex Jones!
[02:58:50.495 --> 02:58:57.439]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:58:57.439 --> 02:58:59.520]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:09.806]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:59:09.806 --> 02:59:15.769]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:59:16.249 --> 02:59:31.186]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:59:31.186 --> 02:59:32.267]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.843 --> 03:00:07.269]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:09.432]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:09.432 --> 03:00:15.158]  Alright, I'm doing five more minutes than I am again jumping out of the cockpit here and turning it over to David Knight.
[03:00:15.158 --> 03:00:16.339]  I'm in the war room.
[03:00:16.339 --> 03:00:18.842]  David Knight is in the situation room.
[03:00:18.842 --> 03:00:21.905]  I'm gonna go to some more news here in just a moment, but first I want to go to David Knight.
[03:00:22.828 --> 03:00:28.472]  And ask him, because I know he's always at the latest breaking news, special reports, and so much more that's coming up.
[03:00:28.472 --> 03:00:30.814]  Jacari Jackson's been out to polling places.
[03:00:30.814 --> 03:00:35.017]  Our crew's been out investigating Joe Biggs and others' election fraud.
[03:00:35.017 --> 03:00:37.779]  Some of those reports are going to be ready by the time David gets on.
[03:00:37.779 --> 03:00:41.281]  And then tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:00:41.281 --> 03:00:45.864]  If you go to our Twitter at RealAlexJones, you can see the meme image.
[03:00:45.864 --> 03:00:46.565]  Great graphic.
[03:00:46.565 --> 03:00:47.526]  Who made that?
[03:00:47.526 --> 03:00:48.546]  Just a talented graphics crew.
[03:00:48.546 --> 03:00:50.448]  We've got five or six people.
[03:00:50.448 --> 03:00:51.528]  Was that Buckley, or who was that?
[03:00:51.528 --> 03:00:51.949]  It's amazing.
[03:00:52.589 --> 03:00:53.590]  Robert did a great job.
[03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:55.751]  Robert, we're going to send that out.
[03:00:55.751 --> 03:01:00.315]  Help us retweet that so people know about our coverage and where they can find it free.
[03:01:00.315 --> 03:01:08.220]  Just go to InfoWars.com or go to RealAlexJones at Twitter and say watch InfoWars exclusive Super Tuesday coverage starting at 7 p.m.
[03:01:08.220 --> 03:01:08.801]  Share this link.
[03:01:09.872 --> 03:01:16.718]  We're going to send another out and tweet it at Donald Trump and his supporters to tune in and get real coverage of Donald Trump dominating Super Tuesday.
[03:01:16.718 --> 03:01:20.642]  Then we'll send another tweet out about evidence of election fraud against Trump and we're tracking it.
[03:01:20.642 --> 03:01:23.945]  We're going to retweet Drudge's tweet with our article as well.
[03:01:23.945 --> 03:01:25.287]  So a lot is happening.
[03:01:25.287 --> 03:01:26.247]  It is surreal though.
[03:01:26.247 --> 03:01:30.932]  I used to be in national news maybe once a month, 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[03:01:30.932 --> 03:01:34.755]  Then it was every week, then it was every day, then it was every hour, then it was every minute.
[03:01:35.436 --> 03:01:40.902]  I mean, some days I type in Alex Jones Infowars and there's like 19,000 articles we're in on Google News.
[03:01:40.902 --> 03:01:42.323]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[03:01:42.323 --> 03:01:44.326]  That's like, whoa!
[03:01:44.326 --> 03:01:46.528]  What a responsibility!
[03:01:46.528 --> 03:01:50.152]  But man, we really see what's happening and it's just a manifestation.
[03:01:50.152 --> 03:01:51.794]  I'm not arrogant.
[03:01:51.794 --> 03:01:54.697]  Our success is the fact that we're informed, focused, and dedicated.
[03:01:55.922 --> 03:01:59.565]  And I pray for Providence, and you pray for us, but it's also, there's a rising tide.
[03:01:59.565 --> 03:02:00.765]  People are waking up.
[03:02:00.765 --> 03:02:02.246]  And Trump should know that, and he does.
[03:02:02.246 --> 03:02:03.047]  He's said more and more.
[03:02:03.047 --> 03:02:06.229]  I'm a focal point, a channel for people's anger.
[03:02:06.229 --> 03:02:07.510]  I think he's showing more humility.
[03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:10.372]  He's got to be confident to do what he's doing, and people are loving that.
[03:02:10.372 --> 03:02:15.615]  But I tell you, as the whole world lines up against Trump, with his David Duke stuff and all the rest of it, his numbers are only going up.
[03:02:15.615 --> 03:02:22.140]  David Knight, what are you covering, and then what do you make of all this, of Trump just surging against everything they try?
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:24.762]  Well, Alex, I think it was very significant over the weekend.
[03:02:24.762 --> 03:02:28.245]  I think Trump got his most significant endorsement with Jeff Sessions.
[03:02:28.245 --> 03:02:31.868]  That, as you know, that's the reason that I supported Trump.
[03:02:31.868 --> 03:02:32.828]  I voted for him today.
[03:02:32.828 --> 03:02:37.853]  I'm very troubled about many of the things that he said that are authoritarian, that go against individual liberty.
[03:02:38.413 --> 03:02:41.894]  But again, there's not any candidates out there who are supporting individual liberty.
[03:02:41.894 --> 03:02:47.876]  So really, at this level, we're going to have to fight for individual liberty in different ways and at different levels.
[03:02:47.876 --> 03:02:55.099]  And if Donald Trump comes out real bold-faced to take our liberties, I think that will really only help us in the fight, help us to wake up people.
[03:02:55.099 --> 03:03:01.981]  But on the positive side, what Jeff Sessions showed and talked about... He said what you said, it's about sovereignty.
[03:03:02.361 --> 03:03:03.002]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:03.002 --> 03:03:15.871]  The fact that he's the only one that's going to stop these trade deals, and Jeff Sessions is the only person, the only person in the Congress, in the House of Representatives, or the Senate, who bothered to look at these trade deals.
[03:03:15.871 --> 03:03:17.312]  He looked at them in detail.
[03:03:17.312 --> 03:03:28.420]  He put up massive... Will it make you go, you're going to talk more about this after the break when I'm gone, but will it make you go from being holding your nose and going for Trump, and will it make you really get behind him if he makes Sessions his VP?
[03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:29.541]  Because that's the word, by the way.
[03:03:29.921 --> 03:03:31.242]  Well, you know, yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:31.242 --> 03:03:32.143]  No, no, no.
[03:03:32.143 --> 03:03:41.932]  I wouldn't say that I'm even holding my nose at this point, because as I said, the things that I disagree with Donald Trump on, I disagree with all the Republican and Democrat candidates on.
[03:03:41.932 --> 03:03:55.403]  And so when I look at this, I think it's very, very important for us to understand that on these three legs of globalism, Donald Trump is the one who is positively going to react against that, and certainly... You should do a video about Trump's the only one covering the three...
[03:03:56.244 --> 03:04:06.410]  Legs of globalism, and we tweet that out to Trump and others because he is listening to us, he is getting our factoids, and so we're communicating with him through different levels, both public and private.
[03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:07.471]  So I think that's important.
[03:04:07.471 --> 03:04:12.634]  Trump's starting to get it where he said, we're fighting an oligarchy, we're fighting these elite offshore people that have hijacked us.
[03:04:12.634 --> 03:04:14.676]  If he starts pointing out that we've actually been taken over...
[03:04:15.456 --> 03:04:20.719]  It's game over for the globalists, because we have been taken over by collaborators like the French were in World War II.
[03:04:20.719 --> 03:04:22.240]  The French stood down, folks.
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:28.023]  If people actually get, whoa, the UN isn't coming, they're already here, it's game over, man, game over!
[03:04:28.023 --> 03:04:41.671]  Yeah, actually, when you look at it, when you look at the TPP, you look at the TTIP, Jeff Sessions has explained it to people, but we're going to take a look at NAFTA, because we know, 23 years after the fact, what NAFTA has done to our country.
[03:04:41.671 --> 03:04:43.612]  We're going to take a look at that in detail when we come back.
[03:04:43.732 --> 03:04:45.134]  All right, great job, David Knight.
[03:04:45.134 --> 03:04:47.576]  Folks, don't forget, it was our biggest sale ever.
[03:04:47.576 --> 03:04:48.678]  It's over, the Leap Year Sale.
[03:04:48.678 --> 03:04:56.967]  We had to end it because many items sold out, but we're keeping the same discounts, 30% off and free shipping through tomorrow on the items that are left, and that is most our items.
[03:04:56.967 --> 03:04:58.709]  Please take advantage of it and support the broadcast.
[03:04:58.709 --> 03:04:59.350]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:02.122 --> 03:05:09.472]  The British government is pushing the Investigory Powers Bill, or Snoopers Charter, that will effectively end internet privacy.
[03:05:09.472 --> 03:05:16.521]  The proposed legislation targets popular chat and message services such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and FaceTime.
[03:05:16.521 --> 03:05:16.902]  Outlaws
[03:05:17.142 --> 03:05:17.743]  I think so.
[03:05:41.781 --> 03:05:51.049]  Admitted that a 1983 telecom act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5 and the agency has done so since September 2001.

[03:07:57.039 --> 03:07:58.920]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[03:08:13.473 --> 03:08:21.978]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:08:21.978 --> 03:08:26.341]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:26.341 --> 03:08:30.504]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:30.504 --> 03:08:32.065]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:34.102 --> 03:08:35.583]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:35.583 --> 03:08:37.485]  I'm David Iyed on this super Tuesday.
[03:08:37.485 --> 03:08:41.148]  We're going to have live coverage tonight as the results unfold.
[03:08:41.148 --> 03:08:43.750]  We're going to be there with analysis and we're going to have a lot of reports.
[03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:46.072]  We've got a report coming up in just a moment.
[03:08:46.072 --> 03:08:53.097]  We had Joe Biggs do further investigation on what was heard this morning on the local radio station, KLBJ.
[03:08:53.097 --> 03:08:59.242]  People called in to say that they were voting at various polling locations here in Austin and I think also in Georgetown.
[03:09:00.003 --> 03:09:10.348]  They said that as they voted and they saw their tally being totaled on the machine as you feed it in, I'm not really sure what the machine looks like, because where I voted, they don't have those kind of fancy machines.
[03:09:10.348 --> 03:09:11.349]  Good thing they don't.
[03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:12.930]  We don't need them, quite frankly.
[03:09:12.930 --> 03:09:18.252]  We need a paper trail, and we need people to count this stuff, and we need to have something that we can audit.
[03:09:18.252 --> 03:09:26.857]  The further we can get away from this electronic voting, and I say this as an electrical engineer, as somebody who understands software, who understands how easy it is to hack
[03:09:27.717 --> 03:09:29.098]  This system.
[03:09:29.098 --> 03:09:32.060]  We need to go back to just honest paper ballots.
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:33.241]  It's very simple.
[03:09:33.241 --> 03:09:33.841]  It's very simple.
[03:09:33.841 --> 03:09:38.764]  You just want an audit trail, and we want to be able to see where this stuff is.
[03:09:38.764 --> 03:09:42.527]  There's so many different places where voter fraud can come in.
[03:09:42.527 --> 03:09:48.371]  But of course, we've got this report, and we're going to play this in just a moment, but I want to take you back 16 years.
[03:09:48.371 --> 03:09:49.912]  Remember the South Carolina primary?
[03:09:49.912 --> 03:09:52.234]  George Bush is running his main competition.
[03:09:52.234 --> 03:09:55.216]  George W. Bush is running his main competition as John McCain.
[03:09:56.156 --> 03:10:03.200]  And as they pointed out eight years ago, as John McCain was running again at that time, this is an article from the New York Times.
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:10.604]  They said, uh, Karl Rove came to the rescue for George W. Bush with a vicious smear tactic against John McCain.
[03:10:11.124 --> 03:10:17.830]  Rove invented a uniquely injurious fiction for his operatives to circulate via a phony poll.
[03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:19.571]  They call these things push polls, okay?
[03:10:19.571 --> 03:10:29.339]  You put out some false information, you do it on the eve or the day of the election, and it's vicious smears and the guise of being a poll.
[03:10:29.339 --> 03:10:30.160]  And this is what they said.
[03:10:30.740 --> 03:10:36.767]  Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew that he had fathered an illegitimate black child?
[03:10:36.767 --> 03:10:38.989]  This is what they did in South Carolina, of course.
[03:10:38.989 --> 03:10:42.793]  And as they point out in the New York Times, this was no random slur.
[03:10:42.793 --> 03:10:49.720]  McCain was, at the time, campaigning with his dark-skinned daughter, Bridget, who he had adopted from Bangladesh.
[03:10:50.501 --> 03:10:53.442]  So he goes out and he adopts a girl from Bangladesh.
[03:10:53.442 --> 03:11:05.804]  And because she's got dark skin, they start to circulate a rumor in South Carolina, hoping they can appeal to people's racism, to say that, well, would it concern you if you thought that he had fathered an illegitimate child?
[03:11:05.804 --> 03:11:13.345]  What is happening today, throughout this whole weekend, with the KKK slurs against Donald Trump is exactly the same thing.
[03:11:13.345 --> 03:11:16.246]  It's just a different kind of racism.
[03:11:16.246 --> 03:11:16.826]  You understand that?
[03:11:17.594 --> 03:11:27.901]  This is still bringing up the racism and applying it in a different way, doing a push-pull and saying, well, okay, he distanced himself from David Duke and the KKK.
[03:11:27.901 --> 03:11:30.783]  He didn't want to be a part of the Reform Party years ago because they were in it.
[03:11:30.783 --> 03:11:36.007]  But he just didn't say enough or say it strongly enough to distance himself from being endorsed by somebody else.
[03:11:36.707 --> 03:11:38.228]  That's precisely what's going on.
[03:11:38.228 --> 03:11:51.079]  And it is really annoying beyond belief, but reminding us again why we are against the GOP establishment when we see the leadership, like Paul Ryan, beating this dead horse still today.
[03:11:51.079 --> 03:11:51.540]  Paul Ryan.
[03:11:52.284 --> 03:11:53.645]  The Speaker of the House.
[03:11:53.645 --> 03:12:04.153]  And if you think you're going to get anything different with anybody other than Donald Trump, just look at what Paul Ryan is doing today over this non-issue of the David Duke endorsement.
[03:12:04.153 --> 03:12:07.095]  You can't help who votes for you or endorses you.
[03:12:07.095 --> 03:12:08.916]  And he's already distanced himself from that.
[03:12:08.916 --> 03:12:11.238]  But let's take a look at the other issues involved with this.
[03:12:11.238 --> 03:12:17.263]  Because the latest polls that we saw in Texas, and of course Texas is a very large state.
[03:12:17.263 --> 03:12:18.483]  155 delegates coming out of Texas.
[03:12:18.483 --> 03:12:20.545]  The only state that has more delegates is California with 172.
[03:12:22.042 --> 03:12:27.804]  But I guess we could say that the Republican establishment itself is one of the largest states.
[03:12:27.804 --> 03:12:32.465]  150 votes have been reserved for RNC superdelegates, almost as much as Texas.
[03:12:32.465 --> 03:12:37.546]  So you've got 150 for the GOP establishment, Texas gets 155, California 172.
[03:12:37.546 --> 03:12:41.167]  Everybody else is getting far, far less delegates than that.
[03:12:41.167 --> 03:12:48.149]  And of course, you could say that the RNC superdelegate primary is a winner-take-all, or I guess you could say the establishment-take-all.
[03:12:49.022 --> 03:13:02.407]  That's where the people like Paul Ryan, that's why they're so confident, that if they can keep Marco Rubio with a pulse, try to create some kind of a narrative where he still has a pulse, that they can turn this thing around at a brokered convention.
[03:13:02.407 --> 03:13:04.928]  And of course the last poll we saw, Marco Rubio was at 19%.
[03:13:04.928 --> 03:13:07.349]  That's a very significant number.
[03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:11.590]  Not just because he's in a distant third place, but because if he doesn't get a threshold of 20%,
[03:13:13.211 --> 03:13:16.274]  Then he's not going to get a single delegate anywhere in Texas.
[03:13:16.274 --> 03:13:23.240]  You have to have at least 20% to get even a proportional allocation of some of the delegates in Texas.
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:31.387]  So let's go to this report of Joe Biggs following up on the reports that some votes were getting switched from Trump to Rubio as they were being tallied.
[03:13:33.277 --> 03:13:35.119]  Joe Banks here with Infowars.com.
[03:13:35.119 --> 03:13:44.386]  Now earlier today listeners of the KLBJ radio show called in with concerns about the voting process that is happening on Super Tuesday.
[03:13:44.386 --> 03:13:51.032]  Now multiple listeners called in saying that they had voted for Donald Trump and yet Marco Rubio was showing up.
[03:13:51.032 --> 03:13:53.394]  This is the morning radio show host.
[03:13:53.394 --> 03:13:54.014]  What's your name sir?
[03:13:54.014 --> 03:13:54.675]  Todd Jeffries.
[03:13:54.895 --> 03:13:57.916]  Now, Todd Jeffries, what happened this morning when you were doing your show?
[03:13:57.916 --> 03:13:59.236]  Yeah, it was pretty surprising.
[03:13:59.236 --> 03:14:02.037]  Probably about a dozen phone calls in a very short period of time.
[03:14:02.037 --> 03:14:10.140]  They, just like you outlined, they wanted to vote for Donald Trump, but in the end, when they went back to check, it showed that they voted for Marco Rubio.
[03:14:10.140 --> 03:14:14.502]  And some people actually called in saying that, well, it was a glitch.
[03:14:14.502 --> 03:14:17.703]  Well, it was operator error, a mistake, that sort of thing.
[03:14:17.703 --> 03:14:21.304]  Easily correctable if you just check your ballot before you leave the voting booth.
[03:14:22.125 --> 03:14:26.189]  But the bottom line is it's not accurate.
[03:14:26.189 --> 03:14:32.956]  Whether it's a mistake because of equipment or operator error, the voter made a mistake, the bottom line is it wasn't accurate.
[03:14:32.956 --> 03:14:36.600]  I mean, it feels like, you know, we could pick an American Idol.
[03:14:37.486 --> 03:14:40.267]  More accurately than we can a president.
[03:14:40.267 --> 03:14:47.789]  And if people can't trust the system and can't trust the process, whether it was operator error or technical mistakes, it's wrong.
[03:14:47.789 --> 03:14:52.491]  And when people can't trust their election process, then what the heck are we doing?
[03:14:52.491 --> 03:15:02.634]  You know, it's just not fair, it's not right, it's not accurate, and it fuels a lot of speculation and frustration and just a basic lack of trust in the system itself.
[03:15:03.345 --> 03:15:04.165]  It was pretty interesting.
[03:15:04.165 --> 03:15:11.228]  I was listening to some of your audio clips this morning, and I remember a caller coming in, calling in saying that last week his grandmother came in and voted.
[03:15:11.228 --> 03:15:11.828]  Tell me about that.
[03:15:11.828 --> 03:15:12.909]  Yeah, he called in.
[03:15:12.909 --> 03:15:22.732]  His grandmother had a problem voting last week, an older lady, and had some trouble with the equipment in the voting booth, this new digital and high-tech way that we're voting nowadays.
[03:15:22.732 --> 03:15:24.573]  And I bet that happens a lot.
[03:15:24.873 --> 03:15:32.537]  All across the country, you know, the older folks that are just not used to the equipment and the technology, and they don't know they should check it before they leave.
[03:15:32.537 --> 03:15:44.304]  And it's very possible that we've had, you know, hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people across this country in this election and in previous elections, where what they thought they were voting on just didn't come out in the end.
[03:15:44.304 --> 03:15:45.985]  It just wasn't accurate for them.
[03:15:45.985 --> 03:15:47.626]  And therefore, their vote didn't count.
[03:15:48.286 --> 03:15:57.208]  It counted for somebody else or something else, and this is true not just in political races, but bond package races, you know, various things we vote on at the polls.
[03:15:57.208 --> 03:15:58.448]  Well, there you have it.
[03:15:58.448 --> 03:16:02.929]  At the end of the day, whoever you're voting for, check the ballot.
[03:16:02.929 --> 03:16:09.050]  Make sure you're getting what it is you're voting for, and if not, bring it to the attention of the people working there.
[03:16:09.050 --> 03:16:12.551]  Whether this is a scam, this is a computer glitch, or
[03:16:13.211 --> 03:16:15.112]  This is personal air.
[03:16:15.112 --> 03:16:21.435]  Make sure that you get the person you want, so we don't have the wrong person in charge of our country.
[03:16:21.435 --> 03:16:24.356]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[03:16:24.356 --> 03:16:29.959]  And of course we can say mistakes have been made, but we can also say there's always a lot of election fraud.
[03:16:29.959 --> 03:16:34.761]  As Alex was pointing out, if it is a landslide, they can't do anything about it.
[03:16:34.761 --> 03:16:40.144]  But if it is a close race, you better believe that they're going to be able to fudge those results in there.
[03:16:40.704 --> 03:16:50.409]  When I voted today in Texas, it's the first time since I've been to Texas that I voted, and I gotta say that at least on the voter identification part, it was much better than it was in North Carolina.
[03:16:50.409 --> 03:16:57.252]  Now, they've tried to change this in North Carolina, but in North Carolina, all you have to do is just show up and give them your name and your address, and they let you vote.
[03:16:57.252 --> 03:16:59.813]  You don't need to show a picture ID.
[03:16:59.813 --> 03:17:00.774]  Very, very open.
[03:17:00.774 --> 03:17:05.096]  Whereas here, you had to show a driver's license, picture ID, something like that.
[03:17:05.096 --> 03:17:07.697]  You had to sign that you were voting.
[03:17:08.197 --> 03:17:15.343]  We had a friend of ours in North Carolina in the last election who went in to vote and they said, well, I'm sorry, you've already voted.
[03:17:15.343 --> 03:17:17.184]  He said, no, I haven't.
[03:17:17.184 --> 03:17:18.185]  They said, well, yeah, you have.
[03:17:18.185 --> 03:17:23.750]  And he looked and he could see the people that were at the address there, and he saw that his deceased mother
[03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:24.550]  That's right.
[03:17:43.909 --> 03:17:53.237]  And of course we saw in the primaries last time a lot of voter tally fraud where people would phone in the results and they would get flipped or other things would happen.
[03:17:53.237 --> 03:17:58.501]  And of course this was reported just recently on the Democrat side between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
[03:17:58.501 --> 03:18:10.791]  Remember we had the Iowa caucus, I think it was also maybe in New Hampshire, but I think it was especially in the Iowa caucus where they were saying, wait a minute, we had these votes and they got reported inaccurately.
[03:18:11.551 --> 03:18:20.577]  We're also going to take a look at some of the phone calls that happened with that, but I don't know, no we don't have time to go to this MSNBC piece.
[03:18:20.577 --> 03:18:31.745]  MSNBC, we're going to play this when we come back from the break, a perfect way to show how the mainstream media is trying to push this phony racism issue to the hilt.
[03:18:32.245 --> 03:18:50.678]  And as I began talking about how they did that with John McCain 16 years ago in South Carolina, we're going to show you a clip that was on MSNBC where they go to, they talk about how racist Donald Trump is because he hasn't done enough to distance himself from, we have time, let's play that clip.
[03:18:50.678 --> 03:18:52.419]  We've got that cued up, let's go ahead and play that clip.
[03:18:54.685 --> 03:19:05.431]  One of our reporters, and I don't want to quote the wrong reporter here, was just out of the Trump campaign, I think we have the sound and my team will have to tell me, where they spoke with some Trump supporters.
[03:19:05.431 --> 03:19:06.392]  Let's play what they said.
[03:19:12.589 --> 03:19:14.611]  So he says we're all Americans.
[03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:35.458]  Um, clearly, let me just be clear here.
[03:19:35.458 --> 03:19:38.463]  Obviously the majority of Donald Trump supporters are not African American.
[03:19:38.463 --> 03:19:46.555]  I don't know how many African Americans were in that building, but that is one person that we have chosen to cut that down from David.
[03:19:47.797 --> 03:19:51.019]  That's the amazing thing, you gotta see that report.
[03:19:51.019 --> 03:19:52.600]  She comes back, she's speechless.
[03:19:52.600 --> 03:19:57.304]  Well, let's just make it clear, there's not a lot of African Americans who support Donald Trump.
[03:19:57.304 --> 03:20:00.366]  That reporter who showed that is going to be in a lot of trouble.
[03:20:00.366 --> 03:20:01.126]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:01.126 --> 03:20:11.634]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:11.954 --> 03:20:16.115]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.

[03:24:02.087 --> 03:24:07.913]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:07.913 --> 03:24:10.195]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:11.573 --> 03:24:14.676]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.676 --> 03:24:20.942]  As we just went to break, we had played an amazing pushback against MSNBC.
[03:24:20.942 --> 03:24:23.344]  We're going to play that clip for you again in just a moment.
[03:24:23.344 --> 03:24:30.031]  But they were pushing this whole meme of attacking Donald Trump because he hadn't done enough about the KKK saying, he's racist, he's racist.
[03:24:30.031 --> 03:24:34.455]  And then they go to the rally, talk to a black man who was there at the Trump rally.
[03:24:34.855 --> 03:24:37.997]  And he's saying, look, these people are going to come out of the woodwork all the time.
[03:24:37.997 --> 03:24:44.600]  I'm just here with my friend here, and he points to a middle-aged white man who's sitting next to him, and he goes, we're just all Americans.
[03:24:44.600 --> 03:24:46.421]  We need to understand where these attacks are coming from.
[03:24:46.421 --> 03:24:49.583]  And they come back, and the MSNBC anchors are speechless.
[03:24:49.583 --> 03:24:53.965]  I want to play that again for you, because I talked over it a little bit, and I want you to hear it.
[03:24:53.965 --> 03:24:57.687]  And if you're watching this, I want you to see the expressions on their faces.
[03:24:57.687 --> 03:24:58.447]  Truly classic.
[03:24:58.447 --> 03:24:59.248]  Before we go to that clip.
[03:24:59.568 --> 03:25:03.513]  Just want to let you know that we've extended the leap year sale that we had yesterday.
[03:25:03.513 --> 03:25:05.415]  It was to end last night at midnight.
[03:25:05.415 --> 03:25:08.239]  We have extended it just a little bit more today.

[03:25:17.970 --> 03:25:19.051]  It has been a huge sale.
[03:25:19.051 --> 03:25:25.458]  We've already sold out of Supermail Vitality, Secret 12, DNA Force, Living Defense, but there's a lot of other products that are still there.

[03:25:46.093 --> 03:25:47.994]  Let's play that clip again.
[03:25:47.994 --> 03:26:00.517]  I want people to hear this because it's a classic example of the truth just shutting down the lies that they were spending for about five minutes prior to going to this clip and then they come back and they're speechless.
[03:26:00.517 --> 03:26:01.117]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:26:01.860 --> 03:26:12.614]  One of our reporters, and I don't want to quote the wrong reporter here, was just out of the Trump campaign, I think we have the sound and my team will have to tell me, where they spoke with some Trump supporters.
[03:26:12.614 --> 03:26:13.576]  Let's play what they said.
[03:26:19.702 --> 03:26:22.103]  Out from under the rocks all the time around this time this year.
[03:26:22.103 --> 03:26:23.824]  It's got nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[03:26:23.824 --> 03:26:25.085]  We're all Americans.
[03:26:25.085 --> 03:26:28.206]  I think we need to stop with all the racist stuff and the race being.
[03:26:28.206 --> 03:26:31.388]  Like me and my friend right here, we just met today and we was talking.
[03:26:31.388 --> 03:26:34.309]  You know, we gotta stop with the racist stuff and this and that.
[03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:35.710]  We're all Americans, man.
[03:26:35.710 --> 03:26:37.451]  And nobody paying David Duke no mind.
[03:26:39.589 --> 03:26:42.630]  Um, clearly, let me just be clear here.
[03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:45.631]  Obviously the majority of Donald Trump supporters are not African American.
[03:26:45.631 --> 03:26:54.074]  I don't know how many African Americans were in that building, but that is one person that we have chosen to cut that sound from, David.
[03:26:55.031 --> 03:26:58.074]  Yeah, so she has to push back and say, well, you know, he's not typical.
[03:26:58.074 --> 03:27:01.937]  They don't have, you know, black people don't really support Donald Trump.
[03:27:01.937 --> 03:27:13.648]  Just like the former president of Mexico, Vincente Fox, said, I want to know who these 44% of Hispanic voters in the GOP primary were that voted for Donald Trump above all of the other candidates.
[03:27:14.228 --> 03:27:28.423]  You see, people who don't consider America to be their host country, as Vincente Fox said, you know, by the way, Fox, if it's their host country, if they're not citizens, they don't get to vote unless there's some fraud going on.
[03:27:28.423 --> 03:27:33.208]  But people who don't consider it to be their host country, who consider it to be their country,
[03:27:33.789 --> 03:27:39.354]  Who have come in, legally have become American citizens, have gone through the process.
[03:27:39.354 --> 03:27:44.558]  They don't want to see their country become like the country that Vincente Fox runs over.
[03:27:44.558 --> 03:27:45.439]  Okay?
[03:27:45.439 --> 03:27:47.341]  His regime was corrupt.
[03:27:47.341 --> 03:27:49.142]  His regime was violent.
[03:27:49.142 --> 03:27:53.366]  They came here to escape that kind of failed regime.
[03:27:53.366 --> 03:27:57.769]  And I want to talk to you now about NAFTA and what has happened with this.
[03:27:57.769 --> 03:27:58.730]  Because we had a lot of people say,
[03:27:59.571 --> 03:28:02.475]  You know, we've got to be very careful because the Mexicans aren't going to like us.
[03:28:02.475 --> 03:28:06.721]  If we talk about building a wall, the Mexican government is going to hate us.
[03:28:06.721 --> 03:28:08.544]  And it's like, well, go ahead.
[03:28:08.544 --> 03:28:12.068]  Because, you know, just last year, they got $58 billion in a trade deficit with him.
[03:28:16.001 --> 03:28:20.883]  Fifty-eight billion dollars went to Mexico out of the American economy just last year.
[03:28:20.883 --> 03:28:22.603]  And where did this all come from?
[03:28:22.603 --> 03:28:24.384]  Well, this all came from NAFTA.
[03:28:24.384 --> 03:28:27.545]  We've had Senator Jeff Sessions say that he was supporting Donald Trump.
[03:28:27.545 --> 03:28:29.125]  He said, look, I don't agree with him on everything.
[03:28:29.125 --> 03:28:30.786]  I don't agree with him on everything either.
[03:28:30.786 --> 03:28:39.389]  But he said, we have to understand the country is going to be destroyed if we don't get control of our borders, if we don't get control of our trade.
[03:28:39.389 --> 03:28:43.070]  And Jeff Sessions, the only senator, the only senator, I was very disappointed.
[03:28:43.570 --> 03:28:48.093]  That Rand Paul, that Ted Cruz did not go and take a look at this and report on it in detail.
[03:28:48.093 --> 03:28:49.073]  But he did.
[03:28:49.073 --> 03:28:50.634]  He reported on it in detail.
[03:28:50.634 --> 03:28:57.158]  He set up a dog and pony presentation show for his fellow members of the Senate who could care less.
[03:28:57.158 --> 03:28:58.679]  And really it was for the public.
[03:28:58.679 --> 03:29:00.040]  Because he knew his colleagues didn't care.
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:03.442]  His colleagues didn't go to bother to even look at this.
[03:29:03.442 --> 03:29:04.503]  And he explained to them
[03:29:05.339 --> 03:29:09.584]  The many problems with this, and it's not an issue even of free trade.
[03:29:09.584 --> 03:29:11.786]  Bernie Sanders opposes TPP.
[03:29:11.786 --> 03:29:13.148]  He doesn't oppose open borders.
[03:29:13.148 --> 03:29:18.133]  He doesn't oppose climate change being set up to enact a global taxation regime.
[03:29:18.133 --> 03:29:24.721]  But he opposes the TPP and the TTIP because he said it's about free trade, and he opposes that philosophically.
[03:29:24.721 --> 03:29:26.523]  Well, it's not even about free trade.
[03:29:27.043 --> 03:29:28.744]  It's about managed trade.
[03:29:28.744 --> 03:29:31.864]  It's about trade being managed by an international commission.
[03:29:31.864 --> 03:29:34.785]  It's about an agreement that is a living document.
[03:29:34.785 --> 03:29:36.846]  And Jeff Sessions pointed that out.
[03:29:36.846 --> 03:29:42.188]  He has been advising Donald Trump since August of last year on trade issues.
[03:29:42.188 --> 03:29:44.668]  Donald Trump has talked about this for 35 years.
[03:29:44.668 --> 03:29:45.529]  Come back.
[03:29:45.529 --> 03:29:49.950]  We're going to tell you how NAFTA has worked out for the United States in the last 23 years.
[03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:51.330]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.330 --> 03:29:53.871]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.871 --> 03:29:56.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.529 --> 03:30:16.355]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[03:30:16.355 --> 03:30:28.899]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[03:30:29.039 --> 03:30:29.860]  We're good to go.
[03:30:45.675 --> 03:30:50.139]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case, because some abusers have died.
[03:30:50.139 --> 03:30:56.344]  The statute of limitations has expired, and in some cases, the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[03:30:56.344 --> 03:31:00.387]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:31:00.387 --> 03:31:02.468]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[03:31:02.468 --> 03:31:03.689]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:31:03.689 --> 03:31:05.271]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:31:05.271 --> 03:31:08.373]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:31:08.373 --> 03:31:09.514]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[03:31:09.514 --> 03:31:10.435]  I'd been working all day.
[03:31:10.435 --> 03:31:12.937]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:31:12.937 --> 03:31:13.937]  I get in here at 830.
[03:31:14.918 --> 03:31:16.519]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[03:31:16.519 --> 03:31:18.180]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:31:18.180 --> 03:31:20.062]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:31:20.062 --> 03:31:21.883]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:31:21.883 --> 03:31:22.944]  I popped two of them.
[03:31:22.944 --> 03:31:25.225]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:31:25.225 --> 03:31:27.186]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:31:27.186 --> 03:31:28.667]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:31:28.667 --> 03:31:30.008]  People really love it.
[03:31:30.008 --> 03:31:30.609]  Read about it.

[03:31:39.915 --> 03:31:43.940]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:31:43.940 --> 03:31:50.087]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[03:33:13.075 --> 03:33:18.719]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:18.719 --> 03:33:20.981]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:22.775 --> 03:33:25.917]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.917 --> 03:33:30.278]  I'm David Knight on this Super Tuesday and we have a report that's up on the Drudge Report.
[03:33:30.278 --> 03:33:35.240]  Trump supporters in Texas see their votes switched to Rubio.
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:42.083]  And these were numerous callers who flooded the Austin-based radio station KLBJ this morning with reports of mistakes after they tried to vote for Trump.
[03:33:42.083 --> 03:33:47.906]  They saw on their, somehow, and I don't know how this device works because they don't have this where I vote in Texas.
[03:33:47.906 --> 03:33:48.426]  I'm way out
[03:33:49.405 --> 03:33:53.126]  Out of Austin, as far out as I can get by choice.
[03:33:53.126 --> 03:34:00.388]  But the people who are in Austin have these fancy machines that are capable of looking at your ballots and switching them around.
[03:34:00.388 --> 03:34:03.389]  Evidently, that's what people were calling up and complaining about.
[03:34:03.389 --> 03:34:11.171]  They said numerous computer freeze-ups, other glitches were causing voter snafus at locations all around Travis County.
[03:34:11.171 --> 03:34:12.332]  Situation normal all
[03:34:13.323 --> 03:34:14.544]  Snafu it up.
[03:34:14.544 --> 03:34:21.089]  Okay, and they point out that Rubio's SuperPAC has poured one and a half million dollars of its budget into Texas.
[03:34:21.089 --> 03:34:21.830]  And here's the key.
[03:34:22.810 --> 03:34:25.212]  The last poll that we saw, Rubio was at 19%.
[03:34:25.212 --> 03:34:31.276]  If he is below a 20% threshold, he will get zero, zip, nada delegates out of Texas.
[03:34:31.276 --> 03:34:32.476]  So that's a very key thing.
[03:34:32.476 --> 03:34:48.747]  Now he does have, with the establishment backing him, 150 RNC superdelegates, which is nearly as many as if he had won every single delegate in the state of Texas, the second largest state delegate-wise for the GOP.
[03:34:48.747 --> 03:34:51.309]  So that's a big advantage that he comes in.
[03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:52.290]  They're not showing
[03:34:52.990 --> 03:34:58.095]  On the voter totals, everybody is showing how many superdelegates Hillary Clinton has lined up.
[03:34:58.095 --> 03:35:03.600]  She has lined up over 500 superdelegates before the election even started, running against Bernie Sanders.
[03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:07.263]  That has really ticked people off, and rightfully so.
[03:35:07.263 --> 03:35:10.466]  They can see that their votes don't really count nearly as much as Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:10.466 --> 03:35:13.588]  When you look at the way the votes were split, you could see that
[03:35:14.529 --> 03:35:17.230]  It took 10,000 votes in a couple of the early states.
[03:35:17.230 --> 03:35:19.771]  It was either Iowa or New Hampshire, I can't remember.
[03:35:19.771 --> 03:35:26.272]  One of those votes, I looked at it, and 10,000 votes for, I think it was in New Hampshire where he did well.
[03:35:26.272 --> 03:35:30.073]  150,000 votes and he got 15 delegates.
[03:35:30.073 --> 03:35:32.334]  So 10,000 voters for him to get one delegate.
[03:35:32.334 --> 03:35:42.037]  Or Hillary Clinton could just pick up the phone and talk to one of her buddies in the Democrat establishment and they would vote for her.
[03:35:42.677 --> 03:35:46.198]  That's the corruption that we see and of course it's every bit as bad in the RNC.
[03:35:46.198 --> 03:35:51.140]  Even worse in the sense that they're not showing the superdelegates and how they are committed.
[03:35:51.140 --> 03:36:00.563]  I mean they really should be showing that Marco Rubio has got 150 delegates in his pocket or whoever the mantle is going to go on and that's the key.
[03:36:00.563 --> 03:36:03.504]  They haven't really decided who their establishment candidate is.
[03:36:03.504 --> 03:36:08.265]  He is out front in the running for this and of course when we look at this it harkens back to Iowa.
[03:36:08.365 --> 03:36:15.550]  Remember, everybody was complaining about the fact that one of Marco Rubio's biggest financial backers was going to be counting the votes in the Iowa caucus.
[03:36:15.550 --> 03:36:26.377]  And then after it happened, everybody said, well, you know, it's interesting because, you know, Marco Rubio was polling around 12% before the election and all of a sudden he jumped up to 23%.
[03:36:26.377 --> 03:36:28.938]  Maybe there was something going on with that.
[03:36:28.938 --> 03:36:31.860]  And we might see the same type of thing happening.
[03:36:31.860 --> 03:36:35.442]  I want to get back to the trade issue because I think this
[03:36:36.764 --> 03:36:40.807]  Endorsement by Senator Jeff Sessions this last weekend was huge.
[03:36:40.807 --> 03:36:52.136]  And it was precisely why I told Alex a couple of weeks ago that I decided that I was going to vote for Donald Trump, even though I strongly disagree with him on all of the individual liberty issues.
[03:36:52.136 --> 03:36:56.240]  He's come across as very authoritarian, but of course, so did the rest of them.
[03:36:57.151 --> 03:36:58.512]  You've heard, haven't you?
[03:36:58.512 --> 03:37:03.957]  Marco Rubio bragging about how he's going to ramp up the security state.
[03:37:03.957 --> 03:37:08.341]  You've seen Ted Cruz saying that he thought that Ed Snowden was a hero.
[03:37:08.341 --> 03:37:09.983]  Now he thinks Ed Snowden is a traitor.
[03:37:09.983 --> 03:37:10.903]  He himself
[03:37:12.665 --> 03:37:30.735]  Has his own little creepy data mining system that should send shivers up and down your spine when you envision Ted Cruz as Commander-in-Chief the way he has done this kind of data analysis and manipulation of potential voters in the GOP primaries.
[03:37:30.735 --> 03:37:32.956]  But then of course there's also the character issue.
[03:37:32.956 --> 03:37:34.697]  The man who said that he was going to
[03:37:36.580 --> 03:37:42.665]  Abolish the IRS, now using the IRS as a weapon against his political opponents.
[03:37:42.665 --> 03:37:48.289]  Acting as if you were being audited by the IRS, that that somehow makes you a criminal or a bad guy.
[03:37:48.289 --> 03:37:49.490]  Does he not remember?
[03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:56.096]  Does he not remember how the Tea Party organizations were targeted by the IRS?
[03:37:57.441 --> 03:38:00.524]  And are still being targeted by the IRS?
[03:38:00.524 --> 03:38:07.370]  Would you rather have somebody who has been a victim, targeted by the IRS, continually audited by the IRS?
[03:38:07.370 --> 03:38:15.357]  Would you rather have somebody like that as president, or somebody who kind of snarkily says, oh, well, the IRS is auditing you, you must be a criminal?
[03:38:16.730 --> 03:38:20.173]  I think, of course, Donald Trump has a large staff.
[03:38:20.173 --> 03:38:21.274]  He's got a lot of lawyers.
[03:38:21.274 --> 03:38:27.879]  He doesn't feel the burden of an IRS audit like an individual would, who doesn't have the resources to deal with it.
[03:38:27.879 --> 03:38:35.965]  But it's going to give him more of an incentive to really look at what these people are doing than somebody like Ted Cruz who says he's going to help
[03:38:37.406 --> 03:38:52.394]  The Tea Party people against the IRS being used as a criminal political witch hunt and then starts dumping on people and insinuating, oh, there must be something there to hide because you're being audited by the IRS because you don't want to show your IRS tax returns.
[03:38:52.394 --> 03:38:52.814]  Seriously?
[03:38:52.814 --> 03:39:00.979]  I mean, if you want to be a constitutionalist, if you want to be an originalist, then tell us why you are a natural born citizen, Ted.
[03:39:01.906 --> 03:39:07.468]  We know you're naturalized, we know that Marco Rubio is naturalized, but neither one of you are natural-born citizens.
[03:39:07.468 --> 03:39:14.310]  And when you say in the debate, well, hey, I've argued before the Supreme Court and I know that I'm a natural-born citizen, fine.
[03:39:14.310 --> 03:39:19.611]  Have the respect for the voters to make your case as to why you're a natural-born citizen.
[03:39:19.611 --> 03:39:20.852]  I don't think you are.
[03:39:20.852 --> 03:39:24.853]  I don't think a judge, like the one that you say that you would support, would say that you are either.
[03:39:25.433 --> 03:39:38.318]  And so the first job, if you're going to be a constitutionalist, if you're going to defend the Constitution, is to respect its requirements for eligibility, even if they get in the way of your personal ambition.
[03:39:38.318 --> 03:39:39.598]  Your personal ambition.
[03:39:39.598 --> 03:39:44.480]  But let's talk about trade issues, because I think this is the positive reason to vote for Donald Trump.
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:50.522]  That and the fact that he stands up for the GOP establishment, which of course is all part of the same issue.
[03:39:51.857 --> 03:39:58.763]  Now, Donald Trump said, and it was reported by the AP yesterday, he said the NAFTA trade deal is a disaster.
[03:39:58.763 --> 03:40:00.905]  And he said he would break it.
[03:40:00.905 --> 03:40:03.427]  And they went apoplectic.
[03:40:03.427 --> 03:40:06.290]  They said, you can't break NAFTA.
[03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:09.653]  You can't stop that giant sucking sound, as Ross Perot said.
[03:40:10.333 --> 03:40:21.362]  So the AP goes out and they talk to people to tell us why that would be the end of the world if we didn't have the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is really not a free trade agreement.
[03:40:21.362 --> 03:40:23.804]  It's thousands of pages that manage our trade.
[03:40:23.804 --> 03:40:24.985]  And who do they turn to?
[03:40:24.985 --> 03:40:27.928]  They turn to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:40:28.248 --> 03:40:36.291]  They have two people there talking about what a disaster it would be, how other countries like Mexico would retaliate.
[03:40:36.291 --> 03:40:37.732]  This is what the CFR guy says.
[03:40:37.732 --> 03:40:41.133]  He said, Mexico, for instance, might scale back its purchase of U.S.
[03:40:41.133 --> 03:40:42.394]  goods.
[03:40:42.394 --> 03:40:43.034]  Oh, really?
[03:40:43.034 --> 03:40:43.935]  Oh, really?
[03:40:43.935 --> 03:40:45.915]  I think they've already done that.
[03:40:45.915 --> 03:40:48.716]  You see, we've got this thing called a trade deficit.
[03:40:48.716 --> 03:40:49.837]  Let's pull up this graphic.
[03:40:49.837 --> 03:40:51.418]  Pull up the one that shows it year by year.
[03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:53.740]  And let people take a look at this.
[03:40:53.740 --> 03:40:55.681]  The US versus Mexico trade balance.
[03:40:55.681 --> 03:40:57.381]  You can look at the trade balance.
[03:40:57.381 --> 03:40:59.202]  Look at that graph there.
[03:40:59.202 --> 03:41:05.244]  And you can see that, you know, there was a couple of years we had a small trade deficit with them, but most of the years it was positive.
[03:41:05.244 --> 03:41:06.844]  Until NAFTA was passed.
[03:41:06.844 --> 03:41:08.905]  See that big red arrow on the chart?
[03:41:08.905 --> 03:41:09.105]  Okay?
[03:41:09.611 --> 03:41:15.093]  So it's like, you know, we're plus or minus 2 to 5 billion dollars a year in a trade deficit with Mexico.
[03:41:15.093 --> 03:41:17.414]  Then all of a sudden, NAFTA is passed.
[03:41:17.414 --> 03:41:18.415]  What happens with NAFTA?
[03:41:18.415 --> 03:41:24.738]  All of a sudden, our trade deficit drops, or increases to 15 billion dollars.
[03:41:24.738 --> 03:41:27.179]  We get a trade deficit of 15 billion dollars negative.
[03:41:27.719 --> 03:41:30.980]  And then it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger every year.
[03:41:30.980 --> 03:41:31.500]  And look at that.
[03:41:31.500 --> 03:41:38.422]  We haven't had a trade surplus, but it went from going back and forth, two to five billion dollars, trading back and forth in Mexico.
[03:41:38.422 --> 03:41:39.323]  Sometimes they were up.
[03:41:39.323 --> 03:41:40.983]  Sometimes we were up.
[03:41:40.983 --> 03:41:48.145]  OK, then it goes to a negative trade deficit every year, getting down in some years to negative seventy two billion dollars.
[03:41:48.145 --> 03:41:53.807]  So you think Mexico, CFR people, you think Mexico is going to scale back its purchases of U.S.
[03:41:53.807 --> 03:41:54.627]  goods?
[03:41:54.627 --> 03:41:56.368]  Take a look at the graph they already have.
[03:41:57.108 --> 03:41:59.189]  We've got a massive trade deficit.
[03:41:59.189 --> 03:42:00.429]  They are our customers.
[03:42:00.429 --> 03:42:07.793]  That's why we shouldn't care about what Mexico and China think about quote-unquote free trade, which is really managed trade.
[03:42:07.793 --> 03:42:19.958]  When you look at this collectively, and actually on my chart I did a disservice, 916 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico since 1990 really should take, should total that from 1994.
[03:42:19.958 --> 03:42:22.279]  A million jobs were lost.
[03:42:22.279 --> 03:42:25.340]  Okay, so you look at that, a collective chart there.
[03:42:26.636 --> 03:42:36.341]  Now, it was three years ago, on the 20th anniversary of NAFTA, that the Huffington Post looked at this and they said, a million jobs lost, higher income inequality.
[03:42:36.341 --> 03:42:43.925]  They said, this study that was put out by Public Citizen, NAFTA at 20 years old, they published a report that details the wreckage.
[03:42:43.925 --> 03:42:46.466]  They said, the study makes for a blood-boiling read.
[03:42:46.466 --> 03:42:48.107]  We look at the promises by all these U.S.
[03:42:48.107 --> 03:42:50.308]  corporations about all the jobs that were going to be created.
[03:42:51.084 --> 03:42:53.264]  But there were jobs that were lost to Mexico.
[03:42:53.264 --> 03:42:55.405]  And here's their bottom line.
[03:42:55.405 --> 03:42:59.906]  They say it demonstrates why NAFTA should be renegotiated or terminated.
[03:42:59.906 --> 03:43:00.666]  Oh, yeah.
[03:43:00.666 --> 03:43:02.066]  And you know, why would they say that?
[03:43:02.066 --> 03:43:03.687]  Listen to some of the data here.
[03:43:03.687 --> 03:43:06.507]  A growing income inequality.
[03:43:06.507 --> 03:43:07.127]  They say U.S.
[03:43:07.127 --> 03:43:14.089]  trade deficit growth with Mexico and Canada has been 45% higher than with countries that are not a party to the U.S.
[03:43:14.089 --> 03:43:15.189]  Free Trade Agreement.
[03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:17.290]  In other words, our deficit grew at a 45% rate
[03:43:19.232 --> 03:43:22.374]  That was higher than the countries that were not part of the Free Trade Agreement.
[03:43:22.374 --> 03:43:32.621]  But now we're told we need to do NAFTA with all the Asian countries, TPP, with all the European countries, TTIP, okay?
[03:43:32.621 --> 03:43:38.445]  So they want to replicate the GOP establishment, the Democrat establishment.
[03:43:38.445 --> 03:43:40.307]  Understand, both of them are in on this.
[03:43:41.047 --> 03:43:53.252]  So, the establishment of both political parties want to get together with the global elite and they want to do to our country many times worse than what has happened with NAFTA.
[03:43:53.252 --> 03:44:00.215]  They also point out that our manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico grew at less than half the pre-NAFTA rate.
[03:44:01.317 --> 03:44:03.097]  It was a giant sucking sound.
[03:44:03.097 --> 03:44:06.618]  That doesn't even come close to saying what it truly was.
[03:44:06.618 --> 03:44:14.460]  Now, they said at the time, and this was Huffington Post, said we, this demonstrates why NAFTA should be renegotiated or terminated.
[03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:17.420]  What did Donald Trump say that got everybody so upset?
[03:44:17.420 --> 03:44:20.061]  He said every agreement has an end.
[03:44:20.061 --> 03:44:22.341]  Every agreement has to be fair.
[03:44:22.341 --> 03:44:26.442]  He said we're going to renegotiate NAFTA or we're going to end it.
[03:44:27.142 --> 03:44:28.403]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:44:28.403 --> 03:44:30.404]  We will renegotiate it or we will break it.
[03:44:30.404 --> 03:44:31.884]  It has been a disaster.
[03:44:31.884 --> 03:44:33.205]  He is exactly right.
[03:44:33.205 --> 03:44:36.406]  That is why Jeff Sessions said he is supporting him.
[03:44:36.406 --> 03:44:42.209]  Let me read you something from a guy who was a former communications director for Jeff Sessions.
[03:44:42.209 --> 03:44:45.811]  He's now a senior policy advisor for Donald Trump.
[03:44:46.789 --> 03:44:57.898]  And he says this, he says, uh, mass immigration, open borders, amnesty, the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, even more globalist trade deals, and the destruction of U.S.
[03:44:57.898 --> 03:45:04.203]  sovereignty are the agenda that Marco Rubio and the GOP establishment are promoting.
[03:45:04.203 --> 03:45:05.564]  Understand that.
[03:45:05.564 --> 03:45:10.708]  He said, understand everybody listening today, there is no point of return, it is not far away, it is right in front of you.
[03:45:10.708 --> 03:45:13.050]  If you cross it, there is no going back.
[03:45:13.851 --> 03:45:22.298]  And then Stephen Miller goes on to say this, and this explains why Marco Rubio is so far behind in his home state.
[03:45:22.298 --> 03:45:26.221]  He says in Florida, Mr. Rubio killed a bill to block sanctuary cities.
[03:45:26.221 --> 03:45:36.350]  And he asks, how many Floridians today have been wounded or maimed or lost a loved one because Marco Rubio didn't fight to help the bill to stop sanctuary cities?
[03:45:36.350 --> 03:45:37.291]  Who is their voice?
[03:45:37.791 --> 03:45:41.714]  He says Marco Rubio pushed to give in-state tuition to illegal aliens.
[03:45:41.714 --> 03:45:44.437]  How many young people in Florida today are in debt?
[03:45:44.437 --> 03:45:57.088]  Because that money has been held away from them so that Marco Rubio could waste the time of Florida legislature to find a way to discount tuition for illegal immigrants instead of fighting for his state's own immigrants, okay?
[03:45:57.088 --> 03:45:57.908]  And I would also say
[03:45:58.729 --> 03:46:13.096]  How are people going to be able to afford property taxes on their homes when we open the borders, as Bernie Sanders wants to do, and we bring in everyone from all over the world and provide them with free college tuition?
[03:46:13.096 --> 03:46:14.236]  How are you going to pay for that?
[03:46:14.236 --> 03:46:16.177]  How are you going to pay for that?
[03:46:16.177 --> 03:46:22.400]  When you make college free, when you subsidize it with the government, all it does is get more expensive.
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:27.883]  So it's going to ramp up into a bankruptcy type of situation very, very quickly.
[03:46:29.332 --> 03:46:39.277]  Now, one of the other things that they said in this article, looking at NAFTA at 20 years old, three years ago, they pointed out 845,000 U.S.
[03:46:39.277 --> 03:46:45.181]  workers in the manufacturing sector had been certified for Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA.
[03:46:46.581 --> 03:46:52.603]  Since NAFTA, NAFTA, because they lost their jobs due to imports from Canada and Mexico.
[03:46:52.603 --> 03:47:10.429]  So understand, they certified almost a million of the workers who lost their jobs and say well we're going to give them some kind of welfare for a short period of time to ease their anger, to get adjusted to their lower standard of living because we just sent their jobs away with NAFTA.
[03:47:11.485 --> 03:47:14.087]  That is what we're going to see on a global basis.
[03:47:14.087 --> 03:47:15.767]  We've already seen that type of thing.
[03:47:15.767 --> 03:47:21.010]  I talked about last week the shipping container ships that come over here.
[03:47:21.010 --> 03:47:22.131]  The newest one.
[03:47:22.131 --> 03:47:23.252]  Biggest one ever.
[03:47:23.252 --> 03:47:26.153]  The size of the Empire State Building.
[03:47:26.153 --> 03:47:31.356]  It comes here, it takes days or weeks to unload and yet when it goes back it's entirely empty.
[03:47:31.356 --> 03:47:34.758]  That is the picture of what is going on with our trade.
[03:47:34.758 --> 03:47:36.219]  We cannot sustain this.
[03:47:36.219 --> 03:47:38.020]  It will destroy this country.
[03:47:38.020 --> 03:47:39.241]  So that's the reason
[03:47:40.165 --> 03:47:41.766]  That I'm voting for Donald Trump.
[03:47:41.766 --> 03:47:45.449]  That's the reason you need to understand where this is all headed.
[03:47:45.449 --> 03:47:51.554]  And as far as the rest of the issues go, I've said it once and I'll say it again, nobody is going to give you your liberty.
[03:47:51.554 --> 03:47:54.696]  You're going to have to fight every inch of the way for your liberty.
[03:47:54.696 --> 03:47:57.679]  You're going to have to do that at local and state levels.
[03:47:57.679 --> 03:48:03.023]  You're going to have to get people elected at the local and state levels who are going to stand up to these out-of-control bureaucracies.
[03:48:03.023 --> 03:48:05.425]  No president is going to do that for you.
[03:48:05.425 --> 03:48:06.906]  Quite frankly, Ronald Reagan didn't.
[03:48:07.645 --> 03:48:09.486]  Many things got worse under Ronald Reagan.
[03:48:09.486 --> 03:48:10.646]  Look at the war on drugs.
[03:48:10.646 --> 03:48:14.188]  He turned it into a prosecution of individual users.
[03:48:14.188 --> 03:48:16.689]  They used it to create mandatory minimums.
[03:48:16.689 --> 03:48:22.611]  They used it to create this massive prison population, the largest the world has ever seen, here in America.
[03:48:22.611 --> 03:48:24.372]  America is a prison state.
[03:48:24.952 --> 03:48:26.393]  Bernie Sanders came out against it.
[03:48:26.393 --> 03:48:28.834]  He said, let's talk about this.
[03:48:28.834 --> 03:48:32.676]  We need to end private prisons, for-profit prisons, is what he had to say.
[03:48:32.676 --> 03:48:34.217]  And I was, I thought, yeah, that's great.
[03:48:34.217 --> 03:48:37.358]  Let's end this prison economy that we've got going.
[03:48:37.358 --> 03:48:43.522]  But his biggest problem with it wasn't so much that we had the war on drugs that was locking up so many of our people.
[03:48:43.522 --> 03:48:46.003]  His biggest problem was that somebody was making a profit from it.
[03:48:46.704 --> 03:48:51.271]  Bernie Sanders doesn't like anybody to make any money, okay?
[03:48:51.271 --> 03:48:52.253]  Typical socialist.
[03:48:52.253 --> 03:48:58.984]  So understand people that there are ways, we can agree with people, we can even come to them on the standpoint of saying...
[03:48:59.929 --> 03:49:05.894]  We need to take away the financial incentive to create this prison planet that we've created here in America.
[03:49:05.894 --> 03:49:17.405]  But the war on drugs and the mandatory minimums that we've seen from the Reagan administration, the shutting down of due process, the creation of civil asset forfeiture that just steals people's property without any due process.
[03:49:17.405 --> 03:49:18.386]  I can't understand why.
[03:49:20.928 --> 03:49:32.778]  Conservative Republicans would allow a situation where the government can come in and confiscate your house because they allege that there were teenagers that were friends of your son on the back porch smoking a joint.
[03:49:32.778 --> 03:49:34.159]  I mean, that's happened.
[03:49:34.159 --> 03:49:35.840]  That's not an exaggeration.
[03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:40.684]  I mean, why would you want to live in a country where you've got absolutely no private property rights?
[03:49:40.684 --> 03:49:42.646]  And we talk about eminent domain, and yet
[03:49:43.286 --> 03:49:51.273]  All of these candidates who say that they are on the opposite side of the issue of eminent domain from Donald Trump, they support the Keystone Pipeline!
[03:49:52.728 --> 03:49:55.510]  That tells you everything you need to know.
[03:49:55.510 --> 03:50:09.120]  I would rather have somebody who honestly comes to my face and has a disagreement with me and says, I think eminent domain is great, rather than somebody like Ted Cruz, who says, oh, eminent domain is horrible, I agree with you.
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:19.447]  We gotta get rid of that, because if we don't get rid of that, there is no such thing as private property, especially when it's done for private use, and then turns around and supports it.
[03:50:20.376 --> 03:50:22.618]  By supporting the Keystone Pipeline.
[03:50:22.618 --> 03:50:36.313]  See, that's the kind of backstabbing, lying, demagoguery that has caused people to pull back and say, you know what, I just want to give Donald Trump a chance because he is a straight shooter instead of somebody who will lie to my face.
[03:50:36.733 --> 03:50:40.617]  As we've seen from the GOP establishment over and over again, and then stabbed me in the back.
[03:50:40.617 --> 03:50:50.966]  When we come back, we're going to take a look at some allegations from the New York Times that conservative media has been part of that lying to your face, then stabbing you in the back.
[03:50:50.966 --> 03:50:51.927]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[03:53:40.813 --> 03:53:41.694]  You blew it.

[03:54:07.239 --> 03:54:08.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:08.500 --> 03:54:10.783]  I'm David Knight, your host this last segment.
[03:54:10.783 --> 03:54:16.209]  I want to talk about what the conservative media is doing to play voters.
[03:54:16.209 --> 03:54:21.034]  Before we do, I just want to let you know that we've extended the 30% off InfoWars store.
[03:54:21.034 --> 03:54:21.574]  This is the
[03:54:22.435 --> 03:54:31.698]  Once every four-year sale that we have at InfoWarsStore.com, we put 30% off as well as free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:54:31.698 --> 03:54:37.920]  We've extended that another day here, and we've extended it for InfoWars Select Storable Foods.
[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:39.420]  That is a huge discount.
[03:54:39.420 --> 03:54:40.861]  Whenever you can get not only 30% off,
[03:54:42.361 --> 03:54:48.085]  But you can get free shipping on orders of $50 or more for food, because that's a big package.
[03:54:48.085 --> 03:54:53.469]  It's even a bigger savings for the shipping on that than it is for the health products that we typically sell.
[03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:55.031]  So again, check out the sale.
[03:54:55.031 --> 03:55:03.677]  It has been extended 30% off everything at InfoWarsStore.com, including InfoWars Select Storable Food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:03.677 --> 03:55:07.020]  30% off and free shipping on everything that is $50 or more.
[03:55:07.020 --> 03:55:10.102]  A huge sale that has been extended for another day.
[03:55:10.979 --> 03:55:29.684]  Now, as we were talking in the last segment, I was talking about Senator Sessions and how he had endorsed Donald Trump this weekend, talking about the case that Donald Trump would stand against these new trade deals that are not only a bad deal for us, a catastrophic deal for us economically.
[03:55:29.684 --> 03:55:33.425]  We talked about what's happened in the last 23 years with NAFTA.
[03:55:33.425 --> 03:55:36.085]  But, of course, from a sovereignty standpoint.
[03:55:36.085 --> 03:55:37.686]  Remember, it was Senator Sessions
[03:55:38.266 --> 03:55:42.049]  Who took on Leon Panetta as Secretary of Defense.
[03:55:42.049 --> 03:55:54.139]  He said, well, if we were going to have a no-fly zone in Syria declared, he said, who would you go to, as Secretary of Defense, who would the administration, the Obama administration, go to to authorize such a thing?
[03:55:54.139 --> 03:55:59.844]  And Leon Panetta says to his face, well, we would talk to the UN and we would talk to NATO.
[03:55:59.844 --> 03:56:02.126]  He goes, I can't believe you would say that.
[03:56:02.912 --> 03:56:04.092]  You're a former congressman.
[03:56:04.092 --> 03:56:05.913]  He's like eight terms a former congressman.
[03:56:05.913 --> 03:56:08.713]  He was a chief of staff for the Clinton administration.
[03:56:08.713 --> 03:56:10.494]  He'd been CIA director.
[03:56:10.494 --> 03:56:18.876]  But of course he had absolutely, maybe because of all those things, he had absolutely no respect for the Constitution.
[03:56:18.876 --> 03:56:21.056]  And Senator Sessions was just absolutely amazed.
[03:56:21.056 --> 03:56:23.277]  You played that clip last night on the nightly news.
[03:56:23.277 --> 03:56:24.517]  You really need to see that.
[03:56:24.517 --> 03:56:27.018]  You really need to understand where Senator Sessions is coming from.
[03:56:27.018 --> 03:56:27.258]  And again,
[03:56:28.138 --> 03:56:30.300]  I don't agree with Senator Sessions on the war on drugs.
[03:56:30.300 --> 03:56:34.082]  You're never going to find anybody that you agree with on every single issue.
[03:56:34.082 --> 03:56:40.806]  If you agree with somebody on every single issue, you haven't done enough research, okay?
[03:56:40.806 --> 03:56:45.490]  You make an adult decision, and you say, I agree with him here, I disagree with him over here.
[03:56:45.490 --> 03:56:49.652]  These issues where I disagree with him, are they as vital as the ones that I agree with him on?
[03:56:49.652 --> 03:56:56.177]  Or are these issues over here where I disagree with him, are they completely washed out because all of his other competition is wrong on that issue as well?
[03:56:56.937 --> 03:57:06.464]  Now, one of the things that Stephen Miller, and of course I read this report, it was from Breitbart, about how Stephen Miller was making the case against Marco Rubio, and he quoted Rush Limbaugh.
[03:57:06.464 --> 03:57:15.610]  And he said, let's remember the warning of Rush Limbaugh, who said that if Rubio is president, within 12 to 18 months, the entirety of the donor class agenda will be implemented.
[03:57:16.755 --> 03:57:18.436]  Very strong words.
[03:57:18.436 --> 03:57:27.122]  Which made me truly amazed at the story that I saw and some of the things that I've seen Rush Limbaugh say within the last month about Marco Rubio.
[03:57:27.122 --> 03:57:28.383]  He's going back and forth.
[03:57:28.383 --> 03:57:32.585]  He's had some kind things to say about pretty much all the candidates.
[03:57:32.585 --> 03:57:33.106]  He does that.
[03:57:33.106 --> 03:57:41.852]  But today, we had the story that came out in the New York Times this last weekend about how Marco Rubio was pushing for immigration reform with the conservative media.
[03:57:42.552 --> 03:57:46.795]  He was chosen as the one from the Gang of Eight to promote this.
[03:57:46.795 --> 03:57:49.397]  And of course, that's been widely reported in the past.
[03:57:49.397 --> 03:57:51.879]  Phyllis Schlafly and many others have talked about that.
[03:57:51.879 --> 03:57:54.481]  The New York Times goes into detail.
[03:57:54.481 --> 03:58:01.445]  It talks about how he joined a push and he promoted this with Fox News.
[03:58:01.445 --> 03:58:11.613]  Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch and how they came in and said, well, we're going to try to be friendly with your amnesty plan, but we're going to need to get Rush Limbaugh on board.
[03:58:12.213 --> 03:58:18.455]  Which makes it truly amazing when I hear Rush Limbaugh say, OK, I went to that private meeting, but I didn't sign up to it.
[03:58:18.455 --> 03:58:28.899]  But then he goes on to say, even after Rubio was there, pushing for amnesty, pushing to take away our sovereignty, he still calls him a legitimate, full-throated conservative?
[03:58:28.899 --> 03:58:30.079]  A Reaganite?
[03:58:30.079 --> 03:58:31.440]  Give me a break.
[03:58:31.440 --> 03:58:31.960]  Stay with us.
[03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:34.421]  Join us tonight for the Infowars Nightly News.
[03:58:34.421 --> 03:58:38.682]  We'll give you the straight shot on what's going on tonight, 7 o'clock Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:38.682 --> 03:58:38.942]  Eastern.
[03:58:38.942 --> 03:58:40.163]  We'll cover Super Tuesday results.
