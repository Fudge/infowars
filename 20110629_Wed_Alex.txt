[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.520 --> 00:38.440]  when you're awake it is very painful to listen to the news or watch television and
[00:38.440 --> 00:46.760]  see the total immersion in propaganda and disinformation the political correctness
[00:46.760 --> 00:52.760]  that's going on that is nothing but destroying the family destroying common
[00:52.760 --> 00:59.520]  sense the prison that is being built around us the electronic control grid
[00:59.520 --> 01:03.800]  the phony environmental movement that has nothing to do with protecting the
[01:03.800 --> 01:07.760]  environment everything to do with transferring power to centralized
[01:07.760 --> 01:16.320]  organizations and groups to watch it is extremely frustrating and to steal a
[01:16.320 --> 01:25.320]  line from the matrix one cannot be told about the matrix one must see the
[01:25.320 --> 01:31.000]  matrix and so many people are caught up in left-right debates when the
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.800]  establishment simply engineers the society through the left and right that
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.800]  they control and then they limit debate and then anyone outside of that limited
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.120]  debate whether they're on what the establishment would call the left or
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.840]  right is demonized as an extremist they limit things and keep it in a very
[01:49.840 --> 01:56.800]  small box with very tight blinders on an example of this we've got a big show
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.960]  lined up today is yesterday I read a big news article out of the French news
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.560]  agency the Associated Press was also reporting on it and there are literally
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.880]  thousands of these studies they knew about it close to 80 years ago back in
[02:10.880 --> 02:21.120]  the 20s and 30s they had research on the different plastic recipes that leech
[02:21.120 --> 02:28.360]  estrogen and mimicers and and other chemicals into the food supply and I
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.640]  covered this yesterday knowing that when it later went on the web at YouTube
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.640]  and other places that a large portion of the commenters would call me a
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.800]  homophobe which again is is is another political correct term regardless of what
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.680]  your views are on this can you scientifically understand that when
[02:48.680 --> 02:54.240]  they move to ban people criticizing folks for their sexual persuasion that
[02:54.240 --> 02:57.760]  that's the end of free speech you may not agree with it you may agree with it
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.000]  regardless it's free speech but there's these calls to shut it down but but my
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.320]  discussion wasn't even about that it was that in dog studies getting pig
[03:08.320 --> 03:16.280]  studies mice rats and yes human studies BPA and it was one of many things I
[03:16.280 --> 03:24.240]  mentioned that it does causes gender confusion in all mammals and you can't
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.800]  even talk about that you can't even talk about that it increases cancer in
[03:28.800 --> 03:33.040]  males but even in females even more these are mainline stuff this is killing
[03:33.040 --> 03:39.600]  people and and folks are so politically correct they can think about nothing but
[03:39.600 --> 03:47.400]  that if you use the word homosexual you're bashing people when gay means you
[03:47.400 --> 03:52.760]  are in a good mood and it's a gay day again this is the semantical change
[03:52.760 --> 03:56.560]  heterosexual he calls them on a heterosexual it's not bashing people
[03:56.560 --> 04:02.400]  that have sex with the opposite sex which is procreation it's just like
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.680]  people are so ignorant they've trained this in the schools the media that if
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.960]  you say Anglo that's okay scientific term if you say Negro it's racist it's
[04:12.960 --> 04:19.040]  just it's a name it's a name I mean I mean it's it's it's like saying this
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.640]  species of flower has this name that species you know this species has this
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.640]  name to where people have been trained that language in fact many times when
[04:28.640 --> 04:34.920]  I've used complex words I get emails saying it's evil I mean knowledge is
[04:34.920 --> 04:41.400]  now racist words are now racist meanwhile real racism is going on
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.720]  targeting people of color the globalist are well they don't they're not even
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.080]  racist they want you dead but as long as they say they're liberal like Margaret
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.320]  Singer she can write private letters saying I want to kill the blacks but
[04:53.320 --> 04:56.360]  even the black leaders didn't say well at least she's liberal go ahead and kill
[04:56.360 --> 05:03.160]  us it's loving the ride back you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs
[05:03.160 --> 05:06.840]  generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal
[05:06.840 --> 05:10.840]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung
[05:10.840 --> 05:14.360]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.240]  in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.480]  silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[05:23.480 --> 05:27.560]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.480]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key
[05:32.480 --> 05:39.520]  target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.800]  orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video
[05:43.800 --> 05:49.920]  tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about
[05:49.920 --> 05:54.680]  how the silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any
[05:54.680 --> 06:01.120]  questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with
[06:01.120 --> 06:04.880]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.640]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[06:08.640 --> 06:13.160]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[06:13.160 --> 06:16.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[06:16.760 --> 06:21.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:21.160 --> 06:25.440]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.440 --> 06:29.200]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.320 --> 06:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.280 --> 06:41.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[06:43.840 --> 06:49.840]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[07:57.160 --> 08:05.360]  others don't he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[08:05.360 --> 08:08.320]  radio network
[08:08.320 --> 08:32.960]  it is Wednesday the 29th day of June 2011 we're gonna be live here for the
[08:32.960 --> 08:38.160]  next three hours and I have an amazing guest I've heard on other talk shows and
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.800]  I've heard no one who was able to just chronologically break down how wicked the
[08:43.800 --> 08:50.480]  TSA takeover of America is and how it's a bellwether federalization prisoner
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.160]  training program to train Americans to feel like we are worthless dirty
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.080]  criminals that line up at the Nazi checkpoints nationwide and not just in
[09:00.080 --> 09:05.640]  trains or planes or automobiles but in public buildings and shopping malls
[09:05.640 --> 09:11.720]  open spaces public commons as they call them so we're gonna be talking to Becky
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.680]  acres coming up in the second hour today joining us from Germany via video
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.360]  Skype tomorrow will be Lyndon LaRouche we also have George Humphrey former
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.160]  Austin City Council member businessman economist he's gonna be in studio with
[09:26.160 --> 09:29.760]  us tomorrow have some other big guests throughout the week obviously we had Ron
[09:29.760 --> 09:35.960]  Paul on the broadcast yesterday with a very important news Ron Paul Obama's
[09:35.960 --> 09:43.520]  Libya war is a power grab is impeachable again Ron Paul Obama's Libya war
[09:43.520 --> 09:53.040]  power grab impeachable Obama's Libyan war power grab is impeachable need to add
[09:53.040 --> 09:59.040]  an is there I believe but that article is up on info wars dot com and prison
[09:59.040 --> 10:02.560]  planet dot com right now and important to get out to everyone we need to
[10:02.560 --> 10:08.760]  continue to point out that he the presidency becomes a imperial office
[10:08.760 --> 10:15.360]  it becomes a kingdom he becomes a literal ruler if these precedents are
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.760]  allowed to continue and of course the ruler only takes orders from one group
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.800]  and that's the United Nations and they're just putting the globalist agenda in
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.680]  whether we like it or not later in the broadcast I have a microcosm of the
[10:30.680 --> 10:37.120]  United States and the rest of the world how the mafia operates now a green and
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.280]  carbon neutral formula one the debate now in Austin isn't about hundreds of
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.360]  millions of dollars to the formula one dynasty who all over Europe has gotten
[10:48.360 --> 10:54.880]  taxpayers to pay for their billion-dollar facilities now that shifted away and now
[10:54.880 --> 10:58.640]  Austin after saying they wouldn't pay for it is saying that that taxpayers will
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.360]  meanwhile the guy's daughter has two homes worth over 200 million dollars a
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.960]  piece one of them over a hundred and a million dollars the the the biggest
[11:07.960 --> 11:15.080]  mansion the US 150 mil total and don't worry her daddy's getting 250 plus
[11:15.080 --> 11:20.720]  mill but he's playing along with the global mafia the F1 will purchase carbon
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.160]  offsets or indulgences like you five hundred years ago would you try to get
[11:25.160 --> 11:29.720]  your family out of purgatory you'd have to pay the Pope well now you don't do
[11:29.720 --> 11:34.360]  that you know to get your family out of hell or out of purgatory you just pay
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.760]  the Austin City Council who openly has announced a 3.6 billion increase in the
[11:39.760 --> 11:47.120]  next three years last year so we're a year into it of all electricity cost to
[11:47.120 --> 11:51.760]  save the earth of course it really just saves the big mega banks that own the
[11:51.760 --> 11:56.000]  power companies that are raping us but hey pay more for electricity it'll it'll
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.520]  save the earth and so we'll get into all those carbon offsets also Lindsey
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.400]  Lohan and Ron Paul and something in common the Atlantic reports they try to
[12:05.400 --> 12:11.080]  make fun of her she's concerned about hyperinflation and dollar devaluation and
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.320]  likes Ron Paul so Lindsey Lohan's been off drugs a while I'm told and starting
[12:16.320 --> 12:24.040]  to join the company of men people say men yes humankind man kind so good job
[12:24.040 --> 12:27.720]  Lindsey there and we're gonna be talking more about that I mean you know
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.160]  we're they just openly say we're gonna lose the dollar as the World Reserve
[12:31.160 --> 12:38.360]  currency and the pro-fellow reserve camp followers like the Atlantic are
[12:38.360 --> 12:45.080]  scorning anyone scorning anyone that dares be involved in reality haha they're
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.720]  concerned with our currency while we're going the way of Mexico with currency
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.040]  evaluation but so what it's good to go from a first world to a third world
[12:54.040 --> 13:00.920]  nation it's fun and to have cities implementing global UN policies outside
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.880]  of law to rape everyone while all the real environmental degradation goes into
[13:05.880 --> 13:11.160]  ultra high gear just this last week I saw articles about scores of species of
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.440]  pig that are part human scores of goats that are part human scores of cross
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.680]  species human z's they're now putting on the market glowing cats in fact there
[13:21.680 --> 13:24.920]  was an article I was gonna mention yesterday it was we can repull it from
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.920]  the stack please someone to get to that later in the hour it was 10 signs of you
[13:28.920 --> 13:32.800]  know crazy genetic engineering I believe was the headline from mfo wars dot com
[13:32.800 --> 13:39.120]  and it was just the news of the last week it was a glowing cats to go on the
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.280]  market in the US that's right part jellyfish it's wonderful any idea what
[13:44.280 --> 13:47.720]  happens when you start crossing all these species you've got top genetic
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.800]  engineers on it's just absolutely destroying the earth's real biosphere
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.400]  all the earth can grow back from fires it can grow back from big big earthquakes
[13:56.400 --> 14:02.240]  it can grow back from even deforestation but of course plants bring
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.000]  carbon dioxide that we exhale it's part of the life cycle like in your terrarium
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.920]  your terrarium they're announcing carbon as a deadly nerve gas but but giant
[14:12.920 --> 14:18.200]  cyclotrons nuclear reactors everywhere leaking and blowing up not a problem
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.520]  mom be out the big global government green fascist calls for it's a sick way
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.720]  to give you false guilt so they can tax you and run your life and inspect your
[14:27.720 --> 14:30.720]  house and tell you what you can do they're using environmental laws to
[14:30.720 --> 14:38.080]  harass the Amish and and and farmers and people but big agris exempt grow up you
[14:38.080 --> 14:40.440]  know this weekend I was invited to a dinner party I talked a little bit about
[14:40.440 --> 14:43.880]  this they were admitting yes the that humans aren't gonna be needed soon and
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.000]  then everybody in the establishment microbiologist talks about there's too
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.600]  many people and getting rid of them and you know these folks I guess we're
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.680]  proud that they don't have children and then you know that they were asking well
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.240]  you know what do your children do and and and I'm well well their homeschool
[14:59.240 --> 15:06.080]  and it was like you know one you know female scientists was just matter they
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.720]  went all the spelling bees and of the highest it just oh my gosh well what
[15:09.720 --> 15:14.560]  about what about socialization you mean learning how to be a cult member
[15:14.560 --> 15:17.240]  learning how to hate your family learning how to hate the second amendment
[15:17.240 --> 15:22.000]  I mean my children go to swim meets and play basketball and with people other
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.160]  children four or five days a week there's a huge homeschool community and but
[15:27.160 --> 15:34.480]  again no connection to reality and then be one of them you know after they heard
[15:34.480 --> 15:41.400]  that they had to had to create some idea of how how we were bad and so oh they
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.280]  said to my eight-year-old son what is wrong with your eye what is wrong with
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.800]  it oh what happened to you see a little little birthmark and he says my birth
[15:50.800 --> 15:56.760]  mark and they were like oh really see spying I mean these these people are not
[15:56.760 --> 16:03.880]  connected to reality in any way shape or form and they're everywhere and it is
[16:03.880 --> 16:08.760]  their sacrament to not have children my wife has had women walk up and gripe at
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.080]  her for having three children in grocery stores you walk around and hold foods
[16:13.080 --> 16:16.600]  and you walk up to the counter and the magazines are how great it is to live
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.720]  under austerity and have nothing it's a religious sacrament to be raped and
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.680]  robbed by the bankers who taught us how to over consume who taught us how to be
[16:26.680 --> 16:31.600]  petty and destructive who built a civilization that was unsustainable so
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.960]  they could then have us completely dependent when they shut it off see it
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.400]  isn't that we're not wasting or we are wasting it's another choice or many
[16:41.400 --> 16:48.400]  other choices it's complex varied thoughts sophisticated thought your your
[16:48.400 --> 16:51.520]  thought to think one-dimensional two-dimensional certainly not three
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.560]  dimensionally certainly not four dimensionally alright I digress I digress
[16:57.560 --> 17:07.240]  here the big news is up on info wars.com right now EPA on radiation alert as
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.600]  fires reach 50 feet from Los Alamos nuke plant and this is where they've got
[17:12.600 --> 17:19.680]  all sorts of test reactors experimental systems giant storage units of nuclear
[17:19.680 --> 17:25.600]  waste the areas had nuclear testing going on for 60 years and when there's
[17:25.600 --> 17:33.840]  fires it releases all of that carbon all of that all of that chaff all of that
[17:33.840 --> 17:41.240]  dust into the atmosphere but don't worry suddenly we've got the plant on the
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.680]  river there in Nebraska confirmed to be flooding on emergency backup generator
[17:46.680 --> 17:52.320]  power don't worry Fukushima five of the six damage three with complete meltdown
[17:52.320 --> 17:57.000]  they knew that the first week covered it up and don't worry Canada with a huge
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.360]  leak that happened three months ago don't worry because even though the
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.920]  Northern Hemisphere has double the normal radiation and rising the EPA has
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.520]  just risen the level they say is safe they've just and there's no alerts
[18:11.520 --> 18:15.200]  about don't drink the milk there's no alerts about we better not let especially
[18:15.200 --> 18:20.120]  children who have fast-growing cells on average radiation has ten times the
[18:20.120 --> 18:26.320]  negative effects on them even more on fetuses no discussions about it this is
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.800]  many times confirmed months ago many times Chernobyl each Fukushima reactor
[18:31.800 --> 18:38.000]  blowing sky high including the mox three the the the mox reactor at reactor
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.920]  three the 644,000 fuel rods stored on top blown sky high up to a mile and a half
[18:44.920 --> 18:48.360]  away the Japanese government just covered them up with bulldozers leaking
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.200]  into the water getting into the atmosphere covering the entire United
[18:52.200 --> 18:58.960]  States off the charts Chernobyl and this in 1986 the UN even admits over a
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.240]  million people contracted and died of cancer since then from Fukushima in
[19:02.240 --> 19:08.400]  their actuaries they're not worried now because they wave a magic wand and say
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.560]  eat the produce doesn't matter of months ago it tested all over the United States
[19:13.560 --> 19:19.280]  in vegetables it tested in all the major milk off the charts 300 500 depending
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.240]  on the state I mean they had Vermont milk testing hundreds of times above
[19:23.240 --> 19:28.920]  normal levels and their answer is you know what is this radioactive orgy
[19:28.920 --> 19:35.720]  begins it's not a problem we raise the level of what we say is safe but my
[19:35.720 --> 19:40.040]  gosh we've got to raise all your taxes and we got a micromanage everything you
[19:40.040 --> 19:44.400]  do because when you exhale carbon dioxide that plants respirate from it is a
[19:44.400 --> 19:52.040]  nerve gas of death it is it is evil the breath is evil the radiation is Valhalla
[19:52.040 --> 20:00.840]  let us bathe in it like the cancers grow oh Gaia loves it give us more we all

[22:01.480 --> 22:05.680]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[22:05.680 --> 22:10.680]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[22:10.680 --> 22:14.280]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[22:14.280 --> 22:19.320]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[22:19.320 --> 22:24.680]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[22:24.680 --> 22:29.600]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.960]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[22:37.720 --> 22:41.680]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[22:41.680 --> 22:47.240]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[24:22.000 --> 24:26.400]  hand them over to the bankers for debt the bankers created before I get into
[24:26.400 --> 24:32.960]  the fires approaching Los Alamos before I get into all the other news let me go
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.680]  ahead now and to go over a few things that just came out in the last week
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.760]  genetic modification gone wild 10 signs that our world may be destined to
[24:41.760 --> 24:46.440]  resemble a really bad science fiction movies is from the American dream we
[24:46.440 --> 24:54.200]  also posted it at info wars.com and going over this number one in China
[24:54.200 --> 25:02.040]  scientists have inserted human genes into DNA of dairy cow embryos at this
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.120]  point approximately 200 hybrid cows have been successfully produced they feed
[25:07.120 --> 25:10.800]  the milk to the military because after all their slaves these cows can produce
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.520]  milk that is virtually identical to human breast milk the scientists hope to
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.200]  have huge herds of these cows producing an alternative to human breast milk soon
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.240]  and they hope to have the milk sold in global supermarket markets within three
[25:22.240 --> 25:26.120]  years number one in Canada scientists at the University of Guelph in the
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.720]  province of Ontario and produce what they're calling in viral pigs these
[25:29.720 --> 25:35.440]  environment viral pigs get goes on to have the genes from my spliced into them
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.560]  and accordingly now the scientists and accordingly the scientists to say that
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.840]  they produce less phosphorus in their excrement so that they are being
[25:45.840 --> 25:48.960]  touted as environmentally friendly authorities in both the US and Canada
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.240]  are evaluating whether or not to allow in viral pigs into the food supply
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.160]  there's already cloned food in the food supply and of course they won't let you
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.200]  know in labeling if it is they won't let you know the salmon is part insect
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.280]  and other fish mixed in and again when you splice these genes does as all sorts
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.040]  of unintended consequences but a lot of them are intended a lot of times the
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.520]  reason they engineered something is just the cover in every major study of the
[26:14.520 --> 26:21.800]  GMO crops they've put out the staple food crops they always reduce fertility in
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.800]  every major rodent study just pull it up scientists in Japan have created a
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.600]  genetically modified mouse that tweets like a bird yeah 30 years ago they had
[26:30.600 --> 26:37.080]  mice that grew human ears on their backs number four one US corporation can now
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.560]  produce a very muscular monster salmon which can grow up to three times as
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.560]  fast as normal salmon do and major university studies show within 40
[26:46.560 --> 26:51.320]  generations it will extinct the open sea normal salmon that's okay that's 40
[26:51.320 --> 26:54.840]  years scientists can now can now produce cats that glow in the dark a
[26:54.840 --> 27:00.600]  genetically modified cat created by scientists named mr. Green was the very
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.760]  first fluorescent cat in the United States but mr. Green jeans was not the
[27:03.760 --> 27:07.320]  first clone the dark cat in the world that honor went to the cat created by a
[27:07.320 --> 27:12.280]  team of scientists in South Korea in Japan scientists have discovered that
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.520]  they can grow rat organs inside of mice these researchers hope to use the same
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.320]  technology to grow human organs inside pigs that was going on 15 years ago by
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.960]  the way this is all old news just that they had human clones 15 plus years ago
[27:24.960 --> 27:31.000]  but they only grow them up to a certain size inside the cow uterus and then they
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.120]  change its genes a little so that it won't be rejected by the cow so they
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.440]  say well it's not really a human clone because it's a small percentage cow now
[27:40.440 --> 27:44.520]  they get all you can't tell it's got that it's a cow doesn't have like a cow
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.840]  snout or cow ears it has cow genetics and so they say well you don't have
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.440]  rights and then they harvest them and use them China on record actually takes
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.000]  the babies if they catch you having more than one child especially if you have
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.080]  two they take the baby they've now discovered and don't just drown them it's
[28:01.080 --> 28:03.840]  their favorite thing throw them in a tank and use them for medical parts and
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.240]  cosmetics collagen that's sold in the United States and Europe to rich women
[28:08.240 --> 28:14.160]  but also I guess metrosexual men they now keep the babies alive and grow
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.760]  organs in them and things but hey too many people so it's a good thing we're
[28:19.760 --> 28:24.240]  gonna hear all day you know about about a baby killed and did the mommy do it and
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.000]  who put the baby in the woods and you know every news channel kept covering it
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.320]  but meanwhile they got kids and tanks just in torture hell and they've got
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.520]  these embryos you know in tanks I've talked to scientists that work at the
[28:36.520 --> 28:39.920]  facilities that are part animals so they don't have rights and you know the
[28:39.920 --> 28:42.760]  babies are grown up larger to grow organs in them and they're they're
[28:42.760 --> 28:47.200]  gulping for milk and gulping for air in the tanks it's all part of the freedom
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.920]  science 30 years ahead at least giant control grids the water the food all
[28:51.920 --> 28:55.880]  poisoned so there won't be any families you want to be able to be attracted to
[28:55.880 --> 29:00.760]  men or women just pure hell released just poured out upon everyone and the
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.880]  mass extermination genetic warfare will be released and they're not gonna eat the
[29:04.880 --> 29:07.960]  cops or military anymore everything's gonna be robotic as soon as they have
[29:07.960 --> 29:11.920]  the factories completed to work on the robots and service the robot drones and
[29:11.920 --> 29:15.760]  ground ground forces and the robot tanks they've had for at least 20 years
[29:15.760 --> 29:20.480]  they're humming my god hell's gonna be released on everybody and all of you
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.200]  laughing conditioned people I can't even get mad at you because you were put in
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.280]  front of the television at birth and your diapers and sent into a mesmerized

[29:37.120 --> 29:41.240]  giggle and laugh when you hear the truth that's why you get so upset women are
[29:41.240 --> 29:44.640]  laughing right now because you know I'm telling them that the bisphenol a

[34:48.600 --> 34:52.200]  world may be destined to resemble a really bad science fiction movie it
[34:52.200 --> 34:58.760]  already resembles it but the public on average spends now around six hours a
[34:58.760 --> 35:04.800]  day in a lower brain state when you're watching television it brings you into a
[35:04.800 --> 35:11.920]  lower brain state major universities for more than 60 years non-stop do
[35:11.920 --> 35:18.520]  studies of how to flicker the rate and how to put information embedded in the
[35:18.520 --> 35:23.120]  transmission to manipulate your mind you can read the studies but I've been
[35:23.120 --> 35:30.040]  given internal tours that I wasn't even supposed to get of the University of
[35:30.040 --> 35:39.360]  Texas psychology department monkeys by the thousands in cages by the hundreds
[35:39.360 --> 35:47.120]  strapped in with their eyes wired open watching flicker rates on television sets
[35:47.120 --> 35:54.240]  and commercials all engineered to assault you viciously all DARPA funded I
[35:54.240 --> 36:05.320]  saw that ten years ago I'm not gonna even get into it that is right down the
[36:05.320 --> 36:09.760]  street from here and I was able to see the monkeys by remote control out at
[36:09.760 --> 36:14.000]  Bastrop I was watching them from cameras the scientists sit in there you go to the
[36:14.000 --> 36:22.880]  next DARPA funded room it's pornography and how to confuse gender through
[36:22.880 --> 36:29.040]  messages on television department of defense I'm taking to the next room
[36:29.040 --> 36:59.040]  Every room Darpa Darpa DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARpa DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DAR
[36:59.040 --> 37:06.320]  you. The Google NSA data gathering system is designed to predict the future and it's
[37:06.320 --> 37:13.040]  able to do it. Individually, they say as of last year, 93% of the time, 99% of the time,
[37:13.040 --> 37:21.080]  they can predict major mass movements. And as they get more data fed in to this system,
[37:21.080 --> 37:26.040]  which was always their goal, Isaac Asimov's Foundation series written in what the 40s
[37:26.040 --> 37:37.400]  is about that and the rules of robotics, what man envisioned has now become real. And that's
[37:37.400 --> 37:40.800]  why they're so arrogant. That's why they don't care. I'm going to explain this again
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.240]  to you. Your food, your water, you just think they stop with fluoride that sevenfold increase
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.400]  in cancer in the bones. You think they just stop with bisphenol A and almost all the plastic
[37:51.400 --> 37:58.760]  and the printer ink that you touch and then reduces your fertility. That's all old tech.
[37:58.760 --> 38:04.560]  60 years. Everywhere there's where there's rebellious people, the United States, Ireland,
[38:04.560 --> 38:18.400]  the Basque in Spain. Those were chemical weapon programs developed in the 20s and 30s on record.
[38:18.400 --> 38:25.000]  Do you know what they're doing with the rice and the corn and the wheat and the soybeans
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.800]  continuing here? Notice I'm spending more and more time on this because I realize everything
[38:29.800 --> 38:35.680]  else is now a side issue. You've got to realize most of this is a distraction, a diversion,
[38:35.680 --> 38:44.400]  a false construct. We have a breakaway technocratic civilization in the universities, in the government,
[38:44.400 --> 38:55.960]  international security doing whatever they want. And only by compartmentalized people
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.800]  in the system waking up and going, wow, how does this guy know all of this? See, I'm pointing
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.520]  out things you already know but never connected. And then begging you to go read the white
[39:04.520 --> 39:11.640]  papers while they're still public before they bring in the Borg centralized censored web,
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.840]  which they're openly calling for. But Japan is the only one doing this kind of research
[39:15.840 --> 39:24.000]  in Missouri. Universities are engineering. Part pig and part human are being grown with
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.880]  the goal of providing organs for human transplants. Always sounds great. Number eight, scientists
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.520]  at Rockefeller University have injected human genes into mice. These humanized mice are
[39:32.520 --> 39:37.240]  being used to study the spread of hepatitis C, you're told. U.S. scientists have discovered
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.960]  that they can actually grow new human organs from scratch. The following is a quote from
[39:41.960 --> 39:48.840]  the recent Newsweek article. It goes on. And Japan, they're coming out with feces that
[39:48.840 --> 39:58.200]  is then transmutated into meat. Folks won't believe that type in Japan, feces to meat.
[39:58.200 --> 40:02.200]  We'll show folks the article. Here's another one. Believe it or not, a company in Canada
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.640]  known as Nexia has actually taken goats and genetically modified them to part spider.
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.000]  Yeah, 19 years ago, this was made public that it was going on a decade before by the Pentagon.
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.600]  They then just privatized the gene sequencing. And last time I checked, there were five companies
[40:17.600 --> 40:23.600]  doing it in the U.S. alone. And I was at 15 years ago, I had the CEO on bragging about
[40:23.600 --> 40:30.760]  how they have these goats released in the open. And when you zoologically cross animals,
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.680]  it causes major problems. Diseases and insects can then get into mammals. Yeah, let's put
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.440]  that back on screen for folks because I want to read the headline for radio listeners.
[40:39.440 --> 40:45.360]  Japan's scientists synthesize this meat from human feces. There you go. I hope to bring
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.600]  it on the market for you and your family. And it goes on as frightening as all of these
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.160]  examples may sound. And this is all ancient news. The truth is, the genetic modification
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.920]  of plants has gone even further. Yeah, some crops have over 100 insect plant and human
[41:00.920 --> 41:10.280]  genes in them. Decade ago, they had pharmacological crops growing live HIV. This is all being
[41:10.280 --> 41:19.200]  done today. Approximately 93% of all soybeans and possibly 80% of all corn in the United
[41:19.200 --> 41:25.440]  States, and that's a low number, have a genetically modified. No, no, almost 100% of all corn
[41:25.440 --> 41:31.720]  varieties worldwide, including 10,000 year old corn varieties in Mexico are now contaminated.
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.000]  They're gone. They're dead. It's over. But don't worry, they're going to tax that carbon
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.520]  dioxide you're exhaling. And they're going to raise the radiation levels of what's safe.
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.160]  Everything's fine. They're going to tax what plants respirate from and then put off oxygen
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.880]  for us. Now they couldn't come out and tax oxygen because you even the dumbest people
[41:52.880 --> 41:59.440]  know that's good. So carbon dioxide sounds like monoxide, just like you can go out and
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.640]  get most people to sign a form calling for banning dihydrogen monoxide. You know what
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.160]  dihydrogen monoxide is? It's water. Most people will sign forms and the studies have
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.880]  been done. Over 90% will sign forms to ban sodium chloride sounds scary. Do you know what
[42:17.880 --> 42:25.320]  sodium chloride is? Sodium chloride is salt. Let's worry about salt. Let's worry about
[42:25.320 --> 42:31.640]  water. Let's worry about carbon dioxide. But let's splice everything and release it open
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.040]  air. Let's do it. Let's let's have the system openly write white papers on it in the 20s,
[42:37.040 --> 42:45.760]  30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. I've got but you and biological diversity assessments.
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.400]  Where they state in the 96 one they said we need to encourage war, famine, we need to
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.120]  cut off resources to reduce population and we need to encourage homosexuality. Now see
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.200]  this isn't a moral statement for me. Let's get that out of the way. Everybody's fetish
[43:01.200 --> 43:07.400]  of obsessing on this. I obsess on the stars and genetics and flowers and beauty and green
[43:07.400 --> 43:17.360]  grass and streams and okay. I'm not all upset and you know freaked out and everything's
[43:17.360 --> 43:24.080]  bombarded with this stuff constantly. I'm above it. I'm above your silly paradigms.
[43:24.080 --> 43:29.360]  You know and all the latent gay people that obsess and bash gay people all day. I'm not
[43:29.360 --> 43:37.600]  talking about that group either. I'm talking about you having what you are as a ancient
[43:37.600 --> 43:42.920]  genetic expression of this beautiful planet being manipulated in the embryonic phase and
[43:42.920 --> 43:49.080]  after so that you won't have children. So there won't be a family unit that tribally
[43:49.080 --> 43:54.200]  defend each other. So there's no opposition to the global hive Borg and the end of our
[43:54.200 --> 43:59.040]  species that has been stated. This is the end of us, the end of humanity, the end of human
[43:59.040 --> 44:05.520]  kind, the end of it all, the end of it. The globalists are psychopaths. They are sadists.
[44:05.520 --> 44:10.040]  They love war and death and ugliness. You read the New York Times and other reports about
[44:10.040 --> 44:20.600]  art. The hottest art for two decades now is buckets of pus, photos of dead babies, skulls.
[44:20.600 --> 44:26.000]  As a tithe, the Fortune 100 and others and the top bankers who buys this stuff in the
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.720]  news will come in and pay $37 million for a bucket of pus with maggots in it. To worship
[44:33.720 --> 44:39.200]  it, it is a tithe. It is taking stuff they stole from families and people they destroyed
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.960]  and old people they robbed and buying a jar of pus with maggots. It is a worship of it.
[44:45.960 --> 44:51.040]  It is a conjuring of dark energies. Why do you think Lady Gaga and the rappers, it's
[44:51.040 --> 44:56.200]  all about psychopath killing, killing your husband, killing your wife, kidnapping children,
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.920]  murder. Lady Gaga is going to have a concert with executed, this is in the news, executed
[45:00.920 --> 45:07.280]  Chinese dissidents sliced open in big vats of formaldehyde. That is to train you that
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.600]  it is exciting and beautiful so that when you get run over, when you get killed, when
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.640]  you get soft killed, the system will love it. They are turning our atmosphere into who
[45:16.640 --> 45:24.880]  they are. Hell, a very crack in dimensional Hades is releasing this. Does it matter if
[45:24.880 --> 45:30.720]  you're religious? Does it matter if you believe in nothing? Manifest death is being injected
[45:30.720 --> 45:40.040]  psychically and physically into us so we will stand down.
[45:40.040 --> 45:45.040]  Now let me break this down for you, okay, because I'm tired of the denial. How many
[45:45.040 --> 45:51.640]  times did I tell you that television gives you Alzheimer's? I want to show people this,
[45:51.640 --> 45:55.680]  type in television Alzheimer's, hundreds of articles, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[45:55.680 --> 45:59.160]  and hundreds and hundreds, probably in the thousands. I've seen hundreds of studies.
[45:59.160 --> 46:08.240]  They knew it takes you into a near dream hypnotized state within minutes of watching it. The
[46:08.240 --> 46:14.080]  first time you watch television on average, it takes 45 to 50 minutes. After you click
[46:14.080 --> 46:21.400]  and sync, folks, your eyes are brain stocks. They are your brain. They are brain tissue.
[46:21.400 --> 46:29.760]  Your eyes are a neural, visual device taking in the information. They can send carrier waves
[46:29.760 --> 46:35.160]  over it. They can put subliminals in it, but more importantly is the flicker. I saw more
[46:35.160 --> 46:39.840]  articles today. Oh, my God, it's so evil about the light bulbs and how they're going to be
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.880]  programming us. That's why by law they're putting in the fluorescence and taking out
[46:44.880 --> 46:51.120]  the phosphorescence where they can flicker them to calm the public. I mean, folks, we
[46:51.120 --> 46:58.000]  are in the matrix. Our brain is a matrix. Our brain is what we see the world through.
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.200]  We are physically here, but the brain is a virtual reality matrix. And they're programming
[47:03.200 --> 47:11.400]  that with outside stimuli, electronic, magnetic, but also chemical. They've already got most
[47:11.400 --> 47:17.360]  of you. Most of you can't even, I'm not able to get to you. My children, though, I can't
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.280]  even control myself with the computers and the wireless and the children are already
[47:21.280 --> 47:24.920]  getting addicted to the internet, addicted even though we tried to use it for education.
[47:24.920 --> 47:31.040]  I'm losing them. They're being sucked in. They're becoming pre-wireheads, cyber punks,
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.960]  whatever you want to call it. We've got to realize that we need to have a huge debate
[47:35.960 --> 47:42.320]  about this now and break out of the trance. Please, please, there's still time. I'm reaching
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.240]  through to you through the matrix system. I'm reaching through interfacing with your
[47:47.240 --> 47:57.640]  visual brain antennae, your eyes. I'm going through the nerve endings in your ears right
[47:57.640 --> 48:04.120]  now. I'm reaching through to you. They're attacking it all. They're attacking it all.
[48:04.120 --> 48:10.040]  They're attacking your hormone levels because most of sexual activity is communicated, especially
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.560]  with females through olfactory smell, through males visual with an olfactory overlay where
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.560]  your brain scans. Does this mate have good hormones? Does this mate have good organs?
[48:20.560 --> 48:28.320]  Does your brain knows, does this mate have a uterus? Does this mate, will this mate produce
[48:28.320 --> 48:37.800]  enough milk? The nose, brain tissue in the olfactory, your multi-dimensional scanning
[48:37.800 --> 48:45.440]  system. Now, what happens with the mice? I'm going to get to that in a moment. Here at
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.800]  Ethanine Telegraph, radio makes Britons happier than TV and web. And this is a new study they've
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.480]  done, but again, these are legion. Radio, when you're listening, you have to image everything
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.000]  I'm saying. If I say blue whale, you see a blue whale. It made your brain manifest that
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.080]  image and cause neural connections. If I say red bicycle, you're seeing red bicycle. If
[49:05.080 --> 49:11.000]  I say Marilyn Monroe, you're seeing Marilyn Monroe. If I say George Strait, you're scanning
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.520]  for George Strait. I say Jesus Christ, you image the archetypal image of Christ. If
[49:15.520 --> 49:23.960]  I say cross, if I say gold, you image gold bars or gold coins. Radio, you have to image.
[49:23.960 --> 49:31.080]  Television, you do not have to image and it causes a downgrading in brainwaves and that's
[49:31.080 --> 49:35.760]  what this latest London Telegraph article gets into and causes depression. Another big
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.920]  study came out yesterday and that was dealing with children that watch TV at night, don't
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.080]  sleep well and don't have proper brainwave patterns during sleep and it disrupts their
[49:45.080 --> 49:49.720]  sleep. I've noticed that anytime I let my children watch even a classic movie at night,
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.640]  then they don't sleep, they run around the house all night, they wake up, they cry. Did
[49:53.640 --> 50:00.160]  we find the Alzheimer's article, Alzheimer's TV? I believe BBC, AP Reuters, just Alzheimer's
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.120]  TV. I want to show folks that's the case they think I'm joking. You're under assault. You're
[50:05.120 --> 50:12.000]  under total assault. Now yesterday I got up here and I explained, yes, they had Romans
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.720]  having sex with each other. Yes, that goes on. I'm going above debates of you guys trying
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.360]  to make this a moral issue one way or the other and look at the scientific facts. They're
[50:23.360 --> 50:30.640]  as BBC, TV link to Alzheimer's. Now, continuing. That was 2001. They've known it since they
[50:30.640 --> 50:38.280]  invented it. When I came out and explained they're trying to cause gender confusion in
[50:38.280 --> 50:44.200]  your brain chemicals and the pheromones you put off. I was reading from French news agency,
[50:44.200 --> 50:50.280]  but still they use the political correct term to kill debate and said homophobe and the George
[50:50.280 --> 50:54.520]  Soros outfits yesterday because they don't want you knowing what they're doing. Let's
[50:54.520 --> 51:00.920]  talk about the breast cancer then. Is that wrong to tell women what's killing them? Probably.
[51:00.920 --> 51:06.260]  Most Americans believe famine and hunger will never happen. But what if day one may end
[51:06.260 --> 51:13.160]  and breaks out at grocery stores? Day three, families are on edge. Day five, the neighbors
[51:13.160 --> 51:21.320]  come knocking. Day 10, small bands of thieves begin stealing at gunpoint. Day 15, desperation,

[54:12.680 --> 54:19.680]  Alright, I want to just again break something down for you. Several months ago the EPA raged
[54:24.960 --> 54:31.960]  the levels of safe radiation depending on the dozens of isotopes from 100 times to 100
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.160]  thousand times what it previously was. You can go to the EPA's website and now even the
[54:37.160 --> 54:42.800]  Associated Press a few weeks ago when it became official reported on it. They're now saying
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.160]  certain isotopes can be 100,000 times higher. Most of them were 2,000, 3,000 times. It was
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.520]  a big list of them. I read them on air over and over and over again. This isotope can
[54:52.520 --> 54:58.240]  now be 25,000 times. This one 100,000. This one 100. This one 500. And that's because
[54:58.240 --> 55:04.000]  it was coming up in water supplies in San Francisco and other areas of 500 times, 300 times. They
[55:04.000 --> 55:11.000]  just say, hey, it's fine. It comes out now that for eight years at at least four or five
[55:11.320 --> 55:16.440]  airports, Boston Logan is the one where this stuff all came out, that they had been testing
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.760]  the body scanners and the cancers went off the charts. No kidding. Eight hours a day,
[55:20.760 --> 55:27.760]  their own internal studies, radiation coming out, you're being living in a microwave. And
[55:28.440 --> 55:31.600]  I mean, no kidding. When you see the body scan photos TSA released, and many of them
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.240]  you can see the skeleton. You can see the fingers. You can see the bones and the fingers
[55:36.240 --> 55:42.240]  in the hand. That's like a dental x-ray. You can see the cartilage and the bone in the nose.
[55:42.240 --> 55:49.240]  Look at those photos. It's going through your skin. These people worked there and they knew.
[55:49.240 --> 55:56.000]  The government knew it was a death sentence for the TSA. These people are insane, but there's
[55:56.000 --> 56:03.000]  a sick, insane plan to it. So find my stack here from what I was covering. And I'm digging
[56:09.640 --> 56:12.760]  through more of this. I'm going to do a special report later in the week of not next week
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.040]  that'll get millions of views because I want to just show overwhelming documents, UN documents
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.040]  that said, encourage the end of the family. Well, I even have a Department of Education
[56:21.040 --> 56:26.040]  documents that said the family is archaic and is barbaric and will be expunged and that
[56:26.040 --> 56:31.680]  families are, quote, mentally ill and the institution is inherently bad. These are quotes.
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.200]  And then look what they've done. It's not some judgment on what people are doing. Were
[56:36.200 --> 56:39.960]  there people in history that were naturally one way or the other? I'm not making a judgment
[56:39.960 --> 56:51.960]  on you. Any more than I'm making a judgment on the French news agency article yesterday.
[56:51.960 --> 56:58.960]  Let me find it here. Chemical in plastic containers makes male mice act like females. And then
[57:01.040 --> 57:06.080]  the females smell the pheromones off of them and they're not attracted and will not have
[57:06.080 --> 57:11.800]  sex with the male mice. And you go into all the other studies. This has been studied for
[57:11.800 --> 57:18.080]  again, 80 years or more. They knew exactly what they were doing. You see, it's more
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.080]  than that. Women are now not attracted to men because their brains are smelling the
[57:24.080 --> 57:31.200]  men, the pheromones. And they don't know why. Well, that guy, it looks good, but something
[57:31.200 --> 57:38.200]  about him. That's why women, when foreigners come in from third world countries and haven't
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.720]  been here long, go crazy. You'll see women go right up. They could be Eastern European.
[57:42.720 --> 57:45.760]  They could be from Latin America. They're ready to get their clothes off as fast as
[57:45.760 --> 57:52.720]  possible. They're like, whoa, I am ready right now. I mean, this is a, we don't have children
[57:52.720 --> 57:57.480]  in the West. The West is dying. We're not even replacing our numbers. Europe is collapsing.
[57:57.480 --> 58:02.880]  Japan is collapsing. They've been doing it to the Japanese men. Japan has won a 1.2 replacement.
[58:02.880 --> 58:09.440]  There won't be any Japanese in a couple generations. The globalists, wherever they got control,
[58:09.440 --> 58:13.320]  have been testing it. Now they're moving it to the third world. This isn't about gay,
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.360]  heterosexual, any of this. It's about destroying who we are. No wonder record numbers of men
[58:18.360 --> 58:24.360]  want to put dresses on and they're attracted to men. They're, you're women. You're women.
[58:24.360 --> 58:28.360]  Women aren't attracted to you because you're a woman. So you're attracted to men because
[58:28.360 --> 58:33.640]  chemically in your brain, you are now attracted to men. Do you understand them? That's, that's
[58:33.640 --> 58:40.640]  one section of this, but that's why it's growing just like the mice. We'll be right back.
[58:40.640 --> 58:51.960]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network. This is Alex Jones with five good
[58:51.960 --> 58:57.000]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[58:57.000 --> 59:01.520]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants
[59:01.520 --> 59:06.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[59:06.480 --> 59:11.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[59:11.520 --> 59:16.320]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[59:16.320 --> 59:21.080]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[59:21.080 --> 59:25.520]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[59:25.520 --> 59:30.440]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.120]  of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[59:34.120 --> 59:40.520]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[59:40.520 --> 59:46.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:46.320 --> 59:57.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the
[59:57.000 --> 01:00:11.720]  GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:19.600]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:47.520]  Texas, Alex Jones. We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. We are now in the little five
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:55.360]  minute segment here and I wanted to talk to you about the chemical, biological, radiological
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:02.560]  attack on what the species is. The global engineers do not want there to be families
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.560]  and they're on record saying this. They want to chemically alter who humans are. If you
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:19.860]  go back to Aldous Huxley in 1932 publishing Brave New World, the vast majority of the
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:26.520]  population are suboid minions and they are sexless or they are hemaphrodites who are
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:34.760]  not allowed to breed and who are genetically engineered to be low IQ and servile. Before
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.480]  Huxley died in 1962, he had written many nonfiction books. He spilled the beans in a Berkeley
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.520]  speech and other speeches and writings admitting that his brother was a eugenicist as he was
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.880]  and his family had been part of a British government breeding program going on from
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.920]  the 1860s on. That's also public information but he talked about it. And he said that he'd
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.280]  already been in facilities then with microchips that weren't even supposedly invented yet,
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.960]  hired in to people's brains to control them and manipulate them. He said chemically and
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:21.200]  biologically that the public was being manipulated and that within 50 years the plan was to roll
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:31.840]  this out widespread. Now, in the last few days I covered articles like this one. Chemicals
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.440]  in plastic containers make male mice act like females. Turns them into females. The females
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.040]  smell them and don't want to have sex with them because they see them as females. The
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.200]  females are hyper-feminized and it accelerates their aging. That's why our girls are going
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.520]  into puberty at 13, 12, 10, you know, now as young as five, some even age three, put
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.440]  that into a search engine, three-year-olds now going into puberty in the West. The biggest
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.240]  contributor is bisphenol-A. Also fluoride accelerates development. So the males are
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.880]  female now to a certain extent and females are hyper-female. So they grow taller now.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.200]  You notice with women are outpacing boys in the generational increase in growth. Women's
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.360]  breast cancer is off the charts directly linked to bisphenol-A. That's in almost all plastic
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:29.080]  products, the lining of juice boxes, tin cans for soda, for coax, everything. And in the
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.880]  studies it turned the mice into females. And if you get into deeper into the studies, there's
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.720]  a whole bunch of them, the males start getting confused and trying to have sex with each
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.600]  other. Now is that saying that 5,000 years ago there weren't men who were attracted to
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.600]  men for whatever reason? You know, the point is for whatever reason that's gone on throughout
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.160]  history. But this is artificially being done and a lot of people will then defend what's
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.280]  artificially been done to them. My point is, and we'll actually defend putting bisphenol-A
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.320]  in there, like, yeah, that's great, we're taking over. See, people then love what has
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:05.880]  been done to them. And then that's a tendency. It's, what's the term, Stockholm syndrome?
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.920]  Loving their abusers. Taking what you were and changing it. Now, that's an oversimplification.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.720]  There's a lot of other factors going on. But look, am I homophobic towards homaphrodite
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:23.600]  frogs? No, it's a scientific fact that all over the world, where our wastewater's dumped
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.200]  in, where these chemicals were being fed, that we excrete, that the fish, the amphibians
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:36.000]  are becoming gender-confused. Discovery news, more homophrodite fish in U.S. rivers, male
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.080]  fish with female anatomy are appearing in rivers across the country. And then, of course,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.840]  Air Force looked in to spray, to turn enemy gay. They could spray female hormones on them
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.200]  that in studies would make them in uncontrollably start having sex with each other. BPA receipts
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:59.280]  bombshell, paper slips contain high levels, a bisphenol-A, dirty money, BPA on dollar bills.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.480]  They're sterilizing us. The folks at eFoods Direct have saved you from the huge price increases
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.360]  on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves. They haven't
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.060]  increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year. But the rising
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.360]  cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.640]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship

[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:12.080]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.880]  from underneath the Americans at home. We have a tremendous influence on our president
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.120]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.760]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:33.360]  our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.200]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists are asking
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.400]  for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.720]  Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:03.200]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. This communications radio network proudly
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.600]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:19.320]  Okay, we're going to our guest on the chronicles of TSA crimes coming up here in just a few
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:25.520]  minutes. Recapping of the top stories, EPA on radiation alert as fires reach 50 feet
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:32.600]  from Los Alamos. Nuke plant, of course, in Nebraska. Nuke plant days ago flooded and
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:38.880]  is on emergency backup power. Fukushima continues to melt down and spew radiation sky high coming
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:44.840]  into the United States and radiating Japan. Ron Paul says Obama's Libyan War power grab
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.960]  is an impeachable offense. That big breaking news is up at infowars.com. Broke here yesterday
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.640]  with Ron Paul on air with us. Gold rises as Greek parliament approves austerity. Final
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.200]  showdown for TSA groping bill in Texas. Fire threatens plutonium and uranium releases at
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.240]  Los Alamos National Laboratory. Charges dismissed against woman arrestable videotaping traffic
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.720]  stop from her own front yard. Police now responding by harassing the neighborhood and writing
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:18.320]  tickets to her supporters. Austerity riots, a glimpse of America's future. That is just
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.640]  some of the news that we have already gotten to a bit of, but I'm going to be covering
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:31.840]  more in the third hour today. Continuing here, Obama says no new taxes, but must tackle
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.360]  spending and tax code. That means massive new taxes. He's moving with Surrogate to try
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.320]  to pass new taxes. He says he doesn't want to scare people, but meanwhile that's what
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.440]  they're doing. Shame we'll lose the dollars triple A rating if we don't give the bankers
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.880]  more money. Food inspections might be compromised without increases. They already give waivers
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:58.600]  to all the big companies. Why not? Continuing the hotels are on fire. Mass riots, rolling
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.800]  street battles. Police savagely attacking crowds as Greece gets sucked in by the globalist
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:10.880]  hydra. Athens demonstrators blockade parliament. Lawmakers approve austerity bill. Police protests
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.600]  clash for second day in Cairo as well. They don't allow protests there now since the
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.280]  new freedom has been installed by the West. Automatic energy may be forced to resign in
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:26.920]  coming weeks. UK to test super Wi-Fi that uses white space between TV channels. Iran
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:35.480]  test missiles that can deliver nuclear weapons. That's just some of the news. There's now
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:42.120]  a new report out saying John Lennon was a closet Republican and fan of Reagan. You know,
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:48.280]  I just might be able to find out if that's true. I'll just leave it at that. I don't
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.480]  believe that. I know John Lennon was a lot more sophisticated than people said he was.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.120]  That's why they kind of suppressed the last few years of his life where he spoke out against
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.320]  global population reduction plans. He spoke out against the quote satanic elite. Years
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.320]  ago I was sent a CD. I can't find it. And I listened to the song, stuff you never hear
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.000]  on the radio, where he talked about satanists running the government, all this other stuff.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.680]  I'm going to investigate more about John Lennon and get into that in the coming weeks. But
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.800]  John Lennon was a closet Republican who felt a little embarrassed by his former radicalism
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:29.520]  at the time of his death, according to tragic Beatles stars. Last personal system. Fred
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.720]  Seaman worked alongside the music legend and 79 to Lenin's death at the end of 80. And
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:40.200]  he reveals the star was a Reagan fan who enjoyed arguing left wing radicals and reminded him
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:48.560]  of his former self. From what I know about Lenin that it was a more it wasn't a Republican.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.240]  He wasn't a Democrat. He was he was really expanding his awareness and talking about
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.640]  eugenics and things. We play clips of that. And that's why it was I don't want to get
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.640]  off into it. I'm going to leave it at that. But interesting report there. Now we're going
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:07.720]  to our guest here in just a minute or two. I need to go over here and actually get these
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:17.360]  second show present planet dot TV viewers. Hold on. Just knock my glass of water over.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.960]  This film is excellent. It's the American dream short documentary 30 something minutes.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.960]  It's a cartoon documenting how the bankers control things through fraud, fractional reserve
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.520]  banking. I must see for everyone, especially mainline folks that are in a way, get it at
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.240]  info wars.com. We got a special running until Friday. That's one of the hottest specials
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.800]  we've ever done. It's such a good deal. The Obama deception, terror storm in game, fall
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.000]  the Republic, police state for the rise of FEMA, my best selling most informative five
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.080]  films, 2995. And that special was already going to end Friday. But I decided to add
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.320]  the thick, great read, very informative big brother, the Orwellian nightmare come true
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.280]  that illustrates how we become a 1984 society by by looking at the book and comparing what's
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:10.080]  happening today by Mark Dice. This book absolutely free until Friday when you order the Alex
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.240]  Jones essential special. And again, your purchase also makes this broadcast possible. You can
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:21.000]  also call here and ask any questions about other specials or order over the phone 888-253-3139
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.240]  888-253-3139. You can also write to us and even if the mail gets in late after the weekend,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.480]  we will, you know, accept those orders and keep the special going for mail in orders.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:42.160]  And that's info wars PO box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60. Again, people always say that
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:54.320]  too fast, PO box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60 and the mailing address is also on the website.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.960]  Now, it has now been confirmed and the documents have been released by the Electronic Privacy
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:10.600]  Information Center that since 2005, but they put them in in 2002 at five airports, Boston
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.600]  Logan first, that were the beta test, that they knew it was high levels of radiation
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:22.000]  and they knew it was going to make people sick, not just the travelers because you don't,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.080]  they're not in there eight hours a day like TSA, but the federal workers. And it turns
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.640]  out for years, they've been covering up at the airports the massive increase in cancers
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:39.280]  and cancer clusters. This is huge news and they fire and this is completely illegal
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.200]  because if you're concerned about your work environment and then they fire you because
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.680]  no radiation tests are being done. There's not a radiation control officer. They're
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.680]  not calibrating them every month as they're supposed to do. They hid this info from Congress
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:58.000]  for a year. Epic was able to finally get it four-year and released. This is bone chilling,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.600]  bone chilling about the nature of the New World Order that they knew. They're like, well,
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.480]  these things will release radiation. So what? So what if it kills the workers? Just like
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.640]  they told people, oh, the dust is safe to breathe. They asked Bessison the problem at
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.320]  ground zero and said, don't wear respirators because it'll scare the public and we can't
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.360]  open Wall Street again. And then they tried to block for nine years. We finally got it.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:28.120]  Health care for the heroes of 9-11. Incredible. This shows the mindset of the cold-blooded
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.880]  people that run society how ruthless, how cutthroat they are. So no wonder the EPA
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.800]  just said, you know, we're going to raise safe levels of radiation between 100 and 100,000
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.000]  times depending on the isotope, what we previously said was safe. Oh, radiation is going way
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.880]  up because of Fukushima and other big disasters like loss of Alamos facility with fires all
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.880]  over their nuclear testing area. And that's in the news. By the way, I can take it to
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.600]  mainstream news admitting danger of radiation release, resonance fear, radioactive smoke.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.000]  You bet. I mean, I may have to move to the southern hemisphere as much as happening because
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.600]  this is all going on in the northern hemisphere. And they're telling me radiation safe. They
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.640]  don't even tell folks to stay away from the milk and the rest of it. But I digress here.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.480]  That's Yahoo News reporting on that AP. Now, I've had a chance to hear a lady and read
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.760]  her writings and I think she's one of the most eloquent people to kind of chronicle
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:27.120]  all of what the TSA is doing. And they play arrogant games. They said in November and
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.240]  then again in April of this year that, oh, we've stopped groping kids 12 and under. They
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.240]  never stopped. They said, again, we're stopping groping. It's a military tactic to claim they're
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.760]  stopping something when it's continuing. Then they said, we didn't make that lady-ticker
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:44.240]  diaper off. We said, take it off or you can't fly. It's all these semantical games. So there's
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.400]  calls for pistol pistol lead to step down. Becky Acres is a journalist who writes for
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:54.360]  Lulu Rockwell, American Daily, Harold Campaign for Liberty, The New American, The Independent
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:02.120]  Review, The Freeman Barons, The Christian Science Monitor, The Washington, New York,
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.520]  Denver Post, Ottawa Citizen, Military History, American History, and many other publications
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:12.640]  and websites. And she's just absolutely amazing the way she breaks down and chronicles these
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.320]  people. And we're going to have her for the rest of the hour. We're going to break here
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:20.880]  in a few minutes. But Becky, please, you've got the floor for the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.360]  Then I want to open the phones up for victims of TSA to call in and talk to you. The toll-free
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.960]  number to join us is 800-259-9231. But Becky, what got you on the trail of the TSA?
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.480]  Well, Alex, I have to first of all thank you and the other activists that turned out in
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.200]  Austin. And I just loved your demonstration at the State House. That was just wonderful.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.840]  So I was cheering you on from in front of my computer screen. I hate the TSA with every
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  fiber of my being, and probably the reason I most hate it is its complete unconstitutionality.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:03.880]  This is something that the founders could not in their most horrible nightmares ever
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:09.440]  have conceived, that American citizens would be sexually assaulted at the airport by their
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:15.920]  government before they simply get on a plane. This is the very definition of tyranny. This
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:24.520]  is outrageous. At no point in world history has any regime, no matter how brutal or totalitarian,
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:31.400]  ever sexually assaulted mass numbers of its citizens. This is completely unprecedented,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.120]  and it is to our shame that this is currently going on.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.080]  Do you agree with my analysis that it's about federalizing not just the airports but the
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.720]  streets of America and breaking our will that this is prisoner concentration camp induction
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.720]  training?
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.480]  Oh, absolutely. And in fact, anytime I hear somebody say that the TSA doesn't work, I
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.320]  want to correct the person and say, actually, it works just fine. It's doing precisely
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:02.880]  what it was set up to do. It's quashing dissent, just go to the airport and watch people in
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.360]  line, how they keep their eyes down. They don't give any lip to the screeners, no matter
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.200]  how abusive the screeners become. All they want to do is get through the checkpoint and
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.600]  onto their flight. So, TSA succeeds marvelously at what it's really all about, and that is
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:24.400]  subjugating us. Does it succeed as security? Absolutely not. That TSA is downright dangerous.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.720]  And that's something all of us should continue to hype and to study, because polls consistently
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.040]  show that those Americans who still are in favor of the TSA hold that position solely
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.840]  because they've swallowed the propaganda that it protects us and that there are terrorists
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.840]  behind every bush, and we need the TSA to route them out. Actually, TSA has never anywhere
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.520]  in the world uncovered a single terrorist in the absence of actual death. Maggie, stay
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.200]  there. Let's break down their crimes, their activities. Let's chronicle it all on the
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:03.800]  other side. We'll be right back. Since 2007, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.720]  have injected as much as $20 trillion into the economies of the world, and yet the globe's
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.800]  economies continue to contract. Our government is borrowing $58,000 per second. If they stop
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.240]  spending, the economy collapses. If they continue spending, the economy collapses. And if they
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:25.880]  raise interest rates, the economy collapses. Prepare now. Call Ready Reserve Foods and

[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:28.160]  They certainly have. Strange days. They tracked us down. They're going to destroy us. Can
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:36.960]  you imagine what's coming next? If we continue to let the TSA run around on the highways
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.960]  and bus stations and expand their groping, well, the states are now trying to get their
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:48.280]  laws in line to allow this and expand it into school proms, you name it. All right, going
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.720]  back to Becky Aker, syndicated columnist, writes for some of the biggest publications
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.920]  in the country. This is a short segment, ma'am, long segment coming up. You've got the floor
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.040]  chronicle and break down what they're doing, you know, the whole constellation of abuse.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:08.120]  Well, TSA excuse has always been that it protects American aviation. Actually, if you look at
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:15.320]  their charter, they are set up to invade all American transportation. It doesn't just end
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.120]  with planes. So that's why we've been seeing them out in buses and Amtrak. As you mentioned,
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.920]  they're going to school proms. They're also at political rallies. And that is especially
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:36.000]  chilling when you think that Obama and McCain both, when they were campaigning, TSA was
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  at their rallies screening people before they were allowed inside. So what are we looking
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.080]  for in that instance? Are we looking for dissidents? Are we going to keep people out of rallies
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:52.640]  who disagree with the candidates? And this is, in fact, the whole purpose of the TSA is
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.920]  to intimidate and bully us so that we no longer protest government atrocities. And that will
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.720]  go for any atrocity, not just what they're doing at airports, but when they bomb innocent
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.400]  people overseas, because we don't want to be on the no fly list, we don't say anything.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.880]  We certainly don't write letters to the editors since we are very easy to track with our name
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.920]  and city then. This is why governments have always coveted. They very seldom realized
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:26.640]  the sort of totalitarian power TSA currently wields. And that is, as long as you can search
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:34.080]  people, as long as you can intimidate and bully them anywhere, anytime, you have enormous
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.120]  power over them. Not only can you confiscate weapons, which is what TSA does at airports,
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:46.160]  so that they cannot rebel, but you can also have them so afraid of the humiliation of
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.240]  a public search. Because there you are, singled out in front of everybody, everyone is thinking,
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.920]  my goodness, what did that miscreant do? And you're probably thinking, goodness, what
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.400]  did I do? Because everybody gives a benefit of doubt to the government agents, never to
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:07.040]  their victims. So you fear that public humiliation, and there's also the very real threat of bodily
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:13.760]  harm. A lot of what the TSA is doing as far as groping people is hurting people. There's
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:19.400]  the example of the man who was suffering from bladder cancer and recovering. He wore a stoma
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:25.120]  bag. He repeatedly warned the TSA's bugs that his bag would break. They'd break the
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.640]  seal on it if they continued groping him, and they did so deliberately so that he was
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.280]  soaked in his own urine before he got on his flight. That's just one story out of hundreds
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:41.920]  I could recite about the TSA's calculated cruelty to anyone that they encounter. It
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.720]  doesn't matter how old you are, as we saw with the woman in the wheelchair, 95 years
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.160]  old, and the TSA is humiliating this woman. It doesn't matter how young you are, they're
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.480]  groping three-year-old children. And if it's pedophilia of them anywhere else, why isn't
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480]  it at the airport?
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:04.160]  Well, I mean, they're taking the diapers off one-year-old babies. And just to add here,
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.160]  the White House has said they want a no-gun buy list where they just put you on a list
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.480]  and can't buy guns without a judge's jury or charge. You can't get off the list. And
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.200]  they're admitting, TSA, I saw Ridge say this eight years ago, you'll have to get government
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.680]  authorization to have a job, and now they're starting that with the unions where they run
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:31.040]  it through the TSA to have a job at a warehouse. This is a total internal passport takeover
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.040]  system. They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:40.840]  Absolutely. That is, the TSA's whole purpose is to foist the police state on Americans
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:46.080]  under the excuse of we're protecting you. You know, it's very, very scary when you witness
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.240]  these atrocities. There's virtually nobody in the country that is outraged by the treatment
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:29:00.200]  that Mrs. Rappert, the 95-year-old survivor of cancer who has leukemia, the abuse that
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.800]  this woman took at the airport. Everybody except the TSA is outraged by this. And TSA's response,
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:11.880]  we followed protocol. I mean, that should scare us silly that this agency is so fearless
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:19.640]  that when laws prohibit what it does, when public opinion comes out overwhelmingly against
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.960]  it, when common decency dictates the truth.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.120]  It's because it's a mission. It's a war. It's got to be carried out to fully federalize
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:33.760]  the country and link the TSA up with the threat fusion centers for the takeover. And then
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.520]  when you get any medical care, you run through TSA to make sure you're not a terrorist and
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:46.040]  they brazenly do it to the heroes of 9-11, the rescue workers first to be outrageous
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.120]  and set the bar at an incredibly low level. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:30:00.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:09.640]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.960]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:19.000]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.680]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.280]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:38.280]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.520]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.560]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:36.360]  Well this just breaking TSA pat down mill dies in Texas legislature. A controversial
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:43.480]  bill to ban intrusive searches by federal airport security officers died in Texas legislature
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.920]  on the final day of a special session today after the house refused to bring it up for
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:55.440]  consideration. So even though they watered it down to almost nothing, it got killed.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.120]  And the Republican leader of the Senate killed it the first time, then claimed he was foreign.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:06.920]  And the speaker in the house killed it. This is Rick Perry's specialty. He introduces legislation
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:11.240]  or says he supports it and then does everything he can to block it. And we talked to Ron Paul
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.640]  about that yesterday. He said that's a favorite tactic now in DC. It's just incredible. But
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.960]  the fight isn't over. But this is the central fight over what are federal goons doing here?
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.200]  They've had TSA drills with Homeland Security in four state areas where they shut down major
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:36.360]  highways. It's happening everywhere. And the governor two years ago in Tennessee said you
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:42.520]  can't do this. You've got the army out here with TSA running it. They're the boss. And
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.720]  they said you can't do that. And TSA and Homeland Security said take a hike buddy, John Warner
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:53.400]  Defense Authorization Act. And now they've got their 10 governor group. It makes the
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.520]  decisions instead of the states. Oh well, I have a rural council I go to decide what
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:05.040]  to do for the states. I have a 10 member governor council. This is how tyranny operates. I don't
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.840]  need the Congress to say we can have a new war in Libya. I say it isn't a war and I say
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:15.640]  the UN says I can. I mean the sky's the limit here because the country has been bankrupt
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.320]  by the mega central banks by design. We're being brought into receivership. Heaven help
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.920]  us. The carbon taxes all of it. They're creating a new federal green army that will come on
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:31.880]  your property without warrants. It is hell being released. TSA Pat down bill dies in
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.560]  Texas legislature. Controversial bill to ban intrusive searches by federal airport security
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.080]  officers died in Texas legislature on the final day of the special session. House members
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.240]  gave preliminary approval to the Senate pass bill but fell short of the 120 votes needed
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:52.480]  to suspend constitutional rules to bring the bill up for final passage. The vote was 96
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:59.320]  to 26. So 96 to 26 on enough. The bill which was a provoked opposition from the transportation
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:06.640]  security administration died during the regular session of TSA officials and not servants
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.240]  officials threatened legal action. But it surged back to life after Governor Rick Perry
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.560]  introduced up a special session agenda after he was forced to the bill by representative
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:21.800]  David Simpson of Longview had a diehard fan base of large conservative supporters who
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.000]  were rallying behind it. To end what they call widespread invasive screening procedures
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.440]  by TSA agents you mean law breaking. Dozens of supporters converged inside the Capitol
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.360]  Monday to denounce changes. It wasn't dozens about 250. The legislation they say severely
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.280]  weakened the bill. House Speaker Joe Strauss earlier denounced the bill as a publicity
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:48.000]  stunt. Yeah the fourth amendment and it just goes on from there. So there you go. Going
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.280]  back to our guest Becky Akers Becky please continue.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.680]  People put an awful lot of time and effort in getting this bill passed but I hope you're
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.600]  all not so terribly disappointed that you give up the fight. I have to say I've never
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.360]  really thought legislation is the way to deal with the TSA and this whole episode gives
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.160]  us a real good lesson in that. First of all you're at the mercy of politicians who have
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:18.560]  consistently shown they have no mercy. It's dependent on their wins their wills whether
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.000]  or not they can be bothered to get their sorry butts over to the legislature which we pay
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.640]  them to attend. They get how many extra dollars in their paycheck for these special sessions
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:34.840]  they're paid to be there and yet they can't show up to vote last week. So you're at their
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:40.040]  mercy when we're depending on legislation to protect us from TSA but a more important
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:46.240]  point is that there's already law against the TSA. In fact there's a law that outliers
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.640]  outlaws its very existence. Yeah I want folks to hear what you just said. There's not just
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.960]  states rights issues there's also official oppression, molestation we're going to go
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:03.880]  over all of it but again I say fight on every front and this whole legislative issue made
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:11.080]  it a big national issue so fighting is winning because you simply resist and it draws more
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.800]  attention and lets people know that America isn't just rolling over to Nazi Germany part
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.720]  two. Absolutely I think that this is a huge shot in the arm for the anti-TSA movement
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.040]  but I don't know that in practice had the law passed I don't think anybody should be
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.720]  upset that it didn't because first of all it's already accomplished what it should
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:38.400]  have it called attention to the problem secondly the Constitution prohibits exactly what the
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:45.520]  TSA is doing and TSA gropes us in direct defiance of the highest law of the land. Had Texas
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:51.400]  passed this law it wouldn't have done squat because if you're going to ignore the Constitution
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.120]  you're certainly not going to be intimidated by some little state law. So in fact Constitution
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.880]  outlaws the TSA's very existence there's nowhere that the federal government has given any
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:10.120]  kind of authority to police aviation, to police transportation, to police us at all. One of
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:15.120]  the things that we should really be very much afraid of and one of the reasons TSA has so
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:22.200]  easily infiltrated not just airports but buses and trains is because almost all transportation
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:27.160]  in this country is either outright owned by government whether at the federal, state or
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:33.240]  local levels or it's so heavily subsidized and regulated it might as well be. Airports
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.000]  are almost always owned by either a city or a state commission so when TSA moves in on
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.320]  them these guys aren't going to protest they're going to say yeah thanks you're taking one
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.680]  of our expenses away from us and trying to protect it we're grateful for that. Airlines
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:54.360]  are one of the biggest partners for the TSA they cover for it you don't see airlines protesting
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:40:02.240]  its abuse of their customers and that's precisely why because the FAA mandated security for airlines
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:08.840]  it has mandated security for airlines since the 1960's okay and the regulations under
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:16.040]  the FAA were just as stupid as they are under TSA except that the FAA required airlines
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.760]  to pay for all these stupid rules that invented okay remember how you used to get asked what
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:24.840]  you what do you pack your own bags that was an FAA mandate and the airlines were forced
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.760]  to comply and forced to pay their personnel to harass us like that so of course they
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.440]  object to paying for security of course they're in favor of the TSA because what the TSA did
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:42.000]  was shift that cost from them to taxpayers so now the federal government is subsidizing
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.040]  yet another airline operating expense. Airlines are completely beholden to the feds. The feds
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:54.960]  do all kinds of things when they outright subsidize them they give them tax breaks they control
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:02.080]  virtually every aspect of commercial travel okay so to all intents and purposes aviation
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.920]  in this country is already nationalized. That's right land of the free home of the brave
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.440]  and you break down the fact that when you go on an airport now they're expanding out
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:17.640]  to the football games and proms a total violation that's in the amendment that it's like going
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:22.720]  down a dark alley with some very dangerous people you know the issue here is this is
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:27.960]  about building an army of miscreants that will roast themselves outside radiation bakers
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:34.720]  porno scanners and who will be happy to take diapers off babies and 95 year old terminal
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.280]  cancer patients that can hardly walk these are a special type of people that they're
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:47.320]  sifting out and isolating to be their army who enjoy the thuggery. Yes absolutely and
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:52.240]  that that that really angered me I don't recall who said it but somebody was making the point
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.480]  I might have been do-hurst made the point that we can't hold the screeners responsible
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:02.560]  it's their bosses that this legislation ought to be aimed at absolutely not I mean just
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.840]  imagine if you walked into your place of employment your boss called everybody together said okay
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.200]  guys from now on any customer walks to that door I want you sexually assaulting okay
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.040]  near rape that's what I'm after I want you poking them I want you prime I want your fingers
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.200]  everywhere they can possibly go what would you do would you pop the guy in the nose and
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.280]  walk out of course that's what any decent human being would do no screener anywhere
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:32.920]  to my knowledge as far as I have seen any news report not one single screener quit when
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:39.520]  the directive came down from pistol last fall they were going to grope us okay so where
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.000]  is the decency where are the people just following orders which of course went out at Nuremberg
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.720]  you no longer can use that defense it's been totally discredited these people are slime
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:54.160]  and scum they have no morals they have no common decency they don't even have the mirrors
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.520]  compassion for a 95 year old woman dying of leukemia okay if they're going to brutalize
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.920]  her like that what do they do to us so this idea that they're just doing their jobs and
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:10.480]  we can't blame them it's total hogwash well I'm going to tell a story now I haven't told
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:16.280]  because it's so insane no one would believe it but it's on record at Austin Bursham international
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.640]  airport and I think it may have been a setup Rob do was with me even got something on videotape
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.080]  and I wasn't going to it's it's it's this really happened and I think it was a setup
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.600]  I'm getting off the airplane I'm walking down the concourse and I'm walking through and
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:35.560]  some guy gets in my face turn out he was from Chicago waiting and he was bigger than I was
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:41.040]  he's trying to intimidate me and he said you're good looking I want to you know have sex with
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:47.800]  you and he grabbed my chest and did a you know twister on it was very painful and and
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.400]  I knew I could tell it was a setup so I stood back and I said I'm going to get the police
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.960]  and he guys starts laughing on yeah you're good looking baby Rob do was already happened
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.040]  to be getting ready to shoot TSA as we walked out with video he had his flip camera almost
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.840]  ready so he started catching it and I said say that again say you just came up and wanted
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:09.360]  to have sex with me and grab my chest and he said yeah I'll do it again baby and he
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:13.280]  was like come on do something come on you'll catch you's all over and I was like man this
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.920]  is really weird I went and got the police they came they watched the video they talked
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:20.120]  to him they sent him down they said alright Mr. Jones we need to fill out a report we're
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:26.400]  gonna arrest him right now and we're gonna charge you know he's gonna be taken down probably
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.520]  charged we need to have your license and stuff for court do you want to do this and
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:38.520]  I just said no this is some kind of setup and I said I said no I just wanted on record
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:43.480]  that this guy did that and I and I left but that but the point is why would the police
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:48.040]  arrest be ready to arrest him for running up and doing this weird setup in the airport
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.640]  and do his mouth was hanging up while this was up I was like what is going on here and
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.920]  he's like oh I want to have sex with you and then he's like come on do something it was
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.240]  all it was really because I guess they were gonna I guess it's kind of like in the movie
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.640]  JFK and those things really happened with Jim Garrison where he'd try to go in the bathroom
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.480]  at an airport and the guy would come in try to have sex with him this was the something
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.240]  like that but different it's like in plain view standing there this guy walks up starts
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:19.360]  and starts saying oh baby and grabbing my chest and and and it was very bizarre but
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:26.600]  the point is they should have arrested the TSA people when they're doing groping why
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.800]  were the cops ready to arrest him for groping me but but not the TSA again it's like two
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:38.240]  different worlds it absolutely is Alex and there has been examples of screeners who have
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.240]  pod or assaulted women outside the airport I remember they've just been doing this for
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:48.080]  an entire shift they get outside the airport and all of a sudden they're arrested for doing
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.960]  what they did inside the airport so again it's it's exactly the example you just raised
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:59.160]  there are two different worlds operating here and we really can't expect anything else since
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.360]  we've just lost our moral compass with the situational ethics of the 1960s triumphing
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:11.080]  now that context is all and rape in an airport done by a goon wearing a government badge
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.320]  is not rape but if he gets outside the airport and he's not wearing his government badge
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.480]  then it all of a sudden becomes rape there was a guy in Georgia who was a screener who
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.200]  was arrested for this he it was feeling women up the whole shift and then he gets out into
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.200]  the parking lot and I can't imagine why could a passenger actually agreed to accompany him
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.200]  off duty they got out to the parking lot he continued molesting her and she reported him
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:42.000]  it's like you know you in I know this is a job that only mentally ill people are going
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.320]  to be happy to do now now let's talk about the pilots said no and they had to back off
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.480]  because you trust me with the plane but now some you know minimum wage level person is
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:55.920]  going to grope me and these are grown men troops have gotten very upset by this I mean break
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.600]  down what's happening on that front yeah pilots this goes back to the point I was making
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.920]  before where TSA is an actual danger to us it's not that it protects us that it risks
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:14.520]  our lives okay there were pilots last fall now they have since been exempted from groping
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.760]  but last fall they were right in the lines with us and they were being groped many of
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.720]  them were so upset there's one reported incident of a pilot so traumatized by this
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:33.080]  molestation he went home he had to call in sick he went home and threw up in his driveway
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.720]  now imagine a grown man and remember a lot of pilots come out of the air force their
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:43.040]  combat veterans okay we're not talking wimps here we're talking pretty tough no it's their
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:49.360]  public it's their private space this is like a person is not a criminal being taken to prison
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:54.480]  and being grope by the jail guards it is totally traumatizing to say you have no power you
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.160]  have no dignity there's something your whole life that you wouldn't let somebody do it's
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.520]  now being done to you and I believe the guy at the Austin airport it was a setup and that
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.480]  if I would have physically attacked him that they were gonna probably try to kill me in
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.200]  the airport oh I don't doubt that but oh can you imagine how mad they are at me now I may
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:17.240]  not even be able to fly or I may have cameras rolling the whole time for these setups and
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.840]  if they assault me I'm gonna have to lay down like Gandhi while they attack because I almost
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:26.120]  attacked him and he just you know he did it again he said come on and I was just like
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.240]  well and I knew it was a setup and I just controlled myself but I mean I'm sure that
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.680]  was a government setup I mean who knows what they're gonna do to me now you know they know
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.600]  I'm leading the fight nationwide along with Drudge against them and we should be on guard
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:45.800]  against all sorts of things like this when you can get a pilot so upset that he's throwing
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.360]  up do you want that guy at the controls of your plane the pilot's union actually issued
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:55.680]  a directive to its members saying you know assess your mental state after you go through
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.800]  the checkpoint are you fit to fly a plane if not call in sick and we'll get a replacement
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:07.280]  for you just imagine the danger you're in when the guy at the controls is shaking from
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:13.400]  rage and and from the trauma he's just been through another man groping him okay that's
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.760]  just one example how TSA endangers this remember that TSA has actually killed the passengers
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:24.000]  too there have been passengers there was one man named Dricka Bearhill Alton well like
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.200]  they took the woman behind closed doors and killed her who was having a panic attack she
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.680]  was going to drug rehab and she turned out she was a professional she argued a little
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:37.160]  they claimed she choked herself with her own handcuffs yes actually TSA was not directly
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.520]  involved in that that was the airport cops that should also scare us why do airports
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.720]  have their own police forces but I do hold TSA morally responsible for killing Carol
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.920]  and got bomb because they have established such a climate of hysteria at airports that
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.520]  things like that happen a woman is arrested because she's upset at missing her flight
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:03.720]  and it's got kept screaming I'm not a terrorist I'm not a terrorist why are you doing this
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.800]  to me so she was clearly picking up on the fact that he had the one guy that had a panic
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.360]  attack as he was scared to fly they killed him yes this is Rigoberto Al Pizarre he was
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:19.560]  a short term missionary flying back to his home in Florida he and his wife had been on
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:25.200]  a mission to South America they got back into Miami and were changing planes for the last
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:31.480]  leg of their flight to their home in Orlando he was suffering from bipolarism he had a
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.760]  panic attack tried to get off the plane without asking TSA's permission okay I bet you didn't
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.600]  know you have to ask TSA's permission nobody did this man simply got up out of his seat
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.040]  and tried to get off the plane his passengers were filing pass there were two air marshals
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.840]  aboard tragically enough they followed him out onto the runway and shot him and killed
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:56.840]  him for no reason except he wanted to get off the flight stay there let's talk about

[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:06.040]  trained law-abiding citizens to be taken away to the backroom dungeon all the tsa thieving of the
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.480]  bags we're going to discuss it all but right now let's go to ed maryland ed you're on the air welcome
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:18.200]  yeah thanks alex uh watch the show every day my son and i listen to it as often as we can
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.120]  uh i i tell you this whole tsa thing has really got me upset as a matter of fact up i won't be
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:32.040]  flying until they change uh change all this but i just had a uh like a strategy i don't know uh
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:38.040]  when people go through to to be screened do they have to have a ticket first uh you know
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.200]  i've wondered about that too yes you do have to have a ticket because you can't get there they're
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.480]  going to ask you at the airport for your id and ticket before you get to the checkpoint now my
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:53.640]  question is and i think i know the answer but i'm not positive my question is with your ticket
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.920]  you decide not to go through the screening or you're so traumatized or for whatever reason
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.960]  you cut it short and leave or the tsa throws you out either one because it does throw people
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.880]  out occasionally um in that case you get your money back i don't know i i don't think you do
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.000]  uh now in a lot of times you do get your money back because the airlines understand how traumatic
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.560]  it is but the other thing is they try to then charge you eleven thousand dollars if you get in
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.240]  there and then and you won't go in the microwave scanner after all they're killing themselves
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:27.400]  why shouldn't you get a little bit of the same death they're getting because it's so they want to
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.120]  grope old ladies and small children so much they're willing to die so why shouldn't you get groped by
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:36.920]  i mean they're giving their life up to do this as perverts and pedophiles and power tripping control
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.520]  freaks uh but uh you know the fines and all this it's all about intimidation uh anything else call
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:47.240]  her because we're we're we're we're taking calls here and folks you know here's the deal not flying
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:52.440]  is a great thing to do because it puts pressure on things but the industries the travel the hotel
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:57.000]  they've already complained for years they're losing tens of billions a year and i appreciate
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.720]  your call if it let's get a comment from becky i've seen numbers as high as 20 billion a year
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:09.400]  lost in tourism and travel and hotels and growing uh because of the tsa yeah the the travel industry
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:15.480]  is very interesting out you'll see some reports that are touting how uh this is the busiest year
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:19.720]  ever for airlines and they're they're filling their planes and this that and the other one of the
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:23.960]  ways they're able to do that is they juggle the figures just like the government though okay they
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:30.440]  are actually losing money um if we had an honest accounting from either the feds or their corporate
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:36.920]  buddies the airlines you'd see that travel has fallen off significantly that may be a function
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:42.600]  of the economy and not just the tsa i wish it were just because of the tsa it'd be wonderful to
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:49.000]  think people cared that much about their freedom and their rights but uh at any rate yeah the airline
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.040]  industry is suffering um i well you know they've cut back flights massively and then they say oh but
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:01.960]  they're all full yes yes they're all full um so it's it's uh they do this a lot they juggle the
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:06.760]  figures they said they cooked the books they want to make it look like they're a winner because you
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.480]  don't want to fly with an airline that isn't doing well right i mean there's just kind of human nature
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.800]  that uh yeah but the hotels everybody else knows better we're going to break back in one minute

[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:25.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:30.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:35.240]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:40.600]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:31.080]  orders americans will follow uh i'll never forget having a conversation with one elderly christian
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:36.520]  gentleman and he was telling me very proudly how he's never broken a law and he obeys anything
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:40.760]  the government tells him to do and i said his wife was suffering from Alzheimer's i said so
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:46.760]  you're telling me that if if federal asians surrounded your house tomorrow and told you
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:50.680]  to put your wife out for a collection they're taking her away to a nursing home because he was
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.640]  very proudly taking care of him himself right then i said you you would hand her over absolutely
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:02.520]  didn't hesitate no no they think america is about being a slave yes oh i know these are very dangerous
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:06.200]  people and they're everywhere and that's who the government hires i bet money that guy worked for
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:13.800]  the government yes how he had um but uh this is a horrible tendency and it's completely alien to
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:17.800]  the generations the wind before these what did you think of the guy saying that when he went back
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.280]  to the medical firm he worked set and said i can't fly anymore they called him a conspiracy
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:26.920]  theorist and it's admitted they're grabbing the genitals but so now so now having an opinion
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:33.480]  something alien in all of human history got lining you up grabbing your genitals now to even question
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:39.000]  is a conspiracy theory i'm always amused to have a corporate media praises it the same way you know
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:47.800]  um some passengers may object to the tsa's pat downs for enhanced security no tell us what it
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:53.800]  really is many people object to being raped that's that's the way to phrase it okay the corporate
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.360]  media just cooperates and makes out that we're some kind of wackos or something when actually
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:09.480]  anyone in his right mind objects to being bruised well uh look i mean all the lobbies for the for
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:15.320]  the hotels the rent cars all of you know it's hurting tourism and travel and business and my
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:20.120]  wife and children will not get on your planes and you're losing that business and it just continues
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.280]  from there uh let's take another call we gotta move quick here russell in california russell
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:30.760]  you're on the air hi alex first i'm caller long time listener um i'm doing a little research i was

[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:44.520]  program just being a way to kind of um initiate yeah in fact that was my next point biometrics
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:50.920]  they always meant they said they do this eight years ago to make you have a card and biometrically
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:56.760]  face scan and thumbprint and so they're torturing us with this then they're going to offer the card
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:01.320]  which thing only to buy a gun anything it's a whole new system where they approve you to
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:07.320]  have a job to buy a gun no judge no jury just a magic list but they admit they're going to keep
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:13.240]  the groping they're still going to call you out now just not everyone and so people are now going
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:18.200]  to accept the federal id card becky yeah that's exactly what's going on it's a way for them to
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:24.200]  get even more control over us but they're selling it as oh now you can you can have more convenience
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:29.080]  when you fly and alex going back to your point before about how americans are just slaves i'm
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.040]  constantly amazed by that just like because you're it's a little more convenient you'll give the
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.760]  government this much more power over you whatever it may be whether it's secure flight or something
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:45.720]  else and by the way don't you love that name trusted traveler like they'll trust us when they
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:52.120]  consider us all terrorists but they trust us um so it's it's more normally known as secure flight
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.560]  which also is very Orwellian but at any rate it's exactly what you're saying it's an attempt by the
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:04.600]  tsa to tie together all our behavior you're going to have to submit tax returns to qualify for this
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.640]  thing so what happens when you get to the airport and you and the irs are having a dispute are you
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:14.280]  arrested on no no and they admit you're not just saying this could happen that's what this is
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:19.480]  so that that is that's that no buy no sell and this is this is you've got to have that approved
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:25.960]  card tied to your face scan to literally drive a car oh my god this is so incredible this is
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:32.680]  such a diabolical plan that's why we obsess on this tsa issue because we have the documents as you
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:37.960]  said and and now they're admitting yes that it's going to be on the streets of america people
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:41.960]  like how did you know they'd be on the streets because they said they were going to do this
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:49.000]  yes uh that's a fascinating point about tsa it lies about everything all the time except about
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.600]  its plans for the future to take over all of american society for some reason it's very up front
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:01.560]  about that and it has long threatened to go beyond airports to control all aspects of travel well it's
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.360]  all about just brazenly throwing it in your face and now they're getting ready with their lc iata
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:11.160]  to attack sports stadiums shopping malls the telescreens are going in saying spy on your
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:15.720]  neighbors i mean america screens saying watch everyone you know goons everywhere now they have
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:21.880]  boy scouts with the tsa nationwide at parades and the little kids with their arms folded looking
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:29.000]  at grandma i mean this is the stasi society uh alex and kansas you're on the air hey guys thanks

[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:09.080]  who goes to the scanner is then called over for a grope down as well they say well we only scan
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.280]  some people they admit their plan is to scan everybody uh i'm sorry please tell us so a pedophile

[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.280]  malfunctions so instead of pulling her to the side behind a curtain in front of all of her peers
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:36.040]  the tsa lady grabs her and says you know we're gonna we're gonna do the the search now it's no big
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:41.640]  deal uh the media's making a big deal out of it and then proceeded to fill up every single crevice

[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:54.360]  from you and the listeners and people to find now hold on alex alex hold on you're not supposed
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:00.840]  to get upset getting upset by this is a conspiracy theory now having emotions is a sign you're an
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:08.280]  extremist you you it is abnormal to not want some uh a woman who likes little girls uh who works
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:14.120]  there for that enjoyment to do this uh serve this is freedom and the government is trying to protect
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:20.200]  you when they got mutalib on the plane uh and protected him how dare you be because of course
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:26.120]  i'm being sarcastic here to illustrate uh this but but uh sir you need to sue him you need to
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.640]  sue him personally doesn't matter what happens with the suits we need to punish all these people
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:37.320]  becky any comments on alex starting to break down having a normal response alex if you were at an
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.680]  airport and you had arms with you would they ever touch your daughter this is exactly why the tsa
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:49.080]  is taking away weapons it has nothing to do with protecting uh other passengers from al-qaeda it has
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:56.600]  to do with protecting the tsa's agents as they rape little girls okay um you can you are completely
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:02.040]  at their mercy not just in the checkpoint line but once you're on board the plane tsa agents have
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:07.800]  actually boarded planes taken passengers off you're at their mercy when the flight lands and you're
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.240]  disembarking from the plane tsa has actually set up checkpoints and searched people coming
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:18.680]  off flights as well as before they get on and there's not a thing you can do about it because
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:23.640]  the only weapon you have left to your fingernails well when i flew out of austin now they don't
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:28.040]  just have people randomly at the gate searching you again there was a guy bugging his eyes out
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:32.760]  hatefully look and i started looking at him right back in the eyes and he turned away and got a
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:39.560]  little smile on his face this is some type of degenerate weirdo who loves psychically feeding
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:45.320]  on people bugging his eyes out at a gate because he's been taught you know that oh you know he
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:49.880]  is magic i can tell if you're a terrorist or not well his his terrorist bosses of the government
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:55.560]  that are staging all this alex you started breaking down finish up i'm sorry i called
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:02.120]  kansas and missouri um aclu and their response is well we're not handling these uh complaints
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.040]  at the local level you need to call the new york office which is a black hole they tell you to
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:11.240]  go to a website fill out a complaint for me they're there to make you think there's opposition
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:15.800]  they're all they're there for total gunman sir they love it not not their rank and file but the
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:22.440]  leadership uh comments becky on that yeah i don't have much faith in aclu and a bunch of these other
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:27.160]  organizations that are protected against the kids say i think one of the best lessons we can take
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:33.480]  away from your story alex is just don't fly uh don't go near an airport but above all don't
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:39.560]  let your kids go near an airport uh entering an airport you're pretty much asking for it you know
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.520]  it's like these these stories have been out there for a long time we're all aware of what's going
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:48.760]  on at airports and this is all acclimations as soon as can be on the streets they're going to pull
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:53.640]  you and your wife and kids out and start running the pedo drill and then all hell's going to break
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:59.720]  loose they're trying to start a revolution becky yes i i actually don't hold much hope of getting
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:05.960]  rid of tsa without a revolution uh there's just too much power and too much money at stake we
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:11.400]  can see how fiercely the feds cling to that power we have a we have a mafia running the government

[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:24.280]  to the medical company works for and complained about it said i'm not flying anymore they said
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:28.920]  what are you a conspiracy theorist see this is an event that happened they admitted happened
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:32.040]  and they say it's a conspiracy theory i remember last year when they were going
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.480]  in the pants and they still are and actually now in the underwear like miss usa to actually get in
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:41.560]  there and they squeeze i mean i've been there watching jesse ventura they didn't do it to me

[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:02.200]  wanted forced inoculation for a long time they tried it with the health emergency powers act
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:07.480]  they try to get cops to train for forced inoculation they got cops under federal grants
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.600]  taking blood at checkpoints now europe's already started it this is about invading your space
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:17.400]  because normal law abiding good people you're like you know you don't even like a cop asking you a
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.480]  question when you're walking down the street i remember one time i was walking to the store on
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.880]  the apartment it was like 50 yards away to get some gatorade and stuff and cops pulled up so let's
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.200]  see your id and i said i just live right there and they got jumped out and freaked out i said do

[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.960]  right there and they held me and went and checked that i live there but but the point is that's
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:47.000]  nothing compared to i'm going in your pants you know i could take endless calls on this and

[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.400]  sexual assault system well one of the things that we should all keep in mind again is that the reason
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:18.200]  the tsa remains in power remains in airports groping us is because there isn't mass revolt and
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:24.360]  because there is this acceptance many americans swallow the propaganda that it protects us
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:29.000]  so every chance you get educate your friends and neighbors tell them no it doesn't protect us it
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.160]  actually endangers us it's killed passengers rigoberto alpazar and caroline gotbound it spreads
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:41.880]  disease with its filthy gloves uh for years uh we've been walking barefoot on airport floors
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:48.520]  and there've been independent studies done showing the bacteria and viruses that cluster on airport
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:53.400]  floors you're picking all that up you're taking home at home on your socks you're spreading it over
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:27:00.200]  your shoes uh any you know you slide your foot into your shoe that new pair of my dad is a dentist
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:06.040]  okay he would be criminally charged under a call by the by the state of texas medical board
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:11.160]  and the health department if he didn't change gloves multiple times during each procedure
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:15.480]  when he changes even a piece of equipment or goes out of the room he's supposed to
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:21.480]  i mean doc medical doctors nurses know this this is a crime they're not testing the radiology it's
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:28.440]  all about lawless power grabbing by a bunch of jack burning scum and i've had it you know why i cover
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:34.760]  this so much because i'm afraid of what i'll do folks i'm sick of it i want to fix things peaceably
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:41.400]  but i will not do this i will not put up with it alex if i can just add name unto that and also
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:48.760]  i'm sorry go ahead don't fly stay away from airports because we have got to zap the tsa now
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:53.880]  before it gets much worse and it is going to get worse the best way to zap them is to deprive the
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:57.560]  airline that's right they want to slowly bankrupt the airlines and nationalize them we've got to
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:04.120]  bankrupt them now to have the confrontation absolutely that's i don't see any other way of
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:12.040]  getting rid of the tsa short of open guns and firing revolution and we don't want that to happen
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:16.520]  and we want to do every avenue as the founders did because ladies and gentlemen the point is
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:23.880]  country liberty is rare tyranny is is is the norm we know what this is we know it's cold-blooded
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:29.880]  we know it's premeditated we know it's evil we know it's evil we know it's wrong becky
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:35.240]  yes absolutely and i have to say that commercial boycott worked this is what the founders did
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:40.840]  you may remember the import export agreements from high school history that's what was going on
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.120]  the founders refused to it buy anything from british merchants figuring that if they starved
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:51.000]  the british merchants those very influential powerful men would put pressure on the british
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.840]  admin so they started the stamp act that if it wasn't made in britain they came in your house and
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:59.560]  gave you tickets for everything and charging you for anything made in the colonies that's right
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:04.760]  and so the founders just refused to buy anything from britain it didn't work because the revolution
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:10.920]  interfered first but we can use the same tactic don't fly don't give your money to resort look the pot
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:16.920]  bellied social engineers psych warfare chiefs have written all this down they planned it all
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:22.760]  they think we're gonna win we've got to keep resisting resisting resisting resisting resisting

[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:50.520]  and melted down they called it a conspiracy theory when we could see the reactor blow up
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.160]  and scientists got the isotope readings that only are created in massive atomic fission
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:02.360]  it's 100 percent it happened we were right again they're now saying you're a conspiracy
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:12.520]  there is if you're worried about Los Alamos blowing up okay okay i want to bring ten
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:16.440]  interests in about three or four minutes to talk about what's happening in the economy right now
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:20.760]  the financial times i'm about the dollar losing its reserve the global is trying to come in with
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:26.360]  new rules trying to block coming up july 15th is ted ted how does that affect you the way
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.880]  that the big trading exchange says they're going to stop over the counter sales of gold
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:36.360]  does that affect what minus resources does well i mean that's yet to be told i mean icta right now
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.800]  is in their lobbying for obviously anything that we can get back out of that deal it just
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:48.600]  this kind of stuff drives me crazy you're talking about the dod frank bill and quite literally the
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:53.240]  way that it's written it could become illegal to trade gold and silver physically completely
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:59.800]  uh i don't i don't think that's going to happen obviously uh you know the they pass these bills
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:04.040]  and then the forex put out a press release a week ago saying that is what this does yeah and that
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:08.520]  why and that's the thing the forex market is usually for trading currencies and i realize
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:13.320]  that you can do some things with gold and silver no they wrote that in there and it's a huge power
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:18.680]  grab they got us to press it but they're failing gold up $13 a day market watch gold silver prices
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:25.800]  pop up on protective buying on word of what's happening in grace any other news for us ten
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:31.480]  well yeah the cbo report came out the long-term outlook and uh again i mean if people would
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:35.720]  just read the government document said no what's coming to them i mean they're talking about before
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:41.640]  the end of this year the national debt is going to rise from 40 percent which it was in 2008
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:48.440]  of the gdp uh to 70 percent before the end of this year we're talking about 70 percent of the gross
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:53.400]  domestic product here in the united states i mean that's that's how high it was way back
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:44:00.120]  right after world war two when we spent our way into that war it's just amazing that we can watch
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:05.800]  this happen i alex if i could do anything right now i would implant the passion that people have
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:11.960]  for buying gold and silver this fall into the minds of people right now because we here we're
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:18.200]  sitting at a bargain basement low prices in gold and silver uh i should i should refrain that from
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:23.480]  saying that uh you know qualify it a little bit because we did have gold go up all the way to
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:32.360]  $1514 an ounce today it was at 1509 70 at the low and then we have uh and then we have a silver
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:38.120]  one from $33 an ounce all the way up to 3502 yeah the bargain basement you mean
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:43.560]  gold if you look at an 11-year graph in silver only go up they always have these little dips when
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.840]  they manipulate things and it only retraces its previous gains and goes up because of global
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:53.480]  currency devaluation and so you've bought gold and silver in the last few months at the lower price
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:58.360]  now that even though it's going up you're able to pass it on at the older lower price ted tell folks
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:03.960]  briefly about today's special offers well the number one best offer i have right now which is a $54
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.840]  discount if you just bought these things straight out and that would be for your three videos and
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:12.760]  also three silver dollars i mean the silver dollars alone right now would be a hundred and

[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:56.120]  to crack down on this because yet it exposes their paper currencies and people say well
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:59.800]  they may confiscate it later i'm not turning it into these criminals enough's enough with these
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:06.440]  nazis okay the point is this is america they can go right to you know where 800 686 2237

[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:47.560]  because you can't let prisoners you know do that after all these are imagined in america where they
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:51.720]  grow up your daughters i mean that's freedom so like why should slaves be able to you know
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:56.920]  own guns own gold anything we're all al-qaeda now i guess no al-qaeda is good now fighting against
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:04.120]  against libyin leader qaddafi with the us so i'm sorry we're bad because we're against al-qaeda
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:07.800]  ted thank you so much for joining us yeah thanks for having me up alex you ought to be ashamed
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:12.040]  yourself for not supporting al-qaeda because obama is is is working with him right now you know that
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:18.280]  i know what's wrong with you ted well you know what it is crazy i mean it's just absolutely
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.000]  upside down crazy that some of the things that we're seeing going on but i can tell you right
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  now freedom the reason why they want people out of gold and silver and they're passing these
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.320]  bills like the ours because it's much easier to confiscate your wealth if it's in the paper
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:35.480]  money that they can print yeah or digitally out of your bank account no that's a conspiracy theory
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:40.040]  ted uh the government cares about us a lot and they really want to take good care of us and
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:45.880]  they're not run by foreign banks okay uh yeah it's don't be a conspiracy theorist i mean do you like
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:53.320]  a cheese a cheeseburger or a pepperoni pizza myself i'd rather the cheeseburger i guess but
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:00.120]  that's a conspiracy theory i mean having an opinion is now are you you you you just discriminated
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:04.520]  you just had a decision you should do what the government tells you if they say pizza what are
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.240]  you gonna do yeah i guess i guess you'll have to take the pizza then i'm really starting to
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:15.800]  realize that you may not have to go to a femicant ted well i tell you what i mean it gets down to
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:21.080]  the point of you know if if they're forcing us to take their paper money and they're making gold
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:26.200]  it's over illegal we're just getting right back to what it was back in 1933 when we're heading
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:31.320]  into the depression and world war two and franklin d roosevelt bailed out the banks with the uh
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:36.200]  they care about us right now they're good people ted i appreciate your call and they're putting
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:41.640]  massive carbon taxes in in austin even though it's not the law but i support that because
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:48.360]  i'm not a conspiracy theorist i think it's good and all the major institutions that aren't governments
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:54.040]  say we're above 22 unemployment but the government says 9.1 so i'm gonna believe that and the
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:49:01.640]  government says there's no real inflation it's true the government also said the sky uh was uh
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.600]  red and i went out there it looked blue but i realized i'm going to the doctor to get my
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:13.240]  eyes checked the optometrist because they said it was red and i'm a good citizen that's right i am
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.200]  i'm a good citizen i want to play a clip about another good citizen mayor bloomberg all over
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:22.360]  the country suing gun manufacturers and trying to shut them down because he knows it's on american
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:29.000]  owned guns uh he's a great american um bloomberg remixes al-qaeda video to push gun control effort
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:34.680]  and they're playing adam gadon the former grandson of the adl head who's now the al-qaeda leader
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:39.720]  saying he wants to order the muslims to use guns at shopping malls kind of like obama got caught
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:44.120]  shipping guns to mexico but again i'm being conspiracy theorist even though it's admitted uh
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:49.240]  here's that uh clip and uh some of it just has text so i'll i'll read that to you because they you
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:54.600]  need to turn your guns in right now and stop private sales of guns or adam gadon with the with
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:50:01.640]  the big beard's gonna get you and i well here it is by guns in america the latest al-qaeda
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:09.320]  is a golden opportunity america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms you can go down
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:15.480]  to a gun show and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check so what
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:22.280]  are you waiting for call your member of congress tell them to close the loopholes that let terrorists

[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:30.200]  disaster earlier this year as the fukushima radiation plume took just days to arrive in
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:36.520]  the united states instead of advising americans to take weaker forms of potassium iodine to build
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:42.360]  up their immunity to certain types of radioactivity the epa simply increased the allowable levels of
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:53.400]  radioactive isotope iodine 131 ah i'm afraid it's quite good for you by many thousands of times
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:58:01.800]  despite the fact that within just two weeks of the japanese earthquake and tsunami and we'll put
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:06.360]  this article up on screen for folks so they can read it at prismplanet.com they're watching on
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:14.200]  prismplanet.tv the epa simply increased the allowable levels of radioactive isotope iodine 131
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:19.320]  by many thousands of times despite the fact that within just two weeks of the japanese earthquake
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:25.480]  and tsunami the crippled nuclear plant the amount of radiation released from fukushima already rivaled
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:31.480]  that of chernobyl the worst nuclear disaster up until that point within weeks of fukushima crisis
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:38.120]  levels of radioactive iodine 131 were found in rainwater in california idaho minnesota ohio
[02:58:38.120 --> 02:58:52.040]  pennsylvania massachusetts thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today this is alex jones
[02:58:52.040 --> 02:58:57.080]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:58:57.080 --> 02:59:01.960]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:59:01.960 --> 02:59:06.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:12.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:17.000]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.440]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:27.800]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a
[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:32.680]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[02:59:32.680 --> 02:59:37.160]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:43.880]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[02:59:43.880 --> 02:59:54.040]  doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct
[02:59:54.040 --> 02:59:59.640]  from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:12.280]  okay so um i just uh covered the fact that these nuclear disasters
[03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:17.400]  another disaster is waiting to kick off or happening all over the place magically
[03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:23.240]  EPA on radiation alert as fires reach 50 feet from Los Alamos nuke plant
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:30.280]  20 000 barrels of nuclear waste going up in flames if they breach that fire line
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:37.240]  so hey but hey they've raised the level what saves radiation so everything's fine don't question it
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:44.040]  or you're a conspiracy theorist and americans don't like to be called that so i imagine mothers
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:49.640]  will be going out to get down range from the smoke and hold their babies up oh in fact remember
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:53.720]  what was her name and colter said that they should be thankful in japan for the radiation
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:59.560]  and so and colter should go bathe in one of the barrels because after all she's not a conspiracy
[03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:07.000]  theorist uh erin in nevada you're on the air uh go ahead you evil evil person are you calling
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:12.120]  into complaint about our valiant tsa people taking diapers off 95 year old cancer patients
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:21.560]  yeah absolutely and thank you very much alex um i think that this tc tsa matter needs to be one of
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:30.120]  the acl key issues so uh i contacted my local state aclu office and i'd like to thank david
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:36.280]  kaplan for getting back to me and here's here's what i put to him i said i think your failure
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:41.240]  to make the actions of the tsa not one of your key issues should be reconsidered they have like a
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:46.360]  key issues page on the aclu dot org website so he came back to me within a half an hour
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:55.640]  so dear mr wilson we appreciate your concern and we do believe that the current tsa pat down
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:04.440]  procedures are gross violations of civil liberties unfortunately the aclu of nevada can do little
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.200]  to change an issue that needs to be changed at the national level yeah they're why they have
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:18.680]  states why even have states exactly the national aclu is evaluating possible challenges to tsa
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:25.320]  policies you can file a complaint with national and view more information here to give me a link
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:30.840]  and he signed it in liberty david kaplan right on dude so that's what i'm saying go to our radio
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:36.520]  we're about solutions i think if we all uh all the info warriors out there contact the aclu on
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:43.000]  your local and then uh you know just make contact with the national the aclu could raise 20 million
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  dollars in a month if they said they were going after the tsa the problem is they're riddled with
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  globalist and politicians and sabotage stuff i've seen over and over again i got more faith in jesse
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:56.760]  vinter and his lawsuit i think we should all individually when they violate his false suits
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  on him and just just just bring the courts down with it we could really use the legal acumen
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:06.840]  that the aclu has and let me just say they don't believe in states rights they don't believe in
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:13.800]  the second amendment i mean they you know excuse me alex um i find it ironic that the past two
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:21.080]  presidents of the aclu both jewish women whose parents immigrated here and our holocaust survivors
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:28.600]  their parents immigrated from europe post world war two are presiding while this sort of tsa
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:34.040]  actions are going on so but i think that they're they're moving in that direction so let's put
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:38.760]  the complaints in and uh you know give them reason to take this up and put it on their
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:43.560]  key issues page because really they're the ones who can challenge successfully at the federal
[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:47.960]  level the tsa i think it's our best move now i hear you look look it's one thing we can do but
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:54.600]  the globalist or social engineers this is their key operation and only by exposing the government
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:00.520]  as terrorists that stage 9 11 if you don't face that it's over your freedom your property rights
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:06.440]  your family rights your personal liberty it's all over as long as they can blow up oklahoma
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:11.480]  city and new york world trade centers they're going to get away with this stuff you must kill
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:19.800]  the myth of the uh kebler elf al-qaeda it doesn't exist kebler elf santa claus tooth fairy it in real
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:25.640]  and this al-qaeda thing is synthetic it is a group of muslim extremists that they
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:31.480]  move around the world against qaddafi and against uh mubarak and against iran and against the serbs
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:38.040]  and against the russians and they go into these poor villages and find mindless morons they go out
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:43.240]  and get to do stuff and then they go oh my gosh we're gonna take your rights away people got to
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:49.480]  decide do they love fetishizing fear of muslims and shaking in fear in their beds at night
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:55.640]  ordered or do they want to actually beat the megabanks i hear you erin mike mark caron david
[03:04:55.640 --> 03:05:03.320]  you're coming up next on the other side stay with us there's a man named dr wallach who is anything
[03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:09.160]  but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician doc asks why does the united
[03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:14.440]  states spend more money on health care by far and still rank fiftieth in health and longevity
[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:19.960]  worldwide he believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition
[03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:25.400]  taking charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition not by
[03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:31.080]  toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is
[03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:35.400]  doc wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of americans who are waking
[03:05:35.400 --> 03:05:40.040]  up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our health care system i like
[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:44.760]  what doc wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about health care and have joined forces

[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:31.560]  we've got a boil down of uh some of the best highlights of what happened in our confrontation
[03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:37.160]  with the tsa up on info wars dot com and prism upon it dot com but it's kind of got a name that
[03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:42.440]  doesn't fit i didn't name it it's alex calls for filibuster at capital that was monday's news it's
[03:08:42.440 --> 03:08:49.640]  like you know highlights of uh or you know texan storm capital again should probably be the headline
[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:53.880]  i'm going to play that in the next segment because it's right at about five minutes long if you
[03:08:53.880 --> 03:09:00.760]  play it from the time that the intro um ends and don't have the outro it's right at about five minutes
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:04.280]  we're going to play that that they put together we got a lot of footage coming to prism planet
[03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:09.320]  dot tv next week from bill deberg too for the members there stuff never before seen that'll
[03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:13.960]  we've been boiling that down for everybody at prism planet dot tv i want to race through a
[03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:18.360]  bunch of your tsa stories and calls right now though and obviously we'll be back tomorrow
[03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:25.000]  live covering all the insanity i'll be back tonight the problem is in southern california
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:33.480]  they had that sodium reactor back in the fifties blow up uh worse than um the disaster at uh chernobyl
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:39.800]  and that's abc news they kept that secret for 30 something years so if those barrels catch on fire
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:44.200]  it's only going to be state agencies or locals or individuals that give you radiation uh levels
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:49.720]  the feds new fukushima had melted down the first week uh and continued to melt down and told you
[03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:54.360]  it hadn't because they knew it was in the headlines then they weren't about to stop you from drinking
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:58.760]  the milk and the food and stuff it's very important you get that radiation to help reduce your
[03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:02.840]  fertility and kill you quicker just like it's very important the tsa people they had mentally
[03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:07.800]  getting cancer now from the scanners very important that continue uh because again their business is
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:14.040]  killing and business is good uh let's go ahead and talk to mike i'm sure another evil person
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:20.360]  that loves freedom uh from wyoming mike go ahead hey alex uh yeah i'm way beyond evil uh i'm i'm
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:25.960]  glad you didn't fall into that trap i suspect that guy was like an 80th degree black belt in
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:31.160]  every martial art node in a man who's probably on drugs to boot so uh you're talking about the guy
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:36.200]  that came up in the airport in front of rob do and robby turned his camera on and caught part of it
[03:10:36.200 --> 03:10:40.200]  sort of grabbing my chest saying you wanted to have sex with me when i got off the plane back
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:47.720]  in austin uh and yeah we uh it was all a setup yes yeah but you ask the what's the difference
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:54.760]  between then what the tsa guys do the difference is this the tsa guys uh make a very uh studious
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:11:00.760]  point of asking your permission uh now this is what i'm going to do i'm going to feel you here here
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:06.520]  here uh you know do you have a problem with that and of course that's a hobson's choice yeah you
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:11.560]  can opt out but but then you're you know stranded take your diaper off or you can't fly but we're
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:16.440]  not telling you to take it off yeah yeah pay me protection money or somebody's going to burn
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:22.680]  down your grocery store i'm not saying it's me but you know things happen yeah but craig roberts
[03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:29.560]  laid out the the correct plan of action not not the aclu which is uh you know his phony opposition
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:37.160]  and uh each of us who gets uh offended by these guys uh and i i was i had to i had to go to a
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:42.040]  continuing at class down in uh los vegas just about a week and a half ago you've been calling
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:47.560]  for years you're a medical doctor yeah what would happen to you if you didn't change gloves in between
[03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:53.320]  seeing different patients well i'm a pathologist so i don't i don't see too many patients that
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:57.720]  rarely go out on the floor and you know and what would happen to doctors if they didn't do that
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:12:02.840]  well the same thing that happens in the va hospitals when when the doctors don't change
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:08.920]  their gloves the patients come down with a lot of nosocomial infections and and die
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:17.400]  needlessly that's flesh-eating bacteria for those who don't know right so uh but i you know the tsa
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:21.640]  uh i had i'd gone through salt lake city and the guys down there are very professional i'm talking
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:28.120]  about tsa even friendly they know their job uh i even talked to some of the guys they have a very
[03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:35.320]  service orient orient to the attitude but the macarron international down los vegas i i i have
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:39.560]  these two bamboo sticks they're they're a scream of sticks i was just practicing while i was down
[03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:45.480]  there while i had some extra time and uh you just want i had a nuclear weapon in there uh the tsa
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:50.520]  guys uh were swarming all over me and i said do you you really think i need these sticks to kill
[03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:56.440]  someone you know i can do that with my bare hands and uh so they insisted that i check it
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:04.280]  so i i checked it and uh i i get into salt lake uh on my way back home and my bag isn't
[03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:10.120]  isn't there uh you know on the uh on the carousel it doesn't show up then it doesn't show up through
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:15.080]  two more flights out of vegas i have to wait till the next morning i had my my car key in there i
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:20.120]  wasn't anticipating having to check the bag so i had my car key in there and i was i was basically
[03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:26.040]  dead in the water in the salt lake city so i've got it i've got a cause of action i'm i'm not sure if
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:34.280]  uh a 1983 uh lawsuit a 1983 work against state actors who mess with your your civil rights
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:39.480]  i'm not sure if they're appropriate for for federal actors uh but i'm going to check with
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:44.120]  an attorney or maybe an attorney can call and and enlighten us on that well no a civil rights
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:48.920]  action or official oppression depending on what code you use it works on all of them uh the courts
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:52.520]  you know of course there are a bunch of criminals on average so they may not actually enforce
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:59.160]  precedent and reality but we'll see uh mike good to hear from you anything else all right there
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:04.120]  goes mike uh let's talk to mark in new york probably another evil person mike you're on the
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:10.040]  year go ahead just call me satan alex now the reason for my phone call is you know um i was
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:14.760]  listening to the howards turn show on monday and they mentioned the same story that you mentioned
[03:14:14.760 --> 03:14:20.920]  about the woman who had her the old lady who had their diaper removed and i just wanted to tell
[03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:25.160]  people to be aware of the celebrities that are giving out propaganda because he's a billionaire
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:29.160]  and he's actually telling people on his radio show and he could listen to it for yourself and
[03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:35.320]  it's archived it's free um he says oh well that's what we have to do we have to you know howards
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:41.080]  turn is obsessed with poo poo so he would probably like that job to inspect old ladies excrement
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:48.360]  um but i mean i i ever once saw a scan through it and hear it and it's just it is it is just it
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:53.240]  is to turn people into brain numbed infantile people uh you know where they're impressed by
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:58.440]  people using cuss words all day and i don't even want to dignify it by attacking howards turn
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:04.120]  whatever uh but yeah no no that's what the system is don't worry howards turn will probably live
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:08.280]  long enough to have the system steal everything he's got all these people that think cozying up
[03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:15.000]  to tyranny is cute they're gonna find out his own parents can't go to a movie theater in long
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:19.160]  island and he says well that's the price of freedom oh really his parents couldn't go to a movie theater
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:25.880]  they they stop going to the local movie theater in in in long island wherever they live because
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:31.320]  of the tsa they have a scanner they you know pat down going into a movie theater in long island
[03:15:31.320 --> 03:15:36.120]  wow i gotta look that up i know they're going in sports stadiums and stuff so he's saying his parents
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:41.720]  won't let him do it but i guess he's saying his parents are bad well his parents won't go to the
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:45.800]  movies here you know they used to go to the movies they don't go to the movies anymore because they
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:50.920]  don't want to get patted down and he's like yeah hey look that's an example uh well he loves to make
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:55.800]  you know i've heard sure enough and he does do you know a good imitations of his mother so i'm

[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:23.920]  go ahead.
[03:17:23.920 --> 03:17:24.920]  Hi, I'm Evil.
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:25.920]  Hi, Alex.
[03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:26.920]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:31.280]  I sent you an email about the 15th of June regarding my experience with TSA a couple
[03:17:31.280 --> 03:17:32.280]  of weeks ago.
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:35.840]  I actually worked for the airlines here in Arizona in their 11 years.
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:42.120]  I worked on 9-11, heard the cries of the people, and I've never even been asked to
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:44.560]  go through the scanner here at Sky Harbor.
[03:17:44.560 --> 03:17:45.560]  This was the first time.
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:48.680]  I was only taking a friend at the gate, and that's one of the privileges we have of being
[03:17:48.680 --> 03:17:50.720]  able to go through security with our ID.
[03:17:50.720 --> 03:17:51.720]  Yeah.
[03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:53.600]  So, they asked me to go through the scanner.
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:54.600]  I declined it.
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:58.400]  A couple different scenarios happened while I was standing waiting to be padded down.
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:03.800]  Number one, a lady walked up with a little five-year-old boy, and the TSA agent motioned
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:06.840]  her toward the metal detector, and she said, oh, no, he wants to go through this.
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:08.400]  He thinks it's fun.
[03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:12.200]  She wanted him to go through the scanner, which I turned at that point, and I said, are you
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:13.200]  kidding me?
[03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:15.080]  You're going to allow him to be radiated like that?
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:17.080]  I said, you better study what's going on here.
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:20.040]  She's like, death is fun, I love it.
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:21.040]  Yeah.
[03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:22.040]  She ignored me.
[03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:26.400]  But anyway, to try to make my story short, I went on through, and they proceeded to pat
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:27.400]  me down.
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:28.400]  And here's the problem I have, too.
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:32.000]  They don't disclaim anything that they might touch.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:35.920]  All these data are going to rub their hands up the legs to where the leg meets the torso.
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:39.440]  Well, I've been padded down in Columbus in Miami.
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:40.440]  No problems.
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:42.600]  It has been professional, and I can honestly say that.
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:43.600]  Very professional.
[03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:44.600]  Yeah.
[03:18:44.600 --> 03:18:45.600]  Well, if you want to call it that.
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:46.600]  So what happened?
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:47.600]  A minute left.
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:52.640]  Anyway, she proceeds to touch my crotch, and I only asked her a simple question, and then
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:53.640]  she stands up.
[03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:56.440]  I said, since when are you touching crotches now?
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:19:01.120]  She stands up, pulls back, calls her supervisor over, and it becomes a 45-minute fiasco.
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:02.120]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:03.120]  Please continue.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:04.120]  Sorry.
[03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:06.280]  It becomes a 45-minute fiasco.
[03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:11.560]  At that point, I was given, the Federal Security Director came over, told me I had a choice
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:15.920]  to either complete the procedure with another agent, or I would be investigated and charged
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:17.920]  with a civil suit.
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:18.920]  Oh.
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:19.920]  Yeah.
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:21.640]  So I was like, okay, bring her on, whatever.
[03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:22.640]  I just want to go home.
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:23.960]  I wasn't even flying that day.
[03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:29.080]  I was strictly walking a friend to the gate, and she didn't touch my crotch.
[03:19:29.080 --> 03:19:30.080]  I went home.
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:32.700]  A week later, I get called into HR.
[03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:34.120]  They want to hear my perspective.
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:39.480]  I am now being threatened with losing my flight benefits and or my job for asking a simple
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:41.040]  question by a TSA agent.
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:45.000]  Well, that's called being a conspiracy theorist who questioned a woman wanting to touch her
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  genitals.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:49.560]  Again, that's un-American to think for yourself and ask questions.
[03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:52.360]  That's almost as bad as that woman videotaping police from her own yard.
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:54.920]  I mean, this ain't the land of the free home of the brave.
[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:58.000]  If they do fire you, you've got a major discrimination lawsuit.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.600]  We want to have you on as a guest.
[03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:00.600]  Send us your info.
[03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:01.600]  Key info coming up.
[03:20:01.600 --> 03:20:06.680]  GCN listeners, why have you been hearing so much about Dermatol, the all-natural, all-purpose
[03:20:06.680 --> 03:20:08.280]  First Aid spray?
[03:20:08.280 --> 03:20:11.920]  Because it's the must-have First Aid product you need in your preparedness kit.
[03:20:11.920 --> 03:20:16.120]  Dermatol is made in America by Americans who know there's a more affordable, natural way
[03:20:16.120 --> 03:20:21.320]  to treat cuts, burns, bites, rashes, shingles, spoils, and many other skin problems.
[03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:25.240]  Dermatol is gentle enough for diaper rash, powerful enough for bedstores, and harmless
[03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:26.560]  to the eyes and mouth.
[03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:29.600]  It's great for the whole family, even your family pets.
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:34.640]  Dermatol is antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and not diminished by freezing, extreme heat,
[03:20:34.640 --> 03:20:36.240]  or years in storage.
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:40.040]  Dermatol is an absolute must for any First Aid or preparedness kit.
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:44.520]  While soothing rapid restoration of injured skin is so effective, it's guaranteed.
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:45.520]  Order yours today.
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:55.000]  Call 800-217-6677 800-217-6677 That's 800-217-6677
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:58.040]  Efficient, economical, effective.
[03:20:58.040 --> 03:21:01.080]  Spray it all with Dermatol.
[03:21:01.080 --> 03:21:03.480]  They help to create a new world order.
[03:21:03.480 --> 03:21:05.720]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:11.400]  A new world order based upon collective action Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of
[03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:14.120]  the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:21:14.120 --> 03:21:18.600]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:21:18.600 --> 03:21:21.080]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:21.080 --> 03:21:23.840]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:27.160]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:32.080]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:34.600]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:39.080]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:40.080]  financial system.
[03:21:40.080 --> 03:21:42.960]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:46.640]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:47.800]  And I got news for you.
[03:21:47.800 --> 03:21:49.480]  You're everyone else.

[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:21.600]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:25.240]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:22.040]  Well it's very traitorous what's happened and State Representative David Simpson told
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:23.920]  us about this this morning.
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:30.640]  They rewrote the bill in the House to say that basically for any reason they can grope
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:31.640]  you.
[03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:35.400]  So they took a bill saying we're going to enforce the law that police or anybody else
[03:24:35.400 --> 03:24:38.400]  can't stick their hands down your pants without a warrant.
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:41.720]  And they've said now basically if government feels like it, they can.
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:44.080]  And they're now selling that.
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:48.560]  Now remember the House unanimously voted a month ago to enforce the law and say you
[03:24:48.560 --> 03:24:52.760]  can't touch on the outside of the inside of the pants or skirt or whatever it is.
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:58.240]  And now they've twisted that to say yes, TSA for any reason can basically give you a
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:00.640]  proctology exam if they want to.
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:05.440]  So the 95-year-old ladies dying of cancer, get ready, a world of hurt's coming.
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:09.720]  This is all about federal power grab, federal occupation, it's all about checkpoints all
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:11.720]  across the country.
[03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:17.200]  Let's let the House know we're aware of their treason.
[03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:18.200]  Treason!
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  Treason!
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:20.200]  Treason!
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:21.200]  Treason!
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:22.200]  Treason!
[03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:23.200]  Treason!
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:24.200]  Treason!
[03:25:24.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  Treason!
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:26.200]  Treason!
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:27.200]  Treason!
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:28.200]  Treason!
[03:25:28.200 --> 03:25:29.200]  Treason!
[03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:30.200]  Treason!
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:31.200]  Treason!
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:32.200]  Treason!
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:33.200]  Treason!
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:37.120]  These are criminals that tax your property and everything.
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:46.000]  These are scumbags that rest on the floor so they can lay down on their backs for the
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  federal government to come in here and grop our little girls and boys.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  Yeah, you like it.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  What this is, what this is, is a pedophile protection network.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:20.480]  They think we don't know Perry killed the last bill on a claims he supports it.
[03:26:20.480 --> 03:26:27.480]  No matter what your policy is, the point is, Rick Perry is a deceptive snake at the level
[03:26:27.480 --> 03:26:32.160]  of the devil.
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:34.880]  This is our capital.
[03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:38.880]  It doesn't belong to the offshore banks.
[03:26:38.880 --> 03:26:54.680]  Seven years I served, I fought for the Constitution, y'all should have pulled it, but my friends
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:55.680]  died.
[03:26:55.680 --> 03:27:00.680]  The senators were visibly changed whenever they started the chanting outdoors and then
[03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:05.960]  you were still filming and due to her attention kind of came back to the Senate floor.
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:11.280]  When you moved, just a few feet, he looked up, he was tracking, you're every move, he
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:16.680]  was very aware of the people in there, very aware of the people that were out in the hall
[03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:19.680]  and very, very aware of that camera.
[03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:22.880]  We've been in here before, I've been in here with media, Davey.
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:24.680]  Well that's the rules today, you can't have it.
[03:27:24.680 --> 03:27:25.680]  All rules today.
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:26.680]  Not like the speed limit's 55.
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:27.680]  I'm not going to do this with you.
[03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:29.680]  We're going to get the police then.
[03:27:29.680 --> 03:27:31.280]  Yeah, get the police.
[03:27:31.280 --> 03:27:36.320]  So again, this is America now, we're in here peacefully sitting here not doing anything
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:41.720]  and he comes and he says the rules today are that you can't videotape.
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:43.320]  The rules today.
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:46.720]  Now usually the police get caught in here and we've caught it before where the police
[03:27:46.720 --> 03:27:54.600]  are shooting live video as well, where the police do their job and leave everybody alone
[03:27:54.600 --> 03:27:58.840]  and we hope that's the case, but Rob's been here before when they're all voting for each
[03:27:58.840 --> 03:27:59.840]  other.
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:00.840]  Go ahead, there's Kirk Watson though.
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:27.840]  First, we're going to bring that to the, I just want to say then, please don't, please
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:39.140]  don't, please don't, please don't, please don't.
[03:28:39.140 --> 03:28:46.480]  But here's the issue, National TV, the D squareds report, infowars dot com, the whole world's
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:54.040]  watching and what we learned from Texas will be used in other states to beat you, globalists,
[03:28:54.040 --> 03:29:14.040]  and mercenaries. And when we take America back, you Nazis are going to prison.
[03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:20.400]  The lobbyists that serve tyranny, the politicians that serve tyranny are going to prison. This
[03:29:20.400 --> 03:29:31.400]  is only the beginning. The answer to 1984 is 1776!
