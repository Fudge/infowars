[00:00.000 --> 00:18.120]  Resistance to tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.120 --> 00:24.320]  Alright, there's this unprecedented circus that's been going for the last three hours
[00:24.320 --> 00:30.120]  on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Barr's testimony, and the Left thought that he was their God,
[00:30.120 --> 00:34.920]  that Mueller was their God, but when they came up empty, they're now having complete meltdowns.
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.560]  We've got all the highlights for you. David Knight did a great job earlier carrying it
[00:38.560 --> 00:41.920]  live and also during breaks, going to the different highlights of it, but I thought
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.200]  we'd just start out now into the next segment with his opening statement and some of the
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.000]  fireworks of the Left flipping out, so here it is. Again, they're in recess right now,
[00:51.000 --> 01:20.680]  but this was earlier this morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Feinstein,
[01:20.680 --> 01:30.060]  members of the committee. During my confirmation process, there were two concerns that dominated
[01:30.060 --> 01:37.080]  as I think you will all agree. The first was whether I would in any way impede or curtail
[01:37.080 --> 01:43.440]  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, and the second, whether I would make public his
[01:43.440 --> 01:51.000]  final report. As you see, Bob Mueller was allowed to complete his work as he saw fit, and as
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.560]  to the report, even though the applicable regulations require that the report is to
[01:55.560 --> 02:03.040]  be made to the AG and is to remain confidential and not be made public, I told this committee
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.960]  that I intended to exercise whatever discretion I had to make as much of the report available
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.080]  to the public and to congressional leaders as I could, consistent with the law. This
[02:14.080 --> 02:22.720]  has been done. I arrived at the department on February 14th, and shortly thereafter,
[02:22.720 --> 02:32.080]  I asked it to be communicated to Bob Mueller's team that in preparing the report, we requested
[02:32.080 --> 02:39.160]  that they make it so we could readily identify 6e material so we could quickly process the
[02:39.160 --> 02:45.960]  report. Did you tell the public what 6e is? 6e is grand jury material that cannot be made
[02:45.960 --> 02:53.400]  public. It's prohibited by statute. I wanted that identified so we could redact that material
[02:53.400 --> 02:59.040]  and prepare the report for public release as quickly as we could. When I arrived at the
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.080]  department I found, and was eventually briefed in on the investigation, I found that the deputy
[03:04.080 --> 03:11.480]  attorney general and his principal associate deputy at Calihan were in regular discussions
[03:11.480 --> 03:20.320]  with the council's office had been, and they communicated this request and had discussions
[03:20.320 --> 03:28.640]  about both the timing of the report and the nature of the report. On March 5th, I met
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.720]  with Bob at the suggestion of the deputy and the principal associate deputy, Bob Mueller,
[03:34.720 --> 03:50.040]  met with Bob Mueller, to get a readout on what his conclusions would be. On March 25th,
[03:50.040 --> 03:57.240]  and at that meeting, I asked, I reiterated to Special Counsel Mueller that in order to
[03:57.240 --> 04:03.400]  have the shortest possible time before I was in a position to release the report, I asked
[04:03.400 --> 04:12.200]  that they identify 6e material. When I received the report on March 22nd, and we were hoping
[04:12.200 --> 04:19.920]  to have that easily identified the 6e material, unfortunately, it did not come in that form.
[04:19.920 --> 04:26.480]  And it quickly became apparent that it would take about three or four weeks to identify
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.760]  that material and other material that had to be redacted. So there was necessarily going
[04:31.760 --> 04:38.200]  to be a gap between the receipt of the report and getting the full report out publicly.
[04:38.200 --> 04:45.480]  The deputy and I identified four categories of information that we believe required redaction.
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.720]  And I think you all know of them, but they were the grand jury. We'll be back with the
[04:50.720 --> 04:57.720]  Democrats fireworks. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us. It's May Day. I think Commie Day.
[04:57.720 --> 05:00.360]  Stay with us.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.400]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us. And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[05:04.400 --> 05:10.160]  need, you don't want. The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put
[05:10.160 --> 05:17.120]  it on par with a major city. Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[05:17.120 --> 05:22.240]  How can I solve that problem? So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure
[05:22.240 --> 05:30.720]  Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air
[05:30.720 --> 05:36.040]  filter technology. And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now. We're basically
[05:36.040 --> 05:41.000]  selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul. Go ahead and read the hundreds
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.320]  of five star reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference,
[05:47.320 --> 05:54.200]  ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house. Don't live in a polluted
[05:54.200 --> 06:13.000]  major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to Infowarsstore.com. From the front lines
[06:13.000 --> 06:25.880]  of the information war, it's Alex Jones. Now you're standing at some dot. You better
[06:25.880 --> 06:35.880]  learn to get somewhere. Hide what you have to hide. And tell what you have to tell. You'll
[06:35.880 --> 06:53.240]  find your problems. And you continually decide to faithfully pursue the policy of truth.
[06:53.240 --> 06:57.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host Alex Jones. We've
[06:57.080 --> 07:04.400]  got all the highlights of the explosive first half of the Bob Barr fiasco that's going on
[07:04.400 --> 07:12.480]  right now. We've got those coming up for you. We've got Ted Nugent joining us to chime in
[07:12.480 --> 07:18.040]  on what's unfolding and his new album just dropped. And we're going to also have the
[07:18.040 --> 07:23.760]  gentleman on. That's the point with Brandon. It was out in California when the Antifa
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.240]  attacked him and he fought back and kicked six or seven of their asses. And then the
[07:28.240 --> 07:32.640]  police arrested the Antifa. So he's going to be joining us. We're also going to have
[07:32.640 --> 07:38.360]  Mike Adams of counter think in studio with me in the third hour. And that's what we're
[07:38.360 --> 07:42.760]  going to have a lot of the highlights. And of course, the hearings going to continue.
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.520]  They are in recess now. And these are some wild attacks by the Democrats that we're going
[07:48.520 --> 07:52.400]  to be playing. I was at home this morning, hanging out with my children, but also doing
[07:52.400 --> 07:56.400]  research and then exercising while I watched the David night show. Probably watched two
[07:56.400 --> 08:01.880]  hours of it this morning off and on. And he had live coverage of it. And it was just crazy
[08:01.880 --> 08:07.880]  to see them twist in the wind and freak out and then imply that bars covering all this
[08:07.880 --> 08:14.680]  up. I cannot believe that we're not moving against the Democrats stronger when they're
[08:14.680 --> 08:18.240]  in bed with the chai comms, the Russians and everybody else. They openly hate the country.
[08:18.240 --> 08:23.440]  They're openly trying to get rid of the nation. They're openly demonizing the country. And
[08:23.440 --> 08:26.520]  then they're the ones that have been caught trying to overthrow an election. And then
[08:26.520 --> 08:32.240]  they've got the nerve to sit there and take the Mueller report that say whitewash covering
[08:32.240 --> 08:39.680]  up their crimes and then turn it around as if it's the word of God. And so because Mueller
[08:39.680 --> 08:44.800]  said he couldn't prove obstruction, but that doesn't mean it didn't exist. Now bar is supposedly
[08:44.800 --> 08:53.200]  corrupt and Satan bar was brought in because he came from more serious time and he was
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.680]  involved in some serious scandals. Iran contra and things like that, obviously overseeing
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.840]  some of the cleanup of it. But at the same time, he doesn't want the country to collapse
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.280]  and go into a violent civil war. And that's really what's been happening here. That's
[09:08.280 --> 09:12.280]  really what's unfolding. That's really what the deep state crazies are pushing for. And
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.960]  Trump has them with all of the intercepts and all of the documents and all of the coding
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.800]  and all of the evidence of their attempt in a coup. And he's loaded for bear with a big
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.680]  cannon pointed right at their head politically. And the Democrats are so driven by hook spa
[09:30.680 --> 09:38.600]  and by bravada and by they're out of control, a plum and they're hubris that they just can't
[09:38.600 --> 09:44.080]  stop. They're openly flooding the border. It's open. I even saw a big report out today
[09:44.080 --> 09:49.760]  on Drudge. Top scientific facilities, medical facilities are coming out saying we have millions
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.960]  of people pouring in, hundreds of thousands have diseases. This has never been done in
[09:53.960 --> 10:00.160]  history. It's totally insane. The border patrol is being told to release people that have
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.200]  smallpox, that have bubonic plague. I mean, it's actually in the report. In fact, I should
[10:06.200 --> 10:12.560]  have just led the whole show with that. But that's what's driving me crazy is that I can't
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.400]  even keep track of this anymore because this is a war. This is the attempt to take down
[10:17.400 --> 10:22.680]  of the nation. And we're this country that's into entertainment and having fun and there's
[10:22.680 --> 10:28.520]  a thousand shows on Netflix and people can't take it serious in our own government and
[10:28.520 --> 10:36.200]  the general public how much damn danger we're in. We had Shaiqom funded and supported Hollywood
[10:36.200 --> 10:41.400]  driven anti-American coalition try to create a race war in this country. They're still
[10:41.400 --> 10:47.760]  doing it. They're trying to destroy the borders completely. They've got Ilhan Omar and AOC
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.720]  and all the usual suspects foaming at the mouth with anti-white rhetoric that you have
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.040]  got just insane garbage everywhere unfolding. You've got the government funding radical
[10:58.040 --> 11:04.200]  Islam trying to collapse Europe. That is the global government. This is crazy. It has to
[11:04.200 --> 11:10.000]  stop. The globalists have taken our acquiescence as weakness. They have taken how far they were
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.800]  able to go as the green light to go absolutely wild and take over civilization. That's what
[11:16.800 --> 11:23.080]  they've done. And we're being usurped by a bunch of ruthless mega corporations that
[11:23.080 --> 11:29.520]  sit offshore and then hire and organize the dumbest, most traitorous scum they can find
[11:29.520 --> 11:35.720]  to bum rush this nation. And as I told you, MS-13 and the drug cartels are openly working
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.000]  with the Democratic Party. They're shipping in the narcotics. They're running the sex
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.560]  slavery. They're running the pedophilia. They're running the child porn. They are planning
[11:44.560 --> 11:52.840]  to decapitate loyal law enforcement and members of Congress when the order goes out. Antifa
[11:52.840 --> 11:59.640]  is being called a good organization on MSNBC and CNN. It's being praised by people like
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.840]  Cuomo. Remember when Cuomo said that if your daughter in middle school doesn't want to
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.520]  see a man who says he's a woman and doesn't want to see his genitals, that she's a hate
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.960]  longer and you're a bad person? That's right. The 30-year-old man wants to say he's a woman
[12:13.960 --> 12:17.960]  and come in the shower with your daughter Cuomo says it's okay. And now let's cue it
[12:17.960 --> 12:26.520]  up to that. And now he's come out and said Antifa is a good cause, a bunch of dirty
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.560]  meth head professors and government employees who want to larp, who want to go out in the
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.440]  real world and hit women in the head with bike locks and stab people and run around
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.600]  in their feted cities like San Francisco and Portland and pull down their pants and crap
[12:41.600 --> 12:44.860]  all over the ground. It's not just the homeless that crap all over the ground. I've shown
[12:44.860 --> 12:51.080]  you newscast that in Portland, liberal men take it as a sacrament to crap all over the
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.880]  streets and make you walk through it because they're arrested development. They're demon-possessed.
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.960]  And guess what? Your children belong to them, they believe. And they are going to tell you,
[13:01.960 --> 13:07.240]  like the exorcist would tell you that you're going to hell and your parents are going to
[13:07.240 --> 13:10.240]  hell and your children are going to hell and they're going to feast on your children's
[13:10.240 --> 13:13.720]  flesh and there's nothing you're going to do about it. And they're going to kill your
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.760]  babies after they're born and they're going to keep them alive and they're going to torture
[13:17.760 --> 13:23.280]  them and you're going to love it because you're in a coma, because you're not awake, because
[13:23.280 --> 13:28.760]  you're dependent to a trance. So these vampires can feed on you and you look at a little chicken
[13:28.760 --> 13:35.520]  neck, little apple-headed, pear-headed, nadler and all these weak people, all these grasping,
[13:35.520 --> 13:42.120]  fallen, satanic people feeding on our blood, loving it and no one standing against them.
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.400]  Let's go ahead and go to this report. Here's Cuomo that says your daughter will be in showers
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.880]  with men's giant genitals. Now he says antify is good and America sucks. Like his brother
[13:53.880 --> 13:58.600]  said, America was never great. It'll never be great. And Cuomo can drink and drive and
[13:58.600 --> 14:05.680]  do hit and runs and he's above the law. He is your God. He is your king. Here he is.
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.640]  He said two things, okay? And I do want people to remember. He wasn't on this correction campaign
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.040]  back then. He had plenty of opportunities to do it. He didn't. He said two things. One,
[14:16.040 --> 14:21.720]  there's blame on both sides for the violence. Now, Steve, you can talk all left all day
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.480]  long and that's fine with me. I have no problem with it. People who are rogue actors and criminals
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.760]  deserve the harsh treatment of the law. But whether you want to talk about antifa or Black
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.760]  Lives Matter or any of the groups that assembled that day to fight against neo-Nazis, you make
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.360]  a moral equivalent between those two actions. You're making a mistake in America.
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.680]  Well, they really don't want Charlottesville investigated. That's why we're putting PIs
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.320]  on and everything else because they did have a bunch of actors there. Most of those Nazis
[14:51.320 --> 14:54.600]  are Democrat operatives. And we know it. We actually know some of the names. We've gotten
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.280]  some of the contracts now, how they were paid through a company. So that's all going to
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.680]  be coming out. Oh, yeah, it's all going to be coming out. So there you go, ladies and
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.680]  gentlemen, totally staged. I'm not saying the woman didn't die. I'm not saying an individual
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.040]  there killed her. Oh, the guy that ran over or ran into her. The fact is they created
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.960]  the climate for it to unfold. And we're figuring out what's going on now. That's why they're
[15:17.960 --> 15:23.160]  coming after us is they don't want us messing up the next events they stage. Well, guess
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.080]  what? They can't stop them for worse and they can't stop you. And they sure as hell cannot
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.200]  stop you going out to these events with cameras and documenting and hell, even dressing up
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.520]  like Antifa and infiltrating them. Now, you've got to have a really, really, really white
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.080]  green skin. You got to say you love Satan. You've had to poop on the ground as an initiation.
[15:41.080 --> 15:46.280]  I'm serious. But that's how they mark their territory. But even it means you got to do
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.800]  a rail of, you know, methamphetamine with them. You get into these professors and I'm telling
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.800]  you, they'll be showing you child porn, everything. They are criminals. We must smash them politically.

[16:34.520 --> 16:39.600]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[16:39.600 --> 16:46.440]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[16:46.440 --> 16:52.040]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began

[20:23.760 --> 20:41.280]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm going to be playing some of the highlights
[20:41.280 --> 20:49.120]  of the Democrats and others flipping out on William Barb who saw the evidence of the crimes
[20:49.120 --> 20:54.880]  committed by Obama, Hillary and the deep state against Trump and basically called
[20:55.520 --> 20:59.600]  Mullerin who was unable to ever find anything on the Republican or on the patriot side
[21:00.720 --> 21:05.920]  on the Trump side and said, dude, this is all illegal. You're lucky you're not going to jail.
[21:07.120 --> 21:10.400]  I'm going to get you out of this. That's what Barr is, is a cleanup guy.
[21:11.760 --> 21:16.880]  And he's not cleaning up Donald Trump's dirty diapers, folks. Donald Trump's potty trained.
[21:16.880 --> 21:22.560]  Donald Trump doesn't crap all over America. He's been crap all over the Russians and
[21:22.560 --> 21:27.920]  the Chinese and everybody cutting off their gas deals, sabotaging their operations for you,
[21:29.120 --> 21:35.360]  for you. And the globalist, he's been brutal, by the way. Oh, but the globalists have all these
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.720]  traders that tell you they hate America and that America sucks and that George Washington sucks
[21:40.720 --> 21:45.680]  and the American flag sucks and our military sucks and we suck and we were never great and
[21:45.680 --> 21:51.440]  we'll never be great. And then the very damn traders that tell you they hate you and your family
[21:52.560 --> 21:59.760]  and hate Christianity. Oh, we're going to save America from Alex Jones and the Patriots
[21:59.760 --> 22:05.280]  and Donald Trump. Oh, save me, Michael Moore from the Russians.
[22:08.080 --> 22:11.360]  No one believes it because it's pure crap.
[22:11.360 --> 22:19.200]  Mullen couldn't believe it in two and a half years, it was even longer than that,
[22:20.240 --> 22:25.920]  that they couldn't find one American to take money from the Russians and it wasn't the Russians.
[22:27.120 --> 22:35.840]  It was the deep state. It's all come out. They couldn't get one person in Trump's
[22:35.840 --> 22:42.240]  not even immediate orbit, but way out at Pluto, way out past the Kuiper Belt.
[22:43.440 --> 22:52.080]  They couldn't get one person from our camp to be a damn trader. They're all the traders and
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.480]  they know it and I'm trying not to drop a GD here, but you know this is the time to drop one
[22:56.480 --> 22:59.920]  because these people are damned to hell. That's not updating the Lord's name in vain.
[22:59.920 --> 23:06.480]  These people are the worst of the worst. I'm going to settle down and go to this clip with my gut.
[23:11.360 --> 23:19.440]  They've been caught doing everything. Again, it's like the police pull up to a robbery at a bank
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.520]  at high noon and they catch the robbers in the vault with bags of money in their hands
[23:23.520 --> 23:32.000]  and people tied up. You're going to prison, man. It's done, but instead I've got to watch the guilty
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.080]  stand up there and say I'm guilty and our reporters are all over this country. People run up and go
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.800]  ask you Alex Jones is going to prison. He's a Russian agent. You've got to see these new
[23:42.800 --> 23:47.040]  clips that are up on infowords.com that Millie Weaver and others got. Man, it's scary what the
[23:47.040 --> 23:55.040]  Democrats have produced. Rutgers, Caitlyn Bennett, the videos on infowords.com, it's gone viral.
[23:56.400 --> 23:57.920]  Millions of years happened yesterday.
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.280]  They come up and they say you're not allowed to interview people here. No free speech and the
[24:05.280 --> 24:11.200]  police come and then the liberals do victory dances and actually pose and beat their chest.
[24:11.200 --> 24:20.240]  It's crazy. This country is in a lot of trouble, folks. These people are dangerous.
[24:21.200 --> 24:28.400]  They're authoritarians and they're stealing your birth right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.800]  And they've been caught. So what are we going to do?
[24:34.800 --> 24:39.600]  Every day that these people aren't indicted, this country inches towards total open bloody war,
[24:39.600 --> 24:46.320]  not cold war, not just a soft civil war, but the real deal. That's their goal and then they're
[24:46.320 --> 24:53.840]  going to blame us for it. Here's Bob Barb saying the media created the confusion over the Mueller
[24:53.840 --> 25:02.240]  report. Yeah, on purpose. Here it is. So we released that. I offered Bob Mueller the opportunity to
[25:02.240 --> 25:14.160]  review that letter before it went out and he declined. On Thursday morning, I received it,
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.440]  probably was received at the department Wednesday night or evening. But on Thursday morning,
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.960]  I received a letter from Bob, the letter that's just been put into the record.
[25:22.960 --> 25:33.440]  And I called Bob and said, what's the issue here? And I asked him if he was suggesting that the March
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.280]  24th letter was inaccurate. And he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.920]  and that the press was reading too much into it. And I asked him specifically what his concern was
[25:45.920 --> 25:54.480]  and he said that his concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion
[25:54.480 --> 26:03.840]  on obstruction. And he wanted more put out on that issue. He wanted, he argued for putting
[26:03.840 --> 26:11.520]  out summaries of each volume, the executive summaries that had been written by his office.
[26:11.520 --> 26:18.960]  And if not that, then other material that focused on the issue of why he didn't reach the obstruction
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.960]  question. But he was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his
[26:26.960 --> 26:42.000]  report. I told Bob that I was not interested in putting out summaries. And I wasn't going to put
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.800]  out the report piecemeal. I wanted to get the whole report out. And I thought summaries by
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.080]  very definition, regardless of who prepared them, would be underinclusive. And we'd have sort of a
[26:54.080 --> 27:00.880]  series of different debates and public discord over each tranche of information that went out.
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.040]  And I wanted to get everything out at once. And we should start working on that.
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.520]  That is so bombshell. Let me translate that. I'm sure you all caught it.
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.160]  Mueller didn't want the full report released because it showed all the criminal activity they
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.720]  carried out. They wanted made up summaries. I told you a month ago, I said the Democrats are acting
[27:18.720 --> 27:22.080]  like they want the whole report. They don't want the whole report. They know it shows the evidence
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.240]  of their crimes and their setups. That's what's all blacked out. You can tell by what's in there.
[27:26.240 --> 27:31.760]  I've been living this, folks. I know. Think about that. Think about that.
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.600]  And he said, no, we're not going to let the media take each piece of this and put out this info
[27:37.600 --> 27:42.640]  by it not being public. I learned that about nondisclosures. Because obviously anybody that's
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.960]  worked here gets approached and offered money to lie about us and say incredible things. But
[27:46.960 --> 27:52.640]  most people that have worked here refuse to take the money. And now we've recorded some folks offering
[27:52.640 --> 27:58.240]  the money and things like that that will be coming out soon. But you learn like a nondisclosure
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.200]  becomes something for people to make up things behind it. Oh, I could tell you how Alex is
[28:03.200 --> 28:09.040]  raping purple unicorns in the basement with the Easter Bunny, but you know, I have a nondisclosure.
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.920]  It's the same thing. Oh, you're hiding the report. Release it. Trump's like, yeah, release the whole
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.600]  thing. They're like, well, in the national security, but I don't do that because it shows all them
[28:19.600 --> 28:27.200]  trying to set people up and how it failed. I have personally experienced this, my friends.
[28:28.880 --> 28:36.640]  So just again, we've got Ted Nugent coming up more clips as well. Please don't forget we are only

[31:06.800 --> 31:11.920]  broadcast, you're bragging. It just gets old, man. I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[31:12.560 --> 31:17.040]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional
[31:17.040 --> 31:23.120]  hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to
[31:23.120 --> 31:27.840]  anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it gonna take us being shut down? Is that what

[31:38.320 --> 31:43.280]  begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not gonna just stop

[32:02.080 --> 32:06.480]  the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine,
[32:06.480 --> 32:13.360]  you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.080]  our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[32:18.640 --> 32:23.040]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the globalists
[32:23.040 --> 32:27.680]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[32:27.680 --> 32:33.040]  nascent iodine and raw UX2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block
[32:33.040 --> 32:38.480]  that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But
[32:39.280 --> 32:43.440]  chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[32:43.440 --> 32:49.920]  compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[32:49.920 --> 32:54.880]  bio-available. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[32:54.880 --> 33:20.880]  it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[33:20.880 --> 33:25.680]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.040 --> 33:38.640]  It's May Day. That's the big commie Socialist Celebration Day. Looks like Venezuela may
[33:38.640 --> 33:43.280]  completely fall. The communist parasitic government may be removed, maybe even today.
[33:44.480 --> 33:48.720]  Wouldn't that be poetic justice? Armored vehicles running over innocent people, machine gunning
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.680]  the disarmed population. I have a crazy clip where even MSNBC tells the truth and says if they had an
[33:53.680 --> 34:02.000]  armed population, Maduro would not be in power. The guy's a dictator. Who is that I'm listening to?
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.800]  Is that Ted Nugent? He's joining us right now. I really appreciate him coming on. His new albums
[34:06.800 --> 34:11.360]  out. Music made me do. We'll play some clips of that. But I wanted to go to Antifa up front with
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.600]  him and just talk about the Second Amendment, the NRA, and so much more. FBI report came out.
[34:17.600 --> 34:20.560]  And of course, you have Ted's hooked into law enforcement. He probably already knows this,
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.320]  but came out Sunday. Got almost no national attention, though. FBI, National Alert,
[34:26.320 --> 34:34.400]  Antifa activists schemed with drug cartels, MS-13, you name it, to staged armed rebellion
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.280]  and to kill federal officers. They've gone inside the groups doing this, but it doesn't matter.
[34:39.280 --> 34:42.640]  Chris Cuomo, whose brother says America was never great and will never be great,
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.560]  Chris Cuomo, he says that Antifa is a good cause. This is a group that is for violence,
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.120]  is for attacking people, is for shutting down free speech. They've aimed guns at our reporters.
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.640]  They are a criminal organization that praises killing innocent police.
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.680]  Ted Nugent, thank you so much for joining us, my friend.
[35:01.120 --> 35:07.600]  It's May Day, May Day, May Day. That's the hopeless cry of a ship about to go down. But I'm
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.600]  here to tell you, Alex, I know all those points you're bringing up are critical. We have to
[35:11.600 --> 35:16.960]  dissect them, to get to the bottom of them, rectify them, remedy them, and we the people
[35:16.960 --> 35:22.160]  are hardcore doing that. We thank you for, you know, leading the charge. But may I, if I may,
[35:22.160 --> 35:29.920]  may the old guitar player bring a more beautiful, peaceful, May 1st, 2019 to the Alex Jones show.
[35:29.920 --> 35:31.040]  Please do it.
[35:31.040 --> 35:39.280]  Yes, there is chaos. It is planet of the cuckoo's nest apes out there. Right is wrong, wrong is
[35:39.280 --> 35:44.400]  right up, is down, down is up, good is bad, bad is good. But let me tell you, and I know I always
[35:44.400 --> 35:48.240]  do this, but I think it's very important, especially for you, my friend. You need to,
[35:48.240 --> 35:53.360]  you need, I'm like Mother Teresa with a glock. I'm here to cleanse your soul.
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.040]  No, I hear you. I'm really pissed off today.
[35:55.680 --> 36:02.640]  And as a warrior, as a constitutional free American, we the people hellraiser,
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.560]  which we all have an obligation to do, and I salute you every time for doing that,
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.120]  we also must listen to the greatest philosopher of all times, and that was Dirty Harry,
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.640]  when he said, a good man has to know his limitations. Alex, you're on the phone with,
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.240]  right now, and sharing the words of the author of Stranglehold and Wango Tango,
[36:23.200 --> 36:30.640]  that I am in this fight every day for at least 50 years. I'm 70 now, and I started counter punching
[36:30.640 --> 36:37.120]  the political correctness opening volley back in the 1960s, Alice went out.
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.000]  You were the Paul Revere. You were the first to raise the alarm.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.680]  I was attacked for carrying a gun, believing in self-defense, promoting self-defense,
[36:46.320 --> 36:51.120]  and murdering innocent animals. I guess somebody missed the barbecue alert.
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.040]  So I have been in the crosshairs of the left and, you know, they attack you,
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.600]  they attack Donald Trump, they attack anybody who they're afraid of, but are you,
[36:59.600 --> 37:06.160]  can you believe the depth of vulgarity and obscenity that the left levels at me,
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.040]  the things they say about me, if my children weren't already
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.160]  nutrient fortified for truth, logic, and common sense, it would break our hearts
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.400]  because the media is the devil. And of course, only the guilty need to feel guilty,
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.480]  but the nasty, rotten, hateful lies they level at me and my family,
[37:28.480 --> 37:31.840]  we brush it off like personal hygiene off of Michael Moore.
[37:32.560 --> 37:39.840]  We go into battle anyway. So let me just, let me just emphasize that you give the world the best
[37:39.840 --> 37:46.720]  you got and you get kicked in the teeth. Alex Jones and everybody who believes in America,
[37:46.720 --> 37:54.160]  give the world the best you got anyway, so you can bring up any of these contentious, insane
[37:54.160 --> 37:59.440]  issues and the hate and the lies and the corruption and the abuse of power and the criminality,
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.960]  media, academia, our government, God, it breaks my heart. But Alex, I am so
[38:04.960 --> 38:11.040]  cock-blocked and ready to rock the clock doc that if they mess with me, I have historically
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.000]  delivered every time that when they attempt to debate truth, logic, and common sense with Ted
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.960]  Nugent, I eat their family tree and I spit sawdust in their face. Well, let's talk about that.
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.680]  Let's talk about that because you look at AOC, you look at Ilhan Omar, you look at all these
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.320]  America haters, literally trying to invoke racial and religious war. It's not working.
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.520]  And as you said though, those that are dumbed down are getting dumber. Those that are awake
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.280]  are getting more awake. And I think we are really starting to win the culture war in many ways,
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.800]  not just here, but all over the world, but they are just getting crazier and wilder and more violent
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.080]  and more insane. And I'm just wondering where you think this is going?
[38:48.080 --> 38:55.440]  Well, it's not pretty, but I've been at this. I've been in hand-to-hand combat with this culture war
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.840]  all my adult life. And there were junctures where I was genuinely frightened by the direction.
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.680]  Obviously, what Bill Clinton did was certainly the worst of the worst when Barack Obama took the
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.760]  helm and started the suicidal nosedive against the Constitution and freedom and individuality
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.280]  and rugged individualism as entrepreneurship. But I'll tell you where it's going. If you and I could
[39:19.280 --> 39:26.640]  donate to a cause to get AOC to talk more, to get Solware to talk more openly, to get Adam
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.320]  Schiff to talk more openly, to spotlight the cockroaches and the top authority figures like
[39:32.320 --> 39:39.360]  James Comey and Brennan. And these people who literally ran America, now they've been exposed
[39:39.360 --> 39:46.640]  to liars and haters, and here's the clincher. They violate their oath to the Constitution
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.520]  every day when they wake up, and American hard-working families are going,
[39:51.520 --> 39:58.400]  are you kidding me? You believe in killing a baby even after it's born? You believe in using the
[39:58.400 --> 40:05.280]  American government to confiscate guns? You actually believe that there's free anything?
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.640]  You actually want to turn San Francisco into the feces needle epicenter of earth and you're proud
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.520]  of it? So it's like you and I went to Central Casting and we said, how could we get the most
[40:15.520 --> 40:22.400]  obnoxious offenses, stinky punk, to represent the enemy? And they gave us Nancy Pelosi and Michael
[40:22.400 --> 40:28.480]  Moore. We should be grateful that the left is so emboldened that they're that stupid to think that
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.800]  there's that many dumbed-down Americans and we are going to kick their worthless ass in 2020,
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.880]  mark my words. I totally agree with you, but it's like you're saying, you go out, you see these
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.320]  people, I go out, we're not trying to exaggerate to make them look bad. They're so horrible on average
[40:44.320 --> 40:50.400]  now and so stupid and so hateful. I have a lot of liberal friends. Most of them I've already fixed,
[40:50.400 --> 40:57.440]  but some of them are still too stoned to get it. So they don't believe in secure borders. Alex,
[40:58.080 --> 41:04.080]  that has been the ruination of every culture. They actually believe that you can get free stuff
[41:04.080 --> 41:11.520]  that nobody has to pay for stuff, college tuition and a guaranteed income. You don't think that that
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.080]  might disincentivize people if they don't have to... Hold on, Uncle Jed. Stay there. We're going to
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.080]  break. I want to walk through borders. I want to walk through free stuff and where this goes every
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.120]  time. What people don't get is if you're bordering even a nice country and you don't have a border,
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.800]  criminals set up and jump back and forth in the systems. But if you've got a corrupt country
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.800]  or a bad country, it will collapse you if you don't have a border. And 100% we are being
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.800]  collapsed by design. I think the Democrats know what they're doing. They want to bring the country
[41:38.800 --> 41:42.720]  down. They want to loot it. The average kind of dumbed down liberal just goes into it because
[41:42.720 --> 41:48.080]  of peer pressure. I agree with you, but I think the left has converted most liberals into actually
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.040]  just being pirates. I think you might be right, but I'll give you a word from the not so mean
[41:53.040 --> 41:58.000]  streets of America right fresh from the National Rifle Association Convention in Indianapolis and
[41:58.000 --> 42:05.840]  my spirit soars on high. I totally agree with you on that. I want to get into your new record.
[42:05.840 --> 42:10.160]  I want to get into Trump and some of the other issues you see unfolding when we come back. But
[42:10.160 --> 42:15.440]  just briefly, NRA shakeup. Obviously, you're part of the NRA board. You're involved in that.
[42:15.440 --> 42:21.600]  I'm just trying to stay out of it, but the NRA strong, right? NRA is strong. We are on course.
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.240]  We believe in the right to keep and bear arms and to crush anybody that gets in the way. If
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.720]  you're not a member of the National Rifle Association, Nancy Pelosi would like to thank you.
[42:32.400 --> 42:35.600]  Absolutely. All right, we're going to come right back with Ted Nugent. And by the way,
[42:35.600 --> 42:39.360]  folks, a lot of people say, oh, the NRA is not hardcore enough. It's Ted Nugent that got him
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.320]  back on the straight and narrow about 10 years ago. And thanks to great groups out there like
[42:44.320 --> 42:49.280]  Gunners of America. But regardless, the NRA, thank God for the NRA, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:49.920 --> 42:53.600]  We keep them honest, though. We keep each other honest. We'll be right back in FullWars.com,

[46:53.680 --> 47:20.880]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible. God bless you.
[47:20.880 --> 47:25.680]  The music made me do it.
[47:25.680 --> 47:33.200]  At TedNugent.com, 70 years old. And I got to tell you, meet him in person. He's an intimidating guy.
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.120]  He's not trying to act tough. You're just like, this is a red-blooded American right here. He's
[47:37.120 --> 47:43.760]  on fire for freedom. And then I go, his wife's amazing as well. Then you go out to a leftist
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.160]  event and they look like somebody sucked their soul out. Like it's Day of the Dead. And I don't
[47:48.160 --> 47:53.520]  say that like I'm having pleasure that they're so pathetic and so stupid. And they just chirp lies.
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.880]  Chirp lies. And I'm glad Ted brings this up a lot. Because if you haven't been famous and a
[47:58.880 --> 48:04.720]  conservative or a nationalist, you've never experienced the lying when you know the truth.
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.440]  They do NPR pieces and ABC news pieces and CNN pieces where none of it's true. Because you
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.880]  tune into these things, you think, well, something's got to be true in it, right? Like half of it's a
[48:14.880 --> 48:23.520]  lie. No, all lies. Insane lies. I mean, we had reporters in Rutgers and other areas and people
[48:23.520 --> 48:29.760]  walk over and go, Alex Jones killed children. Alex Jones is a pedophile. I mean, just made up and
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.480]  but this is what Democrats do. They believe all of this. So it's just important to understand
[48:35.440 --> 48:39.600]  they've gone to seed. They're rotting. They're falling apart. Ted Nugent, the new album is out.
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.960]  You know, most folks, their first album is the best of their third album, but by album 20 something,
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.120]  they're not good anymore. You tune to Ted Nugent music, it just gets better and better and better
[48:49.120 --> 48:53.440]  and to watch him play the Star Spangled Banner in his living room. It's just there's nothing like
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.040]  it when you're sitting three feet away. Tell us about the new album a little bit before we get
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.360]  back into what's happening currently, Ted. Well, I had a bumper crop of goosebumps this year and
[49:01.360 --> 49:06.080]  I'm willing to give them away free. You know, I'm so lucky, Alex. I am 70 years old, but it's
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.960]  important to note and I tell this everywhere I go because I'm from the crazy world of rock and roll
[49:10.960 --> 49:14.640]  where I have to step over all these dead bodies because they're trying to be hip and go to a
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.800]  party that included, you know, drooling, puking, stumbling and dying because they wanted to get
[49:18.800 --> 49:26.000]  high and be comfortably numb. To that I say, kiss my royal high energy ass and I tell everybody
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.560]  I go and speak with or share campfires with that I've been cleaning sober for 70 years. No drugs,
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.720]  no alcohol, no too. Well, I do chew on an occasional Cuban when I shoot my machine gun,
[49:36.720 --> 49:44.480]  but I don't think I inhale. My point is, is that I really am alive. I'm 70 years engaged in my
[49:44.480 --> 49:50.080]  absolute moral, intellectual and I believe spiritual obligation to perform my duties
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.120]  in participation in this sacred self-experiment and self-government. I'm a we the people,
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.760]  even guitar players are we the people. So when I surround myself with the best of the best,
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.880]  you just get music that has a life of its own. The new record is called The Music Made Me Do It
[50:04.880 --> 50:11.040]  because the music makes me do it and I've got Jason Heartless, this 23 year old animal on drums
[50:11.040 --> 50:17.520]  from Detroit carrying on that incredible Motown firestorm of music and Greg Smith, the world's
[50:17.520 --> 50:23.200]  greatest bass player. We go out all July and August every summer and we play six nights a week,
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.640]  sometimes more and the energy from the audience, you know, I know the music alone, even if I was
[50:28.640 --> 50:34.000]  a drooling idiot, the music, if it was this good, everybody would love it. And by the way,
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.200]  you know, you're not whining, you're not a victim, you're a target because you're a leader,
[50:37.200 --> 50:40.880]  you've told me and I've read about it, you could sell out arenas, you could make 20-30 million
[50:40.880 --> 50:45.280]  dollars a year, you've been banned by all the big operations and things because you're a Trump
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.960]  supporter and because you support the Second Amendment. People need to know that those of
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.520]  us that really sign on to this new Declaration of Independence to restore the Republic, we are
[50:53.520 --> 50:57.280]  punished and that's why it's important for listeners to understand when you get a Ted Nugent
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.240]  album and you share it and you circumvent the enemy that's trying to kill this culture.
[51:02.880 --> 51:08.080]  When you buy products at infowarstore.com, you circumnavigate their attempt to shut us down,
[51:08.080 --> 51:14.160]  sorry. You know, yeah, you're absolutely right. You know, I like guns, but I would never force
[51:14.160 --> 51:19.120]  anyone to own one. I like venison, but I would never insist and make a law that you have to
[51:19.120 --> 51:24.160]  eat deer meat, but the left is just the opposite. They hate guns and they think they should forbid
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.520]  everybody from the Second Amendment. They think that animals are cartoon characters, I guess,
[51:29.520 --> 51:32.400]  that's how stupid you can get, that's what comfortably numbs them. And they don't understand
[51:32.400 --> 51:35.600]  that if you've removed the predators and there's too many deer and they start starving,
[51:35.600 --> 51:38.800]  they don't get management, they don't get harvesting, they don't get anything.
[51:38.800 --> 51:42.880]  You know, I part of this Hunters for the Hungry program, Alex, and this is important,
[51:42.880 --> 51:48.880]  especially on the Alex Jones Truth Network. We, for the last 30 plus years, the hunting
[51:48.880 --> 51:59.200]  families of America, we kill, process, and cook 300 million hot, nutritious, organic meals of
[51:59.200 --> 52:05.040]  venison for homeless shelters and soup kitchens every year. Now, you listen to Payton, the Humane
[52:05.040 --> 52:11.680]  Society of the United States, and these liberal freaks, they would shut down the system by which
[52:11.680 --> 52:18.320]  more homeless and needy Americans get the most nutritious, organic meat in the world. And every
[52:18.320 --> 52:24.080]  soup kitchen and homeless shelter will tell you what they need is fresh, good meat. And of course,
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.560]  we all know if you want to get sick, you'll eat something that says USDA on it. And if you want
[52:28.560 --> 52:32.080]  to have the healthiest food in the world, it would be something that Ted Nugent killed,
[52:32.080 --> 52:38.480]  gutted, butchered, hung up, and cooked for you. So the hunting lifestyle is the purest, most
[52:38.480 --> 52:42.800]  environmentally friendly. And they want to kill humans being out, all the studies show. Hunting,
[52:42.800 --> 52:47.440]  being out in nature makes you more happy, it activates who you are. Gardening is the same
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.440]  thing, being outdoors, they want to put us in. And that's a big trait of leftist, as you notice
[52:51.440 --> 52:54.960]  they're all kind of these indoor, glow-in-the-dark people, getting back to some of their hardcore
[52:54.960 --> 52:59.680]  issues. But you're right, lifestyle is key to not let them get us down. And a great way to do it
[52:59.680 --> 53:04.480]  is your new album that I just absolutely have on speed dial on my phone when I'm exercising.
[53:04.480 --> 53:09.520]  Let's get into Antifa, though, because I mentioned this. CNN's Chris Cuomo says Antifa
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.880]  is a good cause. I wanted to play this. This is a communist terror group that goes out to tax
[53:14.880 --> 53:19.360]  any type of conservative or nationalist, which then Cuomo calls all conservatives
[53:19.360 --> 53:25.120]  white supremacists. Here it is. He said two things, okay? And I do want people to remember,
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.280]  he wasn't on this correction campaign back then. He had plenty of opportunities to do it.
[53:29.280 --> 53:36.080]  He didn't. He said two things. One, there's blame on both sides for the violence. Now, Steve,
[53:36.080 --> 53:40.320]  you can talk all left, all day long, and that's fine with me. I have no problem with it. People
[53:40.320 --> 53:45.200]  who are rogue actors and criminals deserve the harsh treatment of the law. But whether you want
[53:45.200 --> 53:50.400]  to talk about Antifa or Black Lives Matter or any of the groups that assemble that day to fight
[53:50.400 --> 53:56.720]  against neo-Nazis, you make a moral equivalent between those two actions. You're making a mistake
[53:56.720 --> 54:02.240]  in America. So there you go. They're just back to this made up Charlottesville thing. When Trump
[54:02.240 --> 54:07.040]  was clear that day, he's always been clear. It's another hoax like saying Trump hates all Mexicans.
[54:07.040 --> 54:15.600]  Well, that's more perfect examples of the mindless, soulless, runaway dishonesty that the left is
[54:15.600 --> 54:22.160]  strangled by. I mean, here's a guy who signed into law that you can kill a baby after it's
[54:22.160 --> 54:27.200]  born. It's not even in the wife's in the woman's body anymore. So the woman can't claim that she
[54:27.200 --> 54:32.720]  has righteousness over her own autonomy. The baby's on the table and he signed a law that you can
[54:32.720 --> 54:39.280]  still kill it. And he got a standing ovation, Alex. So this guy is the source of morality for
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.320]  who? Remember, it all comes from Saul Alinsky, Hillary Clinton's hero and Van Jones hero and
[54:44.320 --> 54:49.840]  Barack Obama's hero whose book, The Rules for Radicals was dedicated to Satan. See, a lot of
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.240]  the, a lot of our- Oh, these people are just over the top evil. I have, I have a feeling everybody
[54:54.240 --> 54:58.880]  listened to Uncle Ted and Uncle Alex right now already know this. But if we, if we dig into
[54:58.880 --> 55:05.920]  Cloward Tiven, if we dig into Saul Alinsky and all those that genuflect at the altar of these
[55:05.920 --> 55:12.800]  evil demonic organizations, Antifa, they really are evil, gang of punks. They are. And they'll,
[55:12.800 --> 55:17.520]  they, they'll target a woman or a person in a wheelchair. They're the archetypal cowardly villain.
[55:18.320 --> 55:25.040]  Well, let's, let's identify their, their, their parallel goofball dirtbag organizations. So you,
[55:25.040 --> 55:30.400]  you belong to an organization called Occupy Wall Street. They're gonna protest Wall Street.
[55:30.400 --> 55:35.360]  Well, here's a little tip for you if you can put down the bong for a minute. If you're protesting
[55:35.360 --> 55:41.520]  Wall Street, you got there using Wall Street businesses. You got your clothes from a Wall
[55:41.520 --> 55:47.920]  Street business. You get your food from the Wall Street business. You, it's like my buddy Tom Morello
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.480]  who I love in a door, one of the greatest guitar players in the world, just a good man. But he
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.400]  wears a t-shirt with a picture of Che Guevara on it. And he's in a band called Rage Against the
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.360]  Machine. And I say to him, so are you raging against the machine that you bought your amplifiers
[56:03.360 --> 56:08.080]  from? It's crazy. Raging against the machine that built the stadium you perform. What machine are
[56:08.080 --> 56:15.200]  you? And in closing, and in closing. How they're living a lie, it is all a dope pipe stream lie.
[56:15.200 --> 56:19.200]  Well, it is. I think a lot of them actually know it's a lie. They just want to domesticate the
[56:19.200 --> 56:23.600]  general public using socialism and communism. Look at Venezuela, totally collapsing armored
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.960]  vehicles running over people. And even MSNBC, let's play this clip, admits that armed citizens
[56:28.960 --> 56:32.880]  could have prevented the tyranny. Here it is. I know Kerry, you've spent a lot of time down there.
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.000]  I think it has been surprising to a lot of people in Washington and the administration at least.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.160]  This is taking longer than they thought, despite the sanctions, despite the pressure,
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.800]  with the help of Russia and other outside forces, Maduro is hanging on. Not only hanging on, but he
[56:48.800 --> 56:54.800]  appears to still control the military. You have to understand in Venezuela gun ownership is not
[56:54.800 --> 56:59.600]  something that is open to everybody. So if the military have the guns, they have the power. And
[56:59.600 --> 57:06.640]  as long as Nicolas Maduro controls the military, he controls the country. And wow. So Ted Nugent
[57:06.640 --> 57:12.720]  stopped the presses. The MSNBC just told the truth. Wow. I'm going to have a heart attack.
[57:13.840 --> 57:17.600]  This is a stop the presses moment. You're right. But here I'm going to repeat, you know, one and
[57:17.600 --> 57:22.480]  one equals two. You need to earn your own way. You need to live within your means and save for
[57:22.480 --> 57:28.560]  a rainy day. You know, all that radical Ted Nugent stuff. Well, here's the ultimate battle cry
[57:29.360 --> 57:38.960]  for the American dream and living as a free man or a free woman. Unarmed and helpless is unarmed
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.960]  and helpless. All victims of tyranny and emperors and death. Hold on. We got to go to break. Do five
[57:44.960 --> 58:01.760]  more with us. We're going to do five more with Ted Nugent by leaps and by bounds. The number one
[58:01.760 --> 58:08.000]  best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.800]  quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed

[58:31.200 --> 58:35.920]  changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:27.680]  This is the intro to the title track of the album. The music made me do it. The music made me do
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:35.520]  it. Okay, dudes, it's our guest for the five minutes. I can talk to this guy all day long.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.560]  Like you said, the energy, it's not just a physical energy, it's a spiritual energy,
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.200]  the spirit of the wild. It's what God gave us. All these devil worshipers and occultists go do
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.200]  horrible things looking for power, thinking that they do bad things, that they'll suddenly get this
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.120]  power. The power is being good and being strong and not being a coward and doing the right thing.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.440]  And then it just gets more intense as I get older. I can't imagine what it's like when I'm 70.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.240]  You know, Ted, is it fair to say you've gotten spiritually or at an animal level as well,
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:08.000]  more powerful, stronger as you get older? Or were you more powerful with your gravitas early on?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.640]  Because you do have a presence. No, I'm more dangerous now than ever because you learn if
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.320]  you're paying attention every day. You accumulate more knowledge and more understanding of the
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.520]  way the world works and how to read truth, logic and common sense and those that abandon it. So
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.160]  when you surround yourself with positive people and I, Alice, you go to my Facebook and there's
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.920]  three and a half million hard-working, smart, clever, funny, cocky Americans that are typical
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.240]  Ted Nugent campfire buddies. But if you've met Germain, my queen of the forest, an amazing wife,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.600]  if you met my sons and daughters, my grandkids, my brothers, my sisters, my band, my crew, my team,
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.560]  my management, our spirit of the wild team, if you meet anybody in my world, they're just the
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.160]  greatest, most positive people in the asset column you will ever meet. And those are the people
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:02.000]  that have to eliminate what you and I talked about many years ago, the number one suicidal
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.880]  curse in America, when good people fail to step forward, evil persists. And the apathy in the
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.960]  conservative community, the apathy in the hunting and the gun owner community is embarrassing. If
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.760]  we voted as a block for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Golden
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.080]  Rule, the Declaration of Independence, Alex, we could get anything we want. Like you said.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.960]  Hillary Clinton would be in chains in a cage somewhere where she belongs. And that was the
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:37.040]  reason I... The apathy that could look what Beto Punkass will work did in Texas, Alex.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.320]  He almost turned it blue. That doesn't make you want to hang your head in shame. I don't know what
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.040]  does. Oh, it's got me climbing the walls in clothes, and that's why I held you over. You're
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.800]  right, we're winning, but a lot of people are in a coma. But specifically, I think we're going to win,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.400]  but I don't think we'd even be where we are today if it wasn't for you 50 years ago. I'm trying to
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.120]  give you credit. I'm saying it wasn't for the Charleston Hastings and the Ted Nugent's early
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.720]  on warning about all this. You, even before Chuck Heston, we would have lost. In so many of these
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.960]  battles, we've barely won against these scum. That's why I'm telling the average man or woman out
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.920]  there, don't just count on Ted and how to do it. You've got to get out there. Smaller, big, doesn't
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.960]  matter. You've got to engage in the information war. Absolutely. What's about communication,
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.960]  and you know, a lot of people in the conservative community, in fact, that was a curse of
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.840]  conservatism, is that, well, we did... We didn't want to ruffle feathers. I didn't want to bring
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.000]  up discomforting information. I didn't want to argue, so I walked away. Well, you wimp. How
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.440]  dare you not argue? You will not find a stupid liberal Democrat in my midst. I've either already
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.560]  fixed them or sent them packing. So here's the bottom line, Alex. Number one, thank you for
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.680]  raising hell. Truth, logic, and common sense like you do, and everybody that listens and supports
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.960]  you. Thanks to all those hard work and American families on my Facebook, and that I meet every
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.640]  day I leave the house here, everywhere across America. And thank you for the support from my
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.200]  incredible music and our Spirit of the Wild TV show, Top Rated for 32 years, Alex. This is hysterical,
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.160]  but you've got to be a member of the National Rifle Association. That drives the left
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.240]  patty more than anything. You've got to demand constitutional... By the way, as you know,
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.160]  some of the support's flagged now that Trump's in. A lot of people think that we've won. No,
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.960]  we're in the middle of the real battle right now. Now's the time for increased activity. Let me
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:35.120]  make a moment here too. For the greatest president in our lifetime, your damn right is not presidential
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.640]  because all these big punks in the past were presidential and they kept kicking us down the
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.680]  path to ruination. Donald Trump is a great American. And Alex, you think I have energy
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.000]  hanging around the president? I just like to get in his paper trail. It's amazing. It's amazing.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.600]  You've got to tell us what the president now. That's it. 60 seconds are coming back to finish.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.560]  I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win. We have those incredible

[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.600]  Ted Nugent. And I've held him over. I appreciate that. Recap for some stages that might not have
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:59.680]  been carrying last segment on Trump's energy. You're 70. He's 72. About to be 73. You were
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.120]  talking about being in his vapor trail, working with the president, the amount of energy. They're
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.480]  claiming the president's low energy. They're claiming he didn't want to be president. All pure
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.000]  crap. It's Biden that swore through his speeches and is well known for being sleepy Joe. So spend
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.920]  a few minutes on Trump and his energy and who he really is because they're always trying to claim
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.040]  he's somebody else. He isn't. Well, Alex, when I was with the president and a bunch of friends at
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.880]  the White House, we had dinner and I'm going to tell you, remember the day at the ranch here at
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.560]  Spirit Wild Ranch where you and the guys came, we just kind of hung around, had some burners,
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.120]  ginger ale and just talked about the things we believe in. I'm telling you the comfort,
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:44.160]  the natural campfire spirit and open uninhibitedness that I shared with President Donald Trump
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.880]  proved to me that this man's energy comes from his love of America, his love of freedom,
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:57.440]  his dedication to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, just cause due process,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.840]  saluting the hardest working people in the asset column, trying to help those who are not in the
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.920]  asset column to get into the asset column where you have the American dream. I'm going to tell you
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:17.120]  the future of freedom is going to pivot on the 2020 election. Everybody listening now,
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:23.760]  you know 100 people you can talk to between now and the election of 2020. Donald Trump,
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:32.000]  November 2020, or we are done. If we can't elect this great man for a second term,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.520]  then we're going to just stab America in the heart and turn into Venezuelan. Here's a little tip
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:44.080]  for Solwell and Pelosi and Ship and all these punks on the other side. Peace and love through
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:52.080]  superior firepower. Check out Venezuela and don't you dare push Americans into that scenario
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.560]  because it won't be tanks running over people. It'll be something quite different.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.720]  And you look at AOC, low energy, incredibly stupid. You look at Swallowswell the same way.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:10.000]  You look at all these people. Hillary acts and looks like a witch. Michael Moore, all these
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.160]  people. And then you look at Trump, who I know is working 16, 17 hours a day. The times I've talked
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.440]  to him, he can finish sentences before I even say them. Totally on and focused and loving every
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.000]  minute of it. And it's just the two choices are so clear. As you said, nothing's ever free.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.760]  Communism always and socialism always destroys people and cultures. And then in America,
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.320]  we've got these rich globalists trying to destroy the American dream and ally with the chai comms.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.680]  But as you said, big tech, the media, they're all trying to bully our free speech. They're
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.240]  trying to shut us down. And the average conservative or Christian or nationalist or outdoors person,
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.440]  I get it. You don't want to be out front as a leader. You're not arrogant. You're leading
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.600]  by working hard, being a good father, good mother, going to church, paying your taxes,
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.240]  helping out at the local. The point is, no, it's a war now. They want you quiet because you're
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.920]  strong and because you're an American. I don't care if you're old, young, black, white, male,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.480]  female, you need to get out there. You need to not just vote. You need to talk to people.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.520]  You need to go start your own YouTube channel. You need to call in to talk radio. You need to do
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.480]  whatever it takes. Go to a Ted Nugent concert. Any of that creates culture. And you read it.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.240]  Absolutely. Here's the bottom line. The Democrats and the left and the media and academia, they
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:31.200]  have their dream. They have fulfilled their dream and it's called gun free zones. And it is in their
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:38.000]  liberal Democrat gun free zones where in every instance, the most innocent lives are slaughtered.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.040]  Kill zones. They know it and they want more of them, Alex. That's right. They're advertising.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.240]  Insanity. Absolutely. Ted Nugent, thank you so much. The music made me do it. The new album out,
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.000]  doing really great. I really, I think it's one of your best albums. And so we salute you and
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.960]  hopefully you and Shemesa, you'll come down to studio sometime into the
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.720]  globalist Republic of Austin. We're trying to retake or I'll come back up with a ranch. But
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.120]  let's, let's get together soon, my friend. Let's try it. God bless you, Alex. God bless
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.240]  America. God bless President Trump. All right. Thank you, Ted Nugent. Always fires me up to
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.520]  have that guy on. He's got a lot of energy folks. And that's why he's so demonized. It's why he's
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.000]  lied about none of the stuff you hear is true. I've gone and looked it all up. It's just lies,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.520]  just like me. It's none of it's true. None of it. And they attack Trump because he's for real. They
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.680]  attack me because I'm for real. They attacked Ted Nugent because he's for real. We attacked
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.120]  Sean Hannity because he's for real Tucker Carlson. And again, it doesn't mean we're perfect, but we
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.680]  mean well. We really care about what we're doing. Doesn't mean we haven't made mistakes. Doesn't mean
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:44.720]  that I do do a perfect job. But you know what? We do about a 98% job. My biggest problem is I care
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.120]  so much that I get pissed. Folks, I try not to watch Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett's videos
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:12:00.480]  that get on average millions of views because I get up here on air and I laugh at these people
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.240]  and I'm doing that. And it's not fake. I'm putting myself in that area of my brain to make it funny.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.600]  But this morning, I watched a couple of these and I got tears in my eyes because look what
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.400]  they've done to these people. I mean, they act demon-possessed. They squawk and honk and try
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.600]  to take over everybody's speech. They believe they rule everyone. They're just vicious authoritarians.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.440]  They're in their own world and they're so dangerous. They're so dangerous. When we come
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.360]  back, I'm going to play part of this. And if you're listening on the radio, you'll hear it. But if
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:49.280]  you're watching it and the way they contradict themselves and the things they say and the
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:57.760]  things they do. And I told you, they're so dumb now. They believe I killed the kids at Sandy Hook
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:05.680]  now. I mean, they have just mutated their lies where they think that I'm a Russian agent.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.040]  And let me explain something. These people are school teachers. They're bank tellers. They're
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.840]  professors. They're counselors. Almost all of them are obsessed with power over people.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.400]  A lot of folks get involved. They want to help people. No, no, no. These people are involved in
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:28.640]  those professions because they want power. They want power over people. They want to tell you
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.960]  what to think, tell you what to say, and run your life. And they're super ultra dangerous.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.960]  And they're doing everything they can to shut us down. And we're just one domino in this.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.160]  They get us, they get you. You know, I always say buy our products, support us
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.800]  because they're trying to shut us down. I'm going to explain this to everybody from the bottom of
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:56.400]  my heart. Iodine. Pure clean iodine. You think I'm happy that we're the only ones that ever
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.160]  came up with true atomic iodine? Everybody else calls it atomic iodine. They don't have atomic
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.040]  iodine. We have it. Deep Earth crystal. X2 is back. And X3 is all three times plus the Deep Earth
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.680]  crystal because some scientists say you need all three to absorb even more. But the point is apples
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.080]  and oranges. Do you understand what a game changer it is and the energy and the stamina I get?
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.160]  And I don't want to get technical here, but let's just say this. My libido is like I was when I was
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.880]  14. That's not normal for 45-year-old men, except it used to be. People used to mainly live on the
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.120]  coast. They got iodine. This is clean iodine without the mercury you get in fish and stuff.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.520]  So I'm just telling you, man, libido, stamina, energy, it takes two to three weeks to kick in.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.400]  You need to be careful with this, but all your skin is made up of this. Your organs,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:52.560]  the hormones you excrete must have halogens. Now, the one they want to run on is iodine.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.120]  It's out of the food. It's out of everything now. It's not the soil. It's depleted.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:03.520]  And it funds us, so it's a total win-win. Yes, this is something every family needs.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.000]  This is something everybody should be taking. Some more, some less. It's up to you and your
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.040]  physician, but it's the game changer. It's the thing that people are deficient in. It's why
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:21.600]  the IQs are dropping. Look at the studies. IQ and iodine, deficiency. When I get busy,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.440]  I've never been a supplement guy. When I started hitting about 38 or so, I was like,
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.120]  swimming two miles a day, sometimes not losing weight. And I got an iodine and lost like 80
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.400]  pounds. It's incredible. And I'm just telling you, you can get a free bottle of X3 to see how
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:43.360]  great it is with your bottle of X2 right now, 25% off. You get 25% off at infowarstore.com.

[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.920]  a major city. Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that

[01:19:53.680 --> 01:20:03.840]  Have clean air. Go to InfoWareStore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:20.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:27.280]  and the heart of the resistance, rallying Patriots worldwide.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:45.920]  Now, this video is posted up on InfoWareStore.com and it's par for the course. It's Millie Weaver
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:54.880]  in Ohio at a Joe Biden event in a tiny little building. About 200 people there, but they're
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.640]  all standing in line to get in. And the full video is on InfoWareStore.com. I'm gonna play part of it
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.080]  here. But it's the foaming at the mount, the screaming, the yelling, the threatening to
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.600]  physically attack Millie saying, get out of here. You can't be on a sidewalk. It's just incredible.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.480]  And the same stuff then happens to Caitlyn Bennett at Rutgers University on the same day.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:23.040]  And again, it just goes to the incredible lies they put out, the things they say,
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.800]  these people are gone. And they say that I'm killing people. But then the Democrats
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.560]  support killing babies after they're born. And then we've got the gentleman that was out in
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.560]  Huntington Beach, California, and attacked by Antifa. And he fought back and kicked their
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.240]  ass. He'll be joining us next segment. And then I've got a public service announcement
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:49.440]  that is 100%. One of the most important things you can do if you have a teenage daughter.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.240]  So that's coming up. But first, let's go to part of this shocking report.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.360]  Get these people to hell out of here right now.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:10.080]  Alex Jones kills people. Who's he killed? People. Who? All of them. Names, please.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.600]  The ones that he killed. We would really like to know the names. The Jewish people. Oh my gosh.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.840]  Come on. Give me the names. Come on. Other people as well. I think you need a tinfoil hat
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.760]  yourself there, sir. Where's your tinfoil hat? I didn't say anything about tinfoil hats.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:33.760]  I said he's a ***hole. Not crazy. What do you think about Biden supporting segregation in the
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.520]  70s? I don't know anything about that. Thank you. Is that okay for you? Would you support a candidate
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.200]  that supported segregation and advocated for it in the 70s? Everyone evolves. Alex Jones can too.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.680]  Everyone evolves. So what about Brett Kavanaugh? Does that hold true for him?
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.920]  No. He drinks beer. He loves beer. He drinks beer with PJ and squee beer.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:01.440]  So drinking beer is not okay but advocating for segregation. Alcoholism is not okay in
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.560]  a Supreme Court judge. No. But advocating for segregation is okay for a president?
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:12.640]  I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth. I simply said Alex Jones is an ***hole.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:18.000]  Alex Jones is a child in the last year. Info wars. Let me ask you this. Do you believe in the
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.400]  Russian collusion conspiracy? Info wars is fake news. Info wars is fake news. Info wars is fake
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:35.520]  news. Info wars is fake news. Info wars is fake news. Listen to Alex Jones all night long and
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.200]  then he set up those cops to be killed. If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:51.040]  murderer. Where's the evidence of that? It's in the courtroom. He was listening to Alex Jones
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.480]  all night long and set those poor cops up. You don't believe? Get the hell out of here. Get these
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.440]  people to hell out of here right now. Three cops died at the...
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:10.320]  I was going to pop in there. Sorry I wasn't talking back.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.520]  Famously, three cops got killed by a white supremacist that hated me and then seeing
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:21.040]  it in others just lied and said that he was a listener and did it for me. I threatened to
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.720]  show them they all had to retract or not. The guy was all over Stormfront seeing how much he hates
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.080]  me. But again, that's from like eight, nine years ago. She's still putting this out. So
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.280]  then we cut to a clip where I actually show the retractions by the news. But this is where
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:42.080]  these people are going, folks. Let's continue. Right now, three cops died at the at the mouth of
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.960]  Alex Jones. Where's your evidence? The evidence is in the court. This kid crazy was listening to
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:25:00.720]  crazy and they shot three. There's three dead police officers because of Alex Jones. You're so dumb. You're dumb.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:07.440]  Wow, that's tolerance here. The tolerance left. There's dead people because of Alex Jones. There's no
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.360]  evidence of that, ma'am. Dead people because of Alex Jones. There's no evidence of that.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.080]  We knew them all, okay? That's no evidence. Keep it up. Keep it up. I'll go to jail for this. Keep it
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:25.760]  up. Are you threatening me? I'll go to jail for this. Keep it up. Are you threatening me? You want
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.440]  me to? Are you threatening violence against me? The Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the ADL,
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:39.200]  and others come out and basically say that the shooter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Richard
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.920]  Pouloskis, that he'd been influenced by InfoWars.com without a shred of proof.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.440]  They knew his handle because the police had shut down his MySpace, but they had his handle.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.880]  They'd done a Google search and found him on a whole bunch of websites, but they chose to go
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.520]  after Stormfront and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. Now, he was worshipful on Stormfront, the
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:10.400]  number one white supremacist website, but he was criticizing me and attacking me on all the posts.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.280]  We went and found it once the newspapers finally in subsequent conversations said we're, oh,
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.240]  here he is saying I'm bad. Here he is saying he disagrees with me. And so we got this material
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.760]  posted it yesterday and Raw Story has retracted. Daily Cost has retracted. Two separate articles
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:35.840]  have retracted in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette saying, yes, he was critical of Alex Jones
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.320]  and his views were against Alex Jones. Who's paying you to stand here and spread conspiracy
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:50.320]  to nonsense? That's right. Alex Jones. Did Trump collude with the Russians? Yes. So you guys are
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:58.320]  the ones that need the tinfoil ads because that was actually disproven. No, it wasn't. We have not
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:06.560]  seen the unredacted. You know, show me the unredacted report. They said there was no evidence
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.720]  of any collusion with any American citizens. They said there was not enough evidence to convict him.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:24.480]  William Barr said it. Oh, bull. William Barr. William Barr is the man Donald Trump handpicked
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.800]  because he said you couldn't have. So like you'd be that stupid.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.040]  Special counsel found no evidence that any American, including anyone associated with the
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:46.240]  Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in this illegal
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:52.160]  scheme. What did you say, sir? I loved it when Alex Jones went to the chicken joint. He went to
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:58.320]  like a chicken joint. It wasn't KFC, but it was a chicken joint, and they heckled him out of the
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.440]  place, which I think is great. So you think it's good for people to be heckled out of diners?
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.320]  Yeah. I mean, if I were a sand, it's a matter of fact. Well, you know what? That's kind of
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:13.280]  interesting. You advocate for that because that's what they were doing to black people in the 60s,
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:20.960]  heckling them out of diners. Wow. Interesting here. Black people weren't doing these weirdo,
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.840]  conspiratories. Whatever your justification, any person. Can I talk? Can I talk? So now we're
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.240]  hearing justification. That's enough. We're going to break. It just gets more insane. The video is
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.880]  up on infowords.com. We have a very special guest about the joiners who got physically attacked by
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.840]  the loving antifa. No one's allowed to have free speech, but the left. Remember that. And if you
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.600]  don't like it, they'll hit you in the head with a bike lock because they're professors and they
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.480]  like methamphetamine. And well, they're in charge of America. Hillary was supposed to get in. She's
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.040]  their muscle. Everything's not going the way it was planned. What's happening? What are they going
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:29:02.000]  to do? Stay with us. Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate

[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.080]  hunt, garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:05.120]  Stacy in a great state of Texas in FEMA region six, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.440]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.680]  normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the ultimate female force. I looked at all the
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:18.320]  ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust, you know, because I've
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.160]  seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that they say that they have in them and
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.440]  they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that. Well, what happened with ultimate
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.040]  female force? Tell us about it. Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.040]  it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.120]  aftertaste and you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.360]  it. Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo charge
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:47.200]  women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.200]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force. So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.360]  m4warstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:03.600]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.840]  with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:16.000]  of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.160]  out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil. If you're
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.600]  going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong. They don't give
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.000]  you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.560]  you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.160]  In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.920]  capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.240]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:53.200]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:32:00.800]  is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it. Brain force plus is a top tier
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:08.720]  neutropin. Focus, clarity, energy, but instead of having a seven times markup, we have a hundred and

[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:50.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me do this. We're going to go to our guest right
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:57.200]  now. And then Tucker Carlson a few days ago laid out an extremely powerful defense of free speech
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:04.560]  and really knocked it out of the park. You know, I tend to watch the show quite often.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:13.520]  And he pretty much defends us every other night. And I know he gets heat for it. So
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.880]  we just really appreciate Tucker Carlson. He really gets what's going on.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:24.320]  So I'm going to air that piece at the star of the next hour that Mike Adams is going to be in
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:29.520]  studio with us. He's got some really big findings and announcements. Strangely enough, NASA came out
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.160]  and admitted that carbon dioxide makes the earth greener and helps scrub the atmosphere of toxins
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:40.800]  and that we had lower carbon dioxide last 100,000 years or so and that actually humans raising it
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.480]  just a tiny percentage point of a point actually had helped the earth. Wow, that's what all the
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.680]  real science shows. So a lot of amazing things are happening. Mike Adams is going to be in studio
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.720]  with us and he's going to host the fourth hour in the war with Owen Shroyer is coming up.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:06.240]  But I have something here in my hand that I've read a lot about in psychology books.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.160]  And then I came across years ago. And then when I did more research on it,
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:16.880]  a few days ago, meaning to cover it, I'm going to cover it coming up next hour,
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:24.160]  I was just blown away by the amount of known information. And when you understand this,
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:30.560]  then it makes you really angry. I've got three daughters. And it's just genetic that I care about
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.240]  my son, but I'm a little rougher on him. And I just when he goes walking out the door, I just
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:42.640]  don't have anxiety. I guess he is almost six, two now and everything else. So I guess he's bigger
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:50.320]  than I am. He's 16. But our boys are targeted, but our girls are being targeted. And they know
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.800]  exactly how to target them. They've known since the time of William Shakespeare,
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:09.440]  that if you tell teenage girls, particularly about 11 to 14 stories of suicide of other girls
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:16.080]  and the passion and the pain of the other girls, that as sympathy, you get a percentage that go
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:22.320]  and commit suicide in the way it's shown in the play. And there were some debates back at the
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:28.720]  time about who could watch Romeo and Juliet in England or France also put on his plays. And for
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.160]  hundreds of years, there were sympathetic suicides. Now, I read that in psychology and literature
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.560]  back when I had time to read a lot of books. I came across it showing I learned about death
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.400]  education being put in by Bill Clinton and how it tripled the amount of girls committing suicide.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:50.240]  And then they had more anti-suicide. So then it causes more suicide. It introduces the idea.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.720]  And so I said, I'd cover this next hour. I'm kind of already doing it. But study. Kids suicide spike
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:07.120]  after Netflix 13 reasons. And it's a fact. Judas Priest is not to blame and they can't be found
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.760]  libel and they weren't found libel in court for beyond the realms of death. That is about a young
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  man committing suicide. And it's like a love song about death. And it's very dark. And I would say
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:25.440]  it's a very evil song. But they have a right to put that out. I don't think it was Rob. Halford
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.320]  probably wasn't doing that consciously. He's probably talking about things he experienced as
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.160]  a young man. I think he even talked about that, wanting to commit suicide. But he was an adult
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.400]  when he wrote that a 13 year old stuck a shot down his mouth and blew his head off. Now,
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.520]  all I'm telling you is I don't think Mr. Halford knew what he was doing. But the shrinks all over
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:49.360]  the world from Japan to the US teaching this know that you go into a middle school and teach
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.760]  little girls about other girls committing suicide. And you teach them how to tie a shoelace around
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.920]  the coat hanger in the bathroom stall. And then you wonder why they show the movies and do the
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:07.520]  education. And then some schools like 10 girls will kill themselves. Just like mass shootings.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:15.600]  You show mass shootings. You hype them up. And the media knows just like Clockwork,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.480]  the same type of people, devil worshipers in black prince coats that play shoot them up video
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.320]  games. That's just the archetype. I'm not saying you're a mass murderer, replace your video games.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:31.600]  I'm saying the criminology, the psychology we know 13 14 year old devil worshiper that can't get
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:41.200]  checks that gets into darkness. It's always the same people. They're programming boys to kill.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:48.240]  And they're programming girls to kill themselves. And Netflix knows exactly what they're doing.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.360]  And they use me to keep bringing up Sandy Hook constantly because I'm so viral and so famous.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.040]  I'm bragging it's true so that they can invoke mass shootings to get more mass shootings and
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.480]  kill kids. And that's their biggest crime. The parents don't know what they're part of.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.440]  But the larger apparatus of politicians above this are trying to use me to get kids killed.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.160]  Hell, even had a dad of one of the kids commit suicide. They blame me on the news and said,
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.240]  take me out the year. It's Senator Murphy and Monster Blumenthal and the monsters at that law firm
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.840]  that are hyping these to suicide constantly in my name. It's you that are the Sandy Hook vampires,
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.720]  not me. And it doesn't matter what you think or say or lie about God knows what you've done.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:38.400]  God knows. And the truth will come out. You won't stop the truth. I said I'd cover this later.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.080]  I'm covering it now. But I've got your stinking number. It's a way to make themselves the heroes and
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.640]  lie about what I've said about Sandy Hook and then keep it in the news because Murphy got
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.680]  elected on Sandy Hook. And the former prosecutor that heads up the law firm going after me there
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.160]  all once in his name, he thinks he gloms onto these kids and that makes him famous.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:07.840]  That's sick. That's evil. And that's all going to come out. So Netflix and all these shows,
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.280]  it's a known phenomenon. We're going to go to our guests in the next segment. I appreciate them
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.840]  coming on. It's a known phenomenon like putting two pieces of toast in a toaster and pushing the
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.880]  lever down. Then in about a minute and a half, it goes being and pops up and there's toast.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.960]  Or putting gas in your car. It's a known phenomenon that you drive it around.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.280]  Or you plant sunflower seeds in the backyard and spring comes, they grow up. That's a known
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:43.920]  phenomenon. You give people death education, boys start, Columbine was the national test site of
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.760]  death education, boys start killing people and girls start hanging themselves or taking pills.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.960]  And I'm going to leave it at that, but I know someone personally whose son took pills and died.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:08.080]  Didn't do it for suicide, but the point was that it's all part of this culture of death. The system
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.160]  knows what they're doing. And these big pharma companies know when they put these drugs out
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.320]  on the street and you have 10 times the amount of opioid prescriptions out, but there's going to be
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:23.680]  10 times the amount of overdoses. It's mathematics. I saw it on CNN this morning. They're like,
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.760]  yeah, this drug company paid people off to do this and that and then all this corruption.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.720]  Why do you trust the vaccine makers? It's the same dirty companies.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.240]  We're going to go to break and come back with the amazing individual who was physically attacked
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.880]  out in Huntington Beach, California by a bunch of foaming at the mouth leftist, the full 18-minute
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.200]  video is up on inforwars.com. We'll play the shorter ones. We had to cut out the cussing
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.560]  and he beat the hell out of these folks. We'll talk about what happened once the camera got knocked
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.520]  off because the police report said he knocked out three more of them, not just the four he popped
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.920]  when they hit him. And we're going to find out if that was a woman or a man or what it was, a zombie
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.600]  creature. Looks like they're the dead creature that attacked because so it's all coming up.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.240]  And we've got more on the bar testimony going on and highlights of that. Mike Adams coming in.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:13.840]  We'll get to all of it. This is a power pack global transmission. But remember,
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.440]  everywhere I go, I get mobbed. In fact, I think dude needs to put the videos out. We've got those
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.160]  in DC. I haven't told him yet. Everywhere it's like school kids and college kids and young people
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.760]  and black people and white people and real shows. We love you. We love you. Oh man. I used to listen

[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:06.000]  really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.560]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:18.800]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:25.840]  out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:32.000]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.240]  from our lexapure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:45.760]  pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the lexapure raises the pH of
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.840]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:59.280]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it i've been doing a lot of
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:06.640]  research into google and youtube censorship and i've noticed that there's one type of video
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:14.560]  though that is the most censored the most varied the most suppressed and that's the videos where you
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:21.280]  saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:27.920]  get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.760]  what political action did and that's why the globalist hilary and others are trying to shut

[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:07.360]  newsletter we are the renaissance and we are winning you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.360]  i
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.240]  i heard in the crowd were members of antifa or antifascists they covered their faces confronted
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:34.640]  police and berated journalists and that was wrong now you've been hearing it there's a lot
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.680]  of what about ism and spin going on and it's kind of sickening to me so let's all agree
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:47.520]  on some common understandings a protester uses their voice song slang slurs there's a huge range
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:55.120]  but it is talk when you use your hands in a violent way you are a rioter and unless you're
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.760]  justified in defending yourself and you hit someone you're a thug you're a criminal you attack cops
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:10.400]  you slap the media you're in the wrong period but i argue to you tonight all punches are not equal
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:18.320]  morally in the eyes of the law yes but in the eyes of good and evil here's the argument if you're a
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.040]  punk who comes to start trouble in a mask and hurt people you're not about any virtuous cause
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.960]  you're just somebody who's going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong but when
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:33.920]  someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot even physical are they equally wrong as the bigot
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:42.080]  they are fighting i argue no fighting against hate matters now how you fight matters too there's no
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:48.560]  question about that but drawing a moral equivalency between those espousing hate and those fighting it
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:57.360]  because they both resort to violence emboldens hate legitimizes hateful belief and elevates
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.320]  what should be stamped out chris you and i have talked about this before i do not make any
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:07.840]  differentiation between neo-nazis and antifa just because they claim in their name that they are
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.720]  anti-fascist their tactics are in fact totally fascist one of the group who was created to kill
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:21.760]  people they don't like the other group and so it was anti-fascist has hangers on and aberrant
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.520]  actors within their ranks it's not aberrant within antifa they put on masks and helmets and they
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:34.080]  show up with clubs to damage property or bad they aren't they are in the group they are america's
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:40.080]  brown shirts and there is no difference between antifa and those neo-nazis both sides are thugs
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:49.360]  both sides are reprehensible they have cbs tv shows about quote beating up nazis and they say
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:55.200]  any trump supporters are nazi they're dehumanizing people they're invoking race war it's dangerous
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:03.920]  it's out of control and brandon of that's the point with brandon was in los angeles huntington
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:09.680]  beach we're gonna play a clip of this this happened just a few days ago it's a big viral video
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.640]  and they started attacking him from the beginning and then we cut to right where the violence
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:21.680]  starts here it is are you guys going skiing you guys going skiing today i can ask people
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:27.680]  questions oh no you guys don't put your hand on me don't put your hand on me you put your hand
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.120]  on me again it's gonna be a problem no what's gonna be a problem is when you walk in there
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.160]  i was gonna be a problem there ain't no problem there ain't no problem why they shouldn't be a
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.760]  problem this is america i should be able to talk and walk wherever i want right it's not what you
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:42.560]  guys stand for for the freedom and no government and all that bull right we're building a wall

[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.560]  and then the mic gets cut off and then the camera gets cut off he'll tell us the rest of story of
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:23.440]  what unfolded now remember ms-13 the whole board is collapsing mexico's border has been smashed
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:29.760]  these people literally say no borders no wall no usa at all brandon of that's the point on youtube
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:34.480]  thank you so much for joining us and we commend you for standing your ground against these thugs
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:38.080]  obviously a lot of stuff doesn't get caught on camera give us your thoughts and tell us the rest
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:43.920]  of story uh first and foremost i just want to say thank you for um having me on here it's it's an
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:52.400]  honor to um you know be on on your show i'm a big fan and um you are a major part of why i do uh
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:57.600]  why i started to do what i do and um so basically what's an honor having you my friend because you're
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:04.960]  out there in the trenches so thanks thank you so yeah so um basically i was in there i was
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.920]  interviewing somebody and prior to if you if you check out the uh full video i had actually got
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.120]  an interview with one of them and um after a bunch of nonsense that was going on the interview
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:21.600]  ended i walked back over to get more um interviews with people and uh they started surrounding me
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:28.320]  and from that point you know i already knew what what the situation was so basically i was just
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.200]  trying to talk and um one of them pulled my backpack from the back to the side that's the
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:38.160]  initial one and try to like pull my arm where my mic was at so i went to like shove them off of me
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:42.880]  and after after that i was telling them don't touch me and at that point one of them somebody
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:49.040]  reached out punched me in my chin and at that point i just defended myself and um yeah i mean
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:54.720]  they didn't uh it didn't seem like they had enough heart when i started fighting back but uh you
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.240]  know i didn't go out there for that reason and um it's sad that it had to get there but i mean
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.040]  things have to be done and i will defend myself describe what happened once the camera got turned
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:08.880]  off because as the police report says you knocked a few more of them out they all like seven or eight
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.240]  it says came at you with clubs and then and then you fought them off i mean some of these were
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:16.800]  pretty big guys one of them was obviously a woman who thought this is like a larping video game i'll
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:20.240]  hit you in the head with a club and stab you in your stomach and then you're just going to take it
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.520]  but i guess unlike the hollywood movie she didn't kick the guy's ass yeah no it didn't happen that
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.240]  way um to be honest with you i didn't know it was a man or a female they had a mask but once
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:36.560]  you hit her maybe it was a male it was just a goblin creature yeah i mean definitely a demon
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:41.120]  possessed person um i i i 100 percent believe in jesus christ and i believe that these people are
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.600]  definitely uh possessed 100 percent oh they're definitely are the influence of the devil you're
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:51.120]  right and so what happened was when uh the camera after i had uh was defending myself and i
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:57.600]  swung the right hook right there and my mic had busted um the audio cut off and so basically what
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:02.560]  happened after that there was there was no other fighting because those first the last by the way
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:06.960]  i should add you're like literally fighting them while you're still holding the mic to get the
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.080]  audio that's pretty professional hey you gotta you gotta get the uh you gotta get that audio in
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:16.960]  man um yeah but definitely some of the reports out there are wrong you didn't knock out a couple
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:22.880]  more of no so after that no there was no uh there was no more physical contact what it was this lady
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.840]  in the green vest was trying to block me off from grabbing my microphone and my hat so they stole my
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:34.160]  hat they took a back part of my microphone and my glasses and i i wasn't able to recover that
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:39.440]  and and after that then a police on horses came in and you know broke us up but after i
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.720]  had accurate that some of them got arrested those is that accurate oh yes five of them got arrested
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:50.160]  that day well please continue and uh so five of them got arrested from the police they viewed
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:55.280]  the footage that i had uh completely they they looked through it and they were able to apprehend
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.560]  i know of two of them that were for sure the ones that hit me one of the shorter ones was the one
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.280]  with the red mask on his face and the other one was the one with the tracksuit uh with the white
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:10.800]  black black with white stripes and um so yeah the police came in they interviewed obviously at first
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.800]  they sat me down like i was i was the one initiating everything and then um after they came to came
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:24.080]  about the swat from uh huntington beach came up in uh your system they took my uh statement down
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.040]  and so it went like that so they were definitely pressing charges on them and well yeah because
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:32.400]  they were bumping into you and hitting you earlier and one cop comes over in the longer video that's
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.640]  on your youtube and he kind of said like you're the bad guy but i guess some smarter police came
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:42.400]  later and actually saw what happened and reviewed it uh regardless it's like do they get their like
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:48.000]  comic book wimps that there's like 10 people trying to beat you up for no reason and then when you
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.440]  start fighting back they like cower and fear i mean they are like pathetic but once he's once
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:57.280]  that do with the track track things swung at me and hit me in the head with the stick i went to
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:02.400]  run at him and he started running back right there he's he started running back and he got scared

[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.920]  berserk i mean it they're going on the page with their heads going in the ground so you had a lot
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:50.160]  of restraint yeah so the thing was is i really wanted to expose their hypocrisy and their double
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.120]  standard and how they represent freedom speech and they say you know anti-government and all this
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.320]  and and let the people rule but yet it's it's people they choose to select it's people they want to
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.320]  let you know whoever believes with them if they don't if you don't believe their ideology or
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:10.160]  their way of thinking you're you're an animal exactly they dehumanize you because you know
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.800]  your dress kind of like them you're talking in a kind of california accent you know a cool accent
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.200]  you're being nice in the whole video and they're just a bunch of jerks all because they don't know
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.400]  who you are they're just a bunch of thugs wanting a gang wanting to beat somebody up yeah they weren't
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:27.360]  out there they weren't out there trying to teach somebody they weren't out there trying to learn
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:32.000]  something they were just out there to cause a disruption and uh they just decided they learned
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.640]  every time they they they pick on a man that's a patriot that you guys kick their ass i mean
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:40.080]  haven't they learned i mean i'm telling they're gonna mess with the wrong person that doesn't

[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:49.520]  want that to happen but they're gonna get killed we've taken thousands of years of known research
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:55.040]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.320]  that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:06.880]  metal and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:11.520]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war it is a

[01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:07.920]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:12.720]  you keep saying you've got something for me
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:23.680]  me something you call love but confess you've been a messing where you shouldn't have been a
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:34.640]  messing and now someone else is getting all your best these boots on the head let's just admit it
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:40.720]  our forces are smart alive and tough they can be black they can be white they can be old they can
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:47.920]  be young we are alive we have christ our enemies literally dress and act like zombies
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:52.960]  and we know from secret documents we got over a year and a half ago
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.680]  the george soros is funding these violent groups that they're being paid gang members
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:06.400]  thugs methods led by college professors to go out and do all this and so when i say somebody's
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.040]  going to get killed i don't want that to happen their plan is to trigger a civil war in this country
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.160]  and have anti-fug go out to events when they hire these fake white supremacists and they're fake
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:21.040]  folks it's come out to then get a bunch of bystanders there and get people killed that's their plan
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.560]  going into 2020 they're going to do it as big as dallas and i want to thank the democratic party
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:35.120]  and the groups there at george town university for suing me so that i could understand the soft
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:39.920]  underbelly and what they're scared of me covering i'll be at all these things now i'll have reporters
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:45.760]  at all these now we'll have undercover people and pi's at all these now we're going to expose you
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.760]  and you'll never stop us getting the information just like james oakheap just won his lawsuit where
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.720]  they said he was fake news and said he was editing things he wasn't uh but but this is their plan
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:02:00.880]  and and so instead of me ranting here with brandon of that's the point with brandon on youtube everybody
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:05.360]  should subscribe other points you want to make about what happened what you've witnessed what got
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.120]  you politically involved what else you're seeing in california the nature of these people who they
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:19.120]  really are absolutely so um basically i i i really started this about a month ago and um i added uh
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:27.120]  listener and and watch her eventful wars um you guys really open my eyes to how fake the media is
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:33.600]  and how important it is to do your own research and really look at the facts and everything that you
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:40.240]  have said and and preached about or spoke about has been accurate from everything that i've went
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.200]  in research so you've given me the motivation to actually learn to do the research for myself and
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.320]  so that turned into watching so many of those people get attacked in california with maga hats on
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.480]  and i'm like they're only picking on weak people they only pick on the weak you know what i mean
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:59.920]  when i walk into places where i know that's super liberal out here in california and i have my
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:04.640]  maga hat on it's it's funny to watch the bullies squirm when they want to say something to you so
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:11.360]  bad but they won't because they're cowards you know what i mean so taking that and bringing it to
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.400]  you know the next level to where it's actually now i want to make a difference i want to make a
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:21.120]  change well you are my friend you are so what were you thinking if you'd been there a while
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.640]  when you when they when they first hit you in the jaw when they first hit me in the jaw what
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:33.280]  was i thinking um my first instinct was now you touched me now you just oh you just opened
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:38.320]  the lions cage and uh now this lion's got to eat and there was nothing but a pack of hyenas over
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:43.600]  there so you know it was a fun time i'm not gonna lie you know i don't advocate for violence but
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.840]  when i get to self defend myself you know by nature i'm a fighter i do h and b which is full
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.800]  contact armored fighting with uh real weapons they're not sharp they're blunted but they're
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:55.680]  real weapons you can look up battle of the nations that's what i'm actually doing in
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.600]  Serbia right now i'm at a world championship tournament that we're fighting in we represent
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:05.360]  USA and um so so that's what i picked up i picked up you had a governor going you were giving them
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.760]  like maybe 30 40 percent so you didn't black out or anything because i could tell the way you got
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.320]  out of the crowd the way you got away from them that you were trying to de-escalate things well
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:19.360]  yeah the so my field awareness is you have to be on point especially when you're in a situation
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.440]  like that you have to know you know your surroundings and you know you have to how to slide in and get
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:27.760]  out so i mean i have a little bit of skill so right there like if you see in that video where i
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:31.600]  move around to this little box is there what i'm doing is just creating the distance because i don't
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:37.440]  want you know i can't have them bum rush me so i create the distance and um you know just try to
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.920]  separate myself as much as possible and de-escalate the system you know situation as much as possible
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:46.640]  but while you know putting the pressure on them because i have to back them up so and they always
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  get surprised when they get caught by somebody who's not a zombie let's talk about where you're
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.120]  going from here brandon where you see this nation going stay with us

[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:23.520]  life from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:39.040]  it's the same video we've seen it hundreds of times oh it's different people in different
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:46.720]  places in the land but it's crowds of 10 15 20 100 sometimes antifa trying to beat up journalists
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:52.480]  attack women attack babies and strollers and then one man will kick five six seven eight nine 10 of
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:59.280]  their asses then they run to the police and i want you put in jail brandon of that's the point with
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:04.880]  brandon on youtube millions of views now all over the internet of them attacking him out in california
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:09.360]  a few days ago he just simply fought back very restrained but that's i knew you're an interesting
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:13.200]  guy get into this fighting style you're involved in and what you do we could probably pull it up or
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.040]  pull up a website you give us he's actually in syria for a for championship fight right now for
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:22.640]  folks that just joined us that's super interesting tell us about that so yeah what i do is called
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:28.320]  hmb it's historical medieval battle which is um a style that used to be done back in the
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.560]  days with actual knights that instead of you know they needed training and they weren't always at
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:38.080]  war so to keep themselves up they used to like do tournaments and um so what we do is we get we
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:45.600]  have 14 15th century full armor and um what we have real weapons and we do melee is we do five
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:52.240]  versus five uh 30 versus 30 uh 12 versus 12 and this is the first year that we're actually doing
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:58.080]  150 versus 150 and this isn't larping this isn't like oh it's tag you know i was about to say
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:03.040]  antifa is like larping this is real that's what's funny like the larper is running this
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:08.880]  might really does this yeah yeah and what's crazy is that i'm a two-handed axe user so god
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:12.560]  forbid i would have grabbed one of those poles i would have i would definitely would have been
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:20.080]  in jail for sure 100 um but so yeah what we do is it's like we fight and five versus five and
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:24.000]  right now we're at the world championships and our team made it to the uh championship
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.200]  and we're representing the team usa and uh we're actually our team is called order draconis
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:35.600]  and um you could look that up on youtube uh or you could um or you could look up battle of the
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:39.360]  nation's 2019 Serbia that's where we're going to be fighting and they'll have a live stream up as
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.680]  well well i like this as it gets people back into their roots and and you know out of the house and
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:48.400]  not just being you know little minions well this is this is crazy i don't know if antifa's ever
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:54.320]  ever want to fight that it is that they just always gang up on people and engage this type
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:00.080]  of activity but i don't know if you saw paul watson's article the fbi put on an alert um on sunday
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:05.600]  he got no coverage other than info wars dot com other than the fbi report you'd think a report
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.160]  that antifa is linking up with the ms-13 that literally torture people to death uh and that
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:15.040]  they're planning to kill law enforcement and planning to break the border and then here's the very
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.760]  groups out there you're facing in california it's just crazy they seem to want to ignite this this
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.200]  crisis but my intel is they're going to use antifa these idiots should know this as the fall guys
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.200]  for some other more serious criminal groups like ms-13 waiting in the shadows yep they don't even
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.920]  know it and what's sad is that they're just being blindly led and and they're loving it and they
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.240]  don't care what what the end game is they just want to know about the now looking cool because
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.520]  i got a ski mask on my face or i got a bandana on my face in a group when in all actuality you
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.240]  know you're not you're not a quarter percent of a what a real man what a real american patriot is
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.720]  and and it's sad and it's sad to see that and and where their headed is a very dangerous road
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:58.480]  because like you said they are going to be these are just these are just the fall guys these are
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:03.760]  just pawns they're not even pawns they're they're they're they're the precursor to a pawn you know
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.680]  what i mean there's a thought before the pawn on the chess board and and it's sad to see them
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.440]  going down that way but but they are playing a very dangerous game and if they dare go down to
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.880]  that border like that it's not going to be a good situation for these people man well they're trying
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:18.080]  to attack the military and police so the military and police kill some of these folks they're going
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.760]  to make them all victims and say the trump did it but this this isn't kin state americans aren't
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.800]  gonna americans gonna see right through this they have to and they have to wake up and that's and
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:33.680]  that's the reason i call it my show that's the point is because you know people need to wake up
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.320]  people need to listen to facts people need to do the research and really find out what's going on
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:43.360]  if you're gonna stand for something you need to you need to understand what you're standing for
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:46.640]  and that's why i love what you do because everything that you do you put it out there
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.800]  with passion and you make people go find you know what i mean and you give people the facts
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:54.320]  and that that's what's motivated me so much motivated me so much to go out there and try
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:00.320]  to open people up to go in and do the research and and learning and learning from people and
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:06.640]  also teaching at the same time you know so it's a it's a powerful movement and out here in california
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:14.320]  it's very you know i'm trying to i have this uh hashtag flip cali red movement and uh and it's
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.120]  it's a thing out here and we're trying to fight back for the state because it's it's it's going down
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:23.200]  fast yeah i had a call the other day said that i'm putting california down saying don't california
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:28.880]  my texas i know california was more redder than texas just 30 years ago i'm warning texas we're
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:34.160]  gonna go that way and and that and that california has been overrun by globalists and their minions
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.160]  and so when i say don't california my taxes you know disrespect to california i even say in the ad
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.720]  california was well it's probably the best state 30 years ago it's been ruined and and and and and
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:48.400]  and so texas better not be arrogant either this this state is is horrible right now it's completely
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.520]  horrible and the fact is that they're coming across the border and i interviewed a um a a mexican
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:57.680]  citizen downtown in alea just ran into him and winded up talking to him and he was telling me how
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.440]  the how he only gets down there they only pushed the liberal side of the media down there of bad
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.200]  stuff about trump the bad stuff about trump so what they're doing is they're brainwashing them
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:13.120]  indoctrinating them down there encouraging them to come over here trying to push for open borders
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:18.560]  and now and they're trying to trying to yeah exactly it's not just poor people they're being
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:24.400]  weaponized they're being politicized this is the real game of thrones here absolutely absolutely
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.640]  they're really trying to play chess with these people they're moving them in by the troves to get
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:34.080]  democratic votes so they can have democratic run throughout the government and turn this country
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:38.400]  into a socialist country so they can be the the the globalist can take over and have their one
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.640]  world government and we have to stand up as christians we have to stand up as believers we have
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.760]  to stand up as patriots and americans and we have to fight and we have to fight with our minds
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.480]  okay this come last i don't advocate for violence this come last but when it comes down to it you
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:56.640]  have to stand your ground defend yourself but use your mind use your mind stand out there and
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.680]  fight against but let me guess you could tell they were about to assault you and what were you
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:03.440]  you were telling yourself hold back weren't you you were you were saying don't lose control don't
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:08.320]  hurt them too bad well the thing was i was just at that point in time i knew something was going
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.160]  to happen and i was just telling myself just let them make the first move and when they do
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:17.360]  unleash fury that's it let them touch me first and i obviously i'm being surrounded by a gang
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:22.880]  i'm in fear i'm fear for my life i get hit with sticks so i'm gonna i'm gonna let the line out
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.040]  and i'm gonna defend myself until i feel like i'm safe so they weren't ready for that well brandon

[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:24.240]  all right mike adams is with us for the rest of the hour that he's hosting the fourth hour right
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:29.360]  here in the new studio your tv viewer you can see it any radio listeners can go to m4wars.com
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:36.240]  for till i show and find the verboten broadcast and i i had my gathams coming in here about
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:41.200]  nasa came out and said carbon dioxide is actually good for plants on the earth that's like saying
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:46.800]  water is good for fishies but the fact that now nasa can actually say the truth not under obama
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:52.080]  is a big deal so we're going to get into all of that with mike we're going to get into a
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:57.920]  bunch of other vaccine news the whole measles panic also how death education is causing massive
[02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:01.600]  suicides that's even in mainstream news now we're going to talk about things that sound
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:08.960]  negative but it's positive to know the truth but mike owns a big accredited major research lab
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:13.440]  accredited to test food supplements water you name it he'd mentioned this a few weeks ago we've
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:19.120]  been so busy haven't done it it's funny we're running a special on alexa pure pro water filtration
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:23.600]  systems that again are one of the best gravity fed systems out there i mean there's some other
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:29.120]  good units out there we sell pro pure as well but he's trying to help the show this is what he does
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:33.600]  he's tested all our products he tested many other products people pay him to test products we haven't
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:40.640]  done that but you you found something interesting testing our system against other systems i appreciate
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:44.480]  you doing that i know it cost thousands of dollars to do it i didn't ask you to i should have asked
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.480]  you to but obviously these are already accredited by other groups that have tested it but tell us
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:54.000]  what you found independently yeah well so so to set the the proper context uh we were not paid
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.760]  we i did this as a volunteer and i tell you why because you know i'm part of the independent
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:04.480]  media as well and i've seen how you have been just viciously attacked over your supplements even when
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:09.120]  your supplements are vastly superior to what's available in retail and i thought you know this is
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:14.240]  entirely unfair if your products are the best if they're really clean if your water filters really
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:19.520]  work well then frankly you deserve credit for that so we have a multiple mass spec laboratory it's a
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:24.880]  multimillion dollar facility i've i've got some video that i sent you this morning you can roll
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:29.920]  some of that document can his spectrometer stuffer yeah and so we we've been testing water filters
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:36.240]  for their ability to remove glyphosate which is the toxic cancer causing weed killer and glyphosate
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:43.440]  is the most difficult chemical to remove from water the most difficult uh laboratories we we
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:47.600]  worked for two years to get a method that could even retain it so that we could test it and all
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:52.000]  the science papers out there show that it's the most difficult chemical analyte anyway the bottom
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.480]  line and i brought you the results here today we're gonna play the video coming up the alexa pure
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:05.440]  water filter that was sent to us for testing directly from the alexa pure company we put two
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.880]  parts per million of glyphosate in water ran it through the filter took the resulting water
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:17.680]  and ran it through our triple quad mass spec 100% removal of glyphosate 100% removal and again
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:21.360]  you're the expert on this you have the scientists that work for you but from what i've read that's
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:26.640]  unprecedented well they're out of all the filters we've ever tested we've only seen three that could
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:32.320]  do this they're all very expensive more expensive than alexa pure very high-end filters uh with your
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:39.280]  sale i think that i just heard about is $199 that is by far the most affordable filter that has
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:45.360]  this 100 efficacy now and the thing is glyphosate is an indicator so if a water filter can remove
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:52.160]  glyphosate with 100 effectiveness which is very rare to find it means that it has the best chemistry
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:58.160]  in the water filter element so if you could knock mike tyson out in 1989 is p you could beat anybody
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:03.200]  well exactly so it's going to remove atrazine it's going to remove pesticides it's going to remove
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:07.680]  you know bisphenol a probably and all these other toxic chemicals plus heavy metals we
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:13.440]  know heavy metals removal is typically very easy for water filters to accomplish so uh that that's
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:18.880]  not difficult for a lot of filters to do but to remove glyphosate is a big deal so our lab i've
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.920]  gone ahead and forwarded this graphic that you can use i'm giving you permission to use this on
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:31.120]  your website our lab cwc labs is confirming 100 removal of glyphosate from the alexa pure water
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:35.040]  filter and by the way you didn't even tell me you were doing this which is it's cool you did it you
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:38.960]  even bought it from the manufacturer i just went out and saw who was ever the highest tested or
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.600]  ever the highest ratings that's who i get as a sponsor yeah i mean that's because i'm already
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:45.040]  gonna be a target plus i want to sell a good product plus so many times the very best you
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:50.320]  can get isn't the most expensive well that's right i mean it really depends on how they make
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:54.800]  that cartridge what goes in it what kind of medium well let me say this i want you to continue to
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:58.800]  test alexa pure for us and i'm glad you did because there's another big national manufacturer
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.280]  i'm not putting them down they were really good for a while then they got cruddy we got complaints
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:08.320]  we didn't have a sponsor for two years i see and so sometimes people are good then they're not
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:12.400]  that's why you've got to continue on with the testing well that's right and actually your
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:17.680]  crew gave me some of your nutritional supplement products several months ago i've got three of
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:23.120]  them tested cleared of glyphosate i'll bring those in at a later date to show what those are
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:28.000]  and we have more testing going on all the time you know and we're also adding by the way atrazine
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.120]  to our testing protocols so later this year we'll be able to test everything with an internally
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.680]  validated atrazine method and look i don't want to get too geeky you know for for folks that don't
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.080]  know that's the chemical that turns the freaking frogs get yeah exactly atrazine is a chemical
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:48.960]  castrator and it atrazine and glyphosate are the top one number one and number two weed killers
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:53.920]  that are used in agriculture so they are in the tap water they're in the well water they're in
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:59.360]  food crops and their gender vendors they are they cause can't they are folks yes i it's like
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.320]  david hog goes jones says the water is poisonous then sells a filter like i'm hiding it from people
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:09.680]  no i sell things i believe in we're trying to fund things my i drink filter water at my house
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.600]  through an elect superior and i reverse osmosis for cooking but that cuts out the mineral so it's
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:19.760]  not as good but for cooking food it's fine but so i'm just i mean yes i sell what i use exactly
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.560]  well and and california you think about the water is so polluted in california oh my god they
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:30.960]  recycle uh sewer water right and toilet your top put on the crops and they have bio sludge now and by
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:36.160]  the way the state of washington i believe has just approved a new law that allows the bio sludge
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.520]  composting of human corpses so they're going to take human corpses and bio sludge them into the
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.560]  food supply and that'll be going back to it again exactly so they're having a closed loop system of
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:51.680]  disposing of human corpses into the food supply by the way for people who don't know let's say a 60
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:57.440]  year old i read the studies in this toxic environment a human body is a toxic thing you do not want to
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.240]  be like you know like lower grade fertilizer you put on grass you don't put on food crops no it's
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:07.920]  putting humans on i mean so one of one of the things that our lab does we we have heavy metals
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.960]  testing and people send us hair samples all the time and so we we have a really good map thousands
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.400]  of hair samples of testing well when my dogs on my ranch they killed a wild rabbit i went out there
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:25.200]  and clipped some hair of the rabbit and i ran that through the same test the rabbit is pristine
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:30.320]  compared to humans the wild animals are pristine compared to human oh we bio accumulate worse than
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:34.640]  a whale yeah well because look at the toxins that people are drinking and eating if you drink
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:40.000]  california water you're getting gender bender chemicals you wonder why we have this rise of
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.800]  so many people who don't know their gender listen part of it is cultural but part of it is quite
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.400]  literally chemical exposure and if you don't want that exposure you need to have a filtration system
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:55.120]  yes it's very simple if all our listeners went and got an alexa pure pro their biggest best systems
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:59.520]  to throw on your counter dump the water in it does tens of thousands of gallons in its lifetime
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:02.800]  hundreds of gallons a day if you want to dump water on the top of it i get lazy to reverse osmosis
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.560]  for cooking because i well i didn't load i didn't load the alexa pure let me go over here and get
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.920]  to reverse yeah take some time for the gravity to drip yeah yeah it's what she takes an hour
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.320]  so to give you for gallons but for your drinking water you need to do it or you're crazy well here's
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  what what else is amazing we went to walmart and other retailers and we bought those cheap
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.880]  water pit picture filters that you buy and the water just runs right through them with almost
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:26.800]  no contact oh exactly if something's going right through it's not filtered it's not filtering it
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:32.880]  takes time to remove the chemicals that you don't want so a fast filter that is gravity is usually
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  not effective and we've seen that in our actual by the way mike adams you are just kickass for
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.400]  doing this because i know it costs you a lot because we do testing ourselves on top of testing
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:44.000]  just to make sure and it's almost bankrupting us thank you so much you're awesome natural
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:47.200]  news dot com we're going to come in with your video report and have a side that we'll get into
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  all the other big news but folks filter your water this is the best system for the prize
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:57.680]  do it for your children and from the info or do it if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:04.000]  many drugs listen to me you don't know me and we'll never meet i had a problem like you once i drank
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.800]  and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life i realized
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:16.800]  i needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me if you've tried to fix your drinking
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:22.320]  and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone you need to call the national treatment

[02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:15.520]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:24.800]  welcome to this laboratory analysis of the alexa pure water filter this is mike adams here the
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:31.760]  founder of cwc labs with a triple quad mass spec behind me that tests for glyphosate at sub parts
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:36.000]  per billion concentrations i'm wearing this microphone because we have a lot of noise in
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.720]  the lab because of all of the vacuum pumps but just to backtrack a little bit we did an analysis
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:48.800]  of the the effectiveness of over a dozen water filters maybe a month ago or so and it was a really
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:54.560]  popular video we were able to find two filters that removed 100 percent of the glyphosate which
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:58.400]  is a toxic cancer causing herbicide that's found in the water
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:07.520]  parts per billion concentrations i'm wearing this microphone because we have a lot of noise
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:14.320]  in the lab because of all of the vacuum pumps but just to backtrack a little bit we did an analysis
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:20.160]  of the the effectiveness of over a dozen water filters maybe a month ago or so and this is a
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:26.000]  really popular video we were able to find two filters that removed 100 percent of the glyphosate
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:32.320]  which is a toxic cancer causing herbicide that's found in the water all across america most of
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:37.840]  the filters did not remove 100 but two of them did and i put out the call at that time for other
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:43.440]  companies to send us their water filters so that we could test them and the rules of that were very
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:49.760]  simple you send us a water filter like alexa pure did here they sent it to us we test it for free
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:54.160]  we don't get paid we don't ask for any money we don't have any compensation
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:35:01.520]  so it's very simple so to conduct this test we made a mixture of glyphosate in water
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:07.120]  glyphosate is water soluble so it's very easy to do we put it together at two parts per million
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:13.600]  that's 2000 parts per billion of glyphosate and then we poured the the two parts per million
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:20.320]  glyphosate into the water filter now before we poured it in we took a sample here so this
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:25.440]  is the two parts per million glyphosate in water and then we allow the water to drip through the
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:32.480]  water filter and then we collected the water here after the filtration into this vial this is the
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:38.640]  post filtration vial which we hope would contain no glyphosate if it's a hundred percent effective
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:45.120]  this would be completely glyphosate free and you could drink this water so what results did we get
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:51.360]  well follow me we'll take a look at the triple quad mass spec results and we'll see what it actually
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:58.720]  shows us so this is a triple quad mass spec and this peak right here as is titled the alexa pure
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:05.760]  pre-filter glyphosate this is the peak and the response that we get on this mass spec instrument
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:12.000]  for glyphosate at two parts per million and as you can see here in the upper right hand corner
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:18.880]  the response is 6.3 times e to the fourth so that's a very large response if we were to
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:27.600]  integrate this peak and actually look at a number the response is 26 618 so that actually represents
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:34.160]  the number of molecular fragments of the glyphosate molecule that were detected by this instrument
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:43.520]  in i believe the injection i use on this was two microliters so two millions of a leader of water
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:53.520]  at two parts per million concentration produced a response of 26 618 that's before the filter
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:37:00.080]  now here's the big question what kind of a job did the alexa pure pro water filter do
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:02.560]  so to answer that i'm going to load up
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:16.080]  the post filter and here it is so this is the post filter you notice there's no peak at all
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:22.160]  so remember this is pre-filter this is post filter there's no glyphosate at all
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:31.040]  so the simple summary of this is that the alexa pure pro removes 100% of the glyphosate at two
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:36.080]  parts per million concentration which is by the way many times higher than what the epa allows in
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:41.120]  drinking water two parts per million is considered actually a pretty high concentration of glyphosate
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.440]  and the fact that that water filter was able to eliminate all of that glyphosate to the point
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:53.440]  where we detected nothing in this run shows you that it is extremely effective at removing
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:59.840]  glyphosate and we can infer scientifically because glyphosate is such a very difficult molecule to
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:06.080]  remove it's it's very tricky it goes through a lot of filters right but we can infer from that
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:13.600]  that the filter media that alexa pure pro is using is really superior to what most water filters
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:18.560]  are using on the market and even though we haven't tested it for other pesticides or agricultural
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:24.800]  chemicals or you know chemical solvents things like that we can infer that it's very likely
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:30.160]  that we would also have 100% or near 100% removal of those other chemicals as well
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:37.440]  there are some filters where we saw a lot of leaking out of this point here and out of the
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:42.800]  valve in fact we were doing some of these tests where we would pour in you know pour it all the
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:47.360]  way to the top and and wait overnight and one morning with some other filters we came in
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:53.840]  and there was like glyphosate water all over the floor which was not not a good thing so of course
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:58.880]  we had to mop that up and clean that up and it was a bit of a mess but that's because not all the
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:07.360]  filters have good you know washers or good prop good good components that fit together tightly
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:14.000]  but this one does and so I'm you know overall I'm impressed with it again we don't sell this unit
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.920]  we actually sell a competing unit to this unit so we have no financial conflicts of interest in
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:26.640]  this at all this is just an issue of I'm interested in the public learning what works I'm interested
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.640]  in the public avoiding exposure to glyphosate pesticides and herbicides and you know they
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:37.440]  they were kind enough to send me a unit so we're going to test it and I'm going to shoot a video
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:41.440]  that's what this is about so you can check out my previous video if you want to see the other
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:48.320]  water filters that also tested at 100% removal of glyphosate with this one there are now three total
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:54.720]  that achieve that result and all three are gravity filters right so it's pretty cool this is another
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:01.200]  option if you want to be prepared for the unknown if you want to have clean water even without a
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:08.320]  disaster you don't need a disaster to use this product our lab is absolutely verifying 100%
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:13.200]  removal of glyphosate and we invite other laboratories all across the country to test it
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:18.800]  yourself and see because you'll be able to replicate our same findings unless you assembled it wrong
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:24.480]  or something which I can't vouch for your assembly techniques but we know how to put pieces together
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:29.200]  it's not that difficult and it works for us so thanks for watching I'm Mike Adams the health
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:34.880]  ranger CWC labs is the laboratory here if you're a water filter manufacturer and you're watching
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:41.040]  this and you're wanting us to test your filter just contact us through naturalnews.com you send
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:46.480]  us your filter just send it to us for free we'll test it for free and if the results are good like
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:51.920]  this we'll shoot a video for free and help promote your quality products we don't ask for anything
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.800]  you don't have to pay us we don't ask for a percentage nothing of the kind this is totally
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:01.440]  free in the public interest I don't know how you do it Mike I obviously sell books and films and
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:06.240]  supplements yourself do a great job but classic thing a headset fell off in the control room
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.160]  about a minute into your piece and it hit replay and started over again I guess God wanted that
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:13.680]  repeated but I didn't even know you were doing this I go out and find out whatever is the highest
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.480]  tested but as you said during the break I said well is mine the best you said well for stainless
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:23.120]  steel and the cost yes it is the best deal I mean I mean repeat that I want to explain out of all
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.080]  these filters you tested three of them came up zero ours though is the stainless steel the highest
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:33.040]  quality I believe then a lower price than them well and and also keep in mind that the Alexa
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:38.000]  Pure the filter the filtration element is very large and it handles a very large volume of water
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.120]  so there was one other water filter that water pitcher that did well but it doesn't have the
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.400]  same volume of throughput so you're paying a lot of money on those on those other filters to only
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:55.600]  filter 200 gallons well just be clear I'll just go sell those if they're better here's my same way
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:59.600]  yeah here's my sales tactic find out whatever is the best for the lowest price exactly so I don't
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.360]  care that you find something better please tell me so here's my statement you think is the best
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:09.600]  deal then scientifically the Alexa Pure has it does more filtration at a lower cost per gallon
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.800]  than any filter we've ever tested especially when you have it on sale right now for for a one and
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:19.040]  nine and this look baller this wasn't planned folks I'm telling you everything we do we know
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:23.760]  we're going to get tested anyways plus even that wasn't the case I'm not going to sell you I would
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:29.360]  get bad mojo man from the guy upstairs yeah right right and plus any other lab in the country that
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.320]  is competent in this can reproduce our results and I invite them to we welcome other labs run the
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:40.400]  test and and get the same results that we did or if you don't contact me because I know these
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:45.040]  results are reproducible because we have a validated method so ours has been tested by others
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:49.200]  that's why we went with it exact rated info or store.com biggest sale ever let's appear pro

[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:59.760]  it for what's possible god bless you i want to say brain force is great i want to say turbo
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:06.400]  force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:11.760]  oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:17.280]  brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've got the adults
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:21.120]  you've got the krill oil if you're going to get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:24.960]  really strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:29.360]  damn burps and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:33.680]  hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:38.320]  i eat five culottes of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:49.440]  so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.840]  but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:47:10.960]  can't do it you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:19.520]  number three
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:26.080]  and mike adams is going to be hosting and i'll go 15 minutes into the next hour when
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:30.240]  it was we got on late and he does have a ton of news to get to a bunch of news i haven't hit a bunch
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:37.520]  of breaking news i haven't gotten to yet uh how psychology departments are trying to make uh
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:41.680]  preteen and teen girls commit suicide we have all the evidence yeah they want to abort babies after
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.000]  they're born they want to kill you okay and it's a small cult of control freaks but once they're
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:50.560]  identified they're done and once you realize they're out to get you that's when we turn things around
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:54.480]  we don't say this is scary we we tell you this because it's true and i'm like mike let's get into
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:58.240]  all your other big findings your great big top stories this deadly fungus story that you broke
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:02.480]  even before the new york times uh as people are aware of it uh and how you can deal with it you'll
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:08.160]  get into the nassid meaning that old carbon dioxide is good i mean it sounds ridiculous but obviously
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:11.600]  it's the truth it's ridiculous it was said it's the truth and so much more but you want to get
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:16.240]  back to water filters and and again this wasn't even planned today i knew i heard he did this test
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.000]  when it came up clean i'm like okay because we already go to the big companies have done their
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.280]  own testing but he's a separate top lab in fact out of all these filters ours was the best value
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:29.920]  the most volume of the three that actually cut it all out of the hardest thing to get out live
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:36.560]  of states what's a good bellwether well i yeah i just want to reiterate alex that that you know we
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:42.160]  you and i have always had a really clear working relationship i've never been on your payroll
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:45.280]  yeah i've never received a dime from info wars and the same thing is true with this
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.320]  water filter so i just want the public to know that i did this as a patriot i did this because
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:55.600]  info wars deserves credit for choosing really rock solid by the way if you'd have found a problem i
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:00.080]  had admitted it and dropped it well of course if i had found a problem i would have let you know i
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.000]  would have said here's a problem by the way these three products i know that i think one of these
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:08.640]  has already been rebranded but i'm testing a force plus but it's the same thing right
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.960]  so i tested these three products for glyphosate and i can clear all three of them every one of them
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:18.640]  has a barcode of our internal lab id you see that's our internal lab testing number internal lab id
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.480]  i can produce a documentation of the validated testing results so i know all these three products
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:28.400]  are clear of glyphosate as well and you know we test our own products that's mostly what we do
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:33.440]  but i've started testing info wars products when your when your staff gives me those products to
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:38.000]  test but the thing is we don't get paid to do that in fact right now we're not even offering
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.320]  glyphosate testing to the public and we don't offer that yet we may offer it later in the year
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:45.360]  but we're not doing it yet just because we're busy we're busy with our all our own stuff we
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:50.160]  know we have so many samples going through and it is expensive to do this that instrument that's on
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:54.320]  the video that you showed is a half a million dollar instrument oh i know because we don't just
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:59.200]  believe these big top companies that we probably label stuff for or and i'm sure they're great but
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  who knows somebody hasn't sabotaged so we go ahead and have it tested again that's why sometimes
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:06.560]  stuff sold out for six months right it's not really sold out it sold out maybe two months
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:11.440]  we're getting lab results back because i know i've got to have every batch locked up in a cabinet
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:16.160]  certified with a special fda trained lawyer in case they ever try to spike something to set us up
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.080]  that's right and we also know that the trolls out there they're buying your products and they're
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:25.280]  buying my products and they're trying to find something that is a contaminant and they haven't
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:29.440]  been able to do it and it's because of this testing that you do and this testing that we do
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:34.560]  so so i just look i just want the your audience to know i'm not paid to do this i come in here
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:39.040]  because this is my patriotic duty and you give me the opportunity to have this voice i'm going to
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:43.920]  host the fourth hour i got a lot of news to cover bombshell stuff about vaccines too but you know
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.800]  i want to thank you for what you do and let me know that we are we're going to use our science
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:55.440]  to to validate the cleanliness of your products and we're going to do it for free because it's
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:59.600]  part of this fight end of story well i appreciate that because people know you they trust you and
[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:03.520]  it's not just some certified name on ours from some other top lab you've got a top lab and
[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:07.120]  you're checking it because i want to check make sure these labs being accurate because i know
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:11.280]  a big target but but it's beyond that what do you call it i call it god-fearing people think
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:17.200]  that oh that means you you're scared of god it's a bigger twist on that it means that when if i even
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:20.640]  think about doing something bad even though i don't want to do it my brain war games it
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:25.120]  i feel scared and away from god i don't know how to explain or like away from humanity
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:32.480]  and so i mean you could call it a compulsion the only thing i'm ocd about is is that i like
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  hospitality of people over my house to cook hamburgers for them i like making people dinner i
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:42.240]  like taking care of i like treating people like i want to be treated and and but then i see the
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:46.560]  rest of the world that's less and less america was built on that they think screwing someone
[02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:50.880]  over's pool or cutting corners or doing something so i don't we see it what do you call that when
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:55.520]  you because i know you're the same when you neurotically want to treat people the way you
[02:51:55.520 --> 02:51:59.920]  want to be treated yeah even though you're at a standard higher than anybody else you still feel
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:04.240]  guilty because you're not perfect no we see in this industry in even in the natural products
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:10.800]  industry we reject 80 percent of the raw materials that we test even for our own products 80 percent
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:16.080]  do not meet our standards and we were contacted by a major player not going to mention his name a
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:21.120]  major player had one of the biggest companies sold it off made a bunch of money came to us
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:25.600]  wanted to invest tens of millions of dollars we tested their raw materials and they were dirty
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:30.880]  and we said no and that major player went out to somebody else in the industry got venture capital
[02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:36.000]  and is now kind of a big shot retailer through Whole Foods and all these other places it's dirty
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.840]  product i can't name the names because they'll you know they'll they'll sue me but i i've got the
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:45.040]  lab results i could prove it if i had to the thing is clean products are what it's really all about
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:49.280]  clean products makes your blood clean and it makes your brain function better and by the way the
[02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:53.920]  planet's so dirty now it's even harder to get clean products well that's exactly it and you
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:58.400]  got to have clean water because look your body uses water to detox all the time you know they
[02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:03.680]  talk about detoxification but if you just drink clean water your body is eliminating the toxins
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.520]  naturally because your liver is doing its job your kidneys are doing its job if you happen to get
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:12.240]  exposed to some atrazine or some glyphosate or some pesticides if you have clean water going
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:17.360]  into your body every day your body is going to eliminate that well people ask me come back to
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:22.240]  that people ask me because i've been through a lot i've been burned out and i didn't need to be
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:26.160]  very healthy so i'm not a great example this thought got a lot better than i was 10 years ago
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:29.200]  because i just kind of gave up got subconsciously depressed and ate a hundred pounds and all the
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:33.040]  rest of it but then i with supplements working out i've gotten back some people look at my son
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:37.360]  like six two now you like beaming they look at my daughters they go why do your kids look like
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:43.200]  super models and i'm not bragging it's because they've never had vaccines they eat overall organic
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:47.200]  food they've always had filtered water and they don't brush their teeth with fluoride now i'm gonna
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:52.720]  explain something my dad is a dentist and oral surgeon he's quasi retired so he has his license
[02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:56.400]  he always thought they were giving people calcium fluoride that was pharmaceutical grade which you
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:54:00.240]  need a little bit of in your body too much as toxic he didn't know it was grignard reagent
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:05.520]  hydrofluorosalic acid weaponized that toxic chemical dumped in he helped develop super
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:09.680]  blue fluoride free toothpaste now sure topically fluoride can actually do some things for your
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:14.240]  teeth but you don't drink sunscreen to stop getting a sunburn and so what i'm getting at here is
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:19.120]  is that i know all this stuff it doesn't mean i follow it perfectly but you better damn well
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:24.480]  believe we put out fluoride free toothpaste because it matters folks and fluoride on average is
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:30.240]  lowering your IQ giving you bone cancer giving you lower fertility it's a fact well i i guarantee
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:35.120]  you i mean maybe you don't want me to say this publicly but i'm gonna say it anyway i think the
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:40.240]  only reason because you and i are subjected to intense stress yeah because of the attacks and
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:44.240]  the lawsuits and all these things the only reason that people like you and i can remain alive and
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:48.560]  productive is because of the nutrition that we take because these adaptogens that are in the
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:53.840]  nutritional supplements they alleviate stress i can be totally depressed and not taking care of
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.840]  myself and had no sleep and eating bad food and if i take some dna force plus or some fish oil
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:05.120]  or or some iodine and drink a bunch of water i suddenly feel alive exactly if you and i lived
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:10.640]  on junk food and live the lifestyle that we live we would be dead by now no question about it
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:15.920]  other people survive on junk foods only because they don't have the stresses in their lives because
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:21.360]  they're not really active in trying to change the world they're not challenging the system
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.120]  they're not doing the things that you and i do we're warriors right we're fighters every day
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:28.800]  and that's a lifestyle that is a high-stress lifestyle it's nutrition that keeps us going
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:33.440]  well i was at ted newton's house like six months ago or so and that's like 70 years old and he's
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:37.600]  been imposing guys i try to act up it's like he's a big guy he's strong for he looks like he's like
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.760]  55 and he's and i said he you know he's totally drug-free and i said how do you do it he goes oh
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.160]  she may and all the supplements he goes all i do is test him if they work i feel him it's not right
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:50.480]  see but with me he goes some things don't work some things do and he was just there shoveling
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.320]  supplements in yeah and he's bouncing off the walls it was all just because he was getting
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:58.960]  healthy stuff we keep we keep doing research on turmeric how powerful that is i think you have a
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:04.480]  body's product that has that and and let me share something with you we're researching right now a
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:09.120]  formula that we're gonna patent i should probably talk to you about it about selling it you know
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:12.640]  you know i have a couple patents on removing things from the body we're gonna have a formula
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:18.320]  that removes aluminum that's incredible from the blood aluminum all the engineering yep yep
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:24.240]  and aluminum also you know it's it's it's in the food supply but it affects brain function and it
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:29.200]  affects kidney function and it's in the vaccines so the aluminum as you say it's an adjuvant it is
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:34.240]  it makes everything that's toxic more toxic the so there is a bubble booster yeah there's a way to
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:38.000]  remove aluminum from the body and the autism community has been super excited about this
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.080]  already talking to me about it uh we're working on we're gonna validate it in our lab before we
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.040]  even announce it you know i should talk to your folks about it i we didn't pre-plan this so i just
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:52.720]  came up but everything that i'm focused on in terms of research and patents is now about cleaning
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:57.760]  the body of the toxins i need to do it i because i you take better care of yourself than i i know
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.560]  all this and when i do it i'm great you say i don't i don't pull into mcdonald's but i will eat a 30
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:07.120]  ounce steak which i shouldn't do i mean it well you know i mean look i'll have barbecue from time
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:11.280]  to time too this is texas you know we love good barbecue yeah but but i'll take vitamin c with
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:14.960]  it you know or i'll take astaxanthin with it or i'll take turmeric with it so you can you can
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:20.800]  actually eat and enjoy a lifestyle of good food no but you're right if i take turmeric and some
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:25.280]  iodine after eating a big steak i feel great if i don't i'm all bloated yeah exactly exactly you

[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:29.040]  studios it's alex jones all right i got a bunch of moller news a bunch of key stuff next segment
[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:35.760]  but i wanted to get into this with mike adams right now and in the next segment there are people
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:41.200]  that are unaware and unconscious of what's going on and they're oblivious and the system wants us
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:45.040]  to be like that obviously correct me if i'm wrong then there are people that actively know their
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:49.200]  scams just want to join different scams to oppress people who are cynics and don't have a connection
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:54.880]  to god then there are people that are informed and involved they split into groups but but but
[03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.040]  the other groups inform it doesn't get involved because they've lost hope they don't go out and
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:02.880]  feed on people because they know the system's corrupt they give up but there's that small group
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:07.600]  that knows there's a fraud believes we can change it and we're doing it maybe there's other groups
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:13.440]  you can add to that there's demon infested groups don't forget about the well well yeah exactly
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:17.280]  you know what i mean i mean actual the well then how would you break these groups down how would
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:22.320]  you break these groups down well i i'd say that the the large masses are you know completely
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:26.400]  uninformed and illiterate about human history about reality about what's going on there's
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:32.400]  that there's maybe 20 of the population that is somewhat informed five percent of the population
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:37.680]  that's incredibly informed and they see what's coming they know that there is global depopulation
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:42.640]  running right now like for example we were going to talk about this this nasa greenhouse gas
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.600]  carbon dioxide story think about it the green new deal wants to eliminate carbon dioxide that
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:52.160]  feeds the plants that generate the oxygen that keeps humans alive green new deal should be called
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:57.200]  green new death because it is a terraforming operation to destroy carbon dioxide destroy
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:04.400]  all plants and destroy all humans look okay the atmosphere 80 percent of it roughly is nitrogen
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:12.720]  pointless neutral gas nobody uses it 20 roughly is oxygen a very tiny percentage is carbon dioxide
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:17.200]  you know less than a fraction of one percent which people don't get it's literally this desperate
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:21.680]  gold right right every and then they're saying that the one thing if aliens want to destroy the
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.280]  planet they would say get rid of this exactly this is the weak link exactly you said it if alien
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:30.800]  we're not i'm not saying literally that that's the case but if aliens were trying to tear apart
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:36.400]  on earth they would have somebody like ocasio-cortez say the carbon dioxide is bad let's destroy the
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:40.480]  planet and then tell you the world's gonna end oh we didn't get rid of it quick right right so they're
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:46.480]  using this desperation our planet is ending in 12 years do as i'm saying yeah yeah and it's a death
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:52.400]  cult so if if we want to keep humanity alive if we want to have an atmosphere where we can breathe
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:57.040]  we breathe you know oxygen right and plants produce the oxygen and plants need carbon dioxide is
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:02.960]  it incredible that plants mainly respirate off of carbon dioxide it's like not even one percent
[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:08.000]  and by the way as you know it was it was it went one peak from ice core samples and mud samples
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:13.200]  what a thousand times stronger well not i think it was over oh trees used to grow way faster
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:17.440]  everything was it was i don't know the exact number but it was many many times bigger than
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:21.920]  what it is today in fact carbon dioxide is near the lowest levels it's ever been in recorded earth
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:28.480]  history by the way that's not debated and they go oh you don't know the science you know it's no
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:34.480]  no look if if if you have a chart and it's going down down down down down for millions even billions
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:38.640]  of years and it's near the bottom and then it slightly ticks up all they do is they zoom in on
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.040]  that little tiny up to and they show and we should be we should like you said we should be geoengineering
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:48.560]  and terraforming with giant plants creating it not pumping it back into the earth right actually
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:54.240]  burning fossil fuels is releasing fertilizer all that ancient all that ancient carbon right right
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.840]  which has been sequestered now if you think about all that carbon dioxide that helped bring those
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:02.720]  plants to fruition is now buried in the earth we need to be pumping it out we need to be releasing
[03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:07.520]  carbon so that plants can grow and turn the earth more green have you seen the leftist proposals
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:13.040]  to cut trees down is that great carbon no it's look they are insane they are a death cult and
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:16.960]  they need to be stopped and i i hope we can talk about this a little bit when we come back in a
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:21.360]  minute who's behind them because we look we're not saying aliens are running things even though the
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:25.440]  globalists believe that like you noticed joe rogan had this big professor on he said oh yeah the
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:29.920]  university and you know in england and they're all going to start geo mapping other dimensions with
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:35.680]  dmt and like astronaut level stuff i told everybody that was going on because i was told by people
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.320]  that were involved in the program we're not even saying that we this is real they believe it
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:45.280]  that they have extraterrestrial like fallen creatures from another dimension programming
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:50.000]  this dimension to bring it down now that sounds insane that's what the elite believe we'll talk
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:54.640]  about it when we come back and then they're trying to cut off the carbon dioxide you know the worst
[03:04:54.640 --> 03:04:59.680]  part about getting old i'm still strong 45 is that i won't be there for my children someday
[03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:04.160]  that's why i need to make them strong now now i can be there for my children now i can make them
[03:05:04.160 --> 03:05:09.440]  strong now i can instruct them now i can teach them what i've learned but not once i'm gone you
[03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:13.200]  think of this digital age your words going forever but now they're even better getting rid of what you
[03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:18.880]  said they were before it's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high
[03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:24.880]  tech book burning isn't it but i have joined my will to the resistance i can't be destroyed now as
[03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:29.760]  long as i realize i've done right and the long as the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed
[03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:35.600]  either as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:41.280]  there is a magic that then takes place the transcend space and time when you commit be a word of mouth
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:46.960]  or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing
[03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:52.400]  so please now commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision to info wars
[03:05:52.400 --> 03:06:04.000]  is your own provision you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow
[03:06:05.680 --> 03:06:13.280]  i hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this country harping on
[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:19.680]  harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are i'll say this about my
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:23.040]  candidate will say about my crew and you the audience you are the activist who are the tip of
[03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:28.560]  the spear we're pro-human we want a human future and we're gonna mic's gonna take over next segment
[03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:33.040]  and get into the carbon dioxide and acid meaning you have to have it for life and it's less than
[03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:38.480]  one percent of the gas did you know that that's right so that's all coming up but let's get into
[03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:45.600]  how right we've been as an audience as listeners as patriots we said trump was being illegally
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:50.400]  spot on and exactly how first not just from research but from sources we've been vindicated
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:54.160]  we've been targeted for shutdown so is mine anybody who's over the target's getting hit
[03:06:54.160 --> 03:07:00.000]  that's what that's your sign of you know obviously who to support and then now
[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:07.680]  william bar comes from kind of the older establishment and he's a cleanup guy from the
[03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:12.000]  establishment because the establishment tried to take trump out and got caught so he's their
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:16.560]  protecting muller and protecting the system in my view and they don't know how to sit down and stop
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:21.760]  and so that whole process they got caught trying to steal the election trying to overthrow it
[03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:26.880]  it's blown up in their face particularly uh mainstream media has almost no viewers uh
[03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:30.880]  they're they're they're a straight down dive their censorship has failed on many fronts
[03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:38.000]  and nationalism is exploding so it's just such a big deal that when i got here back from dc last
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:44.960]  thursday you know folks i didn't just say on air uh hey i talked to two people personally
[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:49.360]  who had meetings with president trump by themselves that doesn't happen very often
[03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:53.760]  where he said i'm going after the system we're gonna have to arrest these people they're criminals
[03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:56.720]  they try to overthrow the government they hate america that's why i was the other person that
[03:07:56.720 --> 03:08:01.120]  was in the meetings about other meetings people had that's three people highly respected you've
[03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:04.960]  seen trump's public statements so he says he's doing it now hopefully he does it back down from
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:09.440]  that but he knows the public demands it plus how could you sleep at night knowing that the deep
[03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:14.320]  state's trying to overthrow the government trying to wear wires trying to set you up trying to do
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:19.280]  all this trump doesn't have a choice the question is what would you call this historic time we're in
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:25.040]  a and b what does trump need to do see and what will happen if trump doesn't move against the
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:29.520]  deep state but i think even kind of the older deep state that isn't as anti america it's not
[03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:35.680]  perfect it gets the cancer that aoc and michael moore and ilhan omar and all this are that they
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:40.160]  want maximum takeover power and that things are totally imbalanced because for globalist
[03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:44.240]  old line globalist oh we have right when we have left when we balance it in the process well it's
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:50.080]  way out of balance and and and the left wants full power and control now running around with ilhan
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:59.840]  omar going america is not white well it is america that brought your somali butt in here who says that
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:03.760]  whites are inherently evil and islam's gonna take over you're the cancer you're the people
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:07.920]  that created a desert hellhole you're the ones that you're main export of sex slavery and and all
[03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:14.000]  this i feel sorry for somalis and many i'm sure nice people but you ain't it lady so i'm just saying
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:19.760]  the power vacuum of the establishment playing this multicultural game and then trying to
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:24.720]  hype these people into race war is too damn dangerous the the desperation of the deep state
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:31.280]  in trying to destroy trump actually reveals the incredible degree of what they're trying to hide
[03:09:31.280 --> 03:09:36.080]  because they're trying to hide not just their election fraud and how much they hate america
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.480]  they want a globalist world and then one one world currency and all that they're actually
[03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:46.720]  trying to hide what trump may uncover in his second term oh yeah which is a cancer virus program
[03:09:46.720 --> 03:09:51.760]  the the gmo's that it's the middle it's the scientific industrial complex is scared and and
[03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:55.760]  look the globalists are being run and we can talk about who the controllers are perhaps they're
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:10:01.680]  being run by an agenda to annihilate 90 of the human population these are the orders they've
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:06.240]  been given now this is what they're acting on they've been told you'll get the advanced technology
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:11.360]  if you wipe out your fellow humans that's right that's right and uh you know i saw a stat this
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:15.920]  morning on on i think it was on zero hedge that talked about in 2024 even the united states
[03:10:15.920 --> 03:10:20.880]  government all the new debt will be used just to pay the interest on the existing debt the reason
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:26.800]  i say that alex is because every world government that's in a similar situation is reaching the
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:31.360]  point where the only way those governments can stay financially solvent is to carry out mass
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:37.200]  genocide and kill off the vast majority of the entitlement receivers brazil's he said that's
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:41.200]  five years ago he says the time has come where it's cheaper to kill a million people than to
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:46.720]  pacify them it is time to kill our people yeah and it's billions it's billions at this point
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:50.720]  right they want to kill off about six billion people this is the only way that those in power
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:55.440]  can remain in power now is to carry out mass death so everything that we're seeing in the news
[03:10:55.440 --> 03:11:01.120]  if you interpret it correctly is a positioning for that right and they're trying to pit sectors
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:05.280]  of humanity against other sectors they're trying to pit white people against black people they're
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:11.040]  trying to pit uh islam against christianity they are you know i i think there are elements of some
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:15.040]  of these shootings that we've seen that are you know really carefully crafted in order to
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:22.480]  create mass hatred no nothing is ever a state more shootings right oh and here's a good point
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:28.240]  remember yesterday when the armored car ran over pedestrians in venezuela every media
[03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:33.120]  organization in america ran that on a loop look this mass murder of civilians right that video
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:38.720]  was okay to show but the video of the christ church shooting in new zealand was banned and
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:44.080]  censored and denounced everywhere so the message from this is that the establishment media
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:52.320]  endorses the correct kind of murder video but bans a murder video that they don't want you to see
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:57.840]  this is a manipulation at a psychological level that we've never seen before in the history of our
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:04.880]  world why is that violent video okay for cnn and cbs news and nbc and everybody else because it's the
[03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:11.680]  correct kind of murder that they want to see happen these media organizations are psychological
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:17.440]  terrorists and they want to whip up hatred and mass murder and mass violence in the united states
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:22.640]  and everywhere around the world and you can see this time bomb where when we send our reporters
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:28.800]  out i mean we're not cherry picking these videos the bad people somehow a group think a spirit
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:37.200]  has been downloaded into the left where they are just frothing evil horrible folks well there
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:41.600]  there some of them are literally possessed by demons as we have talked about others are just
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:45.920]  incredibly misinformed that they don't know what they're talking about but they're full of hatred
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:52.240]  look alex the mainstream media now has become really a hate factory and yet they label conservative
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:58.400]  news as hate the real hate is coming from cnn the real hate's coming from rachel maddow the real
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:02.560]  hate's coming from the new york times of washington post on and on that's the hate factory and
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:06.880]  they're trying to whip up hatred against white people against christians against heterosexuals
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:12.400]  and against males and if you are anything that produces families and wealth and success right
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:15.760]  it now has to go you're gonna take over we come back but i didn't play this two days ago when it
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:19.920]  first came out we come back it's like the first five minutes of it then you'll take over tug of
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:23.840]  carlsson did a great defense of free speech and how they say that trump's attacking the first
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:29.200]  amendment by not coming to the correspondence dinner where they attack trump and lie about him
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:35.280]  so now if you respond to lies you're censoring but then cnn itself organizes the censoring
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:39.760]  but the good news is they're talking about oh ratings are up under trump they lost 90 plus
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:43.680]  percent of their viewers the last decade larry king you said like 15 million 10 million viewers
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:50.080]  a night their top show a million down cnn now they're down 40 percent in just uh since the uh uh
[03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:57.040]  russia gate fell apart and it's a freefall they their average show has 57 000 viewers the lowest
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:14:03.840]  on cable the reruns of andy griffith have more right and our yogi bear literally for the hallmark
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:08.640]  hallmark channels like five times right and now it'll soon be their top show will have 200 000 i
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:14.000]  mean the show conservatively let's be very conservative probably has two million people right now to
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.600]  them their top shows have a million the only reason the that the left wing media even exists
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:25.280]  is because of the extreme censorship trying to ban us and limit the options of viewers look we are
[03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:30.160]  the new media if we survive what's happening here and i believe we will and i think trump is fighting
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:34.720]  for most of the right things i don't agree with what he said about vaccines but we can talk about
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:39.920]  the long play on that later if we survive this we are the new media for america because we
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:45.120]  are the only i'm talking about the independent media not just you and i exactly we want everybody
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:49.520]  in 2016 we won our listeners of the heroes we're the heroes we're proven right we're the future
[03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:53.520]  instead they have to destroy us shut us down now this is their desperate gamble and they're losing
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:56.960]  that's the good news they're losing big time and they've already lost credibility in the minds of
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:02.320]  any rational person the only thing they have left is to keep spewing hatred and rely on that
[03:15:02.320 --> 03:15:07.680]  irrational hatred to get them viewers what they're doing is spewing anti-trump hate porn
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:12.000]  that's what cnn has become and and and most people are waking up but those susceptible get more
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.240]  into a deranged state yes you're taking over after the thugger carlson club when we come back

[03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:31.600]  correspondence dinner took place over the weekend for the third year in a row donald trump
[03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:37.360]  was invited but took a pass and didn't show up that has never happened in the long history of the
[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:42.080]  dinner presidents always show up they always throw in a tuxedo and head downtown to suck up to the
[03:20:42.080 --> 03:20:48.080]  white house correspondence association they don't want to do that they hate going every one of them
[03:20:48.080 --> 03:20:53.920]  all presidents deeply despise the news media but they make themselves go they have no choice it's
[03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:59.920]  a hostage situation if you blow off the dinner the press will punish you guaranteed they won't
[03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:05.040]  admit it of course they won't say it's personal they'll make up some story here for example is
[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:10.960]  jeff zucker spokesman claiming that not going to a media dinner is the same as attacking the media
[03:21:12.240 --> 03:21:16.720]  say what you will about the press this is an event that honors the first amendment
[03:21:16.720 --> 03:21:21.520]  yes that's what it's about it's an awards dinner and a fundraiser in the past presidents have always
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:26.000]  shown up even if they were angry the president at any given time it's yet another example of
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:30.800]  what we're seeing this administration's attack against the media it takes many forms one form is
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:37.120]  the president having a rally this saturday instead of attending the dinner dumb people are so self
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:42.320]  confident have you noticed that it's almost like there's a self-esteem competence reverse access
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:50.080]  i think that's real anyway they're telling us that going to your own event instead of our event
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:56.160]  is a form of harassment you know it's not harassment according to cnn spying on former fox
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:00.240]  reporter james rosen and his parents because you don't like what he's covering the obama
[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:05.360]  administration actually did that and then obama went to eight separate white house correspondent
[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:11.120]  association dinners nobody ever denounced him as immoral obama hated reporters by the way most
[03:22:11.120 --> 03:22:16.080]  people do hate reporters for good reason but reporters loved him back anyway they agreed with
[03:22:16.080 --> 03:22:21.840]  his politics that's what matters watch what happens when they don't agree with your politics
[03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:28.640]  i still separate my career into the period before february of 2017 and what came afterwards
[03:22:28.640 --> 03:22:32.480]  and that's because february 2017 is when the president of the united states called us the
[03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:36.560]  enemies of the people i thought it was time that we reset this dinner and put the focus
[03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:40.000]  a little more squarely on on journalism and a little more squarely on the first amendment a
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:43.760]  little more on the people the men and women who helped to hold the most powerful political
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:47.360]  institution in american life to account ladies and gentlemen to the first amendment
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:54.880]  now i'm delighted to make a spirited case tonight for the first amendment we now have to fight hard
[03:22:54.880 --> 03:23:01.360]  for basic truths we once took for granted like every future president washington felt maligned
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:06.720]  and misunderstood by the press but he never generalized that into a vendetta against the
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:12.240]  institution i think you're doing noble work to preserve democracy at a time when a rising tide
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:18.560]  of misinformation masquerading as news threatens to make a mockery of the first amendment donald
[03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:23.680]  jay trump is not the first and won't be the last american president to create jitters about the first
[03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:29.520]  amendment but what is happening today is perhaps even more insidious a relentless campaign against
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:36.240]  the very credibility of the news media this is a glorious tradition you folks are part of it and
[03:23:36.240 --> 03:23:45.920]  we can't have politicians crampling on it with impunity people are doubting the news media that's
[03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:52.240]  wrong you're seeing misinformation masquerading as news they're telling us and actually the right we
[03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:58.000]  have seen a lot of that recently how about the last two years of russia coverage on cnn for example
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:02.800]  michael cohen met secretly with russian spies and prog john don juniors about to be indicted
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:08.240]  the steel dossier is entirely real they told us all of that and much more all of it wrong
[03:24:08.240 --> 03:24:14.320]  and stupid totally dishonest the new york times the washington post won pollensers for what turned
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:19.840]  out to be misinformation masquerading is news last saturday it would have been a perfect moment
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:26.640]  actually to apologize for that debacle and return the prizes they won but no nobody apologized nobody
[03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:31.840]  returned a pollitzer instead they celebrated themselves no surprise there that's what they do
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:38.240]  what was odd though was hearing them talk about free speech the first woman is in fact under ferocious
[03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:43.200]  attack really more than any time in the last 50 years at least and yet the people in that room
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:48.720]  don't seem to notice where were these same people last summer when the big tech companies colluded
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:56.080]  to silence broadcaster alex jones alex jones he's bad seen and literally led the effort to make
[03:24:56.080 --> 03:25:00.880]  him be quiet jeff zucker doesn't agree with alex jones's political views therefore he thinks alex
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:05.840]  jones shouldn't be allowed to talk so zucker shut him up by force did anyone at saturdays
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:11.360]  didn't mention any of that and where were they when facebook and twitter blocked ads supporting
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:15.920]  congresswoman marcia blackburn because they criticized abortion where were they when tomi
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:21.200]  robinson went to prison in the uk for having unfashionable views about immigration where were
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:26.320]  they when james damore got fired and then slandered by google for questioning the company's diversity
[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:32.000]  theology where were they when peter blaming lost his job teaching in virginia because
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:37.040]  he wouldn't use male pronouns to describe a female student did any of the first amendment
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:41.360]  defenders here's the first amendment they say at the dinner on saturday say a single word about
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:47.760]  any of this of course they didn't their job they say is to hold the powerful to account
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:54.160]  but when given the chance to push back against the truly powerful the actually powerful that
[03:25:54.160 --> 03:26:01.520]  we're not even kidding powerful google amazon facebook paypal do they say anything ever
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:09.520]  no of course not they suck up every single time they suck up to power because that's who they are
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:15.840]  dutiful totes to the powerful defending class interests and pretending it is principal
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:24.480]  fine that's who they are everyone thinks so but i would never say it you know what i want to do
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:36.720]  i want to get it finished the prize i want is victory for the world
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:51.600]  it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:03.680]  we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag info wars helped
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:10.560]  to rule the rumor that president obama is in icis it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:16.480]  i will not let you down you'll be very very impressed by home and i think we'll be speaking a
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:23.680]  lot donald trump and alex jones this means that donald trump will be the 45th president of the
[03:27:23.680 --> 03:27:31.760]  united states waging war on corruption it's alex jones all right we're back on the fourth hour here
[03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:37.360]  mike adams filling in for alex jones on the rest of the show today now we've you know we've
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:42.880]  covered a lot alex and i it's it's always great to kind of just wrap with alex about things that
[03:27:42.880 --> 03:27:46.800]  are happening in the world and just stream of thought you know stream of consciousness kind of
[03:27:46.800 --> 03:27:51.680]  coverage which is what you saw for the last 45 minutes or so but i've got some very important
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:56.720]  news to go over here a lot of his science base and the science agenda to annihilate humanity to
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:28:01.760]  literally destroy 90 percent of the population the evidence is now undeniable that that's exactly
[03:28:01.760 --> 03:28:07.520]  what's happening and we also know that certain globalists whose names you can probably guess
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:12.480]  are in charge of that and they are manipulating human psychology they're manipulating the media
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:18.400]  they're manipulating science medicine vaccines everything in order to accomplish this goal
[03:28:18.400 --> 03:28:22.560]  so i'm gonna lay it out for you this is going to be a very powerful collection of segments
[03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:28.800]  but i want to start with the human composting segment we'll do that when we come back after
[03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:34.640]  this break about how they've now legalized the composting of human beings in order to
[03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:40.320]  allow for the mass extermination of humans this is something right out of terminator
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:44.960]  where the machines are running 24-7 to eliminate humanity we'll be back on the fourth hour here

[03:31:57.600 --> 03:32:04.400]  censorship and i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[03:32:04.400 --> 03:32:13.120]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[03:32:13.680 --> 03:32:18.480]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won
[03:32:19.680 --> 03:32:24.400]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did
[03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:30.000]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now

[03:32:50.400 --> 03:33:01.920]  you're in my hands info war store dot com thank you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:01.920 --> 03:33:21.920]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:31.040]  you know it's it's impossible to fully understand the mesal situation in america today
[03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:38.880]  unless we go back to the year 2010 at that time there were two merc virologists who filed a false
[03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:44.240]  claims act with the federal government and in that false claims act they explained that they
[03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:51.440]  were ordered by merc management to falsify the efficacy of the mumps vaccine and we captured
[03:33:51.440 --> 03:33:57.280]  that document back in 2010 and we posted it on natural news at the time and i just posted a story
[03:33:57.280 --> 03:34:03.840]  today that revisits it i'm going to read you some key summaries from that document that will
[03:34:04.560 --> 03:34:10.640]  drastically alter your understanding of what's happening with measles and mumps and mmr vaccines
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:16.080]  this is absolutely shocking it shows that one of the reasons the vaccines don't work is because
[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:22.000]  they were never working that it was massive scientific fraud that got those vaccines approved in
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:28.720]  the first place in fact reuters even now has a recent story that was linked by drudge i think
[03:34:28.720 --> 03:34:34.480]  yesterday and the reuters story admits that up to 10 percent of those who are infected with measles
[03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:38.320]  in this latest outbreak are people who were previously vaccinated against the measles
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:43.120]  and of course the answer to that according to reuters is that everybody should rush out and get
[03:34:43.120 --> 03:34:48.640]  another vaccine shot or even two more vaccine shots so imagine if the the auto industry
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:54.960]  functioned that way suppose you bought a car and the car blew up on the road you survived
[03:34:54.960 --> 03:34:59.680]  you stumble out of the car and then reuters comes along and writes a story and says oh these cars
[03:34:59.680 --> 03:35:04.720]  don't work buy another one you know like that that's what they're saying with vaccines the vaccines
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:09.840]  don't work but you should keep taking the shots because that's going to enrich the drug companies
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:14.960]  but from this false claims act document that was filed with the federal government here's the upshot
[03:35:14.960 --> 03:35:20.240]  of this number one according to the according to what these virologists filed merc knowingly
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:28.480]  falsified its mumps vaccine tests and fabricated a 95 efficacy rate that they spiked the blood test
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:35.120]  with animal antibodies in order to trick the fda into approving it they falsified trial results
[03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:39.840]  to swindle the u.s. government out of hundreds of millions of dollars quote for a vaccine that
[03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:47.440]  does not provide adequate immunization merc's vaccine fraud has contributed to the continuation
[03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:52.800]  of mumps across america causing more children to become infected this is key to understand it
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:36:00.160]  because the vaccine was fraudulently approved with fake science it gives people a false sense of
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:06.080]  being immunized against these infectious diseases so people keep catching the measles or or maybe
[03:36:06.080 --> 03:36:11.440]  the mumps and other other outbreaks or even the flu and other outbreaks and it's spreading
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:16.960]  around the world and around across the united states because the vaccine was faulty from the
[03:36:16.960 --> 03:36:24.400]  start the data were faked merc used its false claims of 95 effectiveness this is according to
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:29.680]  the false claims act to monopolize the vaccine market and eliminate vaccines that might have
[03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:36.160]  worked better you understand the importance of this so there might have been competitors vaccines
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:42.480]  that actually had higher efficacy because the vaccine does offer some level of immunization
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:47.840]  on some people some of the time but it contains lots of toxic chemicals toxic aluminum adjuvants
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:53.840]  and squalene and antibiotics and in some vaccines a board of human fetal tissue cell lines by the way
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:58.560]  and so it's those things that make the vaccine even more dangerous but there could have been
[03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:03.520]  vaccines on the market that actually worked better than the merc vaccine but because of merc's
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:08.960]  alleged scientific fraud those vaccines were pushed out of the marketplace and the dominant
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:15.360]  vaccine that was released into america was the vaccine that did not work and this is contributing
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:20.880]  to the outbreak according to these two virologists who filed this false claims act they say that this
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:26.400]  has been been going on this vaccine fraud has been going on since the 1990s they say that
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:34.080]  here's another big science issue on this they say that the testing was done against laboratory
[03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:38.640]  measles and laboratory mumps strains which are different from the real world strains that are
[03:37:39.280 --> 03:37:46.640]  circulating in the wild so even if a vaccine in the lab can show high efficacy effectiveness
[03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:51.920]  against the laboratory measles strain the strain out in the wild it can be totally different
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:58.800]  so that same vaccine can fail in the real world population because it's all a hoax people it's
[03:37:58.800 --> 03:38:06.320]  all a fraud and then on top of that you have of course now the government is essentially allowing
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:11.040]  or elements of the government not trump but other elements that hate america are allowing these
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:17.680]  disease infested illegals to cross the border to be deposited even transported and placed in
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:24.000]  cities across america even after they've been exposed to measles and tuberculosis and smallpox
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:29.840]  and influenza and perhaps the the candida fungal superbug that we talked about a couple of weeks
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:36.080]  ago all these mysterious crazy diseases are being deposited in cities all across america
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:42.640]  at the same time that the vaccine is fraudulent and doesn't work and you you combine these two
[03:38:42.640 --> 03:38:47.600]  things what do you get you get massive outbreaks you get infectious diseases spreading all across
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:53.840]  the country and of course the media blames anti-vaxxers the media blames anti-vaxxers the
[03:38:53.840 --> 03:38:58.400]  media doesn't blame the fraudulent science behind the vaccines in the first first place the media
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:03.600]  doesn't blame the the illegals or the the border policies that allow those illegals to come into
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:10.960]  the united states they blame americans they blame homeschoolers they blame patriots they blame
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:16.640]  black americans who are rightfully skeptical of the false promises of the government when it
[03:39:16.640 --> 03:39:23.040]  comes to injecting their bodies with experimental medicinal substances tuskegee anyone does that
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:29.680]  ring a bell you know what it is actually the black community in america that is refusing vaccines
[03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:35.360]  and they are smart to do it because they know the history of how their people were rounded up
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:42.160]  and were subjected to illegal inhumane medical experiments you know to create science and
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:47.920]  medicine i guess with government funded studies black folks were used and abused at like guinea
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:52.880]  pigs by the medical system and the vaccines that are being put out there today are no different
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:40:00.640]  it's a mass medical experiment on everybody but i tell you it's you know what's funny to me is you
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:08.160]  have these highly educated so-called high IQ white academics out there who have phd's and
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:12.080]  master's degrees and their doctors and they say oh no vaccines are perfectly safe and effective i
[03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:17.280]  did the research they're like well where did you do the research oh on google really you mean google
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:22.720]  that that censors all the real information about vaccines that's where you did your research and you
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:28.400]  what you think you're intelligent no you are misinformed you are scientifically illiterate
[03:40:28.400 --> 03:40:33.600]  and that's the way a lot of white people are i mean i hate to bring race into it but for some
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:39.520]  reason it's like white folks who are academics these like liberal white academics they just believe
[03:40:39.520 --> 03:40:44.240]  anything their doctor tells them here take vioxx oh oops 10 years later it's going to kill you
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:48.640]  oh here take statin drugs oh guess what you're going to get you know muscle fatigue and it might
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:54.320]  kill you too oh here take these vaccines 10 years later oh it turns out there were cancer viruses
[03:40:54.320 --> 03:41:00.640]  and those vaccines that too bad that you got injected with all that stuff it's incredible but
[03:41:01.840 --> 03:41:08.000]  continuing with the false claims act document these murk virologist said that this entire fraud
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:14.880]  took place quote this is an exact quote with the knowledge authority and approval of murk's senior
[03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:21.680]  management that murk was completely they they were involved in this they ordered it they destroyed
[03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:26.400]  the evidence according to this claim and that they knew that the vaccine they were putting out into
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:34.560]  the wild would not work and it's all by design because a failed vaccine promotes more outbreaks
[03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:41.920]  that causes media hysteria that causes more oblivious people to run out and get vaccinated
[03:41:41.920 --> 03:41:46.240]  so that the retailers and the pharmacies buy more vaccines and what do you know just saw the news
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:53.360]  yesterday record vaccine sales for all the vaccine manufacturers in america mission accomplished
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:42:00.320]  they're making money off of medical terrorism and scientific fraud because the vaccines don't work
[03:42:00.320 --> 03:42:05.920]  you know what does work you know it really works to stop all these infectious disease or most of them
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:13.360]  good nutrition vitamin d and actually having a good night's rest your immune system is stronger
[03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:20.080]  when you have good sleep when you are less stressful when you have good nutrition these
[03:42:20.080 --> 03:42:26.480]  vitamins and nutrients and superfoods that boost immune function these are what can save us from
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:32.160]  infectious diseases and let's protect the borders let's stop allowing disease-infested

[03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:51.280]  so i'm glad you plugged it in four store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[03:46:57.200 --> 03:46:59.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:03.840]  go
[03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:15.280]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[03:47:18.560 --> 03:47:26.480]  the new world order's annihilation agenda is ramping up this is a story on zero hedge today
[03:47:26.480 --> 03:47:34.800]  that actually it's interesting it it quotes max slavo from shtfplan.com who quotes my article
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:41.120]  on this so the original of course is on natural news but the and i think info wars publish it
[03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:47.440]  as well the reason this is important to understand is because if you're trying to make sense of the
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:52.720]  world you're trying to understand why is the media what why have they been ordered to push so much
[03:47:52.720 --> 03:47:58.640]  hatred why are they declaring war on for example white people why are they trying to pit christians
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:06.800]  against muslims why are they touting certain types of violence like um embracing antifa
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:11.920]  violence against people for example but then denouncing other types of violence what's going on
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:18.560]  the correct way to see the world in my view or i mean you you can decide what's the correct way
[03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:25.360]  but my suggestion is if you understand that it's all about the annihilation of the human race then
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:30.880]  everything starts to make sense everything starts to click into place you look at the geoengineering
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:35.360]  what are they trying to do they're trying to dim sunlight to have less sunlight reaching
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:40.480]  food crops so that there's a food collapse and a famine and mass starvation across the world
[03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:47.920]  why are liberal cities collapsing into homelessness and destitution and soon outbreaks of all kinds
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:52.400]  of infectious diseases because of all the feces and needles that are littering the streets in
[03:48:52.400 --> 03:48:57.840]  places like los angeles and san francisco and seattle well it's because this is part of the
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:03.120]  plan these are not accidents the hatred pushed by the media every day is not an accident the
[03:49:03.120 --> 03:49:10.160]  toxicity of the vaccines is not an accident it's all on purpose it's all designed to eliminate
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:18.880]  humankind and it brings me back to this life-site news story from 2014 that cited the mass sterilization
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:26.560]  exercise as canyon doctors find anti fertility agent it's a chemical called hcg in un approved
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:35.760]  tetanus vaccines so look africa is the experimental weapons testing ground for everything that the
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:41.680]  globalists are doing to try to eliminate humankind this is why ebola strains get out of control
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:46.240]  sometimes accidentally released or sometimes released on purpose in various african nations
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:52.320]  the vaccines being deliberately tainted with spontaneous abortion chemicals and infertility
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:59.920]  chemicals they're tested on young african women in kenya and this was actually exposed by a pro
[03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:06.160]  vaccine group a kenyan bishop organization a catholic group that runs around vaccinating women
[03:50:06.160 --> 03:50:11.200]  in kenya and they started to notice that all these young women they were having spontaneous
[03:50:11.200 --> 03:50:15.280]  abortions after they got the vaccine or they weren't able to get pregnant for many many months
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:21.600]  afterwards and so these kenyan catholic bishops sent those vaccines to laboratories to have them
[03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:25.600]  tested and those laboratories i think it was four different labs confirmed that they contained
[03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:33.440]  this spontaneous abortion or sterilization chemical and then you go back to 1971 and i covered this
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:41.360]  extensively in a documentary called the science agenda to exterminate blacks where i expose all
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:46.880]  this it's like an hour-long lecture i did i don't know a year and a half ago back in 1971
[03:50:46.880 --> 03:50:52.640]  the science advisor to then president richard nixon who's just sort of part of the what we
[03:50:52.640 --> 03:50:57.360]  would call today the conservative establishment had suggested that all the food being exported
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:51:02.160]  from the united states to third world nations including africa central and south america
[03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:08.240]  that all that food be intentionally laced with sterilization chemicals and this was actually
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:13.680]  published by the new york times and my story in my my lecture cites the new york times uh the new
[03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:18.480]  york times i mean you can find us i don't have a link for you right this moment but if you search
[03:51:18.480 --> 03:51:23.600]  on naturalnews.com you'll you'll find this you'll find the lecture the new york times covered this
[03:51:23.600 --> 03:51:30.080]  and this was a very serious agenda to try to cause global infertility it mirrors the kind
[03:51:30.080 --> 03:51:34.480]  of thing that bill gates is funding now with the bill and melinda gates foundation with for
[03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:42.320]  example ultrasound infertility by subjecting a man's scrotum to high intensity ultrasound
[03:51:42.320 --> 03:51:50.000]  found which disables sperm production and this is this is an actual you know infertility technology
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:55.360]  that's been funded by the the bill and melinda gates foundation in addition to the mosquitoes
[03:51:55.360 --> 03:52:01.680]  probably airborne biological weapon delivery system that's going to deliver viral strains or
[03:52:01.680 --> 03:52:07.040]  or bacteria or chemicals that cause infertility as well one of these days soon you won't even
[03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:12.160]  have a choice i mean right now they can they can say there's an outbreak and they can say go get
[03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:17.680]  a vaccine they can lace the vaccines with spontaneous abortion chemical chemicals they did this in in
[03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:24.160]  africa but in the future they can get you just by releasing mosquitoes in your town you won't
[03:52:24.160 --> 03:52:30.400]  you're not even consenting at that point and note that this this whole idea of of informed
[03:52:30.400 --> 03:52:36.160]  consent is being obliterated anyway in new york city with a de Blasio there and also with i think
[03:52:36.160 --> 03:52:41.280]  it's a rockland county new york with their ed day i think is the the name of the guy there who put
[03:52:41.280 --> 03:52:47.680]  in this vaccine medical martial law order what new york is saying is that you don't own your body
[03:52:48.400 --> 03:52:53.200]  that we the government can force you to be injected with any chemical that we label the vaccine
[03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:58.160]  it doesn't even matter what's in it they could forcibly inject you with something that has a
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:02.640]  radiological chemicals they could forcibly inject you with spontaneous abortion chemicals
[03:53:02.640 --> 03:53:07.520]  they could inject you with euthanasia chemicals as long as they call it a vaccine the courts are
[03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:15.120]  now upholding the the power of government to penetrate your body carrying out what can only be
[03:53:15.120 --> 03:53:21.200]  characterized as a form of medical rape in new york and it's spreading everywhere it's in california
[03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:26.400]  as well in california they're medically raping children with sb-277 but in new york they're
[03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:32.480]  medically raping adults as well and they're they're also demanding the medical rape of
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:38.480]  orthodox jews in the jewish communities in new york and upstate new york i mean this is happening
[03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:45.200]  i mean i hate to bring in this language but this is happening they are medically raping americans
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:52.160]  and the liberal judges and the vaccine sellouts are forcing this on people they are penetrating
[03:53:52.160 --> 03:53:59.520]  your body and it's being pushed by the same people who claim that you know pro-abortion people
[03:53:59.520 --> 03:54:04.480]  who say that your body is your choice right that the government has no right to dictate what happens
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:08.800]  to your body that's what they say but then when it comes to vaccines they say oh your body isn't
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:14.560]  your choice anymore you have to be vaccinated against your will against informed consent even
[03:54:14.560 --> 03:54:21.920]  if the vaccines are based on outright medical fraud as we showed here the fraud at merc as
[03:54:21.920 --> 03:54:28.880]  claimed by former merc virologist the massive organized fraud to conceal the truth about the
[03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:36.160]  fact that those vaccines don't work this it all coalesces into the the big big picture
[03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:43.840]  which is an engineered global genocidal holocaust that is a thousand times bigger than the holocaust
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:49.760]  from world war two in that holocaust they exterminated according to historical records
[03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:57.440]  six million jews today they plan to exterminate six billion humans jews and christians and muslims
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:02.720]  and everybody black people and white people alike six billion it's a thousand times bigger
[03:55:02.720 --> 03:55:10.000]  than the holocaust it's a thousand holocausts and they've already put the steps in place and i i gotta
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:18.720]  say this is why the survival of info wars is absolutely crucial because what i do here i fight
[03:55:18.720 --> 03:55:23.200]  for team humanity and that's why i'm here because i know alex is fighting for humanity as well
[03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:28.880]  it's like we no longer even care about our own personal survival so much we care about the survival
[03:55:28.880 --> 03:55:35.680]  of the human race we are sort of the human defense initiative or something hdi you know human defense
[03:55:35.680 --> 03:55:42.320]  initiative we want humanity to survive to make it to reach for the stars and the only way that we
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:47.840]  can achieve that is to defend humanity against this incredible assault that's targeting the human
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:54.160]  race for annihilation and extermination and it's not it's not a conspiracy theory it's not some
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:00.720]  you know it's it's not just some science fiction movie it's like the worst science fiction dystopian
[03:56:00.720 --> 03:56:06.560]  future that you can imagine has become real it's worse than soylent green you know again in washington
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:11.760]  state they they're now legalizing the composting of human bodies to recycle them back into the food
[03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:18.000]  supply it's called bio sludge i did a whole documentary on that called bio sludged and they're
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:23.280]  going to feed you essentially food grown in the dead bodies of the people that they killed with
[03:56:23.280 --> 03:56:27.840]  their vaccines the people that they killed with pharmaceutical contamination and exposure the
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:32.480]  people that have been killed by the heavy metals contamination of food supply the geoengineering
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:36.880]  you know you can call it chemtrails you can call it geoengineering whatever you want to call it
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:42.800]  all these vectors of pollution and contamination are creating a toxic world that's killing humanity
[03:56:42.800 --> 03:56:48.480]  and it's all on purpose and the vaccines are part of it and the medicine is part of it and the human
[03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:55.120]  composting is just going to allow for the efficient elimination of all the human corpses that they plan
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:57:02.480]  in the cities across america seattle will become a death zone san francisco will be a death landscape
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:09.440]  ocasio-cortez's green new deal should be called green new death she plans to eliminate carbon
