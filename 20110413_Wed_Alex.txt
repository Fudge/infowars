[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:33.000]  well we've got a power pack transmission for you lined up today obviously the
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.160]  information coming out of Fukushima is off the chart serious Europe has come out
[00:39.160 --> 00:45.240]  and said do not drink the milk do not eat the vegetables that have been grown
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.520]  recently because wave after wave of low-level radiation fallout is building
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.120]  up and we're now a month into this and after a month of it building up in
[00:57.120 --> 01:04.040]  crops and building up on grass that cows eat don't eat it because it will
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.640]  contribute to cancer it will contribute to your overall lifetime dose of
[01:09.640 --> 01:17.000]  radiation that you're gonna get and as Dr. Busby said yesterday as Dr. Bowman
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.600]  said yesterday as well that's just background radiation and the general
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.480]  fallout if you're unlucky enough to breathe a particle that got picked up
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.440]  by the winds that bumped into uranium and plutonium and that goes in your nose
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.680]  into your lungs they're not gonna know why you get lung cancer at 25 if you're
[01:34.680 --> 01:39.320]  20 years old now and you died five years at 25 they'll just be well you got a
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.440]  lung cancer and that's the big issue here this stuff is raining down all over
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.240]  the world radiation from Fukushima has now circled the entire globe and showed
[01:49.240 --> 01:58.520]  up in South Korea in China where it basically began in Japan four weeks and
[01:58.520 --> 02:04.760]  what three days ago four days ago so we're gonna be breaking all of that down
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.120]  today obviously that the whole TSA situation has kicked off again because
[02:10.120 --> 02:16.040]  the Drudge Report basically sets the news agenda thank God he covers real
[02:16.040 --> 02:22.320]  issues and his little six-year-old being groped between her legs the ladies
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.720]  grabbing her hard going inner pants and then taking her away to quote be drug
[02:27.720 --> 02:33.160]  tested very bizarre well our parents have now gone ABC news and it's now in
[02:33.160 --> 02:40.840]  hundreds of newspapers we first listener sent it to us two days ago on
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.600]  Monday we got it up drudge picked it up Tuesday morning and broke it to the
[02:45.600 --> 02:52.240]  world and now it's a big story and people are saying why are babies being
[02:52.240 --> 03:00.040]  molested being groped why are children you know you have a sworn peace officer
[03:00.040 --> 03:04.720]  who's bonded and been trained by the state and duly empowered through the
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.840]  legislature of the elected representatives say in the state of
[03:07.840 --> 03:13.320]  Texas or Vermont or wherever you live if a cop randomly tried to just start
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.520]  sticking their hands down people's pants they go to prison only an emergency
[03:18.520 --> 03:23.240]  situation if a cop saw somebody shove a pistol in their pants and they tackle
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.080]  them yes then in that emergency situation they could reach in there and get
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.880]  the pistol but you cannot do that just randomly with a bunch of minimum wage
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.080]  workers and everybody knows it the feds are trying to set this precedent and
[03:38.080 --> 03:40.880]  they're not going to get away with it and we're gonna be breaking that down
[03:40.880 --> 03:47.800]  today also I'm really sad to announce that Wayne Madsen is going the way it
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.600]  looks like a Bob Chapman having to leave the United States and if you think
[03:51.600 --> 03:55.440]  these threats aren't serious the feds tried to plant hand grenades on Bob
[03:55.440 --> 04:02.160]  Chapman you can pull up the cases they tried to frame him for other things and
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.040]  he had to leave the country I guess a decade ago or more and Wayne Madsen a
[04:08.040 --> 04:13.520]  Navy veteran submarine warfare specialist then with the NSA you know
[04:13.520 --> 04:17.320]  written for the Washington Post you name it he has been told and that's how it
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.960]  works through the intelligence agency grapevine that the White House is gonna
[04:22.960 --> 04:27.600]  kill him dead or in a hammer if he doesn't shut up and they may still kill
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.280]  him even if he shuts up now that's kind of how it works because he went to
[04:32.280 --> 04:35.520]  Chicago for a couple months digging up stuff on him and they just said look
[04:35.520 --> 04:40.160]  we're the mafia we're gonna kill you I mean Wayne you hadn't heard the New
[04:40.160 --> 04:47.400]  World Order said we don't let Chicago and send their lunches for their kids we
[04:47.400 --> 04:51.160]  are gonna take all of America over with a Chicago model you don't talk about us
[04:51.160 --> 04:55.920]  so he's been given the word they're gonna kill him White House's got a head
[04:55.920 --> 05:01.480]  out on Wayne Madsen when we got him coming on to my folks this is Alex Jones
[05:01.480 --> 05:05.360]  asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about so not detergents but

[07:00.000 --> 07:03.480]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.320]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.320 --> 07:11.560]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.840]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.200]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.200 --> 07:24.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.920 --> 07:36.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[07:36.680 --> 07:40.720]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.440]  really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my
[07:48.400 --> 07:52.520]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government

[07:58.800 --> 08:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.080 --> 08:19.600]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.600 --> 08:28.120]  alex jones all right my friends it is Wednesday the 13th day of April 2011
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.920]  we're gonna be live here for the next three hours Lindsay Williams joined us
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.840]  for an hour last week to join us for another hour day coming up the second
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.920]  hour to take your phone calls your questions for Lindsay Williams coming
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.240]  up because now we see the headlines of they're talking about the next month
[08:46.240 --> 08:53.240]  five dollar a gallon gas on average at the gas pump gas prices of course have
[08:53.240 --> 08:57.280]  gone up and up as oil prices per barrel have gone up they went back a little bit
[08:57.280 --> 09:01.520]  yesterday but are starting their march back upwards again if you look at the
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.400]  graph it's basically going straight up but there are little dips before it
[09:06.400 --> 09:11.440]  starts retracing its previous gains so we've got Lindsay Williams joining us
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.600]  coming up in the next hour in the last 30 minutes of the third hour Wayne Madsen
[09:17.600 --> 09:21.600]  formerly with the National Security Agency written for the Washington post
[09:21.600 --> 09:27.440]  you name it RT contributor of the Wayne Madsen report I'm glad jaren pointed
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.080]  this out to me because I checked the Madsen report every few days but I guess
[09:31.080 --> 09:35.040]  I had in the last four or five days because he put a report out last week
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.960]  that through the grapevine and his sources and I found to be a very credible
[09:38.960 --> 09:47.200]  source that he spent months in Chicago off and on in the last six months or so
[09:47.200 --> 09:55.360]  investigating Rahm Emanuel, Rod Golbojevic, Bogojevic, Barack Obama and the
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.680]  other gaggle of slime balls and he's ferreted out some really powerful info
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.600]  and he's been basically breaking it as he gets it and he was told that basically
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.320]  they've put a hit out on it now that's not confirmed the White House didn't
[10:13.320 --> 10:16.840]  come out and make that announcement obviously the White House doesn't have
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.720]  to do it themselves they've got the Chicago mafia that's run Chicago for at
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.600]  least a hundred years basically blackmailing them and controlling them
[10:24.600 --> 10:31.160]  and it is very creepy that multiple times now I've been sent Rahm Emanuel for
[10:31.160 --> 10:38.680]  mayor stickers to our office even though this address is not known so it's also a
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.640]  little message Rahm Emanuel is the type of guy who sends dead fish wrapped in
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.600]  newspapers to members of Congress he doesn't like that's a Sicilian message
[10:47.600 --> 10:53.360]  for you will sleep with the fishes means you're gonna be down there with the
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.480]  dead fish he's on the bottom of the lake and he's on record sending out dead fish
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.760]  to people he also a congressional closed-door meetings with congressional
[11:02.760 --> 11:09.560]  leaders likes to pull out knives in one well-documented case when he was in the
[11:09.560 --> 11:13.200]  Clinton administration and people that didn't go along with his orders he began
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.000]  to read out their names and then stab the table screaming dead dead dead dead in
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.680]  front of congressional leaders also in public in meetings he has bossed Obama
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.480]  around and I mean he's just a complete monster and that's why he's the new
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.000]  Chicago mob boss there so Wayne Madsen will be joining us and and Wayne
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.040]  Madsen was the fellow who helped us get to DC madam on when she was living in
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.240]  DC and then she had been convicted in court was going to be sent away to
[11:49.240 --> 11:55.720]  prison she was just trying to leave the country but they were worried about the
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.400]  list of high-power Republicans predominantly a Democrat she had and I
[12:00.400 --> 12:03.920]  knew it was so dangerous that I would never even allow her knowing the phones
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.320]  were tapped to tell me information off air I did not want to know any of it
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.240]  unless it was on air because once it's on air you're just playing Russian roulette
[12:14.240 --> 12:21.520]  with maybe six six chambers with one bullet I mean there's a good chance that
[12:21.520 --> 12:27.680]  they might still kill you if you did put that info out with big names but to know
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.480]  the information and not put it out is a death sentence and I gave her the
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.240]  opportunity on air a few months before she was murdered I said listen you've
[12:37.240 --> 12:45.640]  got all these names this information you better either let the establishment
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.960]  know and I told her she could do that any phone conversation she had they're
[12:49.960 --> 12:52.600]  listening just explain that she was going to destroy it all it wasn't going to
[12:52.600 --> 12:58.000]  talk about it or I told her you need to go public with it all right now and she
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  was getting ready to go to prison she told her condo manager at her Florida
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.040]  condo where she lived part of the year between DC we interviewed him on air of
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.600]  course after she was murdered murdered suicided they claimed she committed
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.360]  suicide that men were following her and that she had to get documents over to
[13:19.360 --> 13:26.680]  her mother's house well she was found hung in the shed and of course there
[13:26.680 --> 13:32.120]  were no documents and the handwriting I was sent her handwriting from the
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.160]  suicide note and also talked to some of the Florida detectives involved and I
[13:37.160 --> 13:44.640]  was sent her lease documents and the T's the eyes the L's it was not her
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.520]  handwriting it was as if a 10-year-old was trying to copy mama's handwriting
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.640]  for a note to the school nurse when they've been playing hooky and of course
[13:55.640 --> 14:02.040]  I forged a couple of fake letters to the nurse that actually worked when I was a
[14:02.040 --> 14:06.520]  teenager but still if you knew what you were looking at you know if my mother
[14:06.520 --> 14:12.560]  would have seen the notes to the nurse she could have surmised immediately that
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.720]  that that I had forged it of course she would also know that she hadn't filled
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.520]  them out but it was it was shoddily done and I told her I said you need to tell
[14:21.520 --> 14:24.320]  people you're not going to commit suicide she said absolutely I would never
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.040]  commit suicide I will never commit suicide I will go to prison I will get
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.640]  out I will live my life but I can't believe these hypocrites I kept my
[14:31.640 --> 14:36.680]  mouth shut and I said we'll just be clear about it and I said I would advise
[14:36.680 --> 14:39.960]  you to either go public with all this to the mainstream media now I said don't
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.400]  even do it with me I don't even want this information it's not that I'm even
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.880]  overall afraid of dying I don't want to get killed over exposing what hookers
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.600]  DC people visit and I'm not saying that's a good thing but that's nothing
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.240]  compared to killing a million Iraqis using depleted uranium with the troops
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.680]  stealing trillions of dollars stealing the troops death benefits I got bigger
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.760]  fish to fry but I would still interview the DC madam and Darren breaks talking
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.480]  to her John Harmon remembers listening to she we called her on the Genesis
[15:12.480 --> 15:15.720]  phone system and then Harmon was listening in with us and I was like
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.520]  don't tell me anything I don't want to talk to you she wanted to talk to me
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.400]  during breaks she's like I don't know why they're doing this I've kept my mouth
[15:22.400 --> 15:27.480]  shut and I'm like I don't want to hear it do not tell me anything nothing
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.840]  nothing they will come and kill me no no these people will kill you in a second
[15:33.840 --> 15:40.080]  do you know how many state police how many private detectives hired by
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.440]  Republicans people connected to Roger Ailes and others that they sent into
[15:44.440 --> 15:52.360]  Arkansas in 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 do you know how
[15:52.360 --> 15:59.080]  many died the Clinton death list that the full list is about 350 or so but for
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.200]  police investigators being killed it's more than 12 and you go back and pull
[16:04.200 --> 16:07.680]  those numbers up I mean they would they would take state police that had
[16:07.680 --> 16:11.000]  witnessed Clinton doing corrupt things and shoot them in the back of the head
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.880]  they would take investigators and shoot them and cut their arms and legs off and
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.160]  say they committed suicide they would kill teenagers that had witnessed things
[16:18.160 --> 16:25.960]  they would they would kill women I mean they just it was just an endless string
[16:25.960 --> 16:32.440]  of carnage and now you see I said I was gonna get to the news but I'm already
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.520]  getting into the fact that Wayne Madsen says through very credible sources he's
[16:36.520 --> 16:45.680]  been told that the system is going to try to whacking and you know the
[16:45.680 --> 16:51.160]  messages are basically you've gone too far buddy you're gonna pay for this and
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.400]  that's why Wayne needs to get out every bit of information he discovered in
[16:56.400 --> 17:00.960]  Chicago now because as a journalist he continues to try to vet things he
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.440]  continues to try to double check triple check check with other sources and it's
[17:05.440 --> 17:11.440]  the dossier he's put together on things going on in Chicago that he's already
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.440]  begun to cover a little bit that puts him in such danger and this isn't a joke
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.760]  I mean Wayne could be dead within days it could be dead next week and if he's

[24:08.000 --> 24:13.240]  the federal government is like a vending machine for the global mafia I
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.160]  thought the new world order is they pay off state and national governments
[24:18.160 --> 24:24.000]  worldwide regional governments to sign over government power for huge payoffs
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.600]  to these private corporate mafia groups and they use mercenaries they use NATO
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.160]  they use the US military they use hit men on the ground and there is no amount
[24:36.160 --> 24:43.120]  of abuse that they will not dump out on us until we say no you see
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.880]  at a certain point in corruption the bottom falls out and the criminals
[24:47.880 --> 24:52.080]  learn that they can get away with anything and they go wild that's why the
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.960]  TSA federal goon force is expanding currently it's not coming it's all over
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.560]  the streets of America from Houston Texas to Dallas Texas to Miami Florida to
[25:02.560 --> 25:09.000]  Boston mass to Chicago Illinois to Los Angeles California New York rural areas
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.600]  bizarre homeland security regular Army National Guard Air Force MPs checkpoint
[25:15.600 --> 25:20.480]  searching people Marines searching I mean they're here it's on they're letting
[25:20.480 --> 25:26.840]  you know hey line up give us your IDs we're searching you this is martial law
[25:26.840 --> 25:33.560]  they're just easing us into it and that's why all over the country the TSA
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.920]  first says over all in a naked-body scan some people at some airports then they
[25:37.920 --> 25:41.680]  come out and tell the AP and Chicago Tribune last year we are going to phase
[25:41.680 --> 25:45.080]  it in for everybody then people say we don't want the naked-body scanners and
[25:45.080 --> 25:48.680]  they say well then we're going to grope you and internal memos come out where
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.800]  they say it's meant to intimidate people and make them use the scanners now
[25:52.800 --> 25:55.320]  they've come out and announced actually we're going to put everybody through the
[25:55.320 --> 25:59.480]  scanners and grope you and that's what we now learn happened to the six-year-old
[25:59.480 --> 26:03.720]  girl that we first started reporting on on Monday who got the two-minute grope
[26:03.720 --> 26:08.560]  down with the TSA woman sticking her hands in her pants between her crotch
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.880]  grabbing her that's what Ron Paul Ventura and countless others have
[26:12.880 --> 26:15.960]  described that it's almost like they're trying to lift you up I mean they don't
[26:15.960 --> 26:22.640]  just touch you they get there and they mmm let me make sure what that is and if
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.800]  you don't like it they say get out of this airport and then when they trick
[26:26.800 --> 26:30.680]  you they slap handcuffs on you and say federal law you're not allowed to refuse
[26:30.680 --> 26:36.600]  the screening $11,000 fine we're mafia we run this country now everything is
[26:36.600 --> 26:39.920]  ours we're gonna raise your property taxes your income taxes we're gonna
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.000]  devalue the dollar we're gonna rob everything we got paramilitary federalized
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.680]  police waiting if you try to resist it's ours you don't pack lunches for your

[26:52.280 --> 26:57.560]  play tag they're prisoners you're gonna use IDs to buy and sell we own you we
[26:57.560 --> 27:05.120]  run you it's totally about breaking our will run by the social engineers we're
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.600]  gonna go to break but I get constant emails constant canned comments by TSA
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.920]  minions and others in the YouTube videos and things that are posted they go look
[27:14.920 --> 27:19.000]  if she just go through the scanner she wouldn't have had to be groped no they
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  are going to universal groping after the scanning and I told you what I saw in a
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.240]  San Jose flying out last year and I sat there as we were early for 25 minutes I
[27:29.240 --> 27:31.880]  bought coffee right through the checkpoint they had a coffee place I
[27:31.880 --> 27:38.440]  bought coffee with Aaron Dykes and sat there for 25 minutes watching and they
[27:38.440 --> 27:45.280]  only only only had women and children sent through the scanners and then they
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.160]  were given a grope and I came back and reported I saw them sticking their hands
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.560]  in the waistbands and grabbing the genitals and people couldn't believe it
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.800]  and then Michelle comes running up and says well you know I just got back from
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.560]  a week of vacation in Colorado I said yeah with your two daughters she said
[28:00.560 --> 28:06.120]  yeah eight-year-old and year-old and she said they did that to us and they had
[28:06.120 --> 28:08.800]  men doing it and then of course drudge picked that up and people couldn't
[28:08.800 --> 28:12.320]  believe it and then countless reporters that it had happened to who were well
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.040]  known came on said no it happened to me happened to my daughter happened to my
[28:16.040 --> 28:21.280]  son that they're doing it to babies they're taking babies out of baby carriages
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.520]  and grabbing them and these babies can be wearing diapers they're going in those
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.560]  diapers and it's all about training you that you're a total prisoner ladies and
[28:32.560 --> 28:36.000]  gentlemen if you ever go to prison when they get you off the bus they're gonna
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.800]  take you in pull your pants off do a script search if it's medium security
[28:39.800 --> 28:45.000]  you're up to break your will and that's all this is in America you are being
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.960]  trained to be a prisoner people who've never been into crime who are law abiding
[28:48.960 --> 28:56.480]  good producing creative citizens they are being taught just like the public
[28:56.480 --> 29:02.520]  schools have shake downs and searches and strip searches and cameras watching
[29:02.520 --> 29:05.840]  the kids in the bathroom that's training the new generation on how to be
[29:05.840 --> 29:11.360]  prisoners and now they're doing to the general public and expanding out from
[29:11.360 --> 29:16.160]  the airports the good news is the people are resisting they're saying no and look
[29:16.160 --> 29:19.880]  I understand that all TSA workers are not bad people a lot of them shake my
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.480]  hand they want autographs everywhere I go but if they complain about doing this
[29:26.480 --> 29:32.080]  stuff they get fired and that's what the system wants because then they end up
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.480]  with cadres of people that'll do whatever they're told that there's no
[29:35.480 --> 29:40.920]  doubt a lot of control freaks a lot of perverts a lot of say no masochist a lot

[34:23.120 --> 34:26.120]  the problem of government spending of spite the fair mongering
[34:26.120 --> 34:30.000]  government shutdown would not have been as bad as claimed
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.920]  yeah they cut a little less than forty billion in stuff that was already agreed
[34:32.920 --> 34:34.000]  to be cut
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.880]  ladies and gentlemen uh... the banks of godness to sign on over a thousand
[34:36.880 --> 34:38.560]  trillion in derivatives
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.400]  nothing you get rid of nothing you cut will have even if you cut defense
[34:42.400 --> 34:43.600]  massively
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.040]  uh... none of it will even go towards beginning to pay down this debt until
[34:48.040 --> 34:51.320]  we say no to the thousand plus trillion
[34:51.320 --> 34:54.200]  that the bankers have created through fraud that they've gotten government
[34:54.200 --> 34:55.520]  sign on to
[34:55.520 --> 34:57.360]  and even if you don't believe economist
[34:57.360 --> 35:00.440]  like carplay and others we've had on the states one point five quadrillion
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.840]  washington post last year says it was six hundred and forty plus trillion
[35:05.840 --> 35:10.600]  ron paul went on to say it's encouraging that some in washington seem to be
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.560]  uh... insisting on
[35:12.560 --> 35:15.080]  reduced spending which is
[35:15.080 --> 35:18.240]  definitely a step in the right direction but only one step
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.200]  we have miles to go before we can even come close to a solution and it will
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.160]  involve completely redefining the role of government our lives and on the
[35:26.160 --> 35:27.480]  world stage
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.360]  a compromise was struck at the last minute until democrats agree to rein in
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.760]  entitlement spending and republicans
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.320]  back off the blank checks of the military industrial complex in all amounts to
[35:38.320 --> 35:39.680]  political
[35:39.680 --> 35:42.160]  gamesmanship
[35:42.160 --> 35:43.520]  and he goes on from there
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.080]  unfortunately the compromises always seem to be
[35:47.080 --> 35:51.120]  just the opposite instead on the left to bring to cut social spending on the
[35:51.120 --> 35:55.440]  right to bring to cut military spending the right agrees to more welfare and
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.600]  the left agrees
[35:56.600 --> 35:57.840]  to more warfare
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.560]  in spite of all this rhetoric
[36:01.560 --> 36:02.560]  we will go
[36:02.560 --> 36:03.920]  deeper into debt
[36:03.920 --> 36:07.320]  the fed will print more money the private fellow reserve and the value of the
[36:07.320 --> 36:09.040]  dollar will continue to plummet
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.120]  how long will it be before farner stop buying our debt will the fed already has
[36:13.120 --> 36:14.440]  to buy seventy percent of it
[36:14.440 --> 36:15.880]  and monetize it
[36:15.880 --> 36:19.440]  and hyperinflation arrives well ahead of walmart says it's already arriving
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.880]  throughout history empires of all ways over extended themselves
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.200]  their conquest and wealth transfers leading to eventual collapse from the
[36:27.200 --> 36:29.280]  roman empire to the soviet union
[36:29.280 --> 36:35.320]  we're headed in the same direction and it seems only the chaos of the collapse
[36:35.320 --> 36:38.120]  of the dollar will stop more spending
[36:38.120 --> 36:40.760]  arguing over funding for planned parenthood
[36:40.760 --> 36:41.920]  and mpr
[36:41.920 --> 36:42.960]  though important
[36:42.960 --> 36:46.880]  only shows that leadership in washington either won't face reality or
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.120]  don't understand
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.280]  how serious the problem is
[36:50.280 --> 36:52.880]  you can also hear the audio slash video
[36:52.880 --> 36:54.960]  of ronpol statement and there's more
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.440]  uh... that comes after that he says of course an actual government collapse
[36:58.440 --> 37:01.800]  would create serious problems for many people who have come to depend on
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.000]  government payments for their health care retirement income but that's all
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  been put into rivulancy and stolen
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.960]  their children's education even food and housing however
[37:09.960 --> 37:11.980]  the so-called entitlement programs
[37:11.980 --> 37:15.720]  are unconstitutional to begin with and have
[37:15.720 --> 37:19.440]  engineer the culture of dependence on wealth transfer payments that is out of
[37:19.440 --> 37:21.360]  control
[37:21.360 --> 37:22.760]  and he goes on from there
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.400]  very important article by ron paul at info wars dot com can also find the
[37:27.400 --> 37:29.040]  drug report left hand side
[37:29.040 --> 37:31.040]  the nanny state
[37:31.040 --> 37:32.840]  last
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.880]  well it can't last in its current form unless they fully implode they
[37:36.880 --> 37:40.240]  can sell people on even more taxes more regulations
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.280]  more welfare more control
[37:42.280 --> 37:46.240]  and complete dependence and then we'll be living in a full bore tyranny which
[37:46.240 --> 37:50.120]  is what the social engineers have been designing
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.720]  and this is what they want
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.760]  the central private banks want bankrupt nations
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.640]  just like i've done at the third world countries
[37:56.640 --> 38:01.160]  this is a system of economic conquest backed up by paramilitary police state
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.200]  system
[38:03.200 --> 38:06.520]  now going back into the tsa
[38:06.520 --> 38:10.240]  if you will put up with them putting you in a high-powered radiation baker
[38:10.240 --> 38:13.600]  which they now admit depending on which machine is twenty
[38:13.600 --> 38:15.240]  to fifty times
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.040]  what they previously said and i came out a few months ago in washington post
[38:19.040 --> 38:19.960]  that
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.480]  uh... tsa
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.960]  had refused to give congress the real elected government
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.480]  the radiation monitoring test they've done it turned out they hadn't done them
[38:28.480 --> 38:29.600]  at all airports
[38:29.600 --> 38:33.300]  under federal law they'd violated osha a lot of other uh...
[38:33.300 --> 38:35.720]  radiology laws that are federal and on the books
[38:35.720 --> 38:38.480]  that any dental office or clinic or hospital has to follow
[38:38.480 --> 38:40.640]  on a weekly basis not monthly
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.920]  but the numbers they did get from spot checking on average were ten times
[38:44.920 --> 38:47.960]  the radiation they'd even claimed
[38:47.960 --> 38:50.720]  because they're not calibrated correctly
[38:50.720 --> 38:52.360]  ten times the twenty
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.040]  the fifty times they lied about
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.000]  ten times the twenty to fifty times
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.480]  and you've got these tsa workers
[39:01.480 --> 39:03.880]  and the major we've had radiologists on to break it down
[39:03.880 --> 39:05.500]  sitting by the
[39:05.500 --> 39:08.720]  only partially shielded x-ray machines looking at your luggage
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.200]  then right next to him are the body scanners that backscatter and splatter
[39:13.200 --> 39:15.480]  radiation
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.360]  you add to that the cell phones
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.080]  the nuclear testing the fukushima's the
[39:20.080 --> 39:21.760]  chernobyl's
[39:21.760 --> 39:25.360]  i mean just from chernobyl twenty five years ago in eighty six
[39:25.360 --> 39:26.600]  the u s
[39:26.600 --> 39:30.320]  as well as a northern hemisphere has double the radiation of the southern
[39:30.320 --> 39:31.400]  hemisphere
[39:31.400 --> 39:35.440]  from one chernobyl chernobyl was dirty compared to even an a bomb
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.680]  it put off conservatively according to the i a e a four hundred times her a
[39:39.680 --> 39:41.720]  she must radiation
[39:41.720 --> 39:45.480]  now they admit fukushima is just as bad or worse
[39:45.480 --> 39:47.160]  and again we weren't
[39:47.160 --> 39:47.960]  being
[39:47.960 --> 39:51.240]  fair mongers a month ago when i said this is going to be as big as chernobyl
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.200]  because i went out and interviewed the top radiation experts the nuclear
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.320]  physicists the former head of the star wars project i went and did my research
[39:59.320 --> 40:02.600]  and when they would release radiation numbers from those two prefectures those
[40:02.600 --> 40:05.280]  two states that told you what was happening
[40:05.280 --> 40:07.560]  three weeks into it they did release the numbers
[40:07.560 --> 40:10.440]  seven point five million normal times
[40:10.440 --> 40:14.840]  being dumped normal radiation being dumped in the water
[40:14.840 --> 40:16.880]  new such powerful
[40:16.880 --> 40:19.440]  vision going on that there were visible
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.840]  i on being shooting out at night you could see blue light
[40:24.840 --> 40:27.720]  i mean that's a power radiation you see it
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.440]  now you pull up radiation sickness their hospitals have been filled for weeks
[40:31.440 --> 40:34.720]  but it's minor footnotes yes the hospitals are filled with those of what
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.400]  they believe is radiation poisoning and the doctors and nurses are refusing to
[40:37.400 --> 40:38.160]  treat them
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.560]  and are leaving because they don't want to be contaminated with their radiation
[40:42.560 --> 40:44.840]  one in telegraph two weeks ago
[40:44.840 --> 40:45.960]  but it's a minor
[40:45.960 --> 40:48.640]  footnote because in this mafia state
[40:48.640 --> 40:51.400]  why not tell the parents they can't pack their kids lunch because they're not
[40:51.400 --> 40:52.000]  trusted
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.120]  why not stick the government hands down the pants to train you
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.000]  steal the death benefits of the trip says they did eleven years ago and now
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  admit last year
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.080]  why not tell you that
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.280]  depending on the isotope one thousand to one hundred thousand times the levels
[41:06.280 --> 41:07.120]  they're raising
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.800]  the and and and and saying are safe
[41:09.800 --> 41:11.440]  why not
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.440]  me here's the news fukushima radiation tanks u.s milk supplies at levels three
[41:15.440 --> 41:18.520]  hundred times higher than e p a maximums
[41:18.520 --> 41:22.400]  and uh... natural news linked info wars dot com

[41:37.600 --> 41:41.080]  even though they've raised it from a five to a seven the highest level for a
[41:41.080 --> 41:42.480]  radioactive disaster
[41:42.480 --> 41:43.340]  at fukushima
[41:43.340 --> 41:46.560]  here's another one japan ups fukushima new crisis very good seven
[41:46.560 --> 41:48.440]  same as your noble
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.740]  here's another one
[41:49.740 --> 41:53.480]  elevated radiation levels found in ontario energy minister says up in
[41:53.480 --> 41:55.320]  canada the star reports
[41:55.320 --> 41:57.480]  here's another one
[41:57.480 --> 42:00.440]  and this is on major tv stations major
[42:00.440 --> 42:02.440]  newspapers in europe
[42:02.440 --> 42:03.800]  and again mike adams

[42:08.600 --> 42:12.520]  but you're not seeing this in our news you've got to go to info wars dot com
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.320]  or the drudge reporter natural news to find this information
[42:16.320 --> 42:19.480]  europeans warned to avoid milk and vegetables
[42:19.480 --> 42:24.320]  due to high radiation levels
[42:24.320 --> 42:26.600]  europe and let me explain
[42:26.600 --> 42:31.320]  the jet stream is going from west to east
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.040]  and so japan's on the other side of the world so it goes you know you think of
[42:35.040 --> 42:36.160]  it in the east
[42:36.160 --> 42:39.720]  it's actually going from the west of the east across the pacific across north
[42:39.720 --> 42:41.760]  america that's where we live
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.180]  over uh... atlantic
[42:44.180 --> 42:47.320]  over western europe eastern europe is now all the way through asia back to
[42:47.320 --> 42:48.120]  japan
[42:48.120 --> 42:50.260]  and in europe
[42:50.260 --> 42:53.840]  that is what more than ten thousand miles away
[42:53.840 --> 42:56.840]  guys pull up the numbers uh... england's distance
[42:56.840 --> 42:58.120]  uh...
[42:58.120 --> 43:00.840]  from west to east
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.280]  england's distance from uh... japan i want to get that number was a twelve
[43:04.280 --> 43:06.040]  thousand miles
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.080]  notes more than ten thousand
[43:08.080 --> 43:11.040]  so we're only three four thousand miles depending where you are on the coastline
[43:11.040 --> 43:14.640]  from japan it comes across the ocean and a radiation cloud
[43:14.640 --> 43:17.440]  shadows over the u.s belching
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.040]  nuclear fallout and complete meltdown
[43:21.040 --> 43:25.040]  in one reactor two weeks ago at seventy percent meltdown
[43:25.040 --> 43:27.920]  explosions all of this is belching it
[43:27.920 --> 43:31.200]  so bad they've pulled out the emergency cruise over and over again
[43:31.200 --> 43:35.560]  building up over the u.s and they're saying don't worry about your milk don't
[43:35.560 --> 43:38.520]  worry about your fish don't worry about your spinach don't worry about your
[43:38.520 --> 43:40.160]  lettuce don't worry about
[43:40.160 --> 43:43.880]  uh... your grapes grown in california but this stuff's in vermont this stuff's
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.280]  in new york it's in new jersey it's in florida every states coming out with
[43:48.280 --> 43:49.640]  numbers
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.360]  all of this is going on
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.600]  but europe is a lot further away
[43:55.600 --> 43:58.080]  what we could do is just pull up a world map that has a
[43:58.080 --> 44:00.160]  miles meter and then just kinda
[44:00.160 --> 44:03.000]  with a ruler with your hand
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.320]  you know three thousand six thousand nine thousand ten thousand you know it's
[44:07.320 --> 44:11.480]  don't find out from northeastern japan roughly how far it is to england and in
[44:11.480 --> 44:14.360]  the coast of europe
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.280]  western europe
[44:15.280 --> 44:17.800]  the point is europe is a lot further away
[44:17.800 --> 44:19.600]  from the fallout and they're saying
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.400]  their government saying like they did in eighty six
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.080]  uh... don't eat vegetables
[44:25.080 --> 44:26.840]  from the northern hemisphere
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.800]  don't eat grains from the northern hemisphere don't drink milk
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.640]  because that's where bio accumulates in our media is just like hey
[44:35.640 --> 44:36.720]  it's fine
[44:36.720 --> 44:40.160]  federal government's not releasing numbers state governments are
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.520]  europeans warned to avoid milk and vegetables due to high radiation levels
[44:44.520 --> 44:47.400]  the radiation risk regime is no longer negligible
[44:47.400 --> 44:50.440]  says the c-r-i-i-r-a-d
[44:50.440 --> 44:53.040]  the french research authority on radioactivity
[44:53.040 --> 44:54.040]  it is now
[44:54.040 --> 44:57.360]  warning expected mothers and young children because
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.960]  there's a many times more uh... devastating effect on fast-growing cells
[45:01.960 --> 45:06.320]  especially on fetuses and young children with radiation
[45:06.320 --> 45:08.920]  i was correct eleven thousand miles from
[45:08.920 --> 45:11.520]  japan going east
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.280]  not back west over eurasia
[45:13.280 --> 45:15.320]  but going east over the pacific
[45:15.320 --> 45:18.640]  uh... from japan to england thank you
[45:18.640 --> 45:21.720]  so we're three four thousand miles away on the west coast
[45:21.720 --> 45:25.640]  they're eleven thousand miles away and they're saying don't eat it
[45:25.640 --> 45:27.440]  especially if you're a pregnant mother
[45:27.440 --> 45:28.480]  or if you got a
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.360]  child
[45:30.360 --> 45:32.880]  so the french research authority of the government
[45:32.880 --> 45:36.520]  uh... is now warning expected mothers and young children to avoid drinking
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.120]  milk
[45:37.120 --> 45:38.560]  or rainwater
[45:38.560 --> 45:41.640]  they should also avoid certain types of vegetables
[45:41.640 --> 45:42.960]  and cheese
[45:42.960 --> 45:46.520]  due to the dangerously high levels of radiation they may contain
[45:46.520 --> 45:50.000]  thanks to the radioactive fallout spreading across the globe
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.680]  and it has a direct link to the french government radiation authority
[45:54.680 --> 45:56.960]  and they should know they got more reactors in the other country in the
[45:56.960 --> 45:57.600]  world
[45:57.600 --> 45:59.040]  japan's number two
[45:59.040 --> 46:00.840]  word number three
[46:00.840 --> 46:03.240]  russia's number four
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.960]  the french government now says that eating these items qualifies as risky
[46:06.960 --> 46:08.040]  behavior
[46:08.040 --> 46:09.000]  and yet
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.680]  in particular the same sentence the organization claims there's absolutely no
[46:11.680 --> 46:15.920]  need for anyone to take iodine tablets
[46:15.920 --> 46:17.600]  that's right there's no
[46:17.600 --> 46:20.440]  there's so much radiation the food that you probably shouldn't eat it
[46:20.440 --> 46:23.760]  but all that radiation is so harmless that you don't need to protect yourself
[46:23.760 --> 46:25.280]  with it from iodine
[46:25.280 --> 46:27.600]  well that's because there's so many different isotopes
[46:27.600 --> 46:30.720]  that in a way it's just doesn't even matter
[46:30.720 --> 46:32.920]  in a way i've got almost agree with them
[46:32.920 --> 46:35.760]  of course radioactive iodine is the biggest issue i mean
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.160]  we had dr buzz beyond three weeks ago he said
[46:38.160 --> 46:41.040]  uh... clearly this is going to go up several hundred times normal levels and
[46:41.040 --> 46:42.440]  he said if i had children
[46:42.440 --> 46:46.080]  in california or the west coast he said i would take it i would give them
[46:46.080 --> 46:47.360]  potassium iodine
[46:47.360 --> 46:50.120]  iodine i'm not saying that go to your own doctor
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.880]  go to your own nurse but that's what
[46:51.880 --> 46:53.480]  doctor buzzbee
[46:53.480 --> 46:55.600]  who's a radiation specialist said
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.120]  uh... again
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.640]  oh by the way we have his article
[46:59.640 --> 47:01.120]  and for some reason
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.960]  i don't see it in my radiation stack i may have missed it
[47:03.960 --> 47:06.960]  but it's curtain emos article top scientist says
[47:06.960 --> 47:10.160]  atomic explosions possible to see him we print that for me
[47:10.160 --> 47:12.240]  thank you guys
[47:12.240 --> 47:16.400]  okay so we have that information uh... going on
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.280]  mark uh...
[47:20.280 --> 47:24.200]  circus uh... there it's uh... info wars dot com writes an excellent article
[47:24.200 --> 47:26.880]  nuclear nightmare getting worship propaganda continues
[47:26.880 --> 47:28.880]  will cover more of this after the break
[47:28.880 --> 47:31.480]  i wanted to shift gears into the t s a
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.840]  how great it is to see the backlash kick back in we posted monday drudge
[47:34.840 --> 47:36.760]  carries a tuesday pushes out
[47:36.760 --> 47:38.080]  massively to everybody
[47:38.080 --> 47:39.720]  now it's all over the news
[47:39.720 --> 47:42.960]  but the parents are angry about this but not angry enough for like t s a is
[47:42.960 --> 47:44.280]  doing a great job but
[47:44.280 --> 47:46.720]  why do you need to do this to our six-year-old
[47:46.720 --> 47:49.760]  so uh... but but notice the key with the main reason i'm playing part of this
[47:49.760 --> 47:50.560]  newscast
[47:50.560 --> 47:53.400]  the whole things up on info wars dot com
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.200]  notice why i'm uh... of that they say here
[47:57.200 --> 48:03.280]  all we all went through the scanners but then they pulled her out for the pat down
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.600]  so understand people say well if you don't like i'm grabbing your genitals
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.880]  go through the scanner
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.200]  and you go all i have a choice roasting in the radiation baker being groped
[48:13.200 --> 48:14.040]  no
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.160]  i have witnessed it multiple airports only women and children
[48:18.160 --> 48:20.800]  i would have stood at liberty newark a few months ago
[48:20.800 --> 48:23.600]  i would have stood out of five six months ago or now more
[48:23.600 --> 48:26.720]  last year uh... in in san san jose
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.440]  only women and children
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.440]  all they found a lady on a walker looks like she's on death doorstep
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.960]  who you're in for some serious risking
[48:36.960 --> 48:39.240]  let's go ahead they're just meeting their quotas what's happening they don't
[48:39.240 --> 48:41.000]  like megas will argue
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.320]  on average more let's go ahead and play this newscast
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.560]  joining us now salina drexel and her husband dr toddrexel from their home
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.680]  in bowling green kentucky
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.560]  thank you very much for getting up and being like dangerous folks to be important
[48:53.560 --> 48:56.160]  for you to talk about this and
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.560]  could you just give us a little more background salina i know you also
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.080]  have a nine-year-old grace uh... two-year-old caroline they were with

[49:15.840 --> 49:17.200]  uh...
[49:17.200 --> 49:22.160]  we were selected to go through the the new screening procedures
[49:22.160 --> 49:24.600]  and i was was picked to go through
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.320]  pretty much everybody except the baby was was picked to go through
[49:28.320 --> 49:30.120]  uh... that the scanner
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.680]  and for some reason and i was selected for a pat down i can only
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.600]  speculated so i didn't get a lot of information
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.200]  although i did ask questions as to why i had lost she was being selected for
[49:40.200 --> 49:40.800]  pat

[49:47.920 --> 49:51.200]  generation to live in a giant prison grip

[50:04.760 --> 50:07.800]  uh... i i didn't really get a lot of information
[50:07.800 --> 50:12.560]  i did ask for alternatives i asked for her to be re-scanned and was refused
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.120]  uh... but they didn't give you any video tape it because
[50:16.120 --> 50:19.160]  they just refused and said they were going to do what they were going to do
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.080]  hit pause and uh...
[50:21.080 --> 50:24.880]  she requested the video tape it but they just said we're god outside the law you

[54:24.240 --> 54:28.200]  not knowledge at all that's common sense but for some people out there who are
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.080]  new listeners and don't understand this I want to explain it in very simple terms
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.440]  okay and it's as plain as the nose on your face or my face look in the mirror
[54:36.440 --> 54:41.920]  we are the problem we have allowed this tyranny to continue and expand and these
[54:41.920 --> 54:46.960]  tests we're giving these tests to see what we'll put up with next is going to
[54:46.960 --> 54:50.880]  be urine and blood and that's what they told the girl come over here now we're
[54:50.880 --> 54:54.480]  gonna drug test you and they're still not clear in the newscast what that was
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.680]  about that's why I want to talk to the family because ABC wasn't asking the
[54:58.680 --> 55:04.160]  right question we're gonna play the whole thing later next is urine blood or
[55:04.160 --> 55:07.760]  other tissue sample in England they're already pulling people over for regular
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.080]  speeding stops and taking a swab out of the cheek because some of the largest
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.760]  cells in the body are are in the cheek tissue on the inside of the mouth and
[55:15.760 --> 55:19.800]  they can lightly swab and get hundreds of them and they take that put it in a
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.680]  little dish with your name close it up put it in a DNA file just like I told
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.280]  just 16 years ago because I was sent the secret documents from San Antonio from
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.400]  a nurse working at a military base they were taking all babies blood at birth
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.640]  and putting it in a UN database Cold Springs Harbor is one facility but also
[55:36.640 --> 55:41.920]  in San Antonio Texas now the last two years everything I said everything the
[55:41.920 --> 55:45.240]  documents stated what do you think I was had fake documents people thought they
[55:45.240 --> 55:51.600]  were you know they had phone numbers on them see they take your babies blood at
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.440]  birth and now it's just admitted and they don't care even if you try to say
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.920]  no they say it's state law it's not state law well you want us to blood test
[55:59.920 --> 56:03.240]  them for diseases a lot in the hospital do that well it has to go to the health
[56:03.240 --> 56:08.360]  department it's state mandated they're not doing blood test they're liars just
[56:08.360 --> 56:11.040]  like the school district will tell you it's the law you got to take all these
[56:11.040 --> 56:17.360]  vaccines there is no law it's all color of law fraud them using fake color of law
[56:17.360 --> 56:22.000]  authority just like a cop came to your house and said come outside and dig a
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.520]  ditch I say so well I'm not gonna dig a ditch well I'm wearing a uniform and got
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.000]  a gun you better you don't have that authority but cops have been at least
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.200]  trained in the Constitution a little bit they don't do stuff like that the old
[56:34.200 --> 56:39.120]  Soviet Union couple times a week they'd order you out to dig ditches or you know
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.400]  do community work and that's kind of what they're phasing in in America for
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.400]  petty you know tickets and things they do community service they're there they're
[56:46.400 --> 56:51.160]  there and selling it as if it's great it's great when you volunteer not when
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.880]  they force you you know the bill that they've tried to introduce well they
[56:54.880 --> 57:01.240]  have introduced the last six years in a row sponsored by wrangle the National
[57:01.240 --> 57:05.760]  Service Act and then you read deeper it says compulsory service when you're a
[57:05.760 --> 57:11.520]  junior a senior and in high school and then and then a freshman in college and
[57:11.520 --> 57:15.480]  then Ronald manual comes out on C-span and says you will serve three months
[57:15.480 --> 57:20.240]  every year in military training for a domestic force yes yes it will be a
[57:20.240 --> 57:27.480]  draft this is what they're trying to set up it's called slavery and so people
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.320]  need to learn how to say no no because if you don't say no they're gonna keep
[57:34.320 --> 57:37.240]  incrementally pushing but they're not incrementally pushing anymore they're
[57:37.240 --> 57:42.360]  leaping forward with we're gonna tell you what your kids are gonna eat we're
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.560]  gonna surveil you with cameras on the street we're gonna face scan you we're
[57:46.560 --> 57:51.280]  gonna raise your taxes we're gonna continue to hire more cops to write
[57:51.280 --> 57:55.680]  more tickets we're gonna send less cops out to actual crimes and they're just
[57:55.680 --> 57:59.400]  gonna be here for revenue generation this is all being announced we're in

[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.480]  radio network
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.320]  he joined us last week and I wanted to have him on again this week for an hour
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.720]  to mainly take your phone calls a lot of people want to talk to him he's
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.520]  Pastor Lindsey Williams back in 1981 he wrote the book the energy non-crisis
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.840]  now confirmed everything he wrote about that the big old companies made a deal
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:44.280]  with the Arabs back in the late 1970s to predominantly block major oil
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:50.560]  production and discovery in North America and to mainly buy from the
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.200]  Middle East if they would invest most their money in T bills now George
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.680]  Soros over the weekend announced that the end of the dollar has begun at
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.880]  Bretton Woods to in New Hampshire we see CBS news ABC news all reporting that
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.560]  the next few months they're predicting $5 a gallon gas on average higher in
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.880]  some areas the country lower in other areas that information is now coming
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:24.440]  out we were told all of this six months ago in October of 2010 by Lindsey with
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.480]  Ken from who was nearing his death in December with cancer the former head of
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.840]  Atlantic Richfield operations he has another source who's a former CEO of
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.320]  another large oil company that we cannot reveal but I know his name he he
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.600]  concurred and again he's talked to him since and again this week with more
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.000]  information that this is all engineered the Middle East a double crossing of the
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.720]  Arabs that's the point you've got to briefly describe the quote double cross
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.960]  what this means the dollar and the Arabs and the type of incredible pain I mean
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.160]  it's hard for me to pay for this gas and I'm middle-class I see these poor
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.320]  mothers with three four kids in a junker car see it every time I'm gassing up
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.680]  almost every time you can you know disheveled hair kids acting up trying
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:17.920]  to fill up a big gas guzzler with you know 350 375 was it 376 and growing the
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.240]  national average how are people gonna pay for this and then most of the
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.440]  transportation is based in petrochemical so the food prices already going up from
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.800]  commodities are not gonna go up even more everything that's delivered in this
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.840]  country going up from restaurants to food to consumer items that there's just
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.640]  a huge amplifying effect here please continue Lindsay Williams that we're
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.800]  going to phone calls people can't pay for this that's the idea and the
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.880]  struggling thing is Alex mr. prom told me there's two three years ago before we
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:55.600]  died when basically he said one day Lindsay I'm 87 years of age I'm too old
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.520]  to care just tell everybody everything and that's what I've tried to do but
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.800]  I'm coming down to the point now that I'm seeing people get desperate
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.520]  let me go back just a moment and re-brief one thing and then we'll go on to
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:16.160]  what's happening right now I wrote my book energy nine crisis in 1980 in 1984 I
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.400]  was sitting in my living room in Kaseeloff Alaska where I was a missionary
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.160]  at the time and Kim from call me on the phone and he said chaplain would you like
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.560]  people to think you're a prophet and I said can what do you mean and that time
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.520]  crude oil was $32 a barrel and he said the price of crude oil is going from
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:42.360]  $32 a barrel to $10 a barrel I said can it can't happen he left at me on the
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.120]  phone and he said chaplain come on now get off of it he said you said in our
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.520]  board meetings you know who controls the price of crude oil he said don't tell me
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.600]  we can't do this he's and he did he not only took it to $10 a barrel he took it
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.080]  to $9 a barrel and I said Ken why are you doing this he said Lindsay for the
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.040]  first time we want to teach OPEC a lesson teach OPEC all of the producing
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.440]  country or the world basically and they thought that they had the whole world
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.240]  by the tail as far as crude oil's concerned and he said we don't teach him a lesson
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.360]  I said what do you mean he said we're gonna teach him who it is it
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.920]  controls the price of crude oil and then when just last night I heard Donald
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:31.120]  Trump coming over a major radio program and he said 12 people control the price
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.760]  of crude oil in any given day and I said well this is what Ken Tom told me back
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.880]  35 years ago and I said you were finally you telling the people that this is what
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.600]  is happening now you say what can people do I mean a lot of people thinking
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:54.800]  the CEO of rare market this morning came out and said inflation is a major
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:01.920]  problem and is going up drastically do you realize that ages ages of 18 to 29
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.760]  years of age young people but the unemployment is 30 percent now we're
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:15.800]  talking about 9 and 10 percent ages 18 through 29 unemployment is 30 percent
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:21.000]  yeah I'm hearing what Ken Tom told me Alex I'm just sitting here it's
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.880]  unfounded he said three and a half years ago just to recap he said three and a
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:31.880]  half years ago that crude oil I would go from $45 a barrel to 150 within
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.800]  six months it did exactly that then he said now it's gonna drop down to 40
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.920]  everybody laughed at you it went down to 40 your other source of the same thing
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.840]  then he said two and a half years ago enjoy yourself for about two two and a
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.280]  half years it's gonna basically stay the same go up a little bit maybe to 65 but
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:53.600]  then once golden things start going up look for oil to just skyrocket and it's
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.840]  gonna destroy things by design then six months ago he tells you now is the time
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.880]  six months to a year 150 dollar a barrel it's now begun now mainstream news
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.920]  says 200 to 300 a barrel possible but regardless you did call it the other
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.760]  source called it and this is destroying our society people like well why would
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.080]  Obama allow this he is there to carry out an operation just like Bush they'll
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.480]  politically destroy them get him out of office rehabilitating later in the
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.480]  media there'll be a new puppet in who will take the blame and the elite then
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.600]  never get the blame the private fellow deserve never get the blame their front
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.360]  men puppets that they finance get the blame and so please continue and then I
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.320]  want to start going to phone calls what is the new info that you got from your
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.440]  former big three CEO and his wife and and for folks that don't know why they
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.480]  would tell someone like Lindsay Williams he was their chaplain he was in on the
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.280]  board meetings then he wrote a book then Lindsay becomes a source that's how
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.600]  high-powered people do they have media people that they know will keep their
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.440]  word about not revealing them as as a conduit to get information out just like
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.880]  FBI federal marshals send me documents saying that they're really training to
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.880]  take on the American people not al-qaeda now that's how you get the you get these
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:13.120]  relationships go ahead all the problems of God Alex everyone out there and
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.200]  you're listening audience let me state it very emphatically by the progress of
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.600]  God I was invited to be the chaplain of the elite of the world and I did put
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.960]  three years as a result made friends of some of those people and every time they
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.000]  have told me something I have gone on info whereas and told you exactly what
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.760]  they say I take no credit for this but I want to tell you the very latest to
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.920]  what's happening and our name the nation this is brand new since last week I'm
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.000]  still sitting here startled because I wanted what was going to happen next I
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.480]  was just sent a chart showing the progression of the Muslim brotherhood
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:55.040]  folks please don't take this lightly they already know where they're going and
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.680]  what they're going to do and it was published in the New York Times this
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.600]  bash we do go and get it for yourself and it was posted on April the 5th of
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:12.880]  2011 I guess it was just a few days ago and it said the humans president a lot of
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.160]  dollar is to be thrown to the crocodiles did you hear this you remember
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:24.160]  that first it was Egypt and I came on info rose five weeks before and told you
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.080]  there was going to be a crisis in the Middle East because I've been told it
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.280]  by one of the elite it happened four weeks later did it with the Libya last
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.960]  week I said he's going to go to Yemen Pakistan Syria and the last country will
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.640]  be Saudi Arabia I did not know what the next country was going to be until this
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:48.120]  week it is going to be are you ready ratchet you'll see Yemen this is your
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.840]  next target they have already thrown the king of Yemen to the dogs and listen
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:01.920]  the five reasons why that he's got to go because he's never been used to them so
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.480]  as a result he's to be tossed out the window so to speak then you're going to
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.280]  see this and I hope this is what I said on info wars I was told this just
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.480]  after the Egyptian conflict took place I went back to my informant and I said now
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.160]  you said there was going to be a crisis in the Middle East but tell me where is
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.920]  this going and why you're doing it and this is the time that he told me what
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:31.280]  we just put in our new DVD presentation folks please we produce three hours of
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:37.280]  professionally done in digital viewing DVDs just within the past two weeks we
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.080]  released this showing everything that is taking in place in the Middle East why
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.720]  it's taking place that way and he said to me he said chaplain this crisis was
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.360]  started in Egypt and then goes then they went to Libya he said it was brought up
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:57.520]  to every Middle East all producing country until the price folks are you
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:02.920]  getting this until the price of crude oil goes to $200 a barrel now I know I've
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.120]  been seeing it Alex has to over the past week some of the prognosticators
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:12.000]  are saying $300 a barrel I don't you believe that I want to stay with what
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.120]  the elite told me I'm not going to try to change their words they said we want
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:23.360]  to take it to $200 a barrel but out there in newsletters you're seeing all
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.680]  over where it is going and I just heard it this week I've heard it from numerous
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.640]  sources I've just got one newsletter right here which I won't mention his name
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:38.960]  he said let's just be far oh my goodness I think he's so startled because a year
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.640]  and a half ago before Mr. Ken from died he said to me one day he said chaplain
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.240]  whenever the Federal Reserve begins to buy their own debt he said it's our
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:56.040]  over and I was the first one I guess because of what Ken had told me I
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.440]  dared back about a year ago to go on a number of radio programs and like here
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.720]  on info wars and say there's going to be a default on the national debt and then
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.080]  when I was told what was going to happen in the Middle East just after the
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.000]  Egyptian conflict started and we produced this new DVD series the Middle
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.680]  East the rest of the story I came out and said that positively is going to be
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.480]  a default on the national debt and Alex you and I both have seen it within the
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.840]  past one which time numerous newsletters now are picking up on this word default
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:35.680]  and saying the American that we can't stand it it is there's no way that we
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:39.480]  can keep on going this way and that will mean that will mean an incredible
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:45.240]  acceleration of dollar devaluation which is a tax on our purchasing power a tax

[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.840]  only for Lindsay Williams on the economy, the dollar default that the Globalist are
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:32.920]  engineering, what's happening with oil prices is inside knowledge, 800-259-9231.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.760]  Maybe we'll keep Lindsay a little bit in the next hour to continue with calls.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.040]  I do have the continued radiation fallout, whitewash going on in the U.S., what they
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.800]  say safe for normal levels are being raised from 1,000 to 100,000 times, depending on
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.640]  the isotope.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:55.680]  Another incredible article up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, the TSA threatened the doctor
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.760]  and his wife when they already put their six-year-old and their other children through the scanners.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.760]  They then wanted to grope her, and they said, put her back in the scanner.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.440]  And they said no, and they started arguing a little bit or questioning, and they were
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.040]  told there would be trouble, and they've told ABC News that if they didn't submit.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.400]  So the headline is, parents say TSA made it clear.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.200]  There would be trouble if they refused to allow six-year-old daughter to be groped.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.440]  That's the PrisonPlanet.com headline on InfoWars.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:34.400]  It's a simpler headline, TSA threatened parents of six-year-old before groping.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.560]  Is that the InfoWars headline I came up with?
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:46.600]  Yes, TSA threatened parents before six-year-old groped.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.240]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.960]  We've got to get the revolt kicked back into high gear.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.720]  It's ongoing against the globalist.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.560]  Side issue, Lindsey, and then we're going to get back into the larger issues of the economy.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.800]  What is your view on the TSA groping Ron Paul, groping Jesse Ventura, groping small children,
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.280]  sticking their hands in the pants now, and then threatening the parents if they don't
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280]  like it?
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:13.800]  This is pure goonism, training us to be basically loaded on the cattle cars.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.040]  Training us exactly is what we've trained the Jews and others during the last war.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.040]  It's no different.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.760]  You've heard me say so many times, the name of the game is control, and this is exactly
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.240]  what the elite want.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.120]  But let me give you one or two more things here, Alec, before we have to get into phone
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  calls.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.120]  It's so important.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.120]  And I'll say, I am so appreciative today to be on your show more than probably any
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.120]  time.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.120]  We're appreciative to have you.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.120]  Go ahead.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.300]  Yeah, my predictions and the things that I have to say do not come from tea leaves or
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.300]  divine revelation.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:47.800]  Folks, I'm not a prophet.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.200]  The elite personally have told me these things.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:57.480]  Now, we have seen what they have done come to pass exactly as they told me it would.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.600]  And I'm going to come down and give you a solution.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.440]  I had to come up with something.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  People are so desperate.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.440]  They've gotten so many emails.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.560]  First of all, you have seen Gordon's herbal prices do exactly what Mr. Fromm told me three
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.560]  years ago.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.440]  And I begged all of you to buy it.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.760]  I said, please, don't hesitate one day.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.760]  And now you're wishing you had taken Mr. Fromm's advice before he died.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.520]  gasoline prices are going exactly where they said it will.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.440]  I do not think you'll go to $300 a barrel.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.360]  I think you'll go to $150 to $200 a barrel.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.080]  And Saudi Arabia will be the last country to be touched.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.320]  The next one to be thrown through the wind is Yeoman, watch it.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.880]  I just got the prediction this past week.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.480]  The World Bank is now saying, just as back within the past two weeks, they've said we've
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:50.280]  got to have a new reserve currency, a new reserve currency.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.480]  What are they going to back it with?
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.040]  They're going to back it with Gordon's server, purchase Gordon's server every bit you can.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.520]  You think Gordon's hot price now is going to $3,000 an ounce.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.200]  You're going to see server to $50 to $100 an ounce mark my words again.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.200]  Are you noticing people that the prediction that was given to me a year ago that are still
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.960]  no shortage use on the grocery store shelves?
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]  I know.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:23.040]  I was talking to the church host was saying, go on with food shortage, go on with food
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.040]  shortage.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.920]  Then I came along and was given this by one of my elite friends.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.800]  He said, no, chaplain, there's not going to be any shortage use of groceries on the
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  grocery store shelf.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.640]  But he said, you're going to go hungry.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.640]  And I said, why?
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.280]  He said, because the dollar is going to lose its purchasing power through the product that
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.040]  you won't be able to afford the groceries.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.200]  Now, I want to give you a solution.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.240]  This is something that has come ahead to do something in light of what these people have
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.640]  told me in the past few weeks, please do this and let's go over it if we can.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.360]  That is a solution.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:29:00.080]  Alex, I think the only solution at this point is to expose the elite.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.480]  Now, do you remember?
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.040]  I exposed Golden Silver.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.800]  I exposed the gasoline price.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.560]  I told you what the World Bank said.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.720]  I told you what the food is.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.120]  I was going to have one of the grocery stores here.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.080]  Now people go back and look at that and say, Lindsay, everything the elite told you over
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.480]  these past three years has happened exactly like you said it.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.360]  Now, there's such a credit burden that it has been gained that Alex, when I come on
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:27.040]  in for a while and say it again, people are going to say, oh my goodness, it's going to
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040]  take place this way.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:34.160]  Alex, we've got to expose everything that the elite are doing and when we expose them
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.040]  because of your track record, and you've told it over the years, the truth exactly
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040]  like it is.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.400]  And with the track record of what they've given me over the years, if we can expose
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:49.760]  these people to a net people across America, they are going to take it as gospel and...
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.760]  Stay there.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.440]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.840]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.760]  Hi, folks.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.600]  I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.280]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.440]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.080]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.320]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:31.600]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.920]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:41.240]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:46.480]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:52.760]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.040]  Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:02.240]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.960]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.120]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.480]  at home.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.520]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520]  the shots.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:25.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:31.240]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:35.640]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:42.160]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:48.040]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.040]  of the Republic.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.840]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:00.440]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:05.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:14.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.040]  you to have.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:20.760]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:25.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.080]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.200]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:50.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:09.680]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:23.160]  I remember when I gained my mind, when I gained awareness, when I studied history, and when
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.480]  I broke my conditioning and stopped being intimidated by the globalists who want to break our will
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.520]  and turn us into subservient, groveling slaves.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.480]  Coming up after Lindsay Williams leaves us in the next hour, Wayne Madsen is getting
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:39.720]  threats via the globalist mafia to stop investigating Chicago mob ties in Obama.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.240]  He may leave the country.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.760]  Wayne Madsen is joining us coming up in the last 30 minutes.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:49.920]  Before he joins us, we now have this bombshell article, and I never ask Drudge to really
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.920]  link to our stuff.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.040]  He links all the time, and it's the biggest media site out there, and it's so great how
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.640]  he can set the agenda.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.200]  But just watching this ABC News video from this morning, when the family of this little
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.600]  six-year-old that got groped was interviewed, this doctor and his wife, they put him through
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.280]  the scanners, we're going back to Lindsay in a moment, then they start the groping,
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.960]  and now we know what happened when they took the girl away and said, now the drug testing,
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.240]  she broke down and began crying and was basically begging and pleading.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.760]  I mean, this is what America is, little six-year-olds with men and women in uniforms putting their
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:28.240]  hands down their pants, and what comes next?
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:35.120]  So we've got the headline, parents threatened by TSA before six-year-old was groped, and
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:44.720]  then Marley, let's add a comma, girl then broke down in tears, girl then broke down
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.880]  in tears, or perhaps give the father's exact quote.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.720]  Initially, she was just confused, see, I'm concerned about the oil and the new world
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.720]  order, but at the same time, this is the new world order.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.800]  This is the rubber meat in the road.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:04.000]  Her father, the doctor, said initially she was confused, Todd Drexel said, afterwards
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.680]  she broke down crying because she really didn't understand what she'd done wrong.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.760]  I did ask for alternatives, I asked for her to be rescanned, they just refused and said
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.160]  they were going to do what they were going to do, and of course, I've had district attorneys
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.480]  on the air saying this is illegal, a cop can't do this.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.360]  Selena Drexel said, adding the TSA supervisor made it clear in a nonverbal way that there
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:32.760]  would be trouble if the parents caused a fuss, that means bowing up to them, and refused
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:39.920]  to allow the pat down to be completed, so a very threatening body language, very threatening
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.440]  attitude, little girl crying, this is what these psychic vampires need, is feeding on
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.120]  small children, it's their favorite, and we give our children over to their MOLIC system,
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.080]  we put them through the fire of the TSA, we sacrifice their innocence so they can be trained
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.080]  to be good little slaves.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:01.280]  Lindsay, I want to go to phone calls, but it's just seeing this unfold, seeing this
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.080]  happen is just very hard for me to deal with.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.720]  Parents for 12 years, I was a pastor at the British church in Hollywood, Florida prior
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:17.320]  to going to Alaska as a missionary for 12 years, I can feel right now while you're talking
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:22.160]  the emotion of what these parents must have gone through, this is a shame, it's a disgrace
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.720]  that America would ever come to this.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.880]  And it goes on thousands of times a day.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:34.640]  This year is the new world order, they must bring us under total mental, physical, psychological
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:40.200]  control, it's all a part of what the new world order does, Mr. Fromm told me this back
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.720]  three years ago when he talked about the devil's messiah, I've got to one of these
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:50.720]  days produce the DVD series on this, the devil's messiah, how about what have the method that
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.000]  they've used to bring America under the new world order and it all went on to what he
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.120]  called the devil's messiah, Alex.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:05.080]  And that's a system of taking over society to destroy our morals and to get us to totally
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.080]  accept tyranny.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:12.400]  He said to me, he said, Chaplin, we had to, folks, are you getting this, please, he said
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:19.040]  to me, he said, Chaplin, we had to remove the God of America that made it great before
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:26.200]  we could bring in the new world order, this is exactly what you're seeing there in that
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.000]  airport, we've had to remove the decency of the Bible, we've had to remove the honesty
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.720]  and the righteousness of the scripture.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.120]  To get in our space to take a doctor and his wife and his little innocent children and
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.800]  teach them that they're bad, to teach them that they're criminals, to teach them the
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.960]  government can put their hands in your pants, not just search you at Nazi checkpoints whenever
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.480]  they want, federally funded checkpoints all over America.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.480]  It's happening.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.720]  This is a part of the new world order and Alex, I've come to the conclusion in the last
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.920]  few days that the only way in this world we're ever going to overcome this is to expose
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.600]  the elite, call them what they are.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.360]  You've been doing it for a long time, keep it up, intensify it.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.560]  We must expose everything that the elite are doing and call it as it is.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560]  We must.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560]  Let's go to phone calls.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.960]  I'm going to keep you five minutes to the next hour if you can, Lindsay.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.400]  For any other tidbits of new intel you've got, but that's just huge about the other
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.920]  countries they're planning to overthrow.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.640]  Did he tell you anything else about how they're going to try to overthrow Saudi Arabia?
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.960]  I'll tell you, since you started talking about this, the Saudis have run to the Russians
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.640]  and the Chinese for help saying that they feel like they're being double-crossed.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.440]  I mean, I tell you, this is getting scary.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:43.120]  Just after the outbreak in Egypt, and as you remember, they told me five weeks before,
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.840]  five months before it happened, it was going to happen.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.440]  When it broke out, I waited a week, I went back to my service, I said, where is it going
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  from here?
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.120]  He named all the countries it was going to, and Yemen, I just got this past week, is
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.560]  going to be the next one.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.120]  The last country that the king will be deposed as Saudi Arabia, they had better be scared.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.240]  They'd better be running to the Russians and everybody they can.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.240]  They ought to be scuttled.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.640]  It's only a matter of time, and it's all a part of being able to take the price of
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.000]  coup d'oeuvre to $200 a barrel, break the back of the dollar, bring in a default of
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  the American currency.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.520]  They're going to lose what they've got in two bills and securities, and everybody this
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:28.160]  is a part, and I was just given the chart showing the intended progression of the Muslim
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.200]  brotherhood, and we included it in our Middle East and the rest of the story, but you've
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.200]  got to see.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.480]  Go through the order, Lindsay, and then we're going to calls.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.000]  Go through the order.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.280]  So it's Yemen next.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.000]  Jordan, are they planning to overthrow Jordan as well?
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  Possibly.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.360]  But you've got Yemen, you've got Bahrain, you've got Syria, and you're going to come
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.480]  down to Saudi Arabia, which will be last, last.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.480]  Are you hearing this?
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:58.840]  Whenever you see the king of Saudi Arabia being, when you see the rocks beginning in
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  Saudi Arabia to the point that the royal family is deposed, you know that you've only got
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.360]  a short time until the dollar is done for.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.520]  This is unbelievable.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.920]  Let's go to phone calls.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.920]  Tony and Florida.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.880]  Tony, you're on the air with Pastor Lindsay Williams.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:15.200]  Thank you all very much.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:21.400]  Pastor, I believe you are a prophet because the testimony of Jesus Christ is truth and
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:28.080]  prophecy, and I say that because in 2001, I'm classified myself as a conscience objective
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.680]  of the war, and I was discharged accordingly right after Afghanistan bombing.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.560]  But even that, my wife has not woken up until she heard your message.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.240]  And since she heard your message and the thing that's going on, she has woken up.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.240]  So that has told me that you're true.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.240]  So I want to thank you for what you're doing, and Alex, thank you, of course.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.680]  My question is, sir, do you have information about what's going on?
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.520]  Could this be the inroad into Jerusalem, and what you have information about Israel and
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.520]  the state of Israel?
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.520]  Yes, positively.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.440]  And this is the one that frightens me.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.320]  I don't even like to talk about it.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.640]  I'd much prefer bypassed it.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:13.200]  We were able to secure a DVD soundbite, what they were chanting, when Egypt had its problem,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:19.240]  and they were chanting the words, to Jerusalem we go, matters by the millions.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.520]  I went on to elaborate that on that, some in our Middle East, the rest of the story.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:29.680]  So the globalists are basically hyping up, putting the extremists in, so they can put
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.160]  the Middle East into flames, order out of chaos.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.600]  Tony, I appreciate your call, interesting points.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.160]  Nick in California, Nick, you're on the air.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:40.840]  Hey, guys, thank you for taking my call.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.400]  I just wanted to know, is there anything in the globalist playbook that could drop gas
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.600]  prices down to about 80 cents like it was after 9-11?
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.440]  Not until after the New World Order is completed, you're not looking at that until years down
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.440]  the line.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:03.800]  I think on the last program with Alex Jones, I said that they want to do what they're doing.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.920]  Someone said to me, they said, why would the elite destroy their own country?
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.600]  I said they aren't destroying their own country.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.040]  They're rather bringing it under control.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:16.080]  They have to bankrupt everything first, then they bring it back out of the condition it's
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.080]  in.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.640]  It'll probably take them years to do it.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.840]  At that point, they'll probably bring gas prices back down, but you've got a long time
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:28.440]  before you go to see that.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.040]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  Yes, it does.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  Thank you, Lindsay.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.040]  Thank you.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.040]  Appreciate the call.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.960]  Nick, let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.960]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960]  Hello?
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.960]  Do you don't want to be on air, Tim?
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  No, no, no.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.960]  I do.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.960]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.960]  How you doing?
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:50.960]  Good.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  Go ahead.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.000]  I've been on the air for more than a half, man, and I didn't even get on the talk yet.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:05.280]  First of all, something that Lindsay's pointed out about dollar devaluation.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:14.800]  When I started buying silver, in fact, one of your sponsors, Midas, I was paying $19.25
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.520]  for an ounce.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:30.880]  Today I just checked that same bullion, now it's at $40.27, but what people don't understand
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:39.000]  that I finally understand is it's not that the price of gold or silver is going up in
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  value, it's that it takes more dollars to buy that because the dollar isn't worth what
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  it was.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.800]  And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:58.920]  Now, getting back to the things about what Lindsay was talking about, I wrote down what
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.040]  will be affected, and the first thing, of course, is our budgets in general.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:09.040]  People only drive when they absolutely have to because there aren't people to afford it.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:16.600]  Retail sales are going to increase by who knows how much, I have no prediction on how
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.600]  much people are going to...
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.280]  Human retail sales prices.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:20.560]  Right.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.840]  Shipping costs are going to go up.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.200]  Leisure activity is going to be affected.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.520]  Even going to the show or going to the beach, people will stay home at barbecue in their
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.520]  backyard.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:37.520]  Food prices are going to obviously go to store because of higher shipping costs.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.800]  Another thing, vacations and travel, people just aren't going to be able to afford it.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:53.960]  America by invading all these foreign countries, a lot of them are oil rich, i.e. Iraq and
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:45:00.000]  others have gained control, more or less, of their resources.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.480]  So now, and I know that America, I've run it in several different places, has giant
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.320]  stockpots of oil.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.160]  Now when they get the place where they want it, they're going to pull out and start interjecting
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.760]  their stockpiles and make a killing on the stockpots.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760]  Sure.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.360]  Great points, Tam, the strategic stockpile.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360]  That's on record.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.160]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey Williams?
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160]  Yeah.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.880]  Well, I would basically try asking him if he agrees.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:37.080]  And this too, yesterday, Obama has okayed American oil companies in a speech giving
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.880]  them all permission and issued tons of new drilling permits.
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.880]  No, I hear you.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.360]  And that's kind of funny that didn't happen at this, at this point.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.280]  All right, Tim, we got to move on to get to other people.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.120]  Lindsey comments on what Tim just said.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.200]  Top 10 currencies of the world.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.760]  Take them in average and with the American dollar.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:03.120]  As of yesterday, the American dollar was 73.8 cents, 74 cents, basically, against the other
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120]  currencies of the world.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:07.320]  Today, Canada's currency is worth more than ours is.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.920]  There is a solution.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.680]  People, please listen to me.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.360]  You have never seen gold and silver prices going to where they are going.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.760]  I do not sell gold and silver.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.760]  I always can tell you where to get it.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.440]  This is the only way you're going to protect yourself.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.240]  If you had bought that gold when Mr. Fromm told me two and a half years ago that it was
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:27.680]  the other thing that I could spare my assets with.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.000]  If you had bought it, you could have bought it for $700 to $800 an ounce.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  Today, we're going to pay $1,400.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.640]  You would have not lost one penny of your assets if you had taken Mr. Fromm's advice
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.520]  back two and a half years ago.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.520]  We've got to do it now because it's going to $3,000.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.520]  Alex, I'll stop without more callers.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.120]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.720]  Thank you for whatever you're doing here.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.440]  I have three quick points.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  Why can't we?
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.880]  I want to make sure we protect you and Alex and also this reporter.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.280]  We should have Google bombs on this whenever they threaten you guys so that they can go
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.080]  up, so that basically it becomes untouchable.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.840]  We can't touch it because it's going to become a political issue.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.520]  Next thing, why can't we make committees and go after these guys for racketeering?
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:16.320]  They basically have telegraphed this stuff.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.240]  This is criminal activities, manipulating the markets and things like that.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.440]  We should get prominent people to start committees and go after these people and confiscate
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:32.000]  everything they own, the contracts and everything, then farm them back out to people who will
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.520]  do it for a percentage.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.000]  You could reduce the deficit and also they could use that for tax money.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.720]  Then arrest Soros, he's in control of New York trying to destroy this country.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.320]  They went after Jesse Jackson for trying to help a prisoner from a foreign country, but
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.640]  this guy, he's destroying our currency and our country and they can't go after him.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  What's going on?
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.240]  Everything you said is true.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.560]  Let me very emphatically state the last person in America that's going to be touched is Alex
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.560]  Jones.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:10.200]  I'm not going to bother the media people because they know that today that they touch the conservative
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.760]  media that they also have to limit what the liberal media is over there.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.880]  That's the last thing they're going to start trying to curtail, but they're getting lined
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.360]  up for it now because they know that even mainline media will panic when they see the
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.440]  muzzle going on, but sir, great points.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:28.080]  Let me comment on this.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.440]  We've done over 60 or so Google bombs and for those that don't know what that is, that's
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.560]  making something a number one search term.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:38.720]  So it leads them back to news articles that we've written or topics we want to focus on.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:46.640]  Since Google about a month and a half ago changed their algorithm to try to block this,
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.880]  we've done it three times and only succeeded twice and didn't get number one, got number
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.680]  three and number two.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:59.240]  And so now I want to do a test today, but that means everybody's got to do this and
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.080]  not just count on other people doing it.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:07.960]  I'm looking at the headline, parents say TSA made it clear.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:15.160]  There would be trouble if they refused to allow six year old daughter to be groped.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.880]  Let's go with the headline.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:28.120]  This will lead it to everybody's news reports on this to six, just the number six, six year
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.000]  old groped.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:38.320]  And in the search engine, over and over again, the number six year old groped, groped g-r-o-p-e-d.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.320]  Everybody.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.440]  Let's show folks on screen what it looks like on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:48.600]  Let's go to Google, type the number six year old groped and that'll lead them to our articles
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.520]  about this and all the other videos and articles about it.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:50:02.440]  Let's hit it as hard as we can, okay, or you can also do the variant search.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.440]  Six year groped.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:05.200]  You can just do six year groped.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.320]  Three words is better, but you can do four if they're short because it's really just
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.920]  three words in the number six.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.160]  Six year old groped.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160]  Just type it in.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:20.760]  Six year old groped and when you do that, it leads you to infowars.com up there at the
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:26.800]  top and also the gateway pundit is also the other top link and the links below that, the
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:29.280]  third, fourth, and fifth links are videos of it happening.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.720]  This is already a big story.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.680]  Let's search the term.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:40.560]  Six year old groped, the number six, just the number six, just type six.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:50.720]  Don't spell it, just six year old groped, y-e-a-r-o-l-d, groped g-r-o-p-e-d.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.200]  Let's see if they're really successful at blocking us.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:59.000]  Six year old groped, let's show the globalists, let's show the TSA and Google sensors, we
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  have the power.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.240]  Hit them, hit them hard.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.480]  You know your gear can make the difference between a good day and a really bad day.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:10.200]  It's time to prepare and quality gear from EMgear.net is the critical factor for surviving

[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:04.880]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.800]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:12.840]  or gold?
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:16.120]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:18.400]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.920]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:23.920]  seeds.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.880]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.720]  food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:34.600]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.520]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:45.960]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:57.600]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.600]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.520]  Infowars.com is down right now.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.240]  John Harmon up there in Minnesota, checking for me.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:25.960]  Error established at Database Connection.
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.320]  You'll find out what's going on with that.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.360]  Since we're testing Google, I want to see if they're blocking certain terms as well.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.080]  Let's do something we've only done once before, something simple that isn't as complex.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.520]  Let's search that too.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.040]  Six-year-old groped.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.960]  Let's also search Alex Jones.
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.360]  That'll lead him to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.640]  Bill O'Reilly dare not speak my name when he's demonizing me.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.080]  Sean Hannity dare not speak my name when he's demonizing me.
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  Glenn Beck.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.920]  They don't want to say that name because they don't want you to find Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.720]  Let's search the name over and over again.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.120]  I'll put it in the search engine.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:01.120]  I'll do it right now.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.880]  I already got Alex Jones in there during the break.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.880]  Alex Jones.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  Boom.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880]  Put it up there.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880]  Hit Enter.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  Put the cursor over it again to make sure it's a new search.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:09.880]  Hit Enter again.
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:10.880]  Let's see how they like that.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.640]  Let's do it over and over again.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.120]  Let's see if they've blocked the Google bombs or find out systems to get around this because
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.120]  it's very effective.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:20.240]  It's got a lot of attention and they're scared of it.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.640]  Let's search the term Alex Jones and Drudge is linked to Infowars right now.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.240]  That may have brought it down.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.560]  If not, Drudge can just change over to the PrisonPlanet version of the Ron Paul article.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.120]  Who's up next here, John, for our guest, Lindsay Williams?
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.040]  Sean in Texas, here on the air with Pastor Lindsay Williams.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.400]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex and Pastor Williams.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.400]  I appreciate it.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.640]  This question might help millions of people that are listening.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.360]  Remember back in October, something you said, I'm not sure if Mr. Fromm or one of your
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.720]  leadage friends died of cancer and you said that they actually knew the treatments for
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.240]  cancer, but he listened to his doctor son and he did the medical method, I guess, and
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.800]  he ended up dying and my mom has since gotten cancer and I was wondering if you could point
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.800]  me in some kind of direction.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.480]  Well, I want to be clear, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.200]  I don't give medical advice.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.200]  I talk about what I do personally.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.800]  What Lindsay said was is one of the big company heads, Mr. Fromm, didn't do the alternative
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.840]  treatment because his son's a doctor.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.720]  The other guy did do this other alternative treatment and it worked for him.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:23.800]  But when people, some folks say, well, this is a hundred percent, I don't believe there's
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:24.800]  a hundred percent.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.040]  I believe there are a lot of treatments that do work for some people that are suppressed.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.280]  That's even been on 60 Minutes with famous doctor out of Houston that they try to suppress
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.080]  with all of this.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.600]  Let's go ahead and take another call here because I'm really trying to get into the
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.400]  oil prices here, folks.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.240]  Jason, in Oklahoma, you're on the air with Lindsay Williams.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.240]  Hi, I'm Lindsay.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.240]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  Long time listener.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.240]  First time caller.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.240]  It's nice to get through.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.240]  Unfortunately, my question for Lindsay is a little bit in a different direction.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:57.520]  What I've seen in my life personally, I've studied the occult for a really long time
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:05.440]  and I've seen basically a really large divide in the consciousness of people who care.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:08.120]  The whole satanic thing is death to care, right?
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:09.120]  Death to care.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:13.120]  And what I've seen in the consciousness divide is there are people who care about the planet
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:19.920]  and I really wanted to ask Lindsay about the New World Order utilizing, manipulating.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:24.320]  If he's heard anything, if he's had any intimations, if he's understood anything about how they
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.880]  would utilize a new ecumenical world religion and manipulate-
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.200]  Oh, well, the UN's been pushing that for decades.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.200]  Lindsay, comments.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  In fact, the New...
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.200]  The Devil's Messiah, you heard and referred to it a few minutes ago.
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.000]  In my first DVD series, it was six and eight hours of DVD viewing.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.720]  I went into this in about a 20-minute sector.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.680]  The Devil's Messiah, New World Order, every bit of it is explained there.
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:56.760]  Positively, many of the elite are a part of the occult.
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:57.760]  Please elaborate.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.800]  We're going to come back for a little bit more, but I mean, look at Skull and Mones.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.800]  Look at Bohemian Grove.
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.440]  They believe they're getting power from it.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.240]  Yes, and they are.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:08.880]  And this is where they get many of their answers, much of what they come up with comes from
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.320]  the prints of the power of this air.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:15.120]  The spirit that now works is in the cheer of a disobedient survivalist says, and folks,
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.520]  you've got to set that spiritual house in order because you're going to be facing these
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.520]  people.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:26.160]  All right, third hour with Wayne Madsen talking about threats he's getting for exposing Obama.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.160]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:28.960]  I'm going to get back into the TSA.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:29.960]  What's happening with the radiation?
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.360]  If you can see him in about five more minutes, Pastor Lindsay Williams, a few more phone
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.680]  calls, any other tidbits of news and information he hasn't covered, then we'll continue on
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.680]  to the third hour.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:39.680]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.680]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.680]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.920]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.680]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:59:01.600]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:05.320]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.000]  of your health and your own family.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.360]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:16.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.560]  small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.880]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:26.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.200]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.680]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.320]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:36.920]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:37.920]  yourself.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:44.880]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:59:44.880 --> 02:00:13.040]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:21.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:25.560]  Well, I really appreciate Lindsay Williams joining us today.
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:28.680]  We're going to take a few more calls from Adam, Sam, Randy.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:32.080]  I'll get to others after Lindsay leaves us.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.720]  By the way, you've heard about the DVDs he's produced, the Middle East, the rest of the
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:40.600]  story, breaking down all this in a professionally produced DVD to help get the word out, because
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:45.640]  if we're able to get the word out with this radio show and his films, then people will
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:49.560]  be aware of the globalist agenda, and they may not be able to fully carry it out because
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:50.560]  of pushback.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.400]  And Lindsay has said in past interviews, they are concerned about the awakening, and they're
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:55.800]  not invincible.
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.080]  But people have got to wake up.
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:01.280]  The media is trying to distract us with unions and welfare, which is out of control, but
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.120]  it's a small part of the deficit.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.600]  The real deficit is the derivatives we've signed on to, the inflation tax, what's happening
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.880]  in commodities.
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:11.160]  It's the big economic issue.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.400]  We don't fix that, as Ron Paul has said.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  There's nothing to fix.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.600]  If you want to call and get a copy of the new DVD, it's 888-799-6111 or ProposyClub.com,
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.320]  888-799-6111 or ProposyClub.com.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.600]  Our sites, of course, are infowars.com and prisonplot.tv.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  Let's move quickly.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:29.600]  Quick questions or comments?
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.200]  Don't have to thank us for anything, callers, just give us your question or comment.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:35.160]  Adam in Alabama, you're on the air with Lindsay Williams.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:37.160]  Hey, how are y'all doing?
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:38.160]  Good.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.160]  Good.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.160]  Two points real quick.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.160]  I just wanted to get your opinion.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.880]  I understand everything about the gold, why you need to buy it, and all that.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.880]  I've heard all your callers calling and ask why.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  I understand why.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.840]  I want your opinion on Ezekiel 719, about they'll throw their gold and silver in the
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  streets and all that.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.160]  And my second point is, what is Lindsay Williams' opinion on the Rapture?
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.160]  And I'll take my comments off there.
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:00.160]  Okay, Lindsay.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:03.160]  Yes, I think what he's referring to it is Ezekiel.
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:07.160]  What does the world consider today's currency?
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:09.160]  It considers paper as currency.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.160]  How many people in America own gold and silver?
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.160]  Less than 1%.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.160]  Did you hear that?
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:20.160]  Less than 1% of the Americans hold gold and silver in the palm of their hand.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:25.160]  Now, if Ezekiel were referring to what they would throw in the streets, what would he
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.160]  be referring to?
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.360]  Would he be referring to less than what 1% of the people have, or would he be referring
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:31.960]  to the Federal Reserve notes?
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:36.400]  My contention is he's referring to the paper, which definitely is going to become worthless.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:41.680]  Well, what did Jesus and many other folks in the Bible say over and over again?
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:45.560]  This knowledge, for those that have discernment, you will understand it.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.960]  For everyone else, it's in parables.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.800]  They're not going to understand it.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.120]  So correct me if I'm wrong, but so much of the Bible is incredible poetry, but also
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.120]  riddles.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.480]  Now, that's not the right term, but I mean, it's almost like Sanskrit that if you don't
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.800]  know how to understand it, for somebody that does have discernment, you totally get it,
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.800]  and you see the many levels to every statement in the Bible, the general public reads it,
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.800]  and it looks like gibberish.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:13.600]  One portion of the Bible will explain the other, and whenever you have a question about
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:19.600]  what one part means, go and look what the other part means, now, when, okay, anyway,
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.080]  basically, that'll do it.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.880]  I know we've got time running out here.
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:23.880]  Absolutely.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:24.880]  We'll have to have you back very soon.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:27.400]  Sam in California, you're on the year.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:33.840]  Good afternoon, Alex and Lindsay, just one quick, well, two quick comments.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.480]  I believe they're practical solutions to taking a lot of the leverage out of the hands of
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.480]  the globalist.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:45.320]  One, I would like people to research HHO gas and how they're making conversion kits to
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.280]  make your car run off water.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:50.480]  It's a hydrogen, basically, fuel cell that separates.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:54.840]  Yeah, once a supplement, it will get you more gas mileage if it's the right unit.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:55.840]  Absolutely.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:56.840]  Absolutely.
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:02.160]  The second one, a practical solution to taking power out of the globalist hands is go down
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:06.920]  the street, talk to your neighbors, try to get just three to five of your neighbors on
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.640]  your block to start growing vegetables, not the same kind that you grow because you don't
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.840]  all want to be eating the same thing, but if anything happens, it's like insurance.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.720]  Begin acting like normal humans, ants save food for the winter, grasshoppers don't.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:22.120]  We all know what happens to grasshoppers.
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:23.120]  They die.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.720]  The ants don't die in the winter.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.720]  Great point.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:26.720]  That's all.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.720]  Randy, Christian, Chris and others.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.760]  I'll get to you before our next guest joins us.
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:33.720]  But Lindsay, I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.560]  We will talk to you again in the very near future as things accelerate, as this quickening
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:40.960]  expands.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.160]  But you always thank me for having you on the show and you're so gracious and polite
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.360]  and appreciative.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.880]  We want to say we appreciate you, Lindsay, and thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:51.520]  We want to thank you.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:53.000]  God bless, Alex.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  Have a great day.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  You too.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.440]  We'll be back with a bunch of news, your phone calls, then Wayne Madsen who's getting
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.440]  death threats.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.280]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:05.560]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.360]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.600]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.080]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:17.620]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.400]  You must act automatically.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:22.840]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:25.280]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:30.040]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes in your door, you'll need
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.960]  to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:37.040]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:43.000]  With serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for five days, this powerful $300
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:48.800]  extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from E-Foods Direct.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:54.960]  Go to E-FoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:59.400]  That's E-FoodsDirect.com slash Alex 800-409-5633.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:04.920]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.160]  Terany is here.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.880]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:12.480]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.240]  on earth.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:23.080]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.920]  expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.200]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:34.000]  powerful shadow state, at least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  has fallen.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.480]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:45.280]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:48.800]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.840]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:51.840]  It's here.

[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:07.800]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.960]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:21.520]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:28.720]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:34.720]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:39.680]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:46.480]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.040]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.200]  ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.120]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:00.240]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:10.320]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.320]  All right, Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist.
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.320]  He's written for the Washington Post.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:14.720]  You name it, formally with the National Security Agency.
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:19.760]  He spent months off and on the last six months in Chicago investigating all the mob connections
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.040]  to Obama.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:27.120]  And he's got a report out that he's getting threats and may even leave the country headline
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.640]  White House threats, must be taken seriously, it's up on infowars.com.
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:34.560]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes from now.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.200]  I'm going to get to some of your calls, but also some other important news.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.760]  Now, we did over 60 Google bombs.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.600]  Every one of them became the number one search term.
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:46.160]  And that was 60 different events.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:50.840]  Sometimes we would do one, two, three, four, five terms in a row would be number one through
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:54.080]  number three, number one through number five.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:00.640]  People change their algorithm to quote, target alternative media sites and content farms
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.360]  like DrudgeReport.com, infowars.com.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.760]  And we did see some traffic issues, but we're growing so fast.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:10.240]  We're still growing despite that, but it did take some of our steam out of us.
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.880]  Now I've done three or four Google bombs in the last month.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.320]  I've slowed down on them just because I don't want to wear it out.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.840]  It's such an effective tool.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:23.240]  And we've done, I guess three or four of them and a couple of them didn't work.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.480]  Like the Max Kaiser one last week didn't work.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:32.400]  So we need to do a test today with a very simple term to see if they're blocking my
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.800]  name or if they're blocking the algorithm, the system with their algorithm.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.040]  You go to the Google search box, you put Alex Jones in and you hit enter.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.280]  Then you go and click the cursor in the middle of Alex Jones to make it a new search.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.680]  You don't have to reenter the whole name, just click on it and then hit enter again
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.800]  and do that about 50 times.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:54.960]  And the power of this audience, millions of listeners, it will be number one if, now
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.360]  the good news is, even though they've been obviously manipulating it, one day when we
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.680]  failed last week, the show reared on History Channel about Bohemian Grove.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.760]  So it went to number one.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.480]  People were organically searching that.
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.400]  So already our terms, our videos, our stories, liberty issues, they're already routinely
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.200]  in the top 10 search terms.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:20.320]  And they've released yearly numbers, you know, that Alex Jones info wars.com is always
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.240]  in the top 50 or so.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:26.360]  This last year was in the top 10, naturally on its own.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:29.480]  So they're not going to stop us, but they're trying to slow us down.
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.200]  So search the term Alex Jones.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  Also search six, just the number, don't spell it out, six year old groped, six year old
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:45.160]  groped, and it'll probably be the top term or top search, they have two different systems.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.760]  And let's get that out to expose the six year old.
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:53.040]  And speaking of that, we played part of the newscast earlier, where we now find out more
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:58.280]  of what happened than just what somebody in line about to be searched with his children.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.480]  You hear those children saying, I don't want them to touch me.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:02.280]  I don't want them to do that to my clothes.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.880]  I mean, think of little kids, two year olds, three year olds, five year olds, seven, eight,
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:07.120]  nine year olds.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.120]  Think about your children.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:12.120]  I mean, my children are pretty outgoing, but sometimes I'll take them to a public event
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.200]  or something and they kind of, with a big crowd of people, grab my leg and people say,
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:20.280]  hi, hi there little girl, hi there little boy and they kind of, that's a normal instinct
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.640]  for a child to not like strangers right away so that they don't get kidnapped.
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:27.840]  I mean, it's a good instinct.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:30.040]  It's kind of like a puppy.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:33.160]  You've had a puppy for a month, it's real rambunctious and happy.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.160]  When the repairman comes over to fix the refrigerator, the puppy hides between your legs.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.600]  That's a normal mammal instinct.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:45.660]  So you're at a checkpoint, there's people in uniforms, I've seen them at TSA in Houston
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:50.640]  screaming at people, yelling, freaking out when the lines get too long.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:55.160]  You're being yelled at, you're putting a machine, mommy can't be in there with you.
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.840]  It's hitting you with radiation, then they take you out.
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:00.920]  On top of it, people say, well, just do the scan, you won't do the search.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.920]  They're doing both folks.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:02.920]  That was always the plan.
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:07.520]  Then for two minutes, she sticks her hand down the girl's pants, grabs her buttocks,
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.720]  hands or fingers through her hair, I mean, this is incredible.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.240]  People 10 years ago, if a cop randomly pulled you over and started doing this to your kid,
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:16.920]  most people would get violent.
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:21.900]  They're training you that the government can get in your space and force vaccines on you,
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.560]  take blood tests, they take your baby's blood at birth.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.600]  That's now declassified, admitted.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:29.680]  This is the criminal nature of these people.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:37.720]  I wanted to cut to a piece that is in the article up on infowars.com.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:42.760]  We have the quote in the article, parents threatened by TSA before six-year-old was
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:47.360]  groped, girl then broke down in tears.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.400]  When you read down here, here's the transcript.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:55.680]  Initially, she was just confused, Todd Drexel said, the doctor, after she broke down crying
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:00.560]  because she really didn't understand what she'd done wrong, and then kids also asked,
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.840]  they asked Michelle here in my office when it happened, mommy, I thought strangers aren't
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.720]  supposed to touch me, much less touch me on my privates.
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:13.200]  Think about Jesse Ventura, grab, I mean, Ron Paul, they do it to everybody.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:18.440]  And if you don't like it, they throw you out and then give you an $11,000 fine.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:21.240]  And now they're going to be on the streets of America.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.960]  They're going to say they did ask for alternatives.
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.600]  I asked for her to be re-scanned, they just refused and said they were going to do what
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:28.960]  they were going to do.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.240]  Selena Drexel said, adding the TSA supervisor made it clear in a nonverbal way, bowing up,
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.160]  that there would be trouble, 90% of communication is nonverbal.
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.680]  If the parents caused a fuss and refused, and that was a quote, to allow the pat down to
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:44.680]  be completed.
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:49.520]  It's not a pat down, it's a groping, I've had district attorneys on saying it's illegal,
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.520]  it's criminal.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.680]  They'll start indicting these people and there are a bunch of states, now nine states, passing
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:58.560]  laws on the verge of passing laws saying they're going to have the state police come arrest
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.560]  your butt.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.720]  You understand that?
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.560]  The cops aren't above the law, I'm not above the law, Barack Obama isn't above the law,
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:10.440]  and these TSA people under Homeland Security power grab, you're not above the law.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:16.000]  So let's play the clip of this upstanding, good looking couple, doctor, his wife, his
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.480]  children, I mean, you know, if they can do it to these people, they can do it to anybody.
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:23.600]  And that's who they target, they're training Americans who'd never be in police contact
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:25.520]  to be basically prisoners.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.600]  Here it is from ABC News this morning.
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:37.040]  What was your little girl's reaction as this was happening and afterwards?
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.360]  I think initially she was just confused, but she's very respectful adults, yes ma'am, yes
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:49.240]  ma'am, didn't she was asked to do, and afterward she broke down with crying because she really
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:51.160]  didn't understand what she'd done wrong.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.480]  And so we were really struggling with how do we explain this because we've really stressed
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.600]  her, you know, and it sounded like she had touched here in these certain places, and
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.560]  now she's been pat down in a public setting in an airport, and she was upset and crying,
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:07.560]  so we had to try to explain this to her, it was very difficult.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.520]  I'm sure it was very confusing to her, and yes we could hear her, she's so well-mannered
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.760]  and we could hear her saying yes ma'am, to the agent.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:21.920]  There's a lot of questions as to why you decided to post this on YouTube for others
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.760]  to see, and what is your hope will come of this, Selena?
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:33.320]  Well, my reason for posting it was that we just had a very bad feeling that, you know,
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:37.440]  what happened was wrong, and I posted it out there to get other people's opinions on it
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.800]  and to see, you know, to get some other people's thoughts on it.
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:46.880]  We felt that it was inappropriate, you know, we struggled to teach our child to protect
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:49.200]  ourselves and say no.
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.000]  And to say no, this is training your child not to say no, that's what the school drills
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:57.120]  are, they load them on buses, take them to federal centers where they announce that their
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:01.720]  homeschoolers come to kill them, it's about just training kids to have learned helplessness.
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:05.800]  Now originally when this went on the web, it was other sources, and so that's why we
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.840]  thought somebody else shot it, because you can hear other children off camera saying,
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.600]  I don't want them to touch my clothes, I don't want them to touch me there, you can hear,
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:15.720]  you can hear it in the audio if you boost it, and then they lead her away for a quote
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:20.400]  drug test, it never really becomes clear what that was, but now we're learning more of what
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.280]  happened here, and I do want to get these parents on the show, obviously everybody else
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:29.080]  in the world is going to be trying to do that, who has a media platform, but we're on that
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.080]  today, but we're going to be talking more about this to come, because if they can get
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:39.440]  away with this, they can get away with everything, again I'm going to repeat this, the state
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.360]  lies and says you've got to take vaccines, it's the law, there is no law, it's all
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.640]  color of law fraud, these are criminals, the state takes your baby's blood at birth for
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:57.800]  almost 40 years, this has been going on since 1972, by the way it goes on in Australia and
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:04.360]  England and Europe since the early 1970's, it's global, a global secret program of taking
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:09.640]  your blood and DNA testing and putting a record of it, and then selling it to big pharma who
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.480]  then patents your unique blood proteins, that's how a lot of this started coming out a few
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:19.320]  years ago, we of course reported on it more than a decade ago, so there's an example
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:24.600]  of who these criminals are, who this system is, they're a pack of lying scum, why do you
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:27.680]  think the government's been caught all over the world, our government and others, nerve
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:32.280]  gassing their own troops, testing radiation, biologicals on their own troops, the UN injecting
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:37.840]  people with live polio, live syphilis, our own pentagon doing it, our own department
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.760]  of health doing it, in the US, in other countries, it comes out every week now, new stuff, they're
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:50.040]  testing their federal, their state, their jail guards, their jail doctors doing tests
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:57.680]  in Huntsville, Texas, it comes out, sometimes lethal stuff, it's to create an army of evil,
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.200]  and to see if scientists and government doctors will follow these orders for the quote greater
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.680]  good, then it creates cadres of people that will keep things secret, and then that those
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:13.080]  armies of evil people go out and recruit others to create even bigger armies of evil, I mean
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:22.480]  they kept it secret for decades that the 1959 total meltdown at Semmy Valley, Southern
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:29.840]  California, into LA, radiated the many times, 200 plus times ABC News reported worse, worse
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:36.480]  than Three Mile Island, and no one knew for decades, this is a group that practices secrecy,
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:39.520]  they couldn't keep it secret, the government went ahead and admitted they did it, when
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:42.920]  they felt like it, kind of like all over the country, they kept it secret, they're
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:47.960]  using laptops, school laptops to watch kids, now schools just admit they're watching them
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:58.080]  at home, it's just like Gulf of Tonkin kept secret from 64 to 2004, 40 years that the
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged, how did we know it was staged, well because some of the top
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.680]  officers on the ships, when they got back six months later after their rotation to San
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:14.400]  Diego, told the San Diego Herald Tribune in 1964 that the ships were not attacked and
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:18.800]  it was a lie, then that became a rumor as folks didn't have the original newspaper,
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:23.880]  so you recall the conspiracy theorist for 40 years until they declassified it 2004 and
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.320]  released LBJ on the phone with McNamara, Secretary of Defense saying the day before, we're going
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.560]  to stage this, then the day, get ready it's going to happen, this is what you tell the
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:36.720]  press conference tomorrow, and LBJ is taking orders going alright I tell them, I tell them,
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.240]  we leave it kind of nebulous where they don't know, alright just remember not to be too
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:45.800]  clear exactly in case other stuff comes out, okay well thank you Mr. President, I mean
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:50.640]  it's just a group of con artists scum filled taking your baby's blood at birth, now sticking
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:54.360]  their hands down their pants, what does it take to get people to wake up to the fact
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.560]  that the country's been taken over by tyrants, it's illegitimate, we got to remove the stinking
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.080]  government.

[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:08.200]  Alex Jones here with key information, the US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:12.600]  on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:18.960]  banks, with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation,
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.840]  and the US antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:29.800]  which is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries,
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:34.200]  our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US Dollar will soon become
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:39.160]  worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed,

[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:17.640]  is a test, he'll send them to infowars.com and prisonpana.com, let's also search 6 year
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:24.560]  old groped, the number 6 year old groped, hit them, hit them hard, during the breaks
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:28.160]  I've been entering those terms into Google over and over again, hit them, hit them hard,
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:32.760]  it's getting harder to do this, let's see if it's the new algorithm blocking us, let's
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:39.160]  jam in a few calls ahead of Wayne Madsen joining us, Randy in Nebraska, you're on the year.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.840]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:42.840]  Pretty good sir.
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:47.520]  Hey Alex, I got a couple questions for you, the silver and the gold that you all suggest
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:54.120]  to buy you and Lindsay, is it good to buy bullion, gold or silver because I did call the metal
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:00.080]  place on your line and they're telling me that I should buy coins, collectible coins
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:09.600]  from 1964 and under and I did get Lindsay's new DVD set, very, very good on knowledge,
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:15.120]  he tells us to collect 6 months of food and medical supplies, I need to try to find out
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:17.360]  what type of medical he's talking about.
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:23.720]  All right Randy, let me be specific, the sister company of Genesis is a gold and silver company
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.880]  and the deals that I endorse and all their deals are very competitive, some of them are
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:31.720]  smoking hot, others are just moderately good, they have a whole spectrum, it depends on
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.400]  how good a deal they get on it, Ted buys gold and silver when it's down, you know as it
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:42.440]  dips on its way, overall way up and then he sells it when it's up at the old price, that's
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.360]  how he's extremely competitive and is now the fifth or fourth largest gold and silver
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.920]  broker in the country, so it's through that volume, but a lot of the silver coins they
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:59.320]  sell at extremely competitive or even hyper-competitive prices already have a numismatic value because
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:03.840]  he got a great deal on them, so they're collector, you know, semi-collector, it's not like they're
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.560]  super valuable just for the collector value, they're overall valuable because of the gold
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:14.680]  and silver that's in them, okay and I'm no silver or gold coin master, but I personally
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:20.480]  buy bullion, American that's recognized, some of the British and other stuff's recognized
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:25.680]  even more globally, Krugerans are recognized, French Franks, European Franks, Swiss Franks,
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:31.000]  things like that, whatever I get a great deal on, I mainly have American silver dollars
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.720]  and silver half dollars and most of those are 50, 60, 70, 80, some 100 years old and
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.560]  I'll get a little bag of them from Ted and one of them's 120 years old and others 80
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:50.440]  years old and others 75 years old, but generally I would look at whatever spot prices are
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:54.160]  and you can, I would get something called the red book, I know Ted's been sold out
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:58.840]  of him but he's getting some more, a yearly book that breaks down at the time it was printed,
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.120]  what collector coins are really worth, it's kind of like a Kelly Blue book on cars, but
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:07.960]  I think if you're just now getting into gold and silver, I would basically buy bullion,
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:12.840]  here's the problem, so called American bullion, American eagles, the gold coins, the mint
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:16.680]  or buffaloes are putting out, those a lot of times because the mint sells out of them
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:25.080]  so fast, those will be way above some numismatic 70 year old gold coin, I mean it varies just
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.640]  because those are so recognized and in such demand, so the safest thing to do and go with
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.280]  minus, I know you'll always get a good deal, but if you want the absolute best deal, I
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:38.520]  would go with the radio specials, because the brokers are going to offer you other things
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.360]  but I would say no, I heard Alex say those three silver dollars, three of his films,
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.360]  and free shipping for 110, I think it may go up a little bit but ask him, haven't talked
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:51.760]  to Ted on air this week yet, haven't talked to him this week have I, I don't think so,
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:58.520]  so just bring that up, if you hear a deal for a gold sovereign or a frank, that price
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:01.760]  that's offered, it'll generally be a little bit lower than what you even see on their
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.520]  Midas Resources website, but I hope that answers your question Randy.
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:13.320]  It did, do you see when, what Lindsay says about the barrel, the crude oil getting up
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.800]  to $200 a barrel, when everything escalates, do you see a civil war happening over here
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.720]  with everybody being so used in?
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:28.120]  I think that if it does go anywhere near that price, you will see food riots and things
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:31.920]  because the amount of food stamps they're going to hand out won't be able to buy enough
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:37.440]  food or if the welfare checks will still flow, it's just that they're saying they're
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.520]  going to freeze their size, freeze the social security size, no cola because of the cost
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.480]  of living increase, people are going to get very, very uncomfortable, the gas prices are
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:52.520]  going to suck out other discretionary income, it's going to increase all other major prices,
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:57.200]  foods going up because of commodity issues but also energy and transportation cost and
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:02.000]  then I see the system using that as a pretext to come in and clamp down and then say, see,
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:09.120]  you're your saviors, so yes, I do see that on the radar in a big way but that's just
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.880]  common sense, do I know the hour of the time, do I know exactly where it'll flare up, no.
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:18.480]  Okay, thanks for taking my call Alex, I appreciate it, God bless you and your family.
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:22.400]  You bet, now God bless you and I want to get to Christian, Pat, Rich and Eric but I got
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.080]  a guest coming up, we'll try to get to those callers, meant to get to a few more callers
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:31.240]  but that guy had a complex question, well it's a simple question but it's a large detailed
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:34.280]  answer and I'll only scratch the surface, I should have Ted on some day for maybe a
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.720]  whole hour to really, I can get the red book out of Golden Silver Coins and other collector
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:46.040]  coins and go over it but they're super collective stuff, they're moderately collectible and
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:50.160]  there's a semi that has some collector value on top of it and a lot of those are more inexpensive
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.560]  than regular bullion.
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:30:01.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:05.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:09.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:14.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:19.360]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:21.320]  grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:25.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:33.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:36.880]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:41.520]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:45.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.800]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:53.720]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government

[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:02.120]  Thank you.
[02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:13.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:14.360]  at home.
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:19.040]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:20.040]  calling the shots.
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:25.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:30.840]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:35.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:40.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:41.920]  saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:47.920]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.920]  of the Republic.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:55.360]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[02:32:55.360 --> 02:33:22.360]  now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv Well here's the headline, it's at WayneMansinReport.com,
[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:32.720]  it's also on infowars.com, White House threats must be taken seriously, WayneMansin of course
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:37.320]  is a Washington D.C. based investigative journalist, author and syndicated columnist, he's written
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:42.240]  for The Village Voice, The Progressive Counterpunch, Online Journal, The American Conservative,
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:48.200]  Fox News, CNN, RT, Madsen has been invited to testify as a witness before the U.S. House
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:53.080]  of Representatives, the U.N. criminal tribunal and for Rwanda and anti-terrorism investigation
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:57.360]  panel for the French government, Madsen has some 20-plus years of experience in security
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:02.680]  issues as a former U.S. naval officer and anti-submarine command, he managed one of
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:06.560]  the first computer security programs for the U.S. Navy, subsequently worked for the National
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.360]  Security Agency, the Naval Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:16.640]  and Computer Science Corporation, Madsen was a senior fellow for the Electronic Privacy
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.680]  Information Center, a privacy public advocacy organization and of course we had the D.C.
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:27.480]  Madamon, thanks to him giving us her contact, he knew her well when she had a lot of documents
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:30.120]  and things and was going to try to give them to her mother, she was found dead at her mother's
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:33.960]  house, I had the condo manager on who she was good friends with saying she was being
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:37.400]  followed, she had to get these documents to her mother, they killed her at the house,
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:41.080]  hung her in the shed, called it a suicide and put out a fake letter that wasn't even
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:44.680]  her handwriting, it was not even something a 10-year-old could do a better job of.
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:50.800]  I would take this serious because Wayne is a consultant for international television programs
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.880]  like RT, Wayne is gaining in stature and he's always had a big effect, anytime you watch
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:01.320]  a national security hearing, you'll see Wayne in the background reporting on it, he also
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:07.920]  gives briefings of the National Press Club and he spent months off and on in Chicago
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:12.760]  and other areas of the country investigating all these mafia ties that are public with
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.240]  Obama and he's brought out some of that info, Wayne with these new threats, first tell us
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:23.480]  about the threats through your credible sources, reports that you might even leave the country,
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:29.080]  what's happening there and then B, whatever data you got for all of us here and for your
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:34.160]  own safety as I told the DC madam and she didn't listen and I know you're a smart guy,
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.440]  whatever you found out, I know you like to double triple check and vet everything but
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.920]  whatever it is you found out in Chicago that you haven't been ready to report yet because
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.800]  you're still digging, you better get it out now or we all know what's going to happen
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:51.080]  and then C, I want to get you on record saying you're not planning to commit suicide or go
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:53.160]  swimming with lead shoes.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:36:00.240]  Well, yes, the report that I received was from a very credible source without getting
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:06.200]  into identifying who I can say it was a source with a very large foreign newspaper here in
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:17.240]  Washington and his information came from his contacts in his embassy which are largely
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:23.920]  intelligence contacts, the country in question is an ally in the United States so it's not
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:30.960]  Russia or China or anything like that and then this threat was verified by another source
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:35.560]  that I had within the State Department who said look, I don't like what you write but
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:41.080]  I know it's true but you have to understand you're a marked man.
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:47.280]  Now the other threat specifically said the people in the White House want to kill you
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:55.960]  and I said, yeah, you know, there are people, I said, is that figurative, he said no, it's
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.920]  literal and I had to take that threat seriously because of the statuaries.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.440]  Okay, let me interrupt you because your Skype video and audio was breaking up a bit.
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:10.520]  No back 60 seconds, go over both the sources and the particular source with them saying
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.080]  the White House literally wants to kill you.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.080]  Repeat that.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:22.680]  Yes, what I heard was the White House, they want to kill you, I said, oh, is that figurative?
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:31.280]  He said no, it's literal, he said they mean it and I had threats before but I took this
[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:35.880]  one rather seriously and then I go back and I look at what the Nixon administration tried
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:41.000]  to do with Jack Anderson, they did try to kill him, it's documented, they were going
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  to poison him but he was a teetotaling Mormon, they couldn't do that, they were talking about
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.640]  staging a car accident where he would be incinerated in his car.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:57.480]  They also tried to cause problems between him and his wife by suggesting putting outward
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.680]  that Anderson was gay.
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:06.320]  They've had Glenn Beck doing that to me now, just completely ridiculous with no evidence
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.080]  so I don't care, it's not true.
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:13.040]  They've also liked to call my wife women saying I've gotten them pregnant, then when she doesn't
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:17.080]  buy it a guy comes on the line and threatens her, do you think, I want to get more into
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:23.200]  your story but it came out last year that I'm number 49 of 50 people on the White House
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.240]  Enemies list, no 43, should I be concerned, Wayne?
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:34.520]  I think we all have to be concerned because we have a record of what the Nixon administration,
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:39.400]  G. Gordon-Liddy, Charles Coulson and E. Howard Hunt, who actually Hunt was not big on the
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:45.200]  idea of taking out Anderson and even J. Edgar Hoover thought that was a crazy idea but we
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.200]  have to, because there is a precedent that has been set and we have to take it seriously
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:57.040]  and there's another issue, I've been told that how they deal with recalcitrant journalists
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.800]  and also whistleblowers, they have a playbook they use.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:08.160]  Step one is to isolate the target, now that is try to drive a wedge between the target
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:09.920]  and his friends and family.
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:16.240]  Number two, they try to take the target out of the public eye, getting their bylines out
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:23.120]  of publications, getting their name off out of the chyrons on the television programs.
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:30.120]  And three, then they put the financial screws to you and when that stage is set, then they
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:35.840]  say, well, the person was despondent and committed suicide.
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:39.640]  We've seen that with Danny Castellaro, a journalist who was whacked in West Virginia
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:40.640]  91.
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:45.160]  Gary Webber who wrote the Pulitzer Puzzling book, shotgun him twice in the head.
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:52.560]  J. H. Hatfield, who was the author of Fortune at Son About Bush, so this is their game plan
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:57.680]  but I will say on your program, just as my friend Gene Palfrey said, I do not have any
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:00.240]  plans to commit suicide.
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:05.320]  I do have plans to leave the country for some extended period of time.
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:10.600]  One of the things I'm going to do is complete the book on Obama and the CIA and all I'll
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:17.840]  say is I'll be backtracking some of the places where he lived when he was younger.
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:23.080]  Okay, let's see, do you think that's what's making him angry at you?
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:29.720]  Well what I understand, you know, obviously the stuff about Chicago they like but what
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:34.400]  they really do not like is the stuff that I've been writing about the background of
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:37.560]  Obama and his family with the CIA.
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.320]  That's something that they don't want to go there.
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:48.320]  They're more than happy to go see the birth certificate stuff out there but let's face
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:56.760]  it the rifling of Obama during the primary season was they were after his passport records
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:00.840]  not his birth records and there's a reason why they were after passport records is because
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:03.280]  what those passport records will show.
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:07.240]  All right Wayne, this is too important and your Skype just broke up for another minute
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:09.040]  and was almost unenchallengable.
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:12.440]  I want you to repeat what you just said if it continues to break up we're going to put
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:15.800]  you on hold and call your cell phone or home phone back.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:22.160]  It's great to have the video but we need to be able to hear the audio so again if I give
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:26.960]  the word in a minute we're going to go ahead and call your cells to get that ready guys.
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:32.040]  Going back here I want to retrace this specifically sounds like the British consulate from what
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:37.760]  you've said but I know you don't want to go there I'm just guessing gave you a warning
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:44.400]  that first came through a major newspaper then you got another warning from inside the
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:48.840]  State Department that no they want you dead I mean was that person basically threatening
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:57.320]  them for you or were they just had it leaked to them knowing that they would tell you.
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:03.320]  The source that the embassy wanted the information to be passed to me and it was not the British
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:06.480]  it was an ally but not the British.
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:12.480]  Okay we had you faded down again there at the start start over slowly go over exactly
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:16.120]  not who the sources are but basically what type of sector they came from and what they
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:18.040]  said specifically.
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:25.520]  Well the source said look they want to kill you I said are they being figurative he said
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:33.400]  no literal the information was passed by an embassy here of an allied country and it was
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:43.040]  passed to this high ranking journalist with a very large newspaper to get it get the information
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:44.040]  to me.
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:47.760]  And what did you get from the US State Department?
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:54.200]  I had a source tell me that there's a State Department source said look we don't like
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:43:01.160]  what you write I don't like what you write but I know it's true and you need to know
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:06.200]  that you have been marked that was the words used.
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:09.840]  You said you don't plan to commit suicide anytime soon be clear you will never commit
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:11.760]  suicide it's not in your head.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:17.840]  No not at all I would you know I'm going to leave the country for some period of time
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:26.800]  to work on this book and just check things out abroad but no suicide is not in the cards
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:28.800]  whatsoever.
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:35.960]  Wayne so you're going to be traveling what to Indonesia to Africa to Pakistan to Occidental
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:38.400]  California to look into Obama.
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:46.320]  Well as many places as my funds will allow there are some leads in some of the some of
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:51.680]  these locations that I want to track down and see if I can actually get some actual
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:57.520]  documentation for the book that I'm hope hopefully I can get this out as we're getting
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:02.000]  into the campaign season this should have been done in the oh wait of course that's
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.760]  probably while they're mad at you because I know for a while you've already been working
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.240]  on this book you've been in Chicago you've been in Florida you've been in Texas you've
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:16.680]  been all over California I know you privately told me three or four months ago that you
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:22.520]  were you know getting some great vine threats over the fact that you spent time in Chicago
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:26.880]  I mean again has anybody telegraphed to you what it is they don't like you're saying it's
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:31.560]  mainly the Obama CIA history.
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.240]  It's that mainly the Obama CIA history obviously they're not they're not too pleased to the
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:42.640]  fact that I've been in a lot of contact with Larry Sinclair who also wrote a book about
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:48.640]  the escapades in Chicago and of course he did attempt to take his own life but he would
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:54.400]  you know some some folks were able to save him and and he's now tied up with this court
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:45:00.880]  battle over the contents of a libel suit over the contents of his book so we we know that
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:07.280]  the White House likes to play hardball on people who delve too much into Obama and his
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:09.800]  family's background.
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:13.480]  Well now we hear this sister that nobody's ever heard about come out and say sure he
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:18.560]  lived in Hawaii but regardless of what really happened with Kenya and his grandmother saying
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.240]  he was born there and his wife in two speeches a few years ago saying we traveled back to
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:28.000]  his home country you know of Kenya where he was born we know he gave up his citizenship
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.840]  in Indonesia and took the name of Barry Cetero.
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:38.080]  We also know that he had a step sister in Indonesia who died a few years ago we there's
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:42.760]  very little information on what caused her death she was about the same age as Obama
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:47.760]  so it wasn't you know something from old age or something like that but but there's a lot
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:54.560]  of question marks about him and I just think writing the book here with this like sort
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:46:01.280]  of Damocles hanging over my head I for peace of mind I need to complete this this book.
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:08.160]  Well you're a big security computer expert a journalist a national security expert a
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.040]  leading one I'm a layman but but explain to me it sounds like you're going out of the
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:17.240]  frying pan into the oven or the fire leaving the US I mean a long arm of the corporate
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:23.160]  mafia you think you're going to be safer ferreting around looking for his history in in in in
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.000]  these countries.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:31.480]  Well I think I think that you know you might think that when you go abroad that you might
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:37.000]  be subject to the CIA or something you know but there's a I think there's a better support
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.920]  network of people abroad who understand what's going on inside the United States who are
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:46.880]  more than willing to take the extra measure to provide the security necessary because
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:47.880]  they know the truth.
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:52.440]  I mean also you're tipping your hand here you're saying you've got countries embassy
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:55.320]  people you know that you're going to go to a country where you're going to be provided
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:56.320]  security.
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:57.320]  Yes.
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:46:58.320]  Yeah.
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:03.160]  And essentially yes I I wouldn't be going into these countries if I didn't have a support
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:11.240]  network there that's already basically invited me to come and track down some of these leads.
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:17.160]  Well buddy we hope we get to interview you in the future because I remember warning the
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:23.760]  DC Madame Palfrey here on this show and this isn't a joke folks I risk my life every day
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.920]  I passed the point or return a long time ago I'm committed to this so are you.
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:30.360]  I hope listeners understand this is real.
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:35.120]  I mean how many people connected to exposing Clinton how many police investigators private
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:41.240]  investigators that are consided during the Clinton administration.
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:42.240]  Oh absolutely.
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  I mean when you and it's all like I said start it with the Nixon administration and our enemies
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.960]  list actually it's well documented trying to kill Anderson.
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:57.280]  We know that they they've gone after other journalists as well not killing them but certainly
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:03.360]  had them fired from their jobs we have ample evidence of that and quite recently ample
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:10.320]  evidence of that and I think anytime a threat like that is conveyed from White House sources
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:14.840]  it has to it just has to be taken seriously it's not something like oh well they must
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.360]  be kidding or they're exaggerating no the history history of this doesn't suggest that
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:22.040]  they they are kidding.
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:27.120]  What about public letters to Congress and the White House putting them on notice that
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:31.480]  your sources journalistic sources of the highest caliber have warned you about this so that
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:34.840]  there's even more of a public record.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:39.600]  Well you know I mean Congress you know garbage and you know it's a black hole the stuff goes
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:42.440]  in there that you know nothing ever comes out.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.040]  The other thing I want to state too is it's it's it's getting increasingly difficult covering
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:53.320]  Washington DC because that my sources are drying up faster than a puddle in the Sahara
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:54.320]  Desert.
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:59.960]  They're under they're they're just fearful of being exposed because the Justice Department
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:07.040]  has been more yeah the Justice Department has been publicly burning mild whistleblowers.
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:13.480]  Right we have Thomas Drake the former NSA official now being charged under the Espionage
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:17.600]  Act for providing unclassified information to the Baltimore Sun.
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:23.120]  The fourth only the fourth such case since the act was enacted during World War One.
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:29.760]  In this case Obama's worse than Bush believe it or not when it comes to how they're handling
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:35.240]  whistleblowers there's a fear a fear has set in here in Washington.
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:38.800]  I have sources drying up left and right they don't want to talk anymore because they see
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:42.880]  what happens to some of these other people they were they were concerned during Bush
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:48.200]  but they were much more willing to talk during the Bush administration unlike this one.
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:51.520]  Wayne I want to hold you five minutes in the next hour so we have two more little five
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.080]  minute segments with you but I'm going to ask this question now we're going to reconnect
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.040]  via regular phone with you because your sky's breaking up too much when we go to break here
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:03.320]  in about a minute but before we do that let me just pose the question now you can think
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:08.840]  about during the break we have the White House regulations are saying arrest people that
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:14.800]  disagree with the government infiltrate their groups cognitive dissonance set them up two
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:21.440]  weeks ago Politico gets the memos from last year inside of media matters George Soros
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:25.720]  groups saying we're going to destroy the alternative media starting with Fox News I think that's
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:32.920]  popular and other sites critical of the administration we're going to guerrilla warfare destroy them
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:37.960]  so this is a very scary group here so who do you think they're going to send after you
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:45.680]  a Chicago mafia a CIA hit man I mean what quarters do you think this you know them knocking
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:50.440]  you on the head or giving you a shot and holding you up and putting that that tourniquet around
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:53.720]  your neck I mean folks they'll do it they'll kill him better than a hammer and they'll
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:57.800]  send a message to everybody I mean they'll kill me I mean let me tell you folks that's
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:05.520]  a real possibility the US economy is at a tipping point 40 cents of every dollar the

[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:19.040]  has got to stand up to him Wayne we went to break there I brought up the admissions of
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:23.960]  the White House regulations are of Co and tell pro and how great it is the bizarre memos
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:30.040]  out of George Soros media matters about guerrilla warfare against alternative media the people
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:34.720]  in media matters who listen every day and write about the show every few days those
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:38.920]  interns listening they need to understand they they're going to end up if we get victory
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:44.920]  against them going down like Nixon's people well that's right and and I have to say that
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:51.320]  I have I have seen how almost every group including those who's supposedly protested
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:56.480]  the Obama administration have been totally infiltrated the anti-war movement some of
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:02.440]  these other groups some of these privacy organizations civil liberties organizations
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:09.920]  all infiltrated all with Soros money for the most part and it makes the Nixon's enemies
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:17.440]  list look like you know a shopping shopping list Wayne when are you planning to leave
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:22.480]  the United States well without getting into details it's not it's not easy to just pick
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:30.280]  up after being here for so long to go elsewhere but it will be in the next next few weeks
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:40.040]  maybe a month or so is there any part of your investigation in Chicago or into his CIA grooming
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:45.720]  background you have any intel you haven't released that you can get out here now it'll
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:55.440]  lessen the chances of them whacking you well all I can say is there's a we know that ex-governor
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:01.240]  Blagojevic's trial begins the end of this month in Chicago there's a lot of information
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:07.840]  that the the prosecutors are suppressing I think it'll show what was really going on
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:15.440]  in inside Chicago politics with the the Olympics trying to get the Olympics scam and who was
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:21.640]  going to benefit from that Valerie Jarrett Michelle Obama the late head of the school
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:27.040]  board Michael Scott who was found dead in the Chicago River with a bullet this head
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:33.800]  which is still not been resolved as a suicide by the Chicago PD that I think is what we're
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:42.840]  going to find is in addition to some of the senior sides of Obama and Romo Manuel's past
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:47.720]  what about CIA background with Obama you must be getting close if they're after you well
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:54.040]  I think that's what's got them more concerned than anything else I've been going especially
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:58:01.000]  and Stanley Stanley and Dunham his mother I mean it was quite clear that her whole history
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:09.720]  was invented she was not some flower child hippie bohemian type she was a graduate of
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:16.760]  the University of Hawaii in anthropology and is immersed in post a coup in Indonesia where
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  they they killed 800,000 to a million people courtesy of the military she was a minion
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:29.080]  of the big foundations and Geithner's papa board foundation the World Bank you name it
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:34.360]  she was in all those never was on food stamps in her entire life she was above CIA level

[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:25.160]  Madsen report.com and he's a particularly bad Skype and phone line today and he just dropped
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:31.800]  we're getting him back on for a final few questions here he has said that he is getting ready to leave
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:37.560]  the United States and for somebody who hasn't gotten government death threats where they let
[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:41.080]  you know they're listening to your phones and tell you things you were talking about five minutes
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:45.640]  before ten minutes before before they threaten you you know at that point you're just like I
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:50.280]  can't live in fear I just got to go all out against you people and I don't even really look over my
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:55.800]  shoulder I don't want to die I love life so much I love my children more than life itself but it is
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:01.960]  what it is somebody's got to commit against these people somebody has got to have the courage to say
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:11.240]  no to the new world order somebody has got to realize just how serious these globalists are
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:17.480]  and that they're totally ruthless I mean America is being turned into one giant femacamp with the
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:22.360]  children trained to have the government molesting them to have the parents trained to turn their
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:27.080]  kids over the government taking blood samples from babies at birth now admittedly for close to four
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:33.960]  decades it just has to end it has to stop we've got to at least slow it down but instead of slowing
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:37.960]  it down what's happening is there's a huge awakening happening and the globalists are
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:46.360]  just putting things into high gear they are putting the entire system into high gear we got Wayne
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:51.240]  back we only got about three minutes Wayne Madsen anything else you'd like to add anything else
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:58.280]  you're in you're looking into you know dealing with these direct you know major media telling you
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:03.160]  and the State Department telling you look the word is they want you dead I mean clearly
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:08.280]  they wanted this message to get to you that they are planning to kill you well I I of course did
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:13.560]  a sanity check on myself and ran this by some very close colleagues of mine who are journalists
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:20.680]  and I you know I let them know what the source was and they were you know really concerned and
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:27.880]  upset that you know they said you have to take that seriously so I mean it's not just something
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:36.600]  that was passed over the transom as a sort of an idle threat I did that this with others who
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:45.320]  kind of urged me to you know take it seriously and of course do the right thing so I think I think
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:52.120]  just that Washington is not a good place to be right now there's no access for independent journalists
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:03:00.360]  there's no there's there's the sources are drying up it's almost like covering a politics in Pyongyang
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:05.960]  North Korea here now Wayne are we gonna be able to get you back up in the next few weeks before
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:11.240]  you leave the country oh absolutely well maybe we should get you on a good phone line and have you
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:15.960]  for a full hour or before you leave the country you're welcome to come down here to Austin and
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:20.600]  be in studio where this we might be able to in fact we will if you want we'll buy you a plane
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:25.400]  ticket and put you up here for two or three days maybe you can be our in-studio analyst for a couple
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:29.960]  days you want to after you get here after you move out of your apartment or box everything up or
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:34.440]  whatever you're planning you want to come down to Austin absolutely I'd be happy to do that well
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:39.320]  we've got to hang together or certainly hang separate and our founding fathers went through
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:43.640]  similar things they had British death warrants out on their heads and John Hancock knowing they'd
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:47.960]  come after his land his family he signed his name the biggest at the top and he said if I'm
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:53.880]  gonna be on the list I want to be on the top of the list absolutely but but doesn't this enclosing
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:59.800]  signify that they're scared they're desperate they're not invincible oh I think so the thing is
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:05.640]  they're doing damage control now they they don't want any surprises coming out because the the smart
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:12.040]  money is on Obama getting reelected because we see this you know the circus on the other side
[03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:17.400]  and so that's where all the smart Wall Street money is four more years of Obama
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:22.360]  to carry out their agenda which he's doing quite quite nicely and has been uh and we'll
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:28.200]  hear more about that with his speech tonight that's right he's announcing a new tax code to help us
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:35.320]  black this is this is help we don't need Wayne absolutely and the devil will be in the details
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:40.520]  I'm sure Wayne while we have you I'm gonna put you on hold here at the end of this segment we're
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:45.880]  gonna go ahead and look at the book next week and look for a time to get you on and maybe give us
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:51.720]  off record a ballpark of wind when you leave town maybe you can make a stop through Austin
[03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:57.080]  so we can physically interview you here I know we've gone to DC interview you before but uh
[03:04:57.080 --> 03:05:15.560]  I'm bless you we'll all pray for your support him at Wayne match and report comm
