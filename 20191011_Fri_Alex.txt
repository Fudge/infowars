[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.760 --> 00:31.160]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:34.760 --> 00:55.920]  Hello, stupid Americans, since the North Chinese Communists were out of here, I told you just
[00:55.920 --> 01:04.400]  a week ago, when you don't do what we say, you die. Look what happened to an Hong Kong protester.
[01:04.400 --> 01:11.400]  Oh, and don't forget, we killed more than Hitler ever did, and that's why the liberals love us.
[01:11.400 --> 01:25.400]  In America, the colleges that we fund teach no borders, no walls, no USA at all. Let me show you a trained slave.
[01:25.400 --> 01:39.400]  America is a rotting caucus covered in filthy maggots. Look at your own James Harden. He came out and apologized to us.
[01:39.400 --> 01:46.400]  That's good. And now we tell the NBA what to do, and the NBA say yes, master.
[01:46.400 --> 01:52.400]  Yeah, we apologize. You know, we love China, we love, you know, playing there.
[01:52.400 --> 02:03.400]  Finally, you saw what happened to South Park. They talk about our education camps, and our death camps, and how winning the pool is banned.
[02:03.400 --> 02:11.400]  And let me now tell you what happens. They banned in our country, and they put out sarcastic apology. That's not good enough.
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.400]  Once we take over, we're going to kill the South Park producers. That's what we do.
[02:18.400 --> 02:29.400]  Everyone is adopting our model. Big Tech is censoring Alex Jones, and now even Republican leaders, and they do nothing.
[02:29.400 --> 02:38.400]  Soon, sites like that in my video will be shut down. You stinking Americans do not share that site on info-war.com.
[02:38.400 --> 02:49.400]  Submit to not sign back. Do what I say.
[02:49.400 --> 02:58.400]  I just caught you, American. You visited Band-Aid video. Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[02:58.400 --> 03:09.400]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Band-Aid video, or I have to hurt you.
[03:09.400 --> 03:17.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, October 11, 2000. At 19, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:17.400 --> 03:23.400]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours, and I'm going to open the phones up throughout the full four hours.
[03:23.400 --> 03:33.400]  In fact, I had some guests scheduled. I've canceled those guests. I specifically want to open up the College of Ideas here, people that agree, people that disagree.
[03:33.400 --> 03:42.400]  On your views, if impeachment is inevitable, like Pat Buchanan is saying it is, and I respect Pat Buchanan, well, what comes next?
[03:42.400 --> 03:49.400]  Well, we'll look at those different possible futures here on air, and why is it inevitable?
[03:49.400 --> 03:55.400]  Well, we have a bunch of cowards in Congress that are being blackmailed and are being threatened and are being controlled.
[03:55.400 --> 04:02.400]  And I really don't think it's inevitable, but Trump has it in his power to act.
[04:02.400 --> 04:09.400]  Now, this rhetoric last night was amazing. This is the second best speech he's given since the United Nations.
[04:09.400 --> 04:23.400]  The UN speech was very focused, was not done in a Don Corleone meets a comedian version. Very funny, very entertaining, very serious issues he was covering, though.
[04:23.400 --> 04:31.400]  I was here last night hosting live with Will Johnson, giving live coverage of it, and that's archived a band on video.
[04:31.400 --> 04:41.400]  We're going to play large sections of the speech today in the second and the third hour, and of course we'll be taking your calls throughout that.
[04:41.400 --> 04:48.400]  But there really is a paradox here. When it comes to actually inditing any of the deep staters, we're seeing none of that.
[04:48.400 --> 04:53.400]  But some people that really had no connection to Trump, that barely knew Giuliani, they'd been indicted.
[04:53.400 --> 05:01.400]  And of course, we don't see any action on the Internet censorship. We see a lot of talk, but no action on that as well.
[05:01.400 --> 05:09.400]  And so, if Trump gets taken down, Trump has Donald Trump to blame, then we're really in deep crap with that.
[05:09.400 --> 05:19.400]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago, and they've been approving almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[05:19.400 --> 05:27.400]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged with Silicon Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[05:27.400 --> 05:34.400]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China, will, quote, destroy Trump. That's a headline.
[05:34.400 --> 05:42.400]  So Info Wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation. We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right.
[05:42.400 --> 05:52.400]  That's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their Chai Kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[05:52.400 --> 06:17.400]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded. That's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged, is infowarstore.com.
[06:17.400 --> 06:32.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[06:32.400 --> 06:56.400]  You know you make me crazy. And my mind is racing. You're wasting all my time. So I'm gonna save me. Oh yeah. Cause when I need you.
[06:56.400 --> 07:03.400]  Donald Trump's not gonna save us. Grab the same ourselves.
[07:03.400 --> 07:27.400]  Trump is a echo of male bullheadedness and Americana strength. But an echo from the past. A piece of Americana. A lost relic.
[07:27.400 --> 07:40.400]  But if we don't ourselves rediscover what made America great and if we ourselves don't say no to the bullying and the control of the globalists, we're gonna lose everything.
[07:40.400 --> 08:01.400]  Even in quote nationalist or conservative newsrooms, when people talk to you about stories like a man who claims he's a woman at a CNN town hall last night, getting up and saying anyone using the wrong pronoun on me is a physical assault.
[08:01.400 --> 08:21.400]  Well, that's a man dressed up like a woman coming after reality and coming after the First Amendment. I could care less if the person wants to dress up like a woman and looks like a person that's escaped out of a lunatic asylum.
[08:21.400 --> 08:24.400]  That's their issue.
[08:24.400 --> 08:34.400]  That's what this big open free society has created. There's a lot of decadence. But I don't hate that person because they're so cool and a big fat man can put a wig on.
[08:34.400 --> 08:43.400]  But I don't want those big fat men forcing their way in to bounce little kids on their knees pushed by the public schools and the leftist captured churches.
[08:43.400 --> 08:54.400]  Because if a man came in and said he wants to bounce your kid on their knee, you'd say that guy's a pervert. That guy's a divler. That guy's probably a convicted pedophile. A lot of them turned out to be.
[08:54.400 --> 09:05.400]  But when they wear a costume that's even more creepy, we go, oh, it's cultural enrichment and the big corporations force feed it all to us.
[09:05.400 --> 09:13.400]  So while Trump was giving his big speech last night, that's the second best I've seen him give after his UN speech.
[09:13.400 --> 09:22.400]  And really the guy is quite the comedian. It's a very talented soul.
[09:22.400 --> 09:40.400]  I was covering that live last night here on the feeds on the satellite and internet feeds them for wars.com for its last show and band video with my sidekick, my cohost, my compadre, Bill Johnson.
[09:40.400 --> 09:55.400]  And I was hosting its event. And so I went back and watched the archive of it last night while my children safely slept in a home in the final days of America.
[09:55.400 --> 10:13.400]  While their safety slips away like grains of sand through an hourglass, while the once great republic slouches and collapses like a mountain in a rock slide in the sea of insanity and degeneracy.
[10:13.400 --> 10:41.400]  I watched as much as I could bear an hour and a half of it. And it was like an Olympic sport to see what free goodies they could offer, how they could smile the candidates approvingly on to the throng of mental midgets and soulless degenerates dancing to Satan's tune.
[10:41.400 --> 10:57.400]  Pat Buchanan has the article out from worldanddaily.com is impeachment now inevitable.
[10:57.400 --> 11:12.400]  And you look at it, you say the first whistleblowers a hoax, the second whistleblowers a hoax. All here say garbage, we have the transcript. But then why do you smell blood in the wind?
[11:12.400 --> 11:28.400]  I don't know why we smell blood in the wind. It's because you can smell the piss in the wind. And you can see the piss running down the legs of the media. And the piss running down the legs of Congress.
[11:28.400 --> 11:41.400]  Because they're yellow. Because they were bought and bred and created and pushed and put into power. Because they have no power because they're yes man.
[11:41.400 --> 12:01.400]  So now like a paper mache house built out of straw, when the big bad wolf comes along communist China and the big cold blooded mega corporations with their slave factories and their cloning facilities and the big evil future they already built with our ingenuity and our money,
[12:01.400 --> 12:14.400]  that they're just getting ready to unveil for us. First they got to demoralize us. First they got to have convicted pedophiles, have children ride horsey on their erect genitals through their pants.
[12:14.400 --> 12:24.400]  First we got to be told babies are being kept alive and harvested. First we got to have China. Everybody line up and gesticulate and prostrate themselves before them like Mark Cuban.
[12:24.400 --> 12:37.400]  And oh no, China's good. Don't even bring up self expression at a press conference where the NBA grabs the microwave from even CNN.
[12:37.400 --> 12:49.400]  Because this is the war on freedom of expression. The war on everything that comes from that. Your businesses, your children, your life, your religion or the lack of your spirituality.
[12:49.400 --> 12:55.400]  It's all being taken. This is the big globalist offensive.
[12:55.400 --> 13:10.400]  And the system has gone around and harassed and threatened and put reporters and PIs and the IRS on everybody of any prominence that supports Trump, even down to people that rent or buy condos from him.
[13:10.400 --> 13:23.400]  They've all gotten FBI visits. And now the system looks at this big rotting facade and Trump's there with confidence trying to prop it up, but that's not enough.
[13:23.400 --> 13:32.400]  And they decide that they can huff and they can puff and they can blow our house down.
[13:32.400 --> 13:41.400]  In fact, this House of Straw, the wolf doesn't even need to open the door or come down the chimney or blow it down.
[13:41.400 --> 13:58.400]  Because if the three little pigs were inside and they had any baby piglets, they would go out and feed the wolf those piglets and say, eat our babies just so you eat us later.
[13:58.400 --> 14:06.400]  In fact, the wolf even lets them pretend they're wolves. They kind of dress up in wolves outfits and kind of pull up. He doesn't give them any of the flesh.
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.400]  But if he's full, he takes a dump. Seriously, he tells the pigs, you can eat that.
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.400]  And they do, they pretend they're wolves and they lick the wolf's ass.
[14:16.400 --> 14:22.400]  And then they go, and the wolf says, hey, have some more babies for me. I want to eat those. And they say, yes, the boss.
[14:22.400 --> 14:31.400]  You see, they figured out the one way they're going to get to live is if they just keep having those babies for the wolf.
[14:31.400 --> 14:37.400]  But see, the wolf figured out how to make babies without a mommy and a daddy.
[14:37.400 --> 14:43.400]  And see, those pigs might get up and he's somewhere down the line. So let's just get rid of them all together.
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.400]  And that's the robots. That's the computers. That's the AI.
[14:46.400 --> 14:53.400]  So pigs sitting there thinking he's a wolf and a wolf sitting there picking his teeth with a toothpick.
[14:53.400 --> 14:59.400]  He says, you know what? I really hate your guts, pig. You sold out your own kind.
[14:59.400 --> 15:07.400]  When I'm done with all of them, I'm going to slowly tear you inside out. How's that sound there?
[15:07.400 --> 15:15.400]  Because this is all about conquering you little pigs. And you know, the truth is, if you were wild boars,
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.400]  wolves run from wild boars because wild boars are in packs.
[15:19.400 --> 15:26.400]  And if the pigs ever act like boars, it'd be over for the wolves real quick.
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.400]  But see, people think having yellow bellies gets them ahead.
[15:30.400 --> 15:34.400]  And you know what? When there's not enough men to stand up, I guess it's true.
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.400]  Be a yellow belly or 10-year-old wolf when you know you're not.
[15:39.400 --> 15:47.400]  But see, some of us are going to be not sheep, not pigs, not wolves, but sheepdogs.
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.400]  And we like a good fight. And in the end, we're going to win.
[15:52.400 --> 16:03.400]  But I just want all of you out there thinking it's your safe kissing that wolf's stinking ass to know you're damn fools.
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.400]  Got a big broadcast lined up. You want to stay with us?
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.400]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.400]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:17.400 --> 16:23.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.400]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.400]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:29.400 --> 16:37.400]  Call 834 no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:59.400 --> 17:14.400]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and will never meet.
[17:14.400 --> 17:22.400]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.400]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:27.400 --> 17:35.400]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:35.400 --> 17:42.400]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.400]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[17:58.400 --> 18:02.400]  800-506-6740.
[18:02.400 --> 18:09.400]  That's 800-506-6740.
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.400]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller, Chillforce.
[18:14.400 --> 18:16.400]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[18:16.400 --> 18:23.400]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.400]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.400]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[18:33.400 --> 18:39.400]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous system relaxation.
[18:39.400 --> 18:42.400]  Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.400]  Rodeola rosea root extract, found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[18:47.400 --> 18:55.400]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.400]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chillforce Challenge at infowarslive.com.
[19:08.400 --> 19:14.400]  As the world awakens to the fact that info wars was right, that Alex Jones was right,
[19:14.400 --> 19:17.400]  I could sit here and do a victory lap, but folks, we don't have time.
[19:17.400 --> 19:19.400]  I don't want to do a victory lap.
[19:19.400 --> 19:21.400]  I'm not happy that I was right about all this.
[19:21.400 --> 19:25.400]  No, I don't want to be a slave of the globalist and live like a chai calm slave.
[19:25.400 --> 19:27.400]  I want to see the poor Chinese people freed.
[19:27.400 --> 19:29.400]  I don't want to be brought down to their level.
[19:29.400 --> 19:31.400]  I want to see them brought up to our level.
[19:31.400 --> 19:34.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be involved.
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.400]  Now is the time to be spread the word and now is the time to financially support info wars.
[19:38.400 --> 19:40.400]  And we make it so easy.
[19:40.400 --> 19:41.400]  It's such a 360 win.
[19:41.400 --> 19:44.400]  We're running a gigantic special in some ways.
[19:44.400 --> 19:45.400]  It's the biggest ever.
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.400]  Certainly a whole bunch of the items, 40 to 70% off, store-wide free shipping, double
[19:49.400 --> 19:50.400]  Patriot points.
[19:50.400 --> 19:52.400]  It is the everything must go special.
[19:52.400 --> 19:54.400]  And I'm just going to sell out of all the products we've got.
[19:54.400 --> 19:55.400]  Some of these are to cost.
[19:55.400 --> 19:59.400]  We're bringing in some money on some of the others and it's all vitally needed.
[19:59.400 --> 20:04.400]  And now is the time to fill up our war chest to go in to this key year of 2020.
[20:04.400 --> 20:11.400]  So please support us at m4store.com and take advantage of these great products.
[20:34.400 --> 20:39.400]  Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:39.400 --> 20:46.400]  So here's what's going down on this Friday broadcast, 11th of October, 2019.
[20:46.400 --> 20:48.400]  I had several guests lined up.
[20:48.400 --> 20:51.400]  I have canceled those guests.
[20:51.400 --> 20:54.400]  They'll probably come on the Sunday show at 4 to 6 PM.
[20:54.400 --> 21:02.400]  They're able to come on because I want to really carve out some major time to take calls.
[21:02.400 --> 21:11.400]  So I will take calls in the second, third and fourth hour today.
[21:11.400 --> 21:13.400]  I'm going to host the fourth hour today.
[21:13.400 --> 21:18.400]  I don't know if baggage was ready to host, but I told him to take off today.
[21:18.400 --> 21:20.400]  Usually host Friday's fourth hour.
[21:20.400 --> 21:24.400]  That's a great job because I need some time to take your phone calls and really go through
[21:24.400 --> 21:32.400]  everything and to try to be as calm and focused as I can be and lay out.
[21:32.400 --> 21:35.400]  Really lay the land here from my perspective.
[21:35.400 --> 21:40.400]  And I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[21:40.400 --> 21:42.400]  And I know you can see for miles and miles as well.
[21:42.400 --> 21:48.400]  That's why everybody's been so upset.
[21:48.400 --> 21:58.400]  That's why everybody's been so concerned because our worst analysis, our worst case scenarios
[21:58.400 --> 22:07.400]  about exactly what we're dealing with with the entity running the left worldwide has been confirmed.
[22:07.400 --> 22:15.400]  We're getting real close to total world government, cashless societies, wires in your head to buy and sell,
[22:15.400 --> 22:21.400]  the state taking your children away, if you even decide to have them and doing really terrible things to them
[22:21.400 --> 22:26.400]  and bringing them towards darkness and handing them over to the spider.
[22:26.400 --> 22:34.400]  And watching your children get psychically eaten and watching other people's children be destroyed.
[22:34.400 --> 22:36.400]  Why, you can really feel it, can't you?
[22:36.400 --> 22:39.400]  And you can see it.
[22:39.400 --> 22:45.400]  And you can feel God's anger mounting.
[22:45.400 --> 22:50.400]  And at a sick level, you kind of want to see God's judgment.
[22:50.400 --> 22:55.400]  Remember, vengeance is mine, say, at the Lord.
[22:55.400 --> 23:03.400]  And so when you watch those turned over to evil and you see how soulless they are,
[23:03.400 --> 23:09.400]  you ask yourself, how could they be so deceived? Well, they're given over to great delusion.
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.400]  They've decided to harden their hearts.
[23:11.400 --> 23:13.400]  They've decided to turn themselves over.
[23:13.400 --> 23:19.400]  And so they have become soulless slaves to the ultimate sin to turn down the Holy Ghost,
[23:19.400 --> 23:24.400]  the ultimate sin to know the truth and to have God touch your heart and turn it down.
[23:24.400 --> 23:27.400]  Everything else, evil flows out of that.
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.400]  So there are many people that have already lost their souls.
[23:30.400 --> 23:34.400]  They had free will. They had souls that decided to give them over.
[23:34.400 --> 23:38.400]  And so you wonder why they look so terrible, why they act so terrible,
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.400]  why they do things that are against their own self-interest.
[23:41.400 --> 23:49.400]  It's because the lights are home, but nobody's home.
[23:49.400 --> 24:00.400]  You know, the Clint Black song, still take a shower, brush your teeth, put your clothes on,
[24:00.400 --> 24:03.400]  strap a timepiece on your arm, get in the truck, drive down the road.
[24:03.400 --> 24:08.400]  But the lights are on, but nobody's home.
[24:08.400 --> 24:11.400]  But see, that's not quite right.
[24:11.400 --> 24:21.400]  Lights are on. Somebody else is home.
[24:21.400 --> 24:30.400]  And just exactly who is that? Just exactly what is that?
[24:30.400 --> 24:34.400]  It's a transmission.
[24:34.400 --> 24:38.400]  In fact, most of these people you call possessed are, it's not even an entity,
[24:38.400 --> 24:45.400]  but studying it very closely. Most of them, it's actually a transmission.
[24:45.400 --> 24:49.400]  That's why you can go from one block to another block in places like Seattle and San Francisco.
[24:49.400 --> 24:52.400]  I've seen it. And the first time I saw it, I was like, step back and stumble.
[24:52.400 --> 24:55.400]  I went, what? I saw that in the Matrix. I didn't know that was real.
[24:55.400 --> 25:02.400]  Rageant Smith jumping from person to person, going after Neo and Morpheus,
[25:02.400 --> 25:05.400]  jumps in a cop, jumps in a woman, jumps in a cab driver.
[25:05.400 --> 25:08.400]  No matter where he goes, he just jumps into another person.
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.400]  There's a maid cleaning, jumps into them.
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.400]  They can just shove aside the consciousness that's there because it's turned itself over.
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.400]  And it just jumps, jumps, jumps. I was in Seattle.
[25:21.400 --> 25:24.400]  You saw a lot of it on tape. We were doing live feeds down there.
[25:24.400 --> 25:26.400]  People were throwing coffee on me, screaming at me, yelling at me.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.400]  And I'd go around one block and somebody had talked to me like a demon.
[25:30.400 --> 25:33.400]  And then I'd walk around another block and they'd go, yeah, I saw you over there.
[25:33.400 --> 25:36.400]  Yeah, yep, yep, it's me. I'm going to get you.
[25:36.400 --> 25:41.400]  I mean, and you're like, whoa, like what is that? It's just a transmission.
[25:41.400 --> 25:47.400]  And if you can figure it out where it's coming from or how to block it, you'd save the planet.
[25:47.400 --> 25:53.400]  But see, we're conscious creatures, so we already know how to turn it off.
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.400]  You have to say, you refuse it. You reject it. You denounce it.
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.400]  You want it out of your life and then you've got to ask the other transmission in.
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.400]  It's just like everything in the world, like wireless computers and birds,
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.400]  wirelessly communicating and following the magnetic lines of the Earth
[26:09.400 --> 26:11.400]  and the space winds and the bees do it.
[26:11.400 --> 26:17.400]  We're all interfacing as transceivers at every level, scientifically what we can prove.
[26:17.400 --> 26:21.400]  And then of course, unscientifically just means the areas we haven't broken into yet
[26:21.400 --> 26:26.400]  and we don't understand. And all the spectrometers and radio telescopes and mathematics now show
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.400]  there is all these other dimensions around us that are more powerful
[26:30.400 --> 26:32.400]  holding us artificially in place.
[26:32.400 --> 26:36.400]  So now you don't really have atheists anymore in Silicon Valley.
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.400]  They're all saying, okay, there is something bigger than us and smarter
[26:40.400 --> 26:42.400]  and it's artificially holding us in place.
[26:42.400 --> 26:44.400]  And so now you read the light papers.
[26:44.400 --> 26:47.400]  We're going to figure out how to blow a hole through it.
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.400]  And now we're going to escape the prison we're in.
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.400]  So that's now mainline science.
[26:53.400 --> 26:58.400]  We've got to get a planetary government, get humans in line
[26:58.400 --> 27:04.400]  to then use technologies to punch an interdimensional hole
[27:04.400 --> 27:08.400]  out of the prison.
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.400]  I mean, we're literally following a satanic blueprint, 110%.
[27:13.400 --> 27:15.400]  It's all manifesting. It's all real.
[27:15.400 --> 27:20.400]  And here we are wondering why we've got so many problems.
[27:20.400 --> 27:23.400]  Well, just as a rule of thumb, or do you believe in the devil or not,
[27:23.400 --> 27:30.400]  the big boy of this world, the chief commander?
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.400]  Have you gone outside at night or during the day you looked around where we're at?
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.400]  I mean, we're on a floating planetoid.
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.400]  You just think we got here?
[27:41.400 --> 27:43.400]  Did the Easter Bunny set us out here?
[27:43.400 --> 27:48.400]  Maybe a lucky charm.
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.400]  And you got a bunch of people who didn't have parents that loved them
[27:52.400 --> 27:54.400]  and all they're looking for is a spark of energy.
[27:54.400 --> 27:57.400]  And they run into the devil and they go, whoa, this is energy.
[27:57.400 --> 28:03.400]  The devil goes, yeah, let me in, let me in, little pigs.
[28:03.400 --> 28:04.400]  And you let him in, man.
[28:04.400 --> 28:10.400]  He eats your soul, your free will, your operating system
[28:10.400 --> 28:17.400]  that can dial in and plug in to infinite possibilities.
[28:17.400 --> 28:24.400]  And God's just saying, plug in, plug in, please let me in.
[28:24.400 --> 28:27.400]  To have the devil keep people from plugging in, well, they created false churches
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.400]  and they created false parents and all these systems to abuse people in God's name
[28:32.400 --> 28:38.400]  so that people believe God's the devil and Satan's Jesus.
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.400]  But you look at the world and you know it's real.
[28:42.400 --> 28:43.400]  The Bible's real.
[28:43.400 --> 28:45.400]  It's all happening.
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.400]  And those potentials in children are the potential of the universe
[28:49.400 --> 28:52.400]  and that's why the enemy seeks to destroy it.
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.400]  And now you see the whole world, the whole system is about hurting children,
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.400]  stunting them, twisting them, feeding on them.
[28:59.400 --> 29:06.400]  And anyone that participates in this is going to be destroyed for eternity.
[29:06.400 --> 29:16.400]  We'll be right back. Stay well.
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.400]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature,
