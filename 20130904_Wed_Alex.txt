[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.200]  I'm going to be honest with all of the listeners and viewers out there my job
[00:33.200 --> 00:41.280]  is getting harder and harder every day and the reason my job is getting so hard is that
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.760]  the establishment is going so insane is bleeding out in front of everyone and is
[00:47.760 --> 00:55.600]  basically spewing out so many lies and bizarreness in every direction I don't
[00:55.600 --> 01:02.320]  even know how to respond to it but I'm going to do my dead level best today to
[01:02.320 --> 01:10.380]  do that but you are seeing the collective madness of the establishment
[01:10.380 --> 01:16.280]  banking cartel that runs the United States and at the same time we are also
[01:16.280 --> 01:26.320]  seeing a a marked mass awakening at the last two weeks that is accelerating when
[01:26.320 --> 01:29.680]  you've got Rush Limbaugh coming out saying the evidence points towards a
[01:29.680 --> 01:42.640]  false flag or frame job as he calls it in Syria you know the new world war is
[01:42.640 --> 01:47.960]  in deep trouble Ted Cruz the senator from Texas has come out and said the US is
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.160]  not Al Qaeda's Air Force man I wish I could come up with zingers like that I
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.760]  shouldn't laugh though World War three could start over this we've got that
[01:57.760 --> 02:06.720]  audio coming up as well Chris Matthews is then honest and says quote dim should
[02:06.720 --> 02:16.560]  vote for war to save Obama's ass and I have another disgusting Democrat here
[02:16.560 --> 02:25.080]  in my stack saying that they're going to vote for war out of loyalty for to
[02:25.080 --> 02:32.560]  Obama well is your party loyalty a suicide pact I mean that's what I'm
[02:32.560 --> 02:37.120]  asking here because this could lead to a World War three type scenario here's the
[02:37.120 --> 02:43.000]  quote Jim Congresswoman only reason I'd vote to strike Syria would be loyalty to
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.400]  Obama and then you've got these top Republicans and neocons in the news
[02:47.400 --> 02:53.320]  lobbying Obama calling him a wimp telling him to strike and you've got
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.000]  elements in the Israeli Knesset doing that this is madness now now the
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.680]  Russians and we've talked to some of the high-level Russian media people I'll
[03:01.680 --> 03:08.520]  just leave that at that point not you know give you the source because it was
[03:08.520 --> 03:12.400]  off record they said the government's basically in bunkers and thinks this
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.520]  could be World War three the Chinese are moving their fighter squadrons and
[03:15.520 --> 03:22.400]  troops to their Western border by Pakistan and India and Afghanistan you've
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.520]  got Russian troops massing on their border very close to Syria you've got
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.160]  Obama saying the forces are in place and the B1 and B2 bombers have been sent to
[03:34.160 --> 03:43.960]  what is it Diego Garcia they're off the coast of Africa just south of the Persian
[03:43.960 --> 03:51.440]  Gulf all of this is going on and you've got McCain in fact I forgot to print this
[03:51.440 --> 03:54.720]  article it's on drudge report calm on the right-hand side it's also an
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.560]  informed combat easiest place to find it is just go to drudge I didn't see it in
[03:58.560 --> 04:02.000]  stacks I printed for some reason I want the article with the screenshot of him
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.360]  playing poker that little turd is playing poker during these hearings where
[04:08.360 --> 04:16.920]  they're pushing for a giant military strike on a country so that so that the
[04:16.920 --> 04:21.480]  West you know the way to get around that stuff being cut off on screen is you
[04:21.480 --> 04:24.840]  guys can just take control of my computer in here and then you can aim a
[04:24.840 --> 04:29.080]  camera at it because my computer doesn't cut it off that on-screen computer
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.800]  everything we put up is cut off and I'm just to the point I can't handle it
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.720]  anymore um if you're not a TV viewer you don't know what I'm talking about the
[04:37.720 --> 04:43.200]  article with with McCain it just makes me angry even looking at him playing

[04:46.840 --> 04:50.360]  then then there's Kerry's testimony yesterday where he looks like he's
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.360]  wearing a rubber mask and literally looks like a mental patient who's had a

[08:10.920 --> 08:21.080]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[08:22.280 --> 08:29.280]  I was a hundred percent sure of it two weeks ago and I began breaking down on
[08:29.280 --> 08:34.800]  air that absolute history incredibly important history is unfolding in front
[08:34.800 --> 08:41.400]  of everyone but now I can't even believe how amazing the times are we're in it
[08:41.400 --> 08:49.560]  the news is even better than I thought it was there is a seismic mega important
[08:49.560 --> 08:57.520]  historical awakening because humanity at a gut level at an instinctive level at
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.600]  a discernment level understands that we have very dangerous kleptocrats in
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.640]  control of the West and that China is very dangerous and that Russia is very
[09:08.640 --> 09:12.840]  dangerous and that the world economy is teetering on the edge of collapse and
[09:12.840 --> 09:21.560]  that when empires are in trouble major wars are started and that nuclear war
[09:21.560 --> 09:31.000]  is in the air the beginnings of World War three are on the winds the seeds of
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.760]  Armageddon the seeds of nuclear conflagration are sprouting and need to
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.360]  be need to be pulled up need to be eaten by the crows need to be dealt with
[09:43.360 --> 09:51.280]  immediately because these seeds will grow very very quickly like some ethereal
[09:51.280 --> 09:58.880]  jack-in-the-bean stock and will grow up into the heavens and literally visit
[09:58.880 --> 10:07.520]  giants upon us pillars of fire hydrogen explosions so we need to cut these
[10:07.520 --> 10:16.840]  vines now and ignorance is the water that nourishes them apathy is the sunshine
[10:16.840 --> 10:23.400]  that lets them grow and we need to deal with our apathy right now ladies and
[10:23.400 --> 10:31.480]  gentlemen it is Wednesday the fourth day of September 2013 a year ago this
[10:31.480 --> 10:37.320]  September 11th just six days away seven days away we saw the Benghazi event
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.680]  al-Qaeda forces hired to run security in Benghazi going and killing the
[10:42.680 --> 10:47.040]  ambassador and others and in seven-hour plus firefight so they could get to the
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.400]  three giant warehouses behind them filled with all sorts of heat-seeking
[10:52.400 --> 10:59.360]  missiles anti-tank weapons French German and US tow missiles the list goes on and
[10:59.360 --> 11:06.200]  on do you feel like something big is going to happen on September 11th
[11:06.200 --> 11:14.880]  because my gut tells me watch September 11th right now I have never been more
[11:14.880 --> 11:21.480]  on edge than I am but but so on edge now that I'm focused and calm I've told you
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.840]  in the last few months building up to all this that I have had absolute dread and
[11:26.840 --> 11:29.840]  it felt like I'm not doing a good enough job breaking down what's happening now
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.640]  I've passed into that point where you were the bully starts the fistfight with
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.640]  you the fist are now swinging you're not afraid anymore you're in the fight we
[11:37.640 --> 11:45.160]  have we have we are entering we are entering the event horizon the point of
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.320]  no return for whatever is going to happen and that's why you see mainly
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.720]  libertarians worldwide but also some conservatives and some what you'd call
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.560]  liberals saying this is madness and it's wrong and it's a false flag and
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.120]  there's no proof and then we've got al-qaeda ganged up on Syria and this is
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.160]  wrong and the house of cards is falling on the globalist but here's the problem
[12:09.160 --> 12:13.920]  John Kerry said in his speech before the committee yesterday in the Congress he
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.680]  said our credibility is on the line and he means the new world orders because if
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.200]  they don't go through with this now they're going to get routed on every
[12:23.200 --> 12:34.200]  front their aura of invincibility is now beginning to implode their aura of
[12:34.200 --> 12:41.240]  invincibility is now beginning to collapse and so let me tell you what
[12:41.240 --> 12:44.920]  they're going to do they're going to stage false flags I don't know what
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.360]  they're going to be on attack on Syria maybe the false flag to cover up the
[12:49.360 --> 12:51.960]  fact that they weren't given authorization and it's clearly a fraud
[12:51.960 --> 12:59.440]  that may be the false flag they could do anything ladies and gentlemen and I
[12:59.440 --> 13:05.040]  sat there last night watching the tape that the crew had taped of Kerry's
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.960]  testimony and I had to leave I was so freaked out by it and I'm going to get
[13:09.960 --> 13:16.720]  into that John Kerry looked like a certified member of the Adams family
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.480]  he sat there looking like someone you would see who'd had a lobotomy his wife
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.520]  looked completely insane and demon possessed and mentally ill the members
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.880]  of the Congress that were pushing the war all look like disheveled demonic
[13:32.880 --> 13:43.280]  ringed out your bloodless zombies the military officers looked like clowns in
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.680]  their in their little military outfits and Kerry could hardly talk and kept
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.800]  sticking his tongue out over and over again like a lizard and his face was
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.600]  jiggling like rubber and he looked like he was about to pass out and he would
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.520]  look down and actually have to steady himself during testimony he was about
[14:04.520 --> 14:09.520]  to collapse and I just realized these are literally demon possessed creatures
[14:09.520 --> 14:15.240]  and I already knew that but but but I I had to go home and I could hardly drive
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.280]  home last night because I was so freaked out by watching about 30 minutes of the
[14:20.280 --> 14:22.760]  testimony
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.200]  meanwhile McCain was playing poker the entire time and was caught on video
[14:27.200 --> 14:31.920]  doing that I mean these people all need to be arrested these are mentally ill
[14:31.920 --> 14:38.560]  power tripping insane asylum people who are narcissist and who are on
[14:38.560 --> 14:44.880]  disgusting power trips endangering our entire planet waving hundreds of dead
[14:44.880 --> 14:50.440]  children now it's admitted it's 400 and everybody's like where's the 1400 all
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.520]  the doctors groups say it's 400 and 20 something and they're just like don't
[14:54.520 --> 15:02.040]  worry about it we say so and Kerry comes out and says you all of you there's
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.800]  video of this Kerry holds objectors responsible for any future atrocities in
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.600]  Syria we're gonna play that clip later I've got a flotilla of clips imagine
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.280]  anytime there's another atrocity when the West started this war so under
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.560]  common law and common sense it's all their fault you start a fight with
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.880]  somebody and they beat your brains out that's your problem and it's the same
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.840]  deal but they're not even using the chemical weapons they own legally they're
[15:30.840 --> 15:36.000]  not even signatures to the convention but the point is they they didn't use
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.400]  them clearly the Al Qaeda rebels have been caught three separate times using
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.440]  them on record but they want to sit here with no evidence and say Syria did it
[15:44.440 --> 15:49.520]  and then this guy tells us that it's our fault that's what they said about
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.000]  Sandy Hook if there's ever another school shooting gun owners it's your fault
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.960]  no it's your fault for making the school's disarmament zones it's your
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.320]  fault for putting Al Qaeda in Syria and starting this whole thing and here's the
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.280]  deal the jigs up folks we had the will the last two and a half years to put out
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.360]  the truth that Al Qaeda was the main force now it's mainstream news the last
[16:09.360 --> 16:14.400]  year now everybody knows about it and now Ted Cruz says quote the US is not Al
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.760]  Qaeda's air force Rush Limbaugh is coming out saying it looks like a false flag
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.480]  and he's investigating you've got Ron Paul Rand Paul Glenn Beck Pat Buchanan
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.760]  all of them all of them suddenly Fox News correspondents are talking about it
[16:30.760 --> 16:34.860]  Ron Paul tries to talk about it and they cut him off on CNN last night because
[16:34.860 --> 16:38.560]  they're desperate and they're scared because good people are starting to
[16:38.560 --> 16:42.840]  stand up on their hind legs folks and not roll around our bellies in front of
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.200]  these globalist scumbags look at Matt Drudge leading the charge as well and
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.800]  retweeting these all day I can't quit reading them up on his personal drudge
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.640]  Matt drudge at drudge we have them up on real Alex Jones follow us there as
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.720]  well and he says why would anyone vote Republican please give me a reason
[17:00.720 --> 17:06.480]  raise taxes marching us off the war again approving more NSA snooping who are
[17:06.480 --> 17:14.280]  they exactly who are you look at this now it's now authoritarian versus
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.160]  libertarian since Democrats versus Republicans has been obliterated no
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.120]  real difference between parties boom it's all happening drudge pull on
[17:22.120 --> 17:28.160]  resolution for Obama Syria raid 1000 plus votes in one minute and it goes on
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.360]  and on and on Putin is the leader of the free world yeah how how weird is that
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.120]  that Putin's saying okay all I'll attack Syria with you basically if you
[17:39.120 --> 17:43.240]  could show me proof they did the chemicals and he and he suspended the
[17:43.240 --> 17:51.520]  high-powered surface-to-surface anti ship mega missiles that the ships have a
[17:51.520 --> 17:55.720]  lot of trouble shooting them down he suspended those being shipped to Syria
[17:55.720 --> 18:00.680]  and said okay just show me proof and I'll get behind a strike knowing full well
[18:00.680 --> 18:06.280]  they don't have it to the point of we have to say Vladimir Putin compared to
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.400]  the crazy bankers and globalists and narcissists we have running things is
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.760]  now the leader of the free world look at how absolutely flip-flopped all of this
[18:14.760 --> 18:21.720]  is so that's what's going on on that front up at at drudge all women at drudge
[18:21.720 --> 18:28.720]  all of us at real Alex Jones we're retweeting that and that is exactly what's
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.240]  going on and folks this is an orgy an overload of information these are the

[24:16.360 --> 24:21.120]  today I'll do that in the next segment exclusive high-level source confirmed
[24:21.120 --> 24:30.240]  secret u.s. nuclear warhead transfer and this is our source that is high level
[24:30.240 --> 24:37.440]  in the dais air force base in west Texas directly to us a source known to us for
[24:37.440 --> 24:43.280]  a decade I'll just leave it at that and the people on the base were like
[24:43.280 --> 24:47.320]  freaking out that either weren't supposed to be nukes on the base but they
[24:47.320 --> 24:52.360]  were pulled out of mothballs secretly there hadn't supposed been nukes there
[24:52.360 --> 24:55.840]  since the 80s I went and checked it that was confirmed under a treaty the B1
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.680]  bombers there and they loaded them on trucks to send them to South Carolina
[24:59.680 --> 25:07.240]  and the people on the base were freaking out because there was no paperwork
[25:07.240 --> 25:12.800]  signed remember in 2007 when Cheney had them transferred from my not north to
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.080]  Dakota down to New Orleans there was the big freak out of over that transfer with
[25:18.080 --> 25:21.600]  cruise missiles I mean ladies and gentlemen I don't like that being given
[25:21.600 --> 25:28.240]  news like this it's dangerous it's dangerous to know this type of
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.640]  information okay I'm just gonna leave it I mean believe me this is real just like
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.840]  I told you I had a Navy SEAL source on them all believing that their the
[25:38.840 --> 25:42.280]  helicopter was blown up to cover 23 SEALs and the family thought that they've
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.480]  been murdered by Obama to cover up the fake raid
[25:46.600 --> 25:52.040]  almost two years later I start getting the families on the show saying they
[25:52.040 --> 25:59.040]  knew that day one we don't make this stuff up believe me I wish we were believe
[25:59.040 --> 26:06.680]  me believe me believe it but when I get this info I'm gonna tell you no matter
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.240]  what happens you can be guaranteed of that no matter what happens I will go
[26:12.240 --> 26:18.120]  100% period and that's it excuse me reason I start yelling folks is this is
[26:18.120 --> 26:22.480]  life-and-death stuff okay and my adrenaline just goes crazy because at a
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.160]  subconscious level I realize this is combat ladies and gentlemen this is
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.960]  this is this is not a joke this is not a game the articles up on info wars calm
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.720]  I'll break it down in the next segment Obama gave a speech today saying and
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.880]  just did it again in another speech that there was never a red line that's made
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.360]  up we have video of him saying a red line and the Washington Post with the
[26:46.360 --> 26:54.200]  red line from the what was the 24th of August yeah yeah yeah last August we're
[26:54.200 --> 26:57.680]  gonna get to all that I mean everybody knows he said that this is the level of
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.720]  lying then they promised no boots on the ground they've already been boots on
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.480]  the ground ladies and gentlemen it was August 21st 2011 12 I was going for
[27:07.480 --> 27:15.440]  memory and then he gets asked about it yesterday mr. rubber face and I tell you
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.440]  it's not good to serve evil all these globalists look like reanimated corpses
[27:20.440 --> 27:25.200]  and they all just get off on destruction and power and their empires
[27:25.200 --> 27:28.960]  collapsing sucking America down with it and they're not gonna let it collapse
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.280]  without starting World War three that's what all this is about let me tell you
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.640]  folks they hit Syria and Syria hits Israel Israel is probably gonna nuke
[27:37.640 --> 27:42.160]  somebody or attack them and then Iran's gonna attack and then Russia's gonna get
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.960]  involved folks and then we're all dead and we've barely stopped three nuclear
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.680]  wars before and all you idiot yuppies send me emails and I see comments making
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.640]  jokes about this you people are idiots I would like to literally punch your eyes
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.560]  out you said that to my face I got a family I got three children just because
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.800]  you're uninformed think everything's a joke doesn't mean the rest of us have
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.960]  to go to hell with you excuse me let's go to let's go to Kerry saying oh yeah
[28:11.960 --> 28:16.520]  give me an authorization for boots on the ground but let's play the clip here
[28:16.520 --> 28:23.160]  it is would you tell us whether you believe that a prohibition for having
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.880]  American boots on the ground is that something that the administration would
[28:25.880 --> 28:32.760]  accept as part of a resolution miss chairman it would be preferable not to
[28:32.760 --> 28:37.280]  not because the the the there was any intention or any plan or any desire
[28:37.280 --> 28:41.680]  whatsoever to have boots on the ground I think the president will give you every
[28:41.680 --> 28:47.840]  assurance in the world as am I as as the Secretary of Defense and determine but
[28:47.840 --> 28:59.240]  in the event Syria imploded for instance or which is your plan there was a threat
[28:59.240 --> 29:04.640]  of a chemical weapons cash oh they're going in falling into the hands always

[29:10.040 --> 29:15.520]  interests of our allies and and all of us the British the French and others to
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.040]  prevent those weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of the
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.480]  worst elements there you go that's enough I don't want to take off yeah he

[33:33.080 --> 33:37.600]  national security piece put out by the washington post

[33:44.360 --> 33:49.160]  august last year over a year ago now I know everybody knows that but it just

[36:07.960 --> 36:14.400]  that that 40-plus years in Washington working for presidents a scumbag race
[36:14.400 --> 36:22.480]  pimp just absolute pile of steaming inhuman trash anti-American anti-
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.960]  family anti-gun I mean these are enemies that isn't rhetoric these are our
[36:27.960 --> 36:34.480]  enemies these people are a criminal class he comes out and says we need to have
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.120]  this war to save Obama they're so arrogant in their criminality that's
[36:39.120 --> 36:47.120]  what criminals do they always brag that they're saying this will haul Obama's
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.280]  bacon for their power they admit it's all a big lie to divert everybody so
[36:54.280 --> 36:58.320]  Obama could start a war that might lead to World War three I think the
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.120]  Democrats gonna be forced to sacrifice men and women who really really don't
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.920]  want to vote for this and they're gonna have to vote for it to save the
[37:04.920 --> 37:13.680]  president's hide that's a very bad position to put your party and some will
[37:13.680 --> 37:18.680]  say oh no he's being honest there no he's saying what's going on he's all
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.440]  for it and then you've got all the rest of these people saying I'll do it for
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.000]  loyalty hey why don't you take your kids outside then and blow their brains out
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.760]  Chris Matthews and the District of Criminals Congresswoman I mean I'm not
[37:33.760 --> 37:37.120]  saying literally do that but you know what I mean if Obama said march your
[37:37.120 --> 37:40.440]  kids outside put a gun in their mouth blow their brains all over the wall
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.240]  would you do it if Obama said go jump off a cliff would you do it and let me
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.400]  tell you all these Republicans are telling us go jump off a cliff I can't
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.320]  look at John McCain anymore I mean he's obviously completely mentally ill John
[37:53.320 --> 37:59.440]  Kerry these are flaming nutcases and remember what do you expect folks it's
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.120]  skull and bones ABC News got video of it that confirms what Charlotte is or be
[38:04.120 --> 38:10.000]  leaked to Anthony Sutton the congressional expert congressional hearings
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.800]  and she'll reveal that a few years ago to us and we went to her home and she
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.920]  showed us the skull and bones memorabilia her father and grandfather were
[38:20.920 --> 38:30.520]  members of skull and bones and elite family and she leaked to Anthony Sutton
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.000]  what goes on in skull and bones that confirmed the break-in from over a
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.320]  hundred years ago what it confirmed do you know what goes on at skull and bones
[38:38.320 --> 38:44.280]  well I have a family audience so I can't say it they have sexual rituals some of
[38:44.280 --> 38:49.000]  the most ancient Egyptian rituals where they believe they are possessed by
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.800]  entities basically space aliens when you're looking I don't believe this let's
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.920]  be clear when you look at John Kerry though and his his his tomb mate George
[38:59.920 --> 39:06.440]  W. Bush and the rest of them these are people these are people that had gay
[39:06.440 --> 39:09.080]  sex
[39:10.200 --> 39:16.960]  hundreds of times in coffins begging for spiritual entities to possess them and
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.520]  you know what puts put John Kerry on screen you know what put the video from
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.640]  last yesterday that's the really crazy one I mean you know what if that's a
[39:25.640 --> 39:29.560]  case for possession folks I believe it I mean Hollywood should want to hire him
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.080]  to play the next silence of the lambs because there's no actor that can look
[39:33.080 --> 39:39.120]  this whacked out crazy I mean take George W. Bush and all his weirdness I
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.840]  mean ladies and gentlemen these are people that get in coffins hundreds of
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.720]  times and and giant pits of feces and have sex with each other
[39:52.760 --> 39:57.760]  people go oh that's just fraternity fine no ladies and gentlemen that's not
[39:57.760 --> 40:00.360]  what it is and by the way a lot of people that get tapped for it won't be
[40:00.360 --> 40:06.480]  part of all that that's the higher level initiates John Kerry ladies and
[40:06.480 --> 40:16.880]  gentlemen as a member of a satanic death cult and no wonder he wants to start
[40:16.880 --> 40:21.520]  World War three I mean what do you call it psychologically I mean if you don't
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.520]  believe in these entities like they do okay it doesn't exist doesn't matter
[40:24.520 --> 40:31.000]  they believe entities possess them in pits of feces I mean we have a secretary
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.160]  of state who has asked entities to enter his body while having sex in large vats
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.720]  of feces with men peeing on him I mean I mean they even made a movie The Good
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.120]  Shepherd about this Robert and Ero produced it and it was hailed as
[40:48.120 --> 40:52.400]  historically accurate with men peeing on each other I mean I'm sorry we have
[40:52.400 --> 40:58.080]  family audiences but that's what they're doing and how much more will we put up
[40:58.080 --> 41:07.280]  with these people it is it is chapter 322 officially of the Illuminati ladies
[41:07.280 --> 41:17.880]  and gentlemen founded by the Illuminati in 1832 on record people make fun of me
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.240]  saying oh German death cults run the world no they're a big part of it though
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.400]  doesn't even mean they're German it means they've adopted a German death cults
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.280]  activity that's really Egyptian which was the dark black magic elements of the
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.000]  priesthood in Egypt these people follow a 4,000 year old Egyptian death cult
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.680]  okay that's who's running things wallowing in feces that's what we're
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.480]  dealing with ladies and gentlemen a secretary of state that has had sex in
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.440]  giant vats of feces and I dare the media to attack me on this because that's
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.080]  exactly who they are go ahead make fun of me because it's all on record and it's
[41:58.080 --> 42:02.920]  all come out and go ahead and try to make me look crazy talking about that I
[42:02.920 --> 42:08.680]  don't care you're the ones that are crazy following these people the only
[42:08.680 --> 42:12.880]  video they have a skull and bones is in the courtyard screaming death devil
[42:12.880 --> 42:18.200]  equals death oh I love you devil they have people that dress up in skull mass
[42:18.200 --> 42:24.000]  with crowns on and then you worship the devil and then the person playing the
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.360]  part of the devil who believes they've been possessed by the devil sits there
[42:27.360 --> 42:35.240]  and watches while man after man has sex with you I mean that's what's going on
[42:35.240 --> 42:41.880]  ladies and gentlemen you want the truth can you handle the truth that's the big
[42:41.880 --> 42:50.600]  question here ladies and gentlemen these people are monsters and that's what
[42:50.600 --> 42:54.560]  hit me last night was I have been holding back I know they're monsters why
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.680]  does Kerry look so weird why does he act so weird why do they lie why can't they
[42:58.680 --> 43:01.960]  help not lie why was Kerry about to collapse over and over again watching
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.880]  the testimony go back and review it from yesterday's testimony to the Senate
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.280]  he's in the house today he would he would have to when they were talking have
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.760]  to lean his head down like put his hands on the table and just because I mean
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.960]  folks he imagined he's been possessed by this stuff so long like Alistair Crowley
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.720]  was can you imagine what it's like being under that thank God I'm among the
[43:21.720 --> 43:27.080]  living thank God I love life thank God I've got red blood and gusto and honor
[43:27.080 --> 43:31.680]  and courage and love of life and innocence man it feels good to be on the
[43:31.680 --> 43:37.400]  side of good I did not want to be a part of evil these servants are evil are
[43:37.400 --> 43:43.120]  jokes let me tell you something I said this to the crew earlier today and they
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.760]  said well you got to say that on air but it's true evil ain't cool and evil
[43:46.760 --> 43:52.160]  ain't fine and and the path of evil lives in the heart of all of those that
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.560]  serve evil and what was my full quote you said was good was a quick quote you
[43:57.560 --> 44:03.600]  should be able to make a liner out of it evil isn't good for you bitches I think
[44:03.600 --> 44:07.920]  that's what I said I mean it's just elementary to use a modern parlance
[44:07.920 --> 44:11.880]  excuse me but I mean that's what's going on here this is not fun you don't want
[44:11.880 --> 44:16.480]  to shine on to this the LZ bubs here to destroy things and again even if you
[44:16.480 --> 44:20.320]  don't believe in it our leaders are part of groups it came out in mainstream
[44:20.320 --> 44:26.360]  news that Tony Blair every morning is possessed by the spirit of the light and
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.640]  falls down on the ground and flops around on the ground that's mainstream
[44:30.640 --> 44:36.840]  British news and his wife is an admitted witch who does rituals with him and he
[44:36.840 --> 44:40.760]  spends most his free time flying all around the world doing weird rituals so
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.440]  did France saw on meter on look that up the pyramid at the Louvre the pink
[44:45.440 --> 44:52.760]  pyramid pink and gold pyramid has 666 pieces of glass and meter on said the
[44:52.760 --> 44:58.880]  idea was beamed to him by Lucifer when he was on a sacred mountain top well let
[44:58.880 --> 45:04.160]  me tell you what Lucifer is beaming to you isn't good and I don't want to be
[45:04.160 --> 45:14.680]  run by Lucifer comprende I don't want to work for El Diablo or the skinny one
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.680]  the grim reaper any of it I choose God I choose Jesus Christ I choose life I
[45:20.680 --> 45:25.600]  don't choose death those of you that worship at the dark altar of it I know
[45:25.600 --> 45:28.360]  I'm preaching it's let me just go over the headlines and we'll go to more of
[45:28.360 --> 45:35.800]  these clips okay we've got Ted Cruz u.s. not an Al Qaeda's Air Force cue that up
[45:35.800 --> 45:40.640]  I want to play that in a moment but before we go back to those clips let me
[45:40.640 --> 45:45.960]  just give you some of the headlines here ladies and gentlemen Washington Times
[45:45.960 --> 45:51.440]  Kerry holds objectors responsible for any future atrocities in Syria when they
[45:51.440 --> 45:53.440]  started the whole thing I've been running the whole thing for two and a half
[45:53.440 --> 45:57.200]  years they're blaming it now on us I mean you gotta love that that's just too
[45:57.200 --> 46:01.600]  rich like somebody ran their car into you running a red light and got out and
[46:01.600 --> 46:06.840]  blamed you McCain's playing poker during all this is a big joke to him just
[46:06.840 --> 46:12.840]  total mental patient they asked him how many houses he owns he didn't know
[46:12.840 --> 46:15.720]  nothing against owning things but just they don't even care they even know
[46:15.720 --> 46:19.960]  Democrat Congresswoman only reason I'd vote to strike Syria would be loyalty to
[46:19.960 --> 46:27.040]  Obama Syrian conflict opposition leader the real opposition criticizes plans
[46:27.040 --> 46:31.080]  for u.s. intervention as satanic to destroy the country even the real
[46:31.080 --> 46:36.400]  opposition that's genteel and doesn't like Assad for good reasons just like
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.800]  Syrian girls family the real opposition says this is pure evil don't do it
[46:40.800 --> 46:47.040]  that's having a post Jerusalem post Russia suspends delivery of s300 missile
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.200]  systems to Syria Putin says if you can show evidence he used chemicals he will
[46:52.200 --> 47:01.880]  agree to the strike and might even help but instead no Western media wants to
[47:01.880 --> 47:05.680]  talk to Vladimir Putin by the way Obama isn't trying to talk to the Russians
[47:05.680 --> 47:08.920]  the it's come out in the news but I've been told by our Russian sources as well
[47:08.920 --> 47:15.840]  high-level Russian media high level that the Russian government is in bunkers
[47:15.840 --> 47:19.720]  they're on nuclear alert that's actually come out and that and that they
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.960]  they know about the Western elite and they're actually freaked out and it
[47:23.960 --> 47:31.680]  and that no one diplomatically will even talk to them now you know the the
[47:31.680 --> 47:37.520]  diplomatic phones all of its dead and nuclear weapons are being massed in the
[47:37.520 --> 47:44.480]  Middle East let's continue here Rand Paul demands Obama adhere to Congress on
[47:44.480 --> 47:51.840]  Syria absolutely article by Paul Watson up on info wars.com info wars.com also
[47:51.840 --> 47:58.640]  Ron Paul gets cut off by CNN we have that video up on info wars.com will
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.320]  Congress reject Obama's attack on Syria info wars.com very important break down
[48:03.320 --> 48:07.400]  there president Bashir al-Assad's full interview translated into English on
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.680]  info wars.com and he says first off you just got to show evidence we did it we
[48:11.680 --> 48:19.720]  didn't do it you're setting us up it's a frame up and it just continues new polls
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.960]  out with a vast majority of Americans ABC News poll opposing military strike on
[48:24.960 --> 48:29.440]  Syria now getting into the really important news on Syria the chairman of
[48:29.440 --> 48:37.560]  the Joint Chiefs Dempsey can't say what US is seeking in Syria and he went on to
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.600]  say he doesn't know why this is going to happen because Dempsey said on record
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.880]  it's a bad idea David Cameron rules out any further military action in Syria
[48:46.880 --> 48:50.320]  even if there's new attacks he's now said they're not going to be part of it
[48:50.320 --> 48:54.160]  and you know why because they're not insane and they love their children and
[48:54.160 --> 48:59.360]  they understand that Iran and Syria are going to launch missiles at Israel and
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.200]  then there's probably a 50-50 chance most estimates are that Israel's going to
[49:04.200 --> 49:08.240]  start nuking people and then folks the minute nukes detonate it's over you
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.040]  understand it's over but these power-tripping demonically possessed
[49:13.040 --> 49:18.920]  globalist who literally bathe in feces want to bathe us in fire well they go
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.760]  down in their bunkers and laugh about it because they're they're they are
[49:22.760 --> 49:30.520]  psychopaths they are nutcases who all need to be arrested immediately but
[49:30.520 --> 49:35.960]  men remember none of this is their fault it's all our fault as Kerry said
[49:35.960 --> 49:42.840]  Anderson Bloomberg reports new Obama ally is Jewish groups back Syria strike the
[49:42.840 --> 49:49.400]  lobbyist and billionaire that gave 70 million to defeat Obama last year in
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.520]  the elections is now getting behind Obama saying he needs to attack yeah
[49:54.520 --> 50:01.880]  that's a great idea that that's a really really great idea and it just goes on and
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.880]  on and on ladies and gentlemen and meanwhile everybody in America is still
[50:06.880 --> 50:13.360]  obsessed with last week with Hannah Montana or whatever whatever idiot name
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.880]  is now Miley Tertis or whatever you know bending over and being humped on and
[50:18.880 --> 50:22.000]  again folks if adults want to watch that stuff that's their business this stuff
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.960]  is targeting young girls the satanic stuff in the in the videos aimed at
[50:27.960 --> 50:32.200]  preteen youths is absolutely out of control just like the sex education
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.960]  that Obama's pushing for five-year-olds teaching them how to lock him and say
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.240]  it to an adult audience I mean just you name it they're pedophiles they're
[50:42.240 --> 50:45.840]  devil worshipers but we put up with it well they're the federal government and
[50:45.840 --> 50:49.680]  they say teach five-year-olds how to have anal sex and everybody's like well
[50:49.680 --> 50:54.200]  yeah if you don't do that you're racist Obama's black so it's okay let the

[53:08.240 --> 53:13.680]  presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and
[53:13.680 --> 53:17.840]  government agencies for what they really are incompetent line crooks that are
[53:17.840 --> 53:21.800]  counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[53:21.800 --> 53:26.520]  some have called this a conspiracy others have called it a cover-up and you
[53:26.520 --> 53:32.680]  will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes my video at 123coverup.com
[53:32.680 --> 53:36.920]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you
[53:36.920 --> 53:40.920]  can beat them to watch the controversial video the thousands of other
[53:40.920 --> 53:45.440]  smart patriots have already seen in the last three months go to 123coverup.com
[53:45.440 --> 53:49.960]  and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home
[53:49.960 --> 53:55.880]  go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down
[53:55.880 --> 54:11.200]  again that's 123coverup.com
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.840]  by the way Dave Mustaine's coming into town this weekend at Austin to play
[54:44.840 --> 54:50.680]  with Iron Maiden and he's invited me out to hang out with those guys and who
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.200]  does we might have an interview for you next week get Dave's take on all this
[54:55.200 --> 55:01.040]  Dave of Megadeth obviously I love his new album Super Collider but you know it's
[55:01.040 --> 55:07.720]  hard to even enjoy stuff like that when when when when all of this stuff's
[55:07.720 --> 55:12.200]  going on around us in the world that could absolutely destroy all of our
[55:12.200 --> 55:16.760]  futures I mean I can't even make myself leave the office now even though I want
[55:16.760 --> 55:19.440]  to be with my children more than anything because they don't have a future if
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.320]  we don't stop this and as soon as I start driving down the road sometimes I
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.120]  turn around and come back to think of all the things I need to do all the
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.760]  things I need to say all the messages I need to get out because history is
[55:29.760 --> 55:32.920]  happening what we're putting out is actually being picked up by all the
[55:32.920 --> 55:36.880]  other big talk show host and more and more we see it being mirrored and and
[55:36.880 --> 55:42.720]  that is the essence of changing things is the spirit of truth getting out there
[55:42.720 --> 55:46.800]  and we're a big part of that and all the glory goes to God but it's it's it's
[55:46.800 --> 55:51.320]  very very daunting when I start the next hour I'll get into our top story that's
[55:51.320 --> 55:55.600]  up on info wars comm prison planet comm exclusive high-level source confirms
[55:55.600 --> 56:01.400]  secret u.s. nuclear warhead transfer and why this is such a big deal and I wish
[56:01.400 --> 56:06.840]  this source wasn't so good and wasn't a witness to it and wasn't so confirmed I
[56:06.840 --> 56:13.320]  mean I just cannot believe I'm breaking news like this this is just
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.480]  unbelievable and it totally freaked out the military people and the police that
[56:18.480 --> 56:24.400]  were there and if you don't know why folks it's because there was no signing
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.640]  for the warheads these these warheads disappeared off into trucks down the
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.640]  road and the base commander was there to authorize it and there weren't supposed
[56:35.640 --> 56:42.040]  to be nukes at this base and I know I just got into skull and bones and all
[56:42.040 --> 56:45.600]  that but I mean look at the Masonic lodge in Michigan they just busted with
[56:45.600 --> 56:51.480]  an orgy going on in it that's nothing folks those are women those are guys you
[56:51.480 --> 56:56.600]  know consenting adults I don't agree with it but that's nothing folks those
[56:56.600 --> 57:00.160]  guys aren't going to get invited to the higher level stuff Masons didn't do stuff
[57:00.160 --> 57:05.000]  like that in George Washington's day the Illuminati took over the Masons the
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.960]  Masons go back to Egypt and to the wizards who were not Satanist Solomon
[57:13.960 --> 57:20.920]  picked up on that afterwards so you had the main colleges which were agrarian
[57:20.920 --> 57:24.800]  and science and math and architecture but it was also religious and then you
[57:24.800 --> 57:28.800]  have the secret cults within it kind of like the Jedi and the Sith you
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.880]  understand and and and so the Masons tend to get blamed for what the Sith are
[57:33.880 --> 57:41.160]  doing but it's actually that the Sith to use that analogy use the Masonic
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.480]  lodge to recruit out of and that's what George Washington wrote you can read his
[57:44.480 --> 57:52.840]  letters against the Illuminati from 1889 he died in 1800 I go from memory you can
[57:52.840 --> 57:57.320]  pull those up National Archives signed by George Washington scans of them he
[57:57.320 --> 58:03.000]  battled the Illuminati this is real ladies and gentlemen this is real and
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.800]  you don't get entry into these clubs unless you're part of it I would say

[59:12.840 --> 59:17.040]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when
[59:17.040 --> 59:20.840]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it

[59:24.400 --> 59:28.560]  is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the

[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.120]  alex jones
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:35.800]  you know that's the type of news report we ought to do I just mentioned at the
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:38.560]  end of the last hour you know the National Archive and read all of
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:41.920]  George Washington's letters there's hundreds of them in there scans of them
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:45.400]  but you can read the letters on the Illuminati there's like five of them in
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:50.040]  there where he's warning people about the Illuminati taking over trying to take
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:54.280]  over masonry how dangerous they are how they're jackabins the French
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:58.880]  Revolution was going then and how they were Satanist and and and then you
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:03.280]  realize that they then had the movement here to kick them out of the US that
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:10.080]  became the anti-masonic party and then by 1832 they came over here and set up
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:14.800]  skull and bones to try to take over masonry again and the general public
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.360]  just blamed masonry out of hand and again I'm not defending masonry I'm not a
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:23.680]  mason I've had a lot of family that were masons I've had family that were 33rd
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:30.800]  degree masons there's a reason Texas is called the lone star state it's it's it
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:39.680]  was a masonically founded state and the apple of world masonry's eye and they
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:44.920]  believed pre-destined to do something special in the future but the point is is
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:50.840]  that it's all a deception and it's true that masonry is pre-christian and they
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:57.600]  like to go back to Solomon and Solomon secrets the most knowledgeable man who
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:04.040]  ever lived as the Bible calls him son of David to you know say oh that's where we
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:08.520]  come from we're Christian but you go above that it's it's all the mystery
[1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:15.280]  schools of Babylon of Greece but really Egypt is the root and and you know I'm
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.880]  fair with the masons because I'm not in a war against the masons I would rather
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:24.320]  have them wake up to the fact that their darker roots have sprung forth into
[1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:32.440]  their body and taken over the body and that to use their words of a 33rd
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:39.680]  degree mason they are out of balance big time big time and of course the truth
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:44.520]  is there is no balance to it you start saying oh there's balance oh Lucifer can
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:49.840]  give us knowledge Lucifer is into the twin of Christ you start getting into
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:54.600]  those areas ladies and gentlemen very very destructive I just stay out of it
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:59.200]  and just get my heart right with God it's that relationship that matters
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:06.400]  especially in times like these because you get into all this sorcery and you
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:12.440]  get into all the things these people are involved in it will destroy you you
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:18.680]  can't wear the ring of Mordor and use it for good it's best to stay out of all
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:24.720]  that stuff but I don't judge people that are part of those ancient orders and
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:30.080]  most of them are good it is that's how the evil operates as it gets the best
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:34.280]  men around it believing they're part of something good so that they can be
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:38.240]  controlled and watched and that's what's going on with the masons we just come
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.600]  out say all the masons are behind closed doors drinking blood 99% of
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:51.320]  masons literally or 99.9 they have no idea there's 360 degrees they have no
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:04:00.440]  idea that humans go up into the high hundreds and that then it's princes and
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:08.960]  principalities and deities angels that sit on the other points and that skull
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:14.920]  and bones they worship eulogia the goddess but that's only the white mask
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:20.120]  they wear the dark mask they worship shaitan satan the devil the Elsie bub
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:25.320]  and that's been leaked that's come out that doesn't mean everybody who's even
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:29.800]  been part of that when they do the rituals of possession I actually are
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:34.400]  given over to the entities you want a heavy Illuminati folks I can give it all

[1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:35.720]  friends I want to open the phones up right now in this second hour to get
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:40.680]  your take on all the bombshell information we just covered you've got
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:46.800]  Ted Cruz the senator from Texas coming out and saying us not Al Qaeda's Air
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:53.320]  Force that's in Politico upon info wars.com and prison planet.com Putin
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:58.000]  does not rule out approving serious strike with evidence Assad used poison
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.400]  gas he says the evidence points towards the rebels but if you can show the
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:07.640]  evidence I will support a strike and diplomatically no one will talk to him
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:13.480]  even though there's a big international meeting about to start over in Russia
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:18.720]  that's hosted by Putin so the West literally pushing towards World War
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:24.360]  3 you have the neocons pushing Obama Kerry says that he holds objectors
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:28.800]  responsible for any future atrocities and serious is a just like Sandy Hook
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:33.720]  any kids are ever shot it's your fault doesn't matter gun deaths are down by
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:42.840]  61% gun violence down by 51% other crimes involving firearms down by 49%
[1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:48.720]  just departments own numbers doesn't matter it's your fault people are being
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:54.000]  shot and it's your fault somebody gassed some people over there and Kerry
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.960]  saying it's 1400 it's now 400 and all the evidence points towards the rebels it's
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:02.120]  your fault didn't you hear didn't you get the memo didn't you get the news
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:07.760]  weren't you told you do what they say or you're guilty so you get behind this
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:11.320]  war and then meanwhile we have Democratic Congress women and others
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:15.800]  coming out saying they're gonna vote for the war out of loyalty to Obama and
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:22.120]  we've got Chris Matthews saying Dems should vote for war to save Obama and
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:28.400]  here is that clip with Chris Matthews I think the Democrats gonna be forced to
[1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:32.200]  sacrifice men and women who really really don't want to vote for this and
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:35.480]  they're gonna have to vote for it to save the president's hide that's a very
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:44.000]  bad position to put your party okay now we're gonna queue up Ted Cruz here the
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.280]  saying US not Al Qaeda's Air Force because 60 plus percent of the forces out
[1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:53.080]  of nine groups fighting seven of the groups are Al Qaeda affiliate or actual
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:57.600]  Al Qaeda folks in not just in Syria but in Libya and in Egypt we've shown these
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:02.400]  videos on info wars we've we've we've done news reports on it most of the time
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:06.440]  because that's the coolest group to be part of according to them they are they
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:12.000]  have Al Qaeda flags the black flag that says the group of Al Qaeda the Al Qaeda
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.720]  flag and sometimes they say the bin Laden Brigade they put the name Osama
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:23.200]  bin Laden in Arabic and then they sing his name into battle we got video of
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.600]  tanks flying Al Qaeda flags in Syria CNN calls them protesters
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:32.640]  imagine if you attacked a building with a tank they'd call you a protester no
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.560]  they call you a terrorist it's all out there it's totally insane so so here's
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:42.600]  Ted Cruz calling it like it is all we have to do is rediscover reality say
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:46.040]  what it is yeah it was crazy two and a half years ago for us to say our
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:50.320]  government was running Al Qaeda now we force it out in the mainstream now it's
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:54.160]  safe for other people we're gonna get to rush limbo after this but here is Chris
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:02.440]  Matthews Ted Cruz we just played Chris Matthews Ted Cruz US not Al Qaeda's
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:08.080]  Air Force here it is we certainly don't have a dog at the fight right the war
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.240]  between Sunnis and Shiai in the Middle East what's been going on for centuries
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:16.720]  it's nothing new right well we're not gonna resolve the tensions over there and
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:20.440]  the last thing we ought to be doing is sending our sons and daughters into
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:25.960]  harm's way to get in the middle of this sectarian civil war we should be
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:29.360]  focused on defending the United States of America that's why young men and
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:35.040]  women sign up to join the military not to do it as you know you know search
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.280]  serve as Al Qaeda's Air Force unbelievable ladies and gentlemen so
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:46.120]  there is that clip now I'm gonna cover some news and then we're going to go
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:51.960]  back into some of the clips I haven't played Rush Limbaugh yet in fact maybe
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:57.160]  we should play that right now the full 15 minute clip is is up on info wars
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:01.640]  calm and prison planet calm this got picked up by a lot of media yesterday
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:07.120]  after our own Julie Wilson wrote about it I appreciate listeners sending us the
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:10.720]  YouTube clip that had just been uploaded at the end of the show yesterday
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:16.400]  breaking this down but good for Rush Limbaugh when shown overwhelming evidence
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:21.320]  that this is a false flag to point out it did come out a week before in the news
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:27.680]  there's about to be game-changing events in Syria for the US intervention and
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:32.640]  then the evidence there's video of it of the Al Qaeda forces loading the chemical
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:38.600]  weapons mortars on the mortar platforms to fire them here's Rush Limbaugh
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:44.720]  yesterday there's a growing volume of new evidence from numerous sources in the
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:50.320]  Middle East mostly affiliated with the Syrian opposition and its sponsors and
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:56.280]  supporters which makes a very strong case based on solid circumstantial
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:04.400]  evidence that the August 21st 2013 chemical strike in the Damascus suburbs
[1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:10.160]  was indeed a premeditated provocation it looks like there was US Intel
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:15.800]  involvement dating a week before the alleged chemical weapons attack in
[1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:21.560]  meetings that were anticipating a war-changing event so we could be
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:29.440]  looking here at a at a frame job available data puts the horror in a
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:32.880]  different and disturbing light meaning it's not basher doing the horrible
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:39.120]  things it's the rebels north gassing themselves framing basher setting him
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:43.760]  up so the Al Qaeda guys win and then we end up on the side of Al Qaeda you've
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:50.760]  heard that being speculated about if indeed this is a frame job look at how
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:55.240]  well it's being run I'm not attaching any weight in this to what they have said
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:15:00.280]  it just to me it's coincidental on Saturday at these two notes from friends
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:04.200]  of mine who've done business in the Middle East in Syria just do not think
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:11.440]  this that they know or saw they cannot believe and he would do this well plus
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:15.440]  when he's gonna be invaded and thrown out of power they're fighting for two
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:20.280]  and a half plus years winning and then the West is openly framing them and I
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.000]  don't agree with limbaugh here on one point that Obama's doing a great job
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.600]  this is falling flat on his face you got Ron Paul Rand Paul Pat Buchanan and
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:35.520]  all these other people saying it looks like a false flag staged event you've
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:39.400]  got the rebels so shoddy when it comes to their work that they you don't want to
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:43.440]  upload the hero videos of themselves showing they did it as the Al Qaeda
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:50.600]  jihadi clowns always do and it's just all collapsing but the problem is they
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:54.680]  may do something big to get them out of this crisis I want to hear from
[1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:58.000]  listeners I want to hear from police I want to hear from military I want to
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:03.800]  hear from everybody about what you think about this situation now and and by
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:08.240]  the way in Senate testimony former senator John Kerry said oh we want
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:11.720]  authorization for boots on the ground because Syria may implode they've been
[1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:15.800]  trying to implode it to divide it in at least two parts probably three that's
[1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:23.440]  Presensky's plan that has always been the plan by these pieces of trash and they
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:29.520]  know that Syria went back to the wall will fire missiles at Israel they've
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:33.400]  said we'll never use our legal lawful chemical weapons unless Israel that's
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:38.560]  pushing for this attacks us through proxies through the US and others then
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:45.160]  we may attack you and folks Israel when that happens is going to they've said
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:49.320]  they're going to start nuking people now again I know most Israelis I talked to
[1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:53.120]  on the phone who call in and people I know they're Jewish here in Austin Texas
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:57.320]  it's all madness when we say Israel's doing this or we say America's doing
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:01.680]  this or NATO's doing this the the the out-of-control kleptocrats that are
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:08.280]  running things are doing this now the the leaders of the Knesset and even
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:14.080]  Netanyahu's people came out a few days ago and said look we can handle Syria if
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:19.280]  something goes on you know we'll back your strike if you do it but you don't
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:23.320]  have to do a strike so I think Israel's even getting cold feet in this
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:28.440]  because the Iranians folks have got medium-range missiles and and there's
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.600]  good chance that they're gonna fire them at Israel and I know a lot of good old
[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:36.040]  boys go I good let's attack another country I don't like them a rabs or
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:41.400]  them Persians our government overthrew with the British in 53 a secular pro
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:47.880]  America leader to put bad people in charge there was an attack what was it
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:55.400]  in 1989 another in 90 blowing up a bunch of battleships and stuff that the look
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:17:58.560]  of operation praying man I think that's the name I'm going for memory look up
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:05.760]  US strike on Iran US naval strike on Iran biggest US naval engagement since
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:10.760]  World War two is that is one of the headlines you can see the gun pod video
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:14.760]  of blowing up the battleships and missile cruisers they didn't want Iran
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:18.520]  to have the Navy they just they just blew up their Navy and Iran put up with
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:21.840]  that I mean Iran and I'm not romanticizing them and I don't want to live
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:25.680]  in Iran and I don't live under the moolahs and I'm a Christian the point is
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:28.720]  they're not here running my life they're not putting face scanning cameras up
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:31.520]  they're not trying to teach five-year-olds in public school how to have
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.080]  anal sex I'm sorry to say that but it's even worse than that as Obama has
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:38.520]  openly pushed they don't have Jocelyn elders over here trying to teach three
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:41.360]  year olds how to masturbate and I'm sorry to talk like that these are all a
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:47.720]  bunch of sick freaks folks these are scumbags okay they're they are demonic

[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  was an attack April 18th 1988 by us naval forces within Iranian
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  territorial waters and retaliation
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:49.120]  for the Iranian mining of the Persian Gulf during the Iran Iraq war and the
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:53.120]  subsequent damage to an American ship
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:57.120]  yeah how dare Iran try to repulse the U.S. funded
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  Iraqi seven-year war that killed over a million and a half Iranians
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:05.120]  another thing how dare those Iranians not like their government overthrown
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:09.120]  then the itolas put in by the CIA then double-crossed them
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:13.120]  then fund Saddam to attack them for seven years kill a million and a half of them
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:17.120]  then they tried to fight back and the U.S. blow up all their ships yeah
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  yeah get tough Iran take some more Iran
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.120]  you're bad the TV told me so you deserve to be
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  nuked we need world war three let's have it with Russia to
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:33.120]  they deserve it
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  and it goes on
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  and on and on if Iran was trying
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.120]  to make me buy government healthcare and double premiums so the government
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  could cut off the type of healthcare I'd get I'd hate them if Iran
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:53.120]  was trying to take my guns I would hate them if Iran was
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.120]  trying to send our sons and daughters off for flying wars to die for globalists
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  I'd hate them if they were trying to make me take deadly vaccines on record to
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:05.120]  dumb me down I would hate them and they were putting fluoride in my water on
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  record Harvard studies to brain damage me I would hate them
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:13.120]  if Syria was doing any of that I'd hate them
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  I'd call for war with them because they did something to me
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  let me tell you who's done something to me is the New World Order let me tell you who's done
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  something to you it's the New World Order they have sucked us dry to build this world
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:29.120]  government and to commit crimes all over the planet in our names and every time
[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:33.120]  some country whether it's Brazil or whether it's Iran or whether
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  it's an African country tries to build an infrastructure
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  and tries to have a better life the New World Order goes in there with our troops and our
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  young people that join the CIA and other groups to sabotage
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  those countries because nobody's allowed to have nothing but the New World Order
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:53.120]  and now the New World Order shutting off our power plants now they're shutting off our infrastructure
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  now they're bankrupting our dollar they're going to do to us what they've done to everybody else
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  ladies and gentlemen they are the plague they are the enemy they are the
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:05.120]  scourge and I've had enough of it and that's why everybody's
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  turning against the New World Order now because they get it's all lies it's all death
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  it's fruits are poison you make a deal
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.120]  with these guys you get absolutely hammered
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  people are tired of being screwed over and they know both parties
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:25.120]  are working for the same globalist now I mean hallelujah
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  that Ted Cruz is coming out and Rand Paul and Ron Paul and I told
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  you even though Ron Paul lost the two elections the idea
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  of liberty and common sense and fighting false flag and the government
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:41.120]  shipping and the drugs and all that is now commonplace and people have
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:45.120]  a choice now they know the New World Order
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:49.120]  is doing it they know it's the author of our problems because there's
[1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:53.120]  opposition resistance is victory and we've been here
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:57.120]  with opposition criticizing their programs criticizing their lies
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:01.120]  criticizing their frauds criticizing the things they're doing pointing out
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:05.120]  their lies we're there and we're shutting them down
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:09.120]  the Pentagon admits that Brzezinski admits it Hillary admits it we are
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  now on top the New World Order smashing its teeth in
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:17.120]  ramming its nose off its face ripping its ears off gouging
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:21.120]  its eyeballs in you understand that but the
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  problem is they're going to launch something even bigger but I'm telling you if this was
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  Hitler he's in the bunker I'm telling you we just got to push
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:33.120]  this all the way and know when they nuke a city or something
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:37.120]  in fact even if there's nuclear war after it all happens remember the New World Order
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:41.120]  did it go dig them out of their bases bring them to justice

[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:05.120]  but our top story that i mentioned in the first hour that's redlinked
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  upon info wars.com
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:15.120]  he is exclusive high level source confirms secret u.s. nuclear warhead
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  transfer by anthony guttiardi and alex jones
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:25.120]  so the tip came into me and me and auntie and i wrote this story together yesterday
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  this source came directly into us the source has been known by us for a decade or so
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:35.120]  a high level source inside the military has now confirmed
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:39.120]  to us that dais air force base in texas is actively
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.120]  moving nuclear warheads to the east coast of the united states and a secret
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  transfer that has no paper trail according to the high level
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  military source who has a strong record of continually
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:55.120]  being proven correct in deep military activity the dais air force commander
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.120]  authorized this person was there folks unknown parties to transfer
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:03.120]  the nuclear warheads to an unknown location
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:07.120]  inside south carolina where the warheads will then be
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:11.120]  picked up and potentially utilized
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:15.120]  this is a particular interest not only due to the fact that the syrian situation
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  has escalated to the point a very realistic hot war scenario as u.s.
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:23.120]  today reported but due to the fact that dais has repeatedly denied the
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:27.120]  existence of nuclear warheads inside the base we should probably add since the 1980s
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.120]  when they were removed under treaty
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  happened and everything we were given was confirmed because welton henson was in the air force
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:39.120]  and worked on the b ones and f-16s and he was there
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  for years
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.120]  at the base
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:51.120]  but again you can go to info wars dot com and see this story red linked there on the site
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:55.120]  so you can read it for yourself and that the weapons were reportedly
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  moved in the 80s under treaty they're not allowed to be at that base
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  and that he'd seen russian inspectors there before
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:07.120]  looking in the b1 bombers the b1b's to make sure they had the braces
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.120]  put in them so they couldn't carry the large hydrogen bombs
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  and i went and talked to welton henson again who's worked in mavis for six years and he
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:19.120]  confirmed a lot of what we were told by our source the brief report
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  from the top of a military source which was written in a rush to get the
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:27.120]  information out reads dais is beginning to
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  move out nuclear warheads today i got a tap from dermo
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:35.120]  earlier he said it was the first time they had been ever acknowledged
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:39.120]  since being put there in the 80s no signature
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:43.120]  was required for transfer there was no directive he said that the dais
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  commander was on site to give authority to release no one knew where
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  they were really going but the truck driver said to take
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:55.120]  that they were to be taken to south carolina and another
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  pickup would then take them from there was the quote
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:03.120]  i'm reading what was sent to us then we made a call about it
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  the fact that the transfer was not signed for and there were no papers
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  this key it shows how the military is now secretly operating
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:15.120]  with the transfer of nuclear weapons and what's more we know that
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:19.120]  dermo a military base in florida is a hotbed of special operations
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:23.120]  why is dermo operating the nuclear warheads out of dais air force base
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  with no paper trail this shows this is a highly
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.120]  secretive black ops style move
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:35.120]  and that the military does not want it on record and then he goes through
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  some of the examples of what's at the base the b1b
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:43.120]  bombers all of this is
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.120]  absolutely incredible
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  now again this could just be moving them
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.120]  somewhere to be put on aircraft that are then going to be flown to the middle east
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  but the issue with that is then they're signed for it's on record they're loaded
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  generally on the aircraft that are going to be flying to the middle east
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:07.120]  or on a transport aircraft to move them to the middle east
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.120]  you don't just have them not signed for that's why
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  base security and others were really upset
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.120]  but the base commander was there to say this is authorized
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:23.120]  and everybody had their mouths hanging open as these nukes drove off the base
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:27.120]  to south carolina
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:31.120]  I mean who even knows if that's true ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  that this report was not from an accurate source
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:39.120]  and again you can go to info wars dot com
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:43.120]  where we have the article posted and please send this on to your friends and family
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  and you can scroll through and see shots from satellite of the
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:51.120]  nuke bunkers they had from back in the 80s
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  you can scroll through and see the b1b bombers all of it that
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  left over a week ago and have it come back
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  42 bombers out of Missouri left and haven't come back
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:07.120]  and then of course we have an image of a fukushima
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.120]  survivor not fukushima excuse me a harashima
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:15.120]  survivor from 1945 of what I guess survivors
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  have to look forward to who aren't killed by the initial blast
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:23.120]  that was atomic weapons of course now they're hydrogen and beyond
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  but look he's enjoying his food there
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:31.120]  I really admire people that have had their entire faces burned off
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.120]  like that Japanese man who was a boy at the time
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:39.120]  who could still enjoy life and smile through it all
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:43.120]  and has a beautiful heart even though all the skin was burned off being in the harashima
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:47.120]  blast there's quite a few Japanese that walk around
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  looking just like that
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  absolutely insane so the story goes on to break down the different
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:59.120]  2007 cruise missiles came up missing from a mine out
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:03.120]  north dakota and they were being shipped down to Louisiana
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:07.120]  and there was a big freak out in the military and a bunch of people died
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  at the dakota base who were witnesses they died of
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:15.120]  suicide car wrecks in the week after and then they had to admit okay the nukes
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:19.120]  were accidentally shipped and the paperwork wasn't signed so see people
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  at these bases know you're not just to have nukes just going airplane and there's
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.120]  no record of it or they're just to be sent by airplanes down to another state
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:31.120]  with no paperwork they know to blow the whistle and so I hope people
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:35.120]  don't start dying over this hope I don't you know get pulled over tonight
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.120]  and get shot in the head by a police officer struck by a bolt of lightning
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:43.120]  yeah there it is from wikipedia the united states air force nuclear weapons
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:47.120]  incident and again I don't ever believe wikipedia but it has a big bibliography at the bottom
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:51.120]  you can scroll down it's a strategic air command one of the main
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:55.120]  bases in the u.s. beefs to two bombers there is well air force global strike
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:59.120]  command and if you scroll down to the bottom you can
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:03.120]  read about the minot base and the
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  cruise missiles that were loaded the stealth cruise missiles
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  that were loaded on the aircraft to be shipped down and they go to the bottom
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.120]  it has the bibliography right there for everybody the response by the
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.120]  government the incident the hearings the commissions what went on but don't
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:23.120]  worry all those that helped load them they all died real fast so we'll
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  never find out exactly what happened yeah and and there's the mainstream news articles

[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  I absolutely am like an attack dog I'm like a trained German shepherd
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  that's trained if somebody breaks in the house to attack them I mean I literally am born
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:41.120]  to go after these people I absolutely enjoy
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:45.120]  the fact that they could come after me I'm not worried about it whatever happens
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:49.120]  it's in God's hands I I don't pray to God to protect me
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  I pray to God that his will be done
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  in times of weakness I do pray that my children be protected but that's weak
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:01.120]  I need to just put it all in God's hands and have faith in I do
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  I'm 100% in all in God give me strength to be good
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  God give me strength to be articulate but I'm in I need you to be in with me
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  I need you to stand right beside me committed and that means spreading the word about the broadcast
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  that means buying the products folks because we're not fun about taxpayer money like MSNBC
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  and the rest of the state run media we are 110%
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  we couldn't have done what we've done I realize without all of you spreading the word
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  thank God for you without folks like Drudge Report helping us George Norrie
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  helping us all the people there that wanted justice and knew we were telling
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  the truth who really helped magnify what info wars has done all of you I thank
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  you from the bottom of my heart for your support and we'll give it right back to you because we're all in this together
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  that's what kinship is all about and isn't about race it isn't even about
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:49.120]  religion in the final equation it's about humanity standing for justice
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  people that want justice and truth who value that above everything else and who don't like
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:57.120]  liars and scum and don't like bullies and con artists we stand together
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  and it's time for us to get aggressive and we're doing it and you're seeing it happen
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:05.120]  but now is the maximum danger so I'd pray to God
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  if I was you out there to open other people's eyes and to have Providence move
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  to save this country and the world from this great darkness and to give us a reprieve
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  time to wake up others
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  all these fake devil churches all these fake devil churches they say oh no
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  don't even pray about what's happening don't worry about abortion don't worry about the war
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  don't worry about all the corruption God's going to handle it it's at the end of the world you're going to be raptured
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  even if all that was true which I don't believe it is what a cop out
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  the whole Bible is about who will stand up for me
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  against the wicked ones who will stand against the tyrants all the prophets
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  Christ our lord and
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:49.120]  you're stood against the tyrants went against the tyrants didn't follow the orders of the king
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  didn't follow the orders of Herod didn't follow the orders of the money changers
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  and then they tell you just go along with it ladies and gentlemen God's going to

[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  doug reyberg investigating officer from
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  the it was secret they declassified it a few years ago
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  of the missing nuclear weapons where they uh by the way they killed everybody
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  who was witnesses it was it was a dirty operation
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  we believe for a false flag uh and
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  now nukes have gone missing again so according to our source
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  i wonder if anybody's gonna do anything about it

[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  but the republic and democratic parties are run by a bunch of crazy bankers
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  and globalists who think they're above the law but the british government says
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  we don't care how many attacks there are we're not gonna attack now because the syrians
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  and the iranians are gonna hit israel and then israel's gonna hit them and then

[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:45.120]  by Anthony Gucciardi this is absolutely amazing
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  I said I'll go to your phone calls you've been holding for 30 minutes 40 minutes some of you

[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  but I don't think he's a conservative icon we ought to put Ted Cruz up there
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  by Matt Drudge because he's the one really putting it into shame but no big deal
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  I'm cheap cook bottle washer editor you name it
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  you're the one on air here let's go to James
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.120]  in Arizona you're on the air go ahead
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  yeah Alex I just wanted to give you a couple of reports from
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  the military side of the house basically
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  National Guard and the Marines at least the ones I communicate with they're all pretty much
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  understanding that they're severe
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  but they're afraid to say anything but I also
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  have veteran friends who got out who are like trying to
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  talk them talk some sense into them so on one hand
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  the military is awake on the other hand they're very
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  scared to do anything and or say anything and so therefore
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  it's up to the veterans the friends that have gotten out to push
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  that was my first point second point was
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  that typically you have a
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  what's it called a money bomb every year and I was kind of hoping
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  this year you would get another big one going I think I know I'm so busy I don't have time
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  to plan one and I need the money but it doesn't matter I mean I can
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  sell if I ever need to I'll just sell my house I've improved it some
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  I'm not even worried about it I'm going 110% I'm gonna finish this TV setup
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  get that going but the problem is I don't have enough crew enough money to ever get everything finished
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  because I'm so busy working on everything else I'm doing I'm not a businessman I'm just somebody trying to fight
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  the new world order but I'm getting better well you were burned out last year with the
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  Ron Paul and all this trying to get him elected and it's this year it's like all
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  the employers need to get on board and invest this year because we need to
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  get your operation growing that's my second point my third point is on a false flag
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  I fear that they're gonna do a Mumbai in this country because they want to ban guns
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  so they're gonna do a mass al-qaeda shooting Mumbai style attack and that
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  was my third point so the military is awake Alex we got him awake
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  except for a few it's just they're afraid to do anything so I'm calling on the vet
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  to take action and get your military activity friends on the same
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  side as you if they're just scared absolutely and there's one thing that stopped
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  them doing a Mumbai as the CIA got caught in mainstream news staging
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  that as we said they did it came out a few years later and the Indian papers then
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  the western papers and the US papers that they did stage that attack
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  on record but expanding on that
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  they'll do it in some place like New York or Chicago
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  or a gun-free zone but we need people
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  that are nearby that are still having the second amendment to basically
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  like death commandos go take out the terrorist whenever they're
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:53.120]  in a shopping mall or wherever killing people because they're gonna order the cops to stand down
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  so the terrorists who've been wound up they might even know they've been set up
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  to be able to kill as many people as possible the minute it starts
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  we need gun owners wherever the shooting's happening to just go in
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  I pledge to do this if there's a mass shooting down the street I'm not waiting for the cops
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  just like you know my family right here in Texas when the tower shooting
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  happened and Mike Hansen's dad was involved in you know trying to stop that when it
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  happened I've had the the Austin cop on who went up with the citizen and shot
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  the shooter on the top of it the minute there's a mass shooting
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:29.120]  it's time for men it's not scary just just be a man decide you're gonna charge
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  in and go in and kill these people anybody starts a mass shooting
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  citizens need to go in and they need to kill them bottom line
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  there's a mass shooting around me I'm coming to kill whoever's doing it
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  cops probably shoot me in the back trying to stop it they'll sit around for five hours outside
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  and you know have a hot dog roasting contest or something but the police don't need to
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  wait either they'll be told to stand down police you just go in and you kill them
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  anybody starts a mass shooting kill them that's what you do
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  you kill them you charge in and you kill them
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:05.120]  it's hurricane and wildfire season again I do thousands of people sit in

[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:29.120]  not just the whole world but many prominent people in the United States mainly libertarians true conservatives like Pat Buchanan
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:47.120]  Matt Drudge Ted Cruz Rand Paul myself Alex Jones you're listening to Rush Limbaugh is coming out saying it looks like it may be a false flag that's because it is a false flag and you know I've told people to do articles on this and they have
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:09:05.120]  but the media the mainstream media that the the kleptocratic decepticon media the parent media that covers up everything for Obama and the rest of his followers and the globalist earlier this year the rebels got caught with a chemical weapon attack a few dozen people got killed
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:25.120]  and the Russians tested it and said that's NATO derivative chemicals that's not Russian stuff that Assad has and then the UN tested it and had to admit that was true the Turkish military caught Al Qaeda rebels trying to sneak chemical weapons across the
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:37.120]  border and stopped them people say well why if Turkey's for the rope for the rebels and they do that because the average military unit that catches Al Qaeda people with chemical weapons is going to arrest them ladies and gentlemen
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:51.120]  you don't just let people run around with that stuff see that's the thing about compartmentalization the average boots on the ground I don't care if it's Turkey Syria Israel our troops in Iraq whatever the case is their good men women
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:10:04.120]  their compartmentalized but the establishment is just a bunch of globalist crooks trying to start new wars because they make money off of it they're above the countries they make money out of all our misery they get to take more of our
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:19.120]  liberties out of these wars but now you've got Ted Cruz coming out saying we don't need to supply our Air Force to be the Air Force to for Al Qaeda we played that clip last hour this is big stuff we're going to go to your phone calls right now
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  Mitch and Doris and Patrick and Jason but first let me just briefly mention this breaking article it's now on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and I'm going to tweet it out during the next break at real Alex Jones so that everybody can then retweet it
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:56.120]  breaking Russia says Syrian chemical weapons made by rebels further adding to the analysis of prominent individuals like Ron Paul Pat Buchanan and others who have agreed with our analysis a new report from
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:12.120]  Russia lens evidence that the chemical attack in Syria was in fact carried out by the Obama backed Syrian rebels in order to initiate military action in the nation in a new breaking report released by the Russian Foreign Ministry just moments ago it has now been
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:29.120]  announced that the chemical weapons responsible for the attack in Syria and blamed on Assad's government and army are linked up to the rebel made weaponry specifically the finding state that the chemical weapons shells are very much
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:47.120]  different from the standard Syrian army weaponry and extremely similar to those made by the US funded rebels who have been caught time and time again burning villages full of innocence and all they do is just target areas of the city in Damascus that they
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:12:03.120]  don't control right on the edge and nerve gas through enemies and run around grandstanding and our media buys right into it because they're a bunch of sick freaks from the Russian report probes from Khan Al assault show chemicals used in the March 19
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:18.120]  attack did not belong to standard Syrian army ammunition and that's the one from earlier this year when it came out and that the shells carrying the substance was similar to those made by rebel fighting group the Russian Foreign Minister said so again that's the
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  earlier report from a share I was just mentioning and it happened last year as well so that is basically what's going on new reports and old reports this has happened over and over and over again alright let's go to your phone calls Mitch in Pennsylvania you're on the
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:53.120]  air welcome hi Alex I got one question for you yes go ahead I need to know I was wondering what you think about like why is it that they these elites always choose September as the time for their false flag attacks I know that they keep
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:13:12.120]  astrologists and things like that on the payroll why is it that they do that they are a bunch of mentally ill freaks who follow a bunch of different bizarre quackery and which he put stuff I don't know I mean there's so many different schools of
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:27.120]  thought the globalists follow so many different weird mystery school things but you know generally you want to start wars from the old days in the spring because then you could fight through the spring summer and fall you don't fight in the winter
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:43.120]  because troops can freeze the death and a lot of other stuff happens you know you basically go to your armored fortresses your keeps during those type of periods but historically a lot of wars do get launched in the autumn Hitler launched what operation
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:14:00.120]  Russia in the late summer fall and then of course the winter came and the winter rains in Russia that took out Napoleon same thing happened there but I don't know I mean I really can't answer that question for you because there's so many different
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  things these people follow but it's also a political diversion as Democrats are all admitting and they're so sick and so divorced from reality that they don't even care if we know they're like yeah we're gonna have a war because it'll help Obama
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:30.120]  it's like what you're gonna you're gonna go do this maybe start World War three for this idiot teleprompter reader and John Kerry with a rubber face it looks like a sleet stack or something I mean I just don't know what to say anymore
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:32.120]  what do you think is going on Mitch
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:52.120]  Well I'm a former militia former paramilitary and really what I think it is is worldwide around that it's just the right time of year to start a war and keep people in a weaker state that's just my personal opinion because right before winter it's right before the rainy season it's
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:15:00.120]  right before anything that can keep your while your average individual down that's my opinion anyway
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:13.120]  Listen God bless you absolutely look we are blind to this because we're not sick freaks if you study sick freaks you learn in criminology throughout history they like to hurt innocent people they like to dominate they like ugly things
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:28.120]  Hitler and this was put out in German film reels during the start of World War two the first two or three years actually he would go by armored train to the front lines in France and Poland in Russia
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:44.120]  and he would watch with telescopes for sometimes he would have his doctors injecting with methamphetamine and he would eat like 25 Patriot pastries and he would just sit there eating candy bars and pastries jumping around hopping around
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  watching stuka bombers dive bombers burning in cities and and and he would have them bring them film reels and photographs of piles of dead bodies and black uniforms and burning cities were so beautiful and I've read Hitler's
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:14.120]  writings I'm not just believing propaganda I've gone and read his writings about the art he loved he didn't like modern art he like classical art except for some new modern art that was like demons and devils and
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:33.120]  it was one famous painting of of a banshee and death and he said I love that painting those eyes those are the eyes of my mother and he was just really into death and nighttime rallies and torches and black uniforms and
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  skull and signals and you know black bombers taking off and just that's what he was into and and if people want to understand this that's that's what we're dealing with these people like it they like blood they like death they like killing
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:17:11.120]  people they like wars let's go to Doris in Tennessee thanks for holding hey I went to visit Chuck Baldwin I got on a plane in Nashville my husband and I we went to Cal spell Montana we stayed there approximately two weeks and went
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:29.120]  to church and we really like Chuck he's telling the truth and I appreciate you having people like that on and I also wanted to talk about Syria and what I think is going to happen which you know really doesn't matter what I think
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  but I think it's pretty good synopsis with what I'm here you say about these missing nuclear weapons is that what it is nuclear weapons.
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:18:00.120]  Yes ma'am. I was I had crew coming in here to give me an article when you were asking about nuclear weapons. Yes, our report is atomic warheads or hydrogen warheads out of the base in West Texas being transferred to South Carolina that's what the base security
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:14.120]  and the base police and others were all there but it's it's mainly normal police regular civilian police that are part of base security in front of the main officers and the and the order was the base commander with no paperwork to transfer those out yes.
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:40.120]  Okay, now I have an article that I found it's anonymous shocking current events where FEMA region three has an alert. It's in the senator state senator retired she'll then a song song a sad of South Dakota issued an emergency
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  FEMA region three alert on August the 13th region three is course you know Washington, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and they have said that they have all these orders to get mercy vaccinations.
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:13.120]  $11 million. The CDC has ordered 11. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. In fact, it's in the news regionally, not just on the east coast but all over the country. FEMA the last six months has been mobilizing like it's the end of the world.
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:24.120]  They've got a National Guard called up on emergency alert in most areas of the country. They've never been called people I've talked to it like 4am. You know, come in you're not going to work for the next few weeks.
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:37.120]  It doesn't matter. The Chinese are on alert. The Russians are on alert. I mean, they're moving nuclear weapons around on record. They've been deploying B2 bombers and B1 bombers to Diego Garcia.
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:55.120]  I mean, this is serious, serious business. Yes, I know. But I did get on a plane at the height of the global terrorist alert and I traveled 2300 miles to make Chuck Baldwin because I saw him on your program and I recognize the man of God when I see him.
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:20:01.120]  He's a great guy. I gotta go. God bless you. Good to hear from you. More calls coming up in Rappaports joining us.
[2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:10.120]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:18.120]  Just like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall. So too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.

[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:06.120]  I want you to know some very important information.
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:12.120]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[2:23:12.120 --> 2:23:15.120]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

[2:23:57.120 --> 2:24:21.120]  It's the only one you've got.
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:28.120]  By the way, Rand Paul is in the Senate right now debating Senator McCain and others.
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  He's trying to get resolutions in there on the war powers to make them properly vote on this military authorization.
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.120]  We're going to, Mr. Rappaport here in a moment will continue with your phone calls with John Rappaport
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:48.120]  to give us his take on this, but let's fade up some of this debate that's going on right now for radio people.
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:56.120]  I want to bring in Dan Abash, our Chief Congressional Correspondent.
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:03.120]  That's enough. Sing an end cut over it. I wanted to play some of that because Rand Paul was arguing just seconds ago
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:08.120]  before we went live with him, but we recorded that so we can probably have some of that later in the hour.
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:15.120]  This is historical though, just the fact that they're having to debate whether Congress is going to authorize the military strike
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:19.120]  and then McCain's trying to say, well, we don't even really need this, but we want this.
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:24.120]  So there was a debate about, no, you do need this authorization.
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  So again, by resisting, we're forcing this debate out in the open and we have right on our side.
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  So that hurts them.
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:40.120]  Now, John Rappaport is a media analyst, investigative journalist and frequent guest here on the broadcast
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:45.120]  and he joins us for the balance of the hour to take phone calls and cover the news.
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:53.120]  But I wanted to just overall get your take here, John, on historically the point we're at.
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:57.120]  And I don't want you to just agree with me out of hand because I don't know your view right now on this.
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  I want to get it.
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:02.120]  That I see this as one of the most historical things that's ever happened.
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:04.120]  You've got a mass awakening to the false flags.
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:13.120]  All these prominent people from Rush Limbaugh to Pat Buchanan to Rand Paul saying our government's behind Al Qaeda now.
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:15.120]  This looks like a false flag.
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:17.120]  This is unprecedented.
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:19.120]  The military is waking up in mass.
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:22.120]  The military is calling into the show saying they're against it.
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:24.120]  The media is trying to spin it and saying it's all fake.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:28.120]  Well, it's Rush Limbaugh and Pat Buchanan's fake and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  Are they fake?
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:30.120]  Is Alex Jones fake?
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:32.120]  No, the truth is this is all imploding.
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  Secretary of State Kerry is saying if there's any more atrocities, it's those of us that are against the war.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:39.120]  It's our fault.
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  So they're trying to guilt us, which is just royally over the top and arrogant.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:50.120]  And I see this as the moment that the new world order really begins to collapse.
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:51.120]  It may take a month.
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  It may take five years.
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:27:00.120]  But this is really a magic moment where more and more people are putting on the dark sunglasses and seeing the real world,
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:02.120]  a.k.a. they live.
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  But we're at that critical juncture where the devils that run this may try an even bigger crisis to try to regain control over the world's psyche.
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:15.120]  So do you agree with me on that?
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:19.120]  And if so, if not, where do you think we are historically?
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:22.120]  Because I know you're a smart guy and talk about the mass psyche of the public.
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:29.120]  You said day one that it was a devastating victory against CNN when I blew up and put them on notice.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:32.120]  So many people were scared up front and didn't like it.
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  Weeks later, they said it was one of the most, you know, greatest moments ever.
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:44.120]  And when I talked to the producers, they said, we're not allowed to have you back on, even though we had, you know, 2 million plus viewers.
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:49.120]  He normally has half a million on that CNN show.
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:55.120]  And basically it's now seen as you said it was as a major time that the trance was broken.
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  I see this as about 100 times bigger than that.
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:01.120]  Maybe a thousand times and that this is a sea changing event.
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:03.120]  We're going to break in a moment. This is a short segment.
[2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:08.120]  But John Radford, give us your take on how big this is.
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:14.120]  Well, Alex, I've been doing nothing but writing about this for the last two, three days, one article after another,
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:25.120]  because I see it as this shifting huge iceberg shifting because so many people are now aware
[2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  that this is a completely phony deal.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  Yet another war that's being foisted on us for no good reason.
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:35.120]  There is no evidence.
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  We're not allowed to see the evidence just as always.
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:40.120]  We have to take it on faith.
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:45.120]  And people are breaking out all over the place, whether it's an alternative media,
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:53.120]  whether it's main, even in some portions of mainstream media, certain politicians are stepping forward and saying, hold on.
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:58.120]  This is phony and we have a chance to do something about it here.
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:04.120]  Meanwhile, the war machine keeps on running on and on and on.
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:09.120]  You've got Kerry saying, well, maybe just a single attack isn't enough.
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  Maybe it's going to have to be extended, et cetera.
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:19.120]  And he said today that the Arabs would pay for this whole thing and that that would be fine with him,
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:24.120]  the entire invasion, meaning much more than a missile strike.
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:27.120]  I mean, talk about a clash of civilizations.
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:28.120]  This is it.
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:29.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:30.120]  And they're saying boots on the ground.
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:31.120]  Wow.
[2:29:31.120 --> 2:29:33.120]  I can't wait to hear what else you're going to break down.
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  Absolutely crystallizing what I've been trying to say in two hours and in two minutes.
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.120]  We'll be right back with the amazing John Rappaport.
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:41.120]  Your phone calls and more.
[2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:50.120]  But yeah, America and NATO now has mercenaries of Saudi Arabia offering to pay to have Damascus turned over to them.
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:51.120]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  The Empire's just like in 1918 with Lawrence of the Arabian and the GCN radio network.

[2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:20.120]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:24.120]  By the way, just an update. We always correct ourselves when we're wrong.
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:33.120]  Even a mainstream media is the reason we're wrong. RT put out about 45 minutes ago that they had found that the rebels had made the chemical weapons
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  and that it was the new chemical weapons and then they updated it to say no, no, no, no.
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:45.120]  The two separate times before we tested it and that was confirmed earlier this year and last year, the UN tested it.
[2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:50.120]  It was not the types that the Syrian military has.
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:57.120]  Folks, we have WorldNet Daily last week with the videos that were uploaded on real jihadi sites that have been around for years,
[2:33:57.120 --> 2:34:03.120]  of them loading the chemical mortars and firing them, and they are of the NATO type.
[2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:09.120]  So you can look that up for yourself. So, I mean, all of this is really passé now.
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:13.120]  So it's almost a minor point, though, because that's what I've been making the point over and over again,
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:21.120]  is that if you have the rebels caught by the Turks and others with chemical weapons, it gets tested,
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  and they go, this is Western chemical weapons, they're not even trying to go and fake Russian-style systems, which they could do.
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:40.120]  They just don't care. They don't even care that for two and a half years they've called the rebels protestors and activists.
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  They did that in Libya. How dare the Libyans or how dare the Egyptians, how dare the Syrians crack down on protestors,
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  protestors with rocket launchers, protestors with anti-aircraft missiles.
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:59.120]  This is all about Benghazi folks and the military who knows about all this stuff, that's their business.
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:08.120]  They're really freaked out because, as I've told you for two and a half years, in Jordan, there are U.S. CIA contractors,
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:19.120]  because the main military isn't even really doing it, training brigade-level groups of jihadis on sabotage, you name it.
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  And I've been telling you that for two and a half years, Obama came out yesterday in the New York Times, said,
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:33.120]  I'm getting tough. We're sending in CIA trained jihadis, commandos out of Jordan.
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:39.120]  There have been contractor boots on the ground fighting Russians. There's been Russians dying.
[2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:49.120]  The jihadis have paraded them around on TV. I mean, U.S. troops are commanding al-Qaeda against Russians right now.
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:55.120]  And I'm not siding with Russia. My country's been hijacked by the New World Order and it's doing all this.
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  We're going back to John Rappaport and your calls, but here it is, Reuters. Putin presses U.S. Congress over Syria, says Kerry lied.
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. Congress had no right to approve the use of force against Syria
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:16.120]  without a decision from the UN Security Council and that doing so would be an act of aggression.
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:23.120]  He said anything that is outside the UN Security Council is aggression except self-defense.
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:34.120]  Now that Congress and the U.S. Senate are doing, in essence, is legalizing aggression, this is inadmissible in principle.
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:39.120]  They lie beautifully. Of course, I saw debates in Congress. A congressman says, Mr. Kerry, is al-Qaeda there?
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  He says, no. I am telling you responsibly that it's not.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:48.120]  Putin said at a meeting of his Human Rights Council in the Kremlin.
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:55.120]  And then he goes on to say al-Qaeda units are the main military echelon and they know this, he said, referring to the United States.
[2:36:55.120 --> 2:37:02.120]  It was unpleasant and surprising for me. We talked to them. We proceed from the assumption that they are direct people.
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:07.120]  But he is lying and knows he is lying.
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:14.120]  That's right. The Russian military is talking to the U.S. military and the U.S. military is basically apologizing.
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:21.120]  Dempsey is saying, don't launch an attack. This is unprecedented to the level that Matt Drudge puts out a tweet saying,
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:29.120]  Vladimir Putin is now the leader of the free world. This is disgusting that we are run by such rotten, nasty.
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:32.120]  I look at those senators up there attacking Rand Paul right now.
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:39.120]  There are all these old, nothing against old people, but these old, corrupt, an old person that's loving is very wonderful.
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:47.120]  These evil, bloated, corrupt scumbags that are all attacking Rand, acting like he doesn't know anything, acting like, you know,
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:50.120]  but he's tearing them up right now on C-SPAN. We're taping it.
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:54.120]  And I sit there and I watch the spectacle. Let's go back to John Rappaport.
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:38:00.120]  John crystallized all this for us historically. Where do you think it's going? How big a deal is this?
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:08.120]  And do you feel like vomiting when you look at Kerry because it's like all the humanity was sucked out of him and he's a rubber suit now?
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  I mean, just the last month, John Kerry looks like a body snatcher took him over.
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  I mean, it's like he's been cursed with his evil.
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  John, what's your take on this?
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  Yeah, he froze. I was wondering, I said, he looks really still there the last few minutes.
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:32.120]  Look at him on Skype and his Skype stand. He probably didn't even hear all that question.
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  Oh, man, I tell you, as we hurdle along like an insane freight train, so we're going to get John's take on that while we're getting him on.
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:45.120]  Let's go to Jason in Missouri. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:53.120]  Hey, Alex. Good afternoon to you. First and foremost, I want to thank God because without him, we wouldn't be there without him.
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:56.120]  You wouldn't be there either.
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:03.120]  And this is right. This is one of the scariest times in my life. I mean, I don't really fear anything.
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:09.120]  It's just looking at my kids and imagining these war machines going loose.
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:20.120]  Just seeing everything I've seen so far in my lifetime doesn't compare to these few moments, these few months that has passed.
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:30.120]  What we've seen is everything they've done all come together. What scares me the most is that we are winning and I know we're winning.
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  And everybody knows we're winning, but when we're winning like this, it has been their back against the wall.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:43.120]  That's what's frightened me the most because when you have an animal back against the wall, they fight.
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  Like, say, a robber robs a bank. When he gets put into a situation where he has to get out of that situation, he'll do anything, anything.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:55.120]  So that frightens me the most.
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:01.120]  Well, sir, I absolutely agree with you. It's a corner demon and they're all going to go to prison.
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  I mean, if one part of their criminal operation starts imploding, it'll all implode.
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:17.120]  And they know that, so they're very, very dangerous. And I'm going to ask John Rappaporto, we got back on the line, his take on that, that I'm going to give you the latest headlines on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  There's some big breaking news right now. But John, you just heard his point. Where do you see this going? How do you think the Empire will strike back with a false flag?
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  Well, it's quite likely that they will. You know, the whole thing was set up to give the false impression that, okay, Obama's going to the Congress and they're going to authorize this and then there's going to be an attack and so forth.
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:50.120]  And that means all of a sudden Obama's a wartime president. And traditionally, that means ratings, approval ratings go way up. Doesn't matter what it is.
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:41:01.120]  Okay, we attacked ratings go up, but that's not happening this time. It's amazing that it's not happening. And regardless of whether we attack or don't attack, it's not going to happen.
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:06.120]  He's not going to get that same bump that all these so-called wartime presidents get.
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  You just said the key. Everything they're doing is the opposite of the Midas touch. Whatever they touch turns to absolute, you know what?
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:23.120]  Yep, absolutely. And they are absolutely at their wit's end. They don't know what to do because they're using the traditional playbook, right?
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:35.120]  Of media collusion with the government. They've got all their puppets out there saying, yes, we have to do this. Yes, we have to kill Syrians in order to save the presidency.
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:47.120]  We start World War III or we're immoral. Kerry said if we don't do this, any more death is our fault when they started it. They injected the commandos, they started it, and they've got the nerve to say we did it.
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:56.120]  Yeah, and then Chris Matthews comes in and pretty much says, this is all about saving Obama's presidency and we have to go to war and kill people in order to do that.
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:01.120]  Well, you know, people are now waking up when they hear this.
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  This Skype again, something's going on today. It's usually real good with John. Man, he is such a smart guy. He just boils it all down directly.
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:13.120]  John is absolutely right. While we're getting him reconnected here, we'll not need to restart our Skype or have him restart.
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:20.120]  Breaking. Russia says Syria chemical weapons made by rebels last time, so that's evidence they did it this time.
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  And I'm glad that's being pointed out because we've been pointing that out.
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  It's like, does anybody forget they got caught doing this three separate times twice? The UN had to admit that the evidence was that it wasn't Assad, i.e. the rebels.
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  I mean, do we forget that?
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  Oliver Stone slams push towards intervention in Syria.
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:54.120]  Conservative icons put anti-war left to shame. And you've got Matt Drudge, Pat Buchanan, Rand Paul, and so many others. Rush Limbaugh, Amash, Congressman Amash.
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  You've got Ted Cruz coming out saying the government runs Al Qaeda saying it looks like a false flag.
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.120]  I mean, this is just the best news we've ever seen.
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:09.120]  See, now it's safe for the general public to talk about this. Now it's safe for more in Congress to talk about it.
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:13.120]  Now it's safe for the military to come out and speak out against it.
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:22.120]  John, how big is it that all these prominent libertarians are coming out and conservatives and really showing their good guys in the final equation?
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  Because the neocons are all wanting this. Matt Drudge is saying, I have his quotes over here. I retweeted this at real Alex Jones.
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.120]  He says, it's now authoritarianism versus libertarian.
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  Since Democrats versus Republicans has been obliterated, no real difference between the parties.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:41.120]  Absolutely right. It's exactly the way he's putting it.
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  It's people who want to be free, who want to get government out of all this war machine business.
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:54.120]  They see through it in a second. It's a completely phony setup from the beginning.
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:44:02.120]  Kerry, as you said, he looks like a corpse that they dragged in who's pre-programmed to say what he's saying.
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:08.120]  Obama has absolutely nowhere to go here because he...
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  You know, I wonder what's going on with Kerry.
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  I wonder what's going on with Kerry that he does look like a reanimated corpse.
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  His wife, I know she's been sick, looks like she's dying behind him, why he brought her.
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:28.120]  And when the others were speaking, he'd put his hands on the desk and lean his head down.
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:32.120]  And he's like this all the time now. Maybe he's dying or something.
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  I mean, I'm just speculating here, but maybe they've death-threaded him into doing this.
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:44.120]  I don't know what's going on, folks, but I'm telling you, it's scary to watch these hearings.
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:51.120]  And to look at the scum that we have, again, Mike Skype continues to break up.
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  We'll go to him whenever we get him back. Let's talk to Patrick and Louisiana.
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  You're on the air. Go ahead. What's your take?
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  Yeah, I was kind of wanting to follow the idea of...
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:11.120]  It seems like with so many people waking up that the goal is kind of being cornered in this most dangerous time.
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:17.120]  That what if we follow the idea of immunity for anybody who's willing to come forward and...
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:21.120]  Yeah, the problem is we're not in control of the government yet, so we can't give that immunity.
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  Once we ever do start sending these people to prison, it'll all fall like a house of cards.
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:28.120]  This has happened over and over again. All tyrants think they're invincible.
[2:45:28.120 --> 2:45:35.120]  All oligarchies think they're invincible, but this one is long in the tooth, degenerate, backstabbing,
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:42.120]  and now their Agenda 21 program is making everybody poor, and so the public's not going to go along with it now.
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:47.120]  The bread and circuses aren't quenching the mobs thirst anymore.
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:53.120]  But I'll tell you this, it's time for whistleblowers, just as the late, great Michael Hastings said,
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:57.120]  to all go public, and then they can't stop everybody.
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:02.120]  Okay, that's the answer. I appreciate your call. Anything else, Patrick?
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:07.120]  No, it's just... I've been a listener since 2000. It's so great.
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  You keep on getting better and better, and I'm so glad everyone else is listening as well.
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:19.120]  God bless you, sir. It's good to have you call into the broadcast, and God bless you. We appreciate you.
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:26.120]  All right, let's go ahead now, and let's go to John Rabaport. We've got back on phone this time.
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  John, you've got the floor until we go to break. We're going to come back and take calls.
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:34.120]  Sorry, your skype's breaking up. Continue making the points you were eloquently trying to get to.
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:38.120]  Well, some of that is being reflected in what your callers are saying.
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  Whistleblowers coming out of the closet, coming out of the woodwork everywhere all at once.
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  That's the whole idea. It's momentum. It builds up to a certain critical mass,
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  which we've reached right now with this whole Syria episode, and people are talking.
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  People in the military are talking. They're saying, I don't want to go to war to fight on the side of al-Qaeda.
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  This is ridiculous. There is no end game. What's the purpose of this whole thing?
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:11.120]  Where has it been stated that there's any reason for doing this?
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:15.120]  All Obama's been able to say is we have to make a statement, send a message,
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:21.120]  punish the blah, blah, blahs for doing this and that when the evidence shows clearly
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  that there's no reason to assume that this was Assad's chemical weapons to begin with.
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:30.120]  So the whole thing is falling apart like a house of cards.
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  And none of the traditional methods of trying to prop up the government are working
[2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:45.120]  because we've got now such a fantastically powerful alternative media that it can't work.
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:53.120]  It's just not going to work. He's not going to succeed Obama in this by getting any sort of bump in ratings
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:59.120]  or becoming a wartime president to pump up his other programs that he can't get support for.
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  The other scandals are not going to go away by this distraction, Benghazi, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  They're all going to stay on the table. They're at their wit's end.
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  They have no game planned for this whatsoever.
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  And it's exploding in their faces, their entire corrupt system, which is...
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:23.120]  I just wrote an article this morning.
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:27.120]  The structure of the federal government is now a permanent war structure.
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  That's what it is. And it's not just the Pentagon.
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:36.120]  You look at all the agencies, the FDA, the USDA, the CIA, the IRS.
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  You just run them down one at a time. What are they all about?
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:45.120]  They're about searching out people who are breaking some kind of regulation
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:48.120]  that they don't even know they're breaking and punishing them.
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:52.120]  This is war against the people. This is the way the government is structured.
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  So it's very natural that they would say, well, we have to attack Syria because this is what we do.
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:02.120]  This is all that we do. This is what you're paying for.
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  You people who are sinking further and further below the poverty line,
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:11.120]  this is what your taxes have been paying for as a wartime permanent government
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:16.120]  on all fronts, domestically, foreign, in every other fashion possible.
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  And so you're going to have to go along with this.
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  But the response is, what level of insidious, hideous corruption is necessary to have this kind of government?
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  And when you look at these people talking, Kerry, Obama, McCain, who's completely out of his mind,
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:41.120]  and I think that Kerry, I mean, he looks to me like a guy who's either been put in a trance
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  or has been drugged to the gills or threatened in some possible way.
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:50.120]  That's why I'm freaked out because I've watched C-span since I was in high school.
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  That was like my soap operas when I was in high school. I liked watching it.
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:57.120]  I watched the Waco hearings, you name it. They all never looked like this.
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:02.120]  They look like mentally ill, crazy people now, all of them, except for the few good guys.
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:08.120]  They all look handsome and sharp and awake. They look like reanimated corpses. It's true.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:12.120]  It's like they're the legion of Satan or something. I mean, what do you think is going on?
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  You know, I'm not sure, but I mean, you look at Harry Reid, Pelosi, Barney Frank, John Kerry,
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:24.120]  and then, you know, Boehner on the Republican side and other Republicans as well.
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  I mean, these people look like they died a couple of years ago and they were brought back as, you know, zombies.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:35.120]  That's what they really do look like. And that's the way they're talking.
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  It's like something that was pre-recorded out of the grave, you know, that should have hideous organ music going on.
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  Yeah, something's going on. I mean, I actually, last night, went home and was like freaked out,
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  because there's like something else going on here. I mean, it's like a science fiction movie.
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:58.120]  Like, they live or something. Next, you're going to tell me we're going to have Rowdy Rowdy Piper on the show.
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  Oh, we did yesterday. That video's up on infowords.com.
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  You know about RVs. You've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation and man wasn't made to live underground.

[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:08.120]  I want you to know some very important information.
[2:53:08.120 --> 2:53:13.120]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:22.120]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:26.120]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs

[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:57.120]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:21.120]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:28.120]  We're going to do a smidgen of overdrive to get everybody's calls. John Rabaport's giving us his commentary today.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  John, in your gut, where do you see all this going?
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  Because it's not like the Chinese and the Russians are going to save us.
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  They're just as bad, just not as sophisticated as the globalist or maybe not as demonic as skull and bones carry.
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  But it does seem like that everybody's woken up kind of to the paradigm.
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:54.120]  At least people that know how to tie their shoelaces. And you've got all these Democrats, though, showing how weird they are saying,
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:58.120]  we need to go ahead and attack to prop up Obama.
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  You've got the District of Columbia, District of Criminals, Congresswoman saying that.
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  You've got Matthew Slimeball saying it.
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  Why do they like to get on MSNBC and say, yeah, we lie to you and say there's no drones even though there are?
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  I guess it is that old thing of criminals. Love to brag or is it a rubbing it in?
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  Would these people shoot themselves or their children with a firing squad?
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  If Obama told them all because Matthews gets a tingle up his leg, looking at Obama is like artificial viagra for him?
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  I think it's like looking at a crime family. They stick together.
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:46.120]  And they don't care what they say or what they do or how crazy they look.
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  They're basically telling us, hey, you know, we're a crime family and we run the country.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  And this is what we're doing. And it doesn't matter. And we support each other.
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:03.120]  They're sending signals to each other is what they're doing.
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:12.120]  No matter what's going to happen, I'm there and I'll stick with you all the way to the firing squad if necessary.
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  And they just keep telling themselves that only it's happening on television.
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:22.120]  It's happening on live TV that you're seeing these lunatics doing this.
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:30.120]  So what I think is going to happen, I mean, I don't like to get into too many predictions, but my prediction is, yeah, the Congress is going to approve it.
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  They're going to go ahead. They're going to attack Syria. The media wall to wall are going to try to play it like this is a noble action and prop up Obama.
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:50.120]  And it ain't going to work. It's not going to work. It's only going to make things a thousand times worse for them. That's what's going to happen.
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:57:00.120]  And I think Russia will probably stand down, not wanting to cause World War Three, but then that only encourages more aggression.
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  But there's a good chance Assad is going to hit Israel. And if their missile defense doesn't work, Israel's gotten where they are because they have a lot of hutzpah.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:13.120]  They may go ahead and nuke them.
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  Well, they're certainly going to respond one militarily, one way or another. There's no question about that.
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  So, yeah, I mean, this whole thing could blow up into something wave. I mean, that's why, obviously, these nuclear warheads were shifted because, you know, it's all about contingencies.
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  And the Pentagon is well aware that when you just go charging like a bullet to a Chinese shop, okay, let's bomb Syria and send a message that you're lighting up, you know, seven or eight different countries all of a sudden,
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:50.120]  who have proprietary interests in the whole region, and then you could get massive warfare developing out of that.
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:58.120]  You bet. Yeah, I think Russia is going to stand down too for now. But when they stand down, that doesn't mean that they don't do covert things.
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  I mean, they're not going to just say, oh, well, we couldn't win this time. That's not the way they're going to play it.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:17.120]  And again, it's not like it's America running off and doing all this. It's globalists running us that are doing this. And I think Congress is leaning towards doing it, but I also see such a backlash.
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  I think it's up to what we do, John. I think if we all call Congress, if we all call talk radio and literally bully these bullies, beat them over the head that they're the ones that are going to cause World War III in the name of children
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:40.120]  and hit that point about how the government's backing al-Qaeda, how America is an al-Qaeda's air force, I think we can stop it. But Obama may go ahead and hit him anyways.
[2:58:40.120 --> 2:58:42.120]  We'll be right back in Overdrive and FullWords.com.
[2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:43.120]  Thank you for watching.

[2:58:48.120 --> 2:59:01.120]  Nightly news, 7 o'clock tonight.
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:39.120]  State of mind, because there's a war on.

[2:59:51.120 --> 3:00:00.120]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[3:00:00.120 --> 3:00:17.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:22.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:30.120]  So, you look into Pootie Poot's eyes. What do you see? Do you see his soul? George Bush said he saw his soul.
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:36.120]  Oh, I wanted to suck it out of him. Give him to his skull and bones mate, John Kerry or something.
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:41.120]  I don't know. NoMoreFakeNews.com. We carry all his great stuff at infowars.com.
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:45.120]  He's got an article out called Top 9 Reasons to Go to War with Syria.
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:52.120]  I'm going to cover it in the next segment with John Rappaport. And we're going to continue with your calls and overdrive until we're done,
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  at least with the Top 5 or 6 like Charlie, Antonio, and Vince and Eddie.
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  Is there a reason Antonio is on my board twice? Is it the same guy calling on two lines? I've never seen that before.
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:11.120]  Let's go to Charlie in California. You're on the air with John Rappaport. Go ahead.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  Hey, yeah, I just want to thank both of you guys for all the hard work you had to do it.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:19.120]  And mainly what I wanted to say was a message to the American public.
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:26.120]  I believe today is that we're in a bunch of trouble and you speak about it so truthfully every day and I appreciate it.
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:30.120]  But the American people have to get involved today. Like I always give the analogy,
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:34.120]  most people in the TV, in the living room watching TV, and they're entertained.
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:38.120]  And I understand that. We've lived that life for quite a while and look where it's got us out.
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:42.120]  We're going to get out of the spectator mode. Yeah, so then there's people in the kitchen.
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  Those are the people that watch it for. There's the people that are informed and they're just having a conversation with one another.
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  They keep talking about it, but there's no action behind their argument.
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:57.120]  See, the people that are going to make the change, the people that are going to make a difference,
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:01.120]  are the ones that know the information but actually go now and wake up the rest of the story.
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:05.120]  Ooh, that's a great analogy. Why does everybody always hang out in the kitchen? I know I always do that too.
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:09.120]  It's always moved out of a larger house into a lot smaller house because I'm like,
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:13.120]  we don't need a big house. We live in the bedroom in the kitchen.
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:17.120]  And we build a whole house where it's just a kitchen, I guess, and the bed comes down on the wall.
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  But no, but that's true. You've got the spectators that just watch TV all day and just think it's all entertainment.
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:28.120]  And you've got those of us that actually live in the kitchen and we're talking about reality here.
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:31.120]  That's a great analogy, great, great point, Charlie.
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  Comments on that, John Rabaport.
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:39.120]  Yeah, the kitchen is a place where people actually sit down and talk and do a little thinking
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:42.120]  and get away from their crazy television set.
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:48.120]  But even on the television now, you can see some voices speaking out and saying,
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:51.120]  this is insane, this is completely crazy.
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:54.120]  And they're trying to cut them off and they're trying to say,
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:58.120]  oh, satellite connection went out on Ron Paul and CNN.
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:02.120]  So we've got to listen to Chris Matthews talk about how wonderful Obama is.
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  But they're also transparent that it's rebounding against them.
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  It's just preposterous. It's like zombies talking about how war is necessary.
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:15.120]  It's like zombies trying to run the Philharmonic Orchestra.
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:22.120]  What do you call that when the propaganda starts feeding back and not working anymore in history?
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:24.120]  I mean, I think it's a tipping point.
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:29.120]  Yeah, it is definitely a tipping point. I mean, they used to call it blowback
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  in intelligence agency parlance.
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:35.120]  And I just think it's the end of the imperial empire.
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:40.120]  I mean, when you try to go out and you're right, the globalists are controlling the government ultimately.
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  When you try to go out and just decimate populations and throw them into chaos
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:50.120]  and then move in with the banksters and take over and refinance the whole thing.
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  That's bad mojo.
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:58.120]  You just can't keep on doing that without getting people waking up.
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:01.120]  I mean, it's a certain point and we're at that point now.
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:06.120]  People from all sides of the political spectrum are saying, hey, wait a minute, this is insane.
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  This has nothing to do with partisanship.
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:12.120]  It just has to do with, you know, somebody wants to kill people.
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:14.120]  That's what they want to do.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:19.120]  They think war is the highest human activity possible and they want to pursue it.
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:21.120]  That's what it's all about. And we got to stop it.
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  And, you know, it is one of the highest human things.
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:28.120]  If it's fighting for your tribe against an invading group where it's there and that.
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  But with the globalists, it's all about picking on little countries and tearing them apart and blowing up every church.
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:37.120]  Let me ask this when we come back.
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:38.120]  So remember this question.
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:39.120]  I'm going to go with more calls.
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:41.120]  Why do they hate Christians?
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:47.120]  I don't mean the Blitterbug, Haguey types, you know, that buy into pro-government stuff.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:53.120]  Why do the globalists want to destroy old Christian civilization around the world?
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:05:18.120]  Whether it's Orthodox, Protestant, Catholic, it doesn't matter. Why?
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:29.120]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:35.120]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[3:08:01.120 --> 3:08:12.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:22.120]  Just watching Senator Corker in the Senate hearing where they're trying to get this war authorization going to expand the illegal covert war of the last two and a half years
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:27.120]  using al-Qaeda, jihadi, scumbags against the sovereign nation of Syria.
[3:08:27.120 --> 3:08:32.120]  And even Corker was saying, man, this thing is for like all out war in the whole region.
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:35.120]  I mean, I'm going to support a war in Syria. I'm a good patriot.
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  But this thing gives Obama the authorization to attack anywhere, basically in the world.
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.120]  Well, that's what one of the top lawyers that worked for Bush said yesterday.
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:49.120]  We had an article about that on infowars.com that it was written for that.
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:51.120]  And I went and read it. It was clearly written that way.
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:54.120]  So they're doing amendments to strip that out now.
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:09:08.120]  But it just shows how when Kerry was asked yesterday by Senator Mendes, he was asked, you're not going to have boots on the ground, right?
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:12.120]  And he said, well, we might actually need boots on the ground.
[3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:14.120]  So we're going to get to that clip coming up in a few minutes.
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:21.120]  But to answer the question I posed before the break with John Rappaport, a political analyst,
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:30.120]  why do they love, at least from my perspective, to hunt down villages of Christians in Africa, Asia,
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:39.120]  Middle East, Latin America, you name it, the UN, the globalist, they love to kill Christians.
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:45.120]  Why is that from your deep research, or do you disagree with that statement, John Rappaport?
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:52.120]  No, I don't disagree. And I think the reason is simple and clear, and it applies to other religions as well.
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:10:01.120]  If you believe that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness comes from a power higher than the government,
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  then you're an enemy of the government because they are saying, we gave you free.
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:12.120]  That's where it comes from, and therefore we could take it away.
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:17.120]  And these people are saying, just a minute, hold on, that's not the way we think.
[3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:24.120]  That's not what we believe, and we'll go to the wall with our belief that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:30.120]  come from some higher power than the government. And that's it, period. End of story.
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:37.120]  That cannot be, you know, countenance by the globalists because they have to destroy that
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:43.120]  because they want a planet where everybody is brainwashed and hypnotized into believing
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:48.120]  that whatever they get, whatever's given to them, whatever freedom they have or don't have,
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:53.120]  it's all a function of the ruling class, and they can take it away anytime they want to.
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:59.120]  They can dole it out in small dribbles. They can just absolutely remove it, send you to prison
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:06.120]  because government is the highest authority, and anybody who challenges that is right on their target list.
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:12.120]  And by the way, John Rappaport, I didn't talk to you before the show today and talked to you in that last break.
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:17.120]  I asked you that question to see what you would say, and you gave from my perspective
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:24.120]  the absolute perfect answer of hundreds. Here is the current issue of In Fall Wars magazine
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:29.120]  for September 2013, and it's Obama as the Christ, and it says,
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:36.120]  Thou shalt not have any gods above the state. And that's it. These people with Google and the AI,
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:42.120]  they say they're going to become God, Ray Kurzweil and others. They are God in their eyes,
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:48.120]  and they're a jealous God, and we shall have no gods above them.
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:55.120]  And people understand the psychology. They want to kill because that's the ultimate expression of playing God.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:01.120]  They don't want to go take a walk in the beautiful woods or go fishing or hang out with their grandchildren.
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:07.120]  They want to murder people, and they get off on shopping children's heads off.
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:12.120]  It turned out Congress came out six, seven years ago when the torture news came out.
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:19.120]  Many members of Congress for hours would go into classified briefing areas to watch the people being tortured,
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:24.120]  including children, and they would come out very invigorated and very excited.
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:29.120]  And so that's what this is all about. I mean, this is hellraiser stuff, and you ask,
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:35.120]  why do they like to do this? Because it's who they are. And they're not just a God in their views.
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:44.120]  They're a God of death. They're a God of pain. They're a God of destruction. They're a God of starvation.
[3:12:44.120 --> 3:12:51.120]  What's in Spanish? Who's the female grim reaper they worship down in Mexico that's now bigger than Mary?
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:55.120]  They call her the skinny one. How do you say that in Spanish?
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:02.120]  But I don't understand what you're talking about. It's like saying, I have ultimate power.
[3:13:02.120 --> 3:13:06.120]  What is ultimate power? Power over life and death. That's my power.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:16.120]  So you who don't have the power, you're going to fall into line with whatever I give you or take away from you
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:23.120]  and to prove what I can do, I'm going to kill you. There's the proof. There's the proof.
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:30.120]  So they're essentially proving it to themselves. They're saying, okay, I can kill people.
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:38.120]  And therefore that proves to me that I have ultimate power because when I do that, nothing happens to me.
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:44.120]  See, I'm still here. And that's where they take, you know, this is like, where do you find power?
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:49.120]  Where do you find energy? Where do you find faith? Where do you find life?
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:58.120]  And most people find it in many other places, but certainly not in that place, but death is where these guys find it.
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:00.120]  That's where they get it from.
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:05.120]  Well, you know, I don't want to kill anybody, but I'll tell you, my gut tells me it'd be good if these people weren't on the planet.
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:07.120]  It's Santa Merte?
[3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:08.120]  Oh, yeah.
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:14.120]  Merte. Yeah, we'll put up the little grim reaper that's so popular in Mexico now and worship by the cartels.
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:21.120]  Well, one cartel, one big group worships the male grim reaper, but the female grim reaper, she's even more popular.
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:23.120]  And people have given up on Christ down there.
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:27.120]  They've decided that the God of death is going to deliver everything to him.
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:30.120]  And I guess that's where the whole world's going.
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:36.120]  And of course, since they've been worshiping that particular deity, things have just gotten worse.
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:42.120]  And even if you don't believe in God or spiritual stuff, folks, what you focus on and what you believe
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:46.120]  and take for yourself as a template begins to manifest in the world.
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:48.120]  John Rappaport, do you agree with that statement?
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:51.120]  Oh, absolutely, because then you live your life on that basis.
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:53.120]  And so that's what you produce.
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:56.120]  And that's what comes into being.
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:14:57.120]  No question about it.
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:08.120]  And especially over time, and especially when you've got these globalists who have been working on this plan of theirs for, you know, more than a century.
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:15.120]  I mean, they're essentially working to manifest their ultimate power over life and death.
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:17.120]  That's what it's all about.
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:22.120]  They feel they're entitled to it, and they're going to take it, and they do take it.
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:24.120]  And that's, you know, that's what they're playing.
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  That's how they're doing it.
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:32.120]  And what's happening right now is in this Syrian episode, we're seeing it playing out.
[3:15:32.120 --> 3:15:37.120]  I mean, because they're essentially being very naked about the whole thing.
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:38.120]  They have the power.
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:41.120]  We can authorize it, even if you guys don't authorize it.
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:43.120]  I can do it anyway, and I will.
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:45.120]  And that's the end of the story.
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:47.120]  I have power over life and death.
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:48.120]  I'll kill babies.
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:49.120]  It doesn't matter.
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:58.120]  I'm not going to send an email or a telegram or a message to Assad or whoever it is or to Al Qaeda saying, stop it.
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:00.120]  I'm going to kill people.
[3:16:00.120 --> 3:16:04.120]  Well, then everybody backs up and says, wait a minute, that doesn't even make sense.
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:12.120]  You're going to kill people that have nothing to do with this fiction that you've invented in the first place about chemical weapons.
[3:16:12.120 --> 3:16:16.120]  And then you're going to say, that's payback for what you did.
[3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:19.120]  You know, I mean, that's a complete sociopath.
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:21.120]  That's somebody who's a total psychotic.
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:29.120]  And by the way, you've got another article up about 20% of the population are now on psychoactive drugs.
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:40.120]  So there you go with part of the explanation, I'm sure, as to why many of these people that we're looking at in the government who look like zombies are acting the way they're acting.
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:41.120]  Oh, yeah.
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:45.120]  They admit in the New Yorker magazine that 20% of the public is now on psychotropic.
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:54.120]  And they admit that the study shows it's that people don't have enough of the chemicals in their body like serotonin and that they could just give them that.
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:56.120]  And it's better.
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:17:01.120]  I can't believe there's an article in New Yorker magazine that's somewhat critical of psychotropics.
[3:17:01.120 --> 3:17:02.120]  Yeah.
[3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:05.120]  And so how many people in the government does that include?
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:07.120]  What's John Kerry on?
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:15.120]  What's John McCain on so that he can actually sit there in the middle of the debate and play poker on a little device held in his hand?
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:17.120]  I mean, the guy is totally wacko.
[3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:24.120]  If he's going to be bored, you think, okay, maybe he's reading a book or he's looking at news reports on his little device there.
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:25.120]  No.
[3:17:25.120 --> 3:17:28.120]  This guy is playing poker.
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:34.120]  And then a while I was bored and then he's the guy that says, we have to attack.
[3:17:34.120 --> 3:17:42.120]  Otherwise, we would be quote, undermining the credibility of the United States of America and of the president.
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:17:45.120]  I mean, what drugs is he on?
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:52.120]  I've long written and said, we need an accounting of every public official and what medications there are.
[3:17:52.120 --> 3:17:55.120]  That's right. They're pushing for drug testing of the general public.
[3:17:55.120 --> 3:17:59.120]  How about they do monthly drug test and then it be published?
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:00.120]  You bet.
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:12.120]  Oh, you mean this guy's on Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac and he's on sleeping pills and then he's also doing some kind of Adderall for speed.
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:17.120]  And he's voting in Congress and making statements about going to war.
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:19.120]  Hold on a minute.
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:20.120]  You bet.
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:23.120]  Yeah, you could take one look at McCain and his wife and all the rest of it.
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:25.120]  These are certifiable lunatics.
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:26.120]  Total.
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:30.120]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls here with John Rappaport.
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:32.120]  Let's go to Nick in Oklahoma.
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:34.120]  Thanks for holding Nick here on the air.
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:35.120]  Yes.
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:37.120]  I was in the Army for six years.
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:40.120]  I was in a buka, Iraq with 10,000 detainees when I was there.
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:42.120]  So I know how FEMA camps run.
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:46.120]  I was in Afghanistan and Camp Marmal, that place where the steel team came out and killed Osama.
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:49.120]  I was there when that happened, but we never really saw them.
[3:18:49.120 --> 3:18:55.120]  But I just want to say something to all the veterans out there.
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:18:56.120]  Hello?
[3:18:56.120 --> 3:18:57.120]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:18:58.120]  Go ahead.
[3:18:58.120 --> 3:18:59.120]  Yes.
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:03.120]  I want to tell them, the caller earlier mentioned that a lot of them are scared.
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:05.120]  A lot of them are scared to come out and face them.
[3:19:05.120 --> 3:19:09.120]  And I just want to tell them all, you know, you don't have to worry about your reputation.
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:13.120]  You don't have to worry about being labeled as a crazy person because now it's serious.
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:15.120]  This is dangerous stuff.
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:17.120]  We're talking about world war three.
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:19.120]  Nothing will matter after that.
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:21.120]  Your reputation being labeled as a crazy person.
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:22.120]  None of that will matter.
[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:26.120]  Our kids and our future is at stake here.
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:32.120]  Well, yeah, I mean, we've even got Rush Limbaugh going public and all.
[3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:36.120]  And Matt Drudge and all these people saying, you know, clearly we're fighting for al-Qaeda
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:39.120]  and false flag and Pat Buchanan and all this.
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:40.120]  I mean, it's time.
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:44.120]  It's time to call it for what it is.
[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:47.120]  You know, you've got Oliver Stone up there saying the same thing.
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:49.120]  So it isn't just on the political right.
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:51.120]  You've got people on all sides.
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:19:58.120]  I was just reading an article from, I think it was Truth Out about various polls and so forth.
[3:19:58.120 --> 3:20:04.120]  I mean, the American people are, you know, are completely realizing what's going on here.
[3:20:04.120 --> 3:20:15.120]  They're even now saying that the same CIA section, Windcap, that twisted the evidence on WMDs in 2002 that led to the Iraqi war,
[3:20:15.120 --> 3:20:23.120]  they're the same section now responsible for evaluating the so-called evidence that Assad was using chemical weapons.
[3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:25.120]  It's a total farce.
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:26.120]  Absolutely.
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:30.120]  I want to give a nice some more, or Nick, some more info.
[3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:33.120]  Start getting tired for three hours on air and start reading stuff wrong.
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:37.120]  I'm going to go to Nick, back to Nick in a minute, but I wanted to show people this article since you mentioned that.
[3:20:37.120 --> 3:20:41.120]  German intelligence claims evidence Assad responsible for chemical attack.
[3:20:41.120 --> 3:20:47.120]  They're taking the same Israeli intercepts that can be anybody talking on the phone.
[3:20:47.120 --> 3:20:57.120]  Reportedly, with a member of Hezbollah talking to somebody in the government saying Assad accidentally ordered the attack.
[3:20:57.120 --> 3:21:07.120]  And then showing no proof, and it was the Germans last time that helped put out fake intelligence on Iraq and stuff.
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:14.120]  So absolutely disgusting that Germany's acting like they won't be part of the strike, but they're there trying to get it going.
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:18.120]  And then what do you make of the French being such big cheerleaders, the French government?
[3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:22.120]  I mean, I guess Hollande wants a diversion.
[3:21:22.120 --> 3:21:30.120]  Yeah, I guess they do, or they want some favors from America. I mean, they're sort of standing on the fence about the whole thing.
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:32.120]  So maybe there's money passing.
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:37.120]  Why do you think the British parliament for the first time in 200 plus years voted it down?
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:44.120]  Yeah, I think, you know, there's enough people now even in government that are so sick and tired of this whole thing.
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:47.120]  And they know what the blowback is going to be.
[3:21:47.120 --> 3:21:51.120]  They understand now they realize that the public is rising up.
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:21:55.120]  And that the alternative media is exposing the truth.
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:21:59.120]  And they don't want to have to pay the price for that when it comes time to pay.
[3:21:59.120 --> 3:22:02.120]  Yeah, I think it's even more than I mean, I agree with you, but it's more than that.
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:05.120]  A lot of these people in government are not even evil.
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:10.120]  They've been compartmentalized and they've kind of sold out, but now they're finding out what they sold out to.
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:14.120]  They thought they just sold out to the establishment and everything was just going forever.
[3:22:14.120 --> 3:22:17.120]  They don't want to sell out to the grim reaper.
[3:22:17.120 --> 3:22:19.120]  They don't want to sell out to nuclear war.
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:21.120]  They don't want to sell out to bio war.
[3:22:21.120 --> 3:22:26.120]  They don't want to sell out to their grandkids all being six feet under.
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:29.120]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:40.120]  And if there's one thing that the American people have to understand about this little episode here, it's what the dangers are that we talked about earlier.
[3:22:40.120 --> 3:22:45.120]  How all these other countries are going to want to get into the act and anything could happen.
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:51.120]  Missiles fired from Syria to Israel, Israel responds with planes, bombs, missiles.
[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:54.120]  Russia finally decides they have to get into the act.
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:23:00.120]  I mean Saudi Arabia and of course the United States.
[3:23:00.120 --> 3:23:08.120]  This is just a complete World War III waiting to happen at any moment.
[3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:20.120]  And here the zombies in Congress are arguing about whether or not the constitutional authorities should be given to the president to launch a message, etc, etc.
[3:23:20.120 --> 3:23:23.120]  I mean, people have to realize this is way bigger than that.
[3:23:23.120 --> 3:23:26.120]  Oh yeah, I was watching the senators up there, including the chairman, and they're like,
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:31.120]  we need to send Assad a message for his chemical attack, which they have no proof.
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:32.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:23:32.120 --> 3:23:37.120]  And it's a group known to lie about stuff and Assad doesn't have the motive.
[3:23:37.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  I mean, I think that's really why people are waking up is they're like,
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:46.120]  he's told they'll invade and attack if he uses chemical weapons and then it happens.
[3:23:46.120 --> 3:23:48.120]  And then it's al-Qaeda that we're fighting for.
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:49.120]  It's just amazing.
[3:23:49.120 --> 3:23:56.120]  Nick, as a veteran and talking to other folks, you know, what's the sense of the military people you talked to about this?
[3:23:56.120 --> 3:24:06.120]  Well, I got out about a year ago, but when I was in, I was always ridiculed when I'd bring up articles that I'd bring up from inspo wars and people would just kind of shove it off.
[3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:07.120]  You know, whatever.
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:15.120]  But now they're totally proving themselves ignorant and stupid with everything that come out each day.
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:17.120]  They're looking more and more stupid.
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:25.120]  And that's what's, you mentioned earlier that as long as we keep slamming people with stuff and let them know that they're basically lying to us,
[3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:29.120]  we're eventually going to get through to everybody.
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:30.120]  Absolutely.
[3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:31.120]  And I appreciate your call.
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:37.120]  You know, it was Mark Twain that said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[3:24:37.120 --> 3:24:46.120]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:49.120]  And we've hit the barbed wire, folks.
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:57.120]  I mean, I want to pat on the back all our listeners that have taken action and pat myself and the crew on the back just to say, hey, we're going in the right direction.
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:03.120]  And thank God that people have been out there to resist this and understand history.
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:07.120]  Because if we don't know history, we repeat it, John.
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:11.120]  Yeah, I was just going to say, you can throw a little Thomas Payne in there too.
[3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:14.120]  You know, these are the times of tri-mentals.
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:21.120]  This is not some formal little debate happening in Congress right now.
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:29.120]  This is the exposure of an entire massive war machine operation controlled ultimately by the globalists.
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:31.120]  This is where they are going.
[3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:36.120]  They think they can get there and that they will be able to overcome any resistance.
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:37.120]  That's a good question.
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:44.120]  What is Saudi Arabia, Israel, the globalists, the Germans, the big banks?
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:50.120]  I mean, even when warmongering England gets on the bleachers because they can look at the angles on this.
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:52.120]  Historically, now we become the bad guy.
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:53.120]  We become the Hitler.
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:55.120]  We become the Napoleon.
[3:25:55.120 --> 3:25:58.120]  How do they think they're going to get away with this?
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:04.120]  I mean, I guess they're just going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing.
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:06.120]  Why do they think they can just keep winning?
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:08.120]  I don't get it.
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:15.120]  Well, I think because they believe that they put into place oppressive enough governments that can control their own population
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:23.120]  and that people are so hypnotized and so put in a trance that they'll accept anything because they just want to survive.
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:26.120]  That's their calculation as far as I can see.
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:30.120]  They just think, okay, we control enough of the population.
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:36.120]  They're under our thumb and therefore we can do anything and it won't make any difference, but they're wrong.
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:38.120]  They're dead wrong.
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:42.120]  Well said, John Rappaport.
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:43.120]  Absolutely well said.
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:48.120]  There's a lot of news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that's been breaking.
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:49.120]  One of them is Syria.
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:52.120]  Conservative icons put anti-war left to shame.
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:58.120]  Drudge Buchanan, Rand Paul, Justin Amash, highlighted hypocrisy of Obama supporters.
[3:26:58.120 --> 3:27:00.120]  So does Ted Cruz.
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:08.120]  We need to get that out of the article, but it's so important that we get this article out to everybody and people retweet it from real Alex Jones.
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:10.120]  Let's jam in a few final calls here.
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:12.120]  Antonio in New Jersey.
[3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:15.120]  Thanks for holding her on the air with John Rappaport.
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:16.120]  Hello?
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:17.120]  Yes, go ahead.
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:20.120]  Yes, hi Alex.
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:25.120]  Actually, the first time I listened to your show was quite interesting.
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:29.120]  It was on September 1 of 2001.
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:36.120]  And you had an interesting host on your show by the name of William LaRouche.
[3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  Hello?
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:39.120]  Yeah, you're on air, brother.
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:46.120]  Okay, yes, and he was talking about how this was a false flag, an inside job.
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:50.120]  And, you know, at the time it was unclear.
[3:27:50.120 --> 3:27:55.120]  And when you said this to a lot of people, people would think, oh, you know, you're crazy conspiracy.
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:27:57.120]  But now it's all clear.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:04.120]  All along what's been going on is that you have an Anglo-Saudi alliance.
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:10.120]  These were just a small piece of it, not major, took down our security on 9-11,
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:15.120]  and funded the whole operation to get us into this war in Iraq.
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:21.120]  Well, it is that same apparatus that President Obama has been protecting all along.
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:29.120]  In fact, it was Obama that didn't want the 9-11 commission documents that exposed how
[3:28:29.120 --> 3:28:34.120]  Prince Bandar had been shot and who was on the border.
[3:28:34.120 --> 3:28:39.120]  Sure, sure, he's the same guy that, he's the same guy just threatening last week
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:42.120]  the Russians with terror attacks with al-Qaeda if they didn't do what they were told.
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:45.120]  No, I mean, I think that's the answer to all this, and I appreciate your call, sir,
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:48.120]  is that the globalists think they're going to nuclear blackmail the world
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:53.120]  and just basically get everybody to go along with them, shut up the planetary government,
[3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:57.120]  turn off the resources, and then soft kill everybody, and we've got to stand against them.
[3:28:57.120 --> 3:29:01.120]  Because if we're going to kill everybody to really save the Earth in their view,
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:03.120]  that'd be bad enough.
[3:29:03.120 --> 3:29:07.120]  But these are psycho-demons that just say they're going to kill everybody to save the Earth
