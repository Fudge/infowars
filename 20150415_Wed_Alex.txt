[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:28.100]  the info graphic on the front page of info wars dot com says it all it's an
[00:28.100 --> 00:34.800]  image on the mountains of el paso texas on the mexican border and the headline
[00:34.800 --> 00:39.800]  reads isis is operating a camp just a few miles from el paso texas judicial
[00:39.800 --> 00:45.520]  watch joe biggs and josh owens filed a report last night they're on the ground
[00:45.520 --> 00:52.320]  in el paso they've already been into the edge of mexico they are inches away from
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.760]  getting a pilot to take them into the area where the reported jihadi base is
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.960]  located they have the basic coordinates so pray for those guys they're gonna be
[01:02.960 --> 01:06.560]  joining us and with a breakdown of what they done so far at the bottom of the
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.480]  hour they may not be able to do that because the plane may be getting ready
[01:09.480 --> 01:12.720]  to take off right then they're trying to make arrangements right now
[01:12.720 --> 01:16.240]  obviously most pilots are scared to even do it there's nothing illegal about it
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.080]  these are pilots licensed to fly into mexico but we're working on that right
[01:21.080 --> 01:27.320]  now and of course folks will say well keep it secret what you're doing no
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.760]  then they could set them up and spend something we're openly just reporters
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.320]  doing our job judicial watch highly respected has the documents has the
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.000]  sources that well they admit thousands of jihadist types are coming across it's
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.760]  it's being covered up congressmen are on record and we're being set up
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.240]  basically for an isis attack the Pentagon is called the military don't
[01:52.240 --> 01:58.480]  even wear uniforms out in the open don't use military slingo or jargon so we're
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.080]  there to investigate this situation then we have the gentleman joining us who got
[02:03.080 --> 02:07.080]  pulled over in Florida by the armored tank and threatened by the police and
[02:07.080 --> 02:11.080]  we've also I have some other special guests joining us in special reports
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.480]  today it is a jam-packed news transmission huge amounts of intel right
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.040]  after this quick break but first off here is part of Joe Big's first report
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.520]  from the border see the video at infowars.com
[02:35.880 --> 02:41.480]  Joe Big's here with infowars.com right now we are on the border of Juarez in
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.200]  Mexico that is right behind me in this area there that's lit up we've come out
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.440]  here to investigate an article we saw by judicial watch saying that they've got
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.320]  intel that there are basically isis sleeper cells people training over here
[02:55.320 --> 02:58.720]  in an area called Anoprah now we're gonna fly over tomorrow in a single
[02:58.720 --> 03:04.080]  engine Cessna a very small plane try to get low flying altitude footage of that
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.160]  compound and then we're also going to go investigate the east portillo mountains
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.720]  which is just west of us in New Mexico now we've shown you time and time again
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.520]  how these borders are intentionally left wide open that a threat like isis
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.520]  could possibly come across now a lot of people go well isis is funded by America
[03:21.520 --> 03:25.400]  yeah we got that we know that we accidentally drop weapons caches off
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.520]  of that we know that we're funding them but it's the old Frankenstein thing
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.880]  dr. Frankenstein is the Obama administration and these guys are the
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.680]  monsters isis is out of control and they're chopping people's heads off
[03:37.680 --> 03:41.920]  killing Christians in record numbers and this is something we've come out here
[03:41.920 --> 03:45.440]  to investigate we want to bring awareness to the fact that these guys are
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.120]  operating now right at our border now we've already heard reports that these
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.680]  guys are apparently already operating in every state this could be the key spot
[03:53.680 --> 03:56.920]  where they're coming over right now so for the next few days we're going to be
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.000]  out here investigating what's going on looking into this and bringing you guys
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.640]  as much information so we can keep you up to date once again I'm Joe Biggs with
[04:04.640 --> 04:10.360]  info wars.com that's an excellent quick report we should again add that the
[04:10.360 --> 04:14.640]  FBI says isis is in all 50 states that they are coming across the border and
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.360]  brace for imminent attack and isis is publishing videos saying they're going
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.600]  to destroy the United States and Joe Biggs back in September of last year
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.040]  went with Josh Owens that very spot because he'd been stationed at Fort
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.600]  Bliss when he got out of the army there at Biggs Field strangely enough and he
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.760]  had said this is the type of place if I was Isis I would come across because we
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.000]  knew that they were across the border there he said that very spot that's
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.920]  where they now say the Mexican authorities and others say they are
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.520]  coming across and that it's being allowed to happen so we are over the
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.320]  target ladies and gentlemen we're gonna have those reporters on today and
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.520]  they're gonna be up in the air Lord willing so give them some prayers for

[05:25.920 --> 05:31.480]  are we really more free when the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his
[05:31.480 --> 05:35.760]  Spartans surrender their arms the outnumbered King shouted Molan Labe
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.880]  or come and take them even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a
[05:39.880 --> 05:44.320]  much larger adversary he is not remembered for his loss he lives in

[08:07.800 --> 08:18.080]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind for 2000 plus miles
[08:18.080 --> 08:24.760]  from South Texas stretching all the way to the coast of the Pacific Ocean and
[08:24.760 --> 08:31.320]  California there are giant sectors of complete lawlessness 75 miles into
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.240]  Arizona there are signs up telling citizens not to go down major paved
[08:36.240 --> 08:42.000]  roads and saying that up to a third of the state is now under cartel control and
[08:42.000 --> 08:52.440]  in that festering criminal zone that 2200 mile pockmarked zone the FBI
[08:52.440 --> 08:57.120]  Homeland Security members of Congress and now the Mexican government also they
[08:57.120 --> 09:01.000]  don't get the blame when the attacks come our warning that ISIS has training
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  camps right across the New Mexico Mexico border and the South Texas South East
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.200]  Texas Southwest Texas border zone Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are there and they
[09:16.200 --> 09:21.920]  are investigating the reported training camp but we know that thousands of other
[09:21.920 --> 09:25.880]  than Mexicans you can pull these numbers up their mainstream news come across
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.200]  every month just in that border crossing sector that they're at alone and the
[09:31.200 --> 09:35.920]  majority of them are from China and then after that they are from the Middle
[09:35.920 --> 09:42.080]  East and many of them are jihadis and ISIS is said they're infiltrating and
[09:42.080 --> 09:45.960]  again ISIS comes out of Europe and comes out of England and comes out of the US
[09:45.960 --> 09:52.560]  and Canada they recruit young radical Islamist to the secret army that the
[09:52.560 --> 10:00.920]  West was openly funding to launch major attacks for four years against Assad in
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.360]  Syria but also against Egypt our supposed ally who CNN then praised the
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.560]  jihadis when they overthrew that government and overthrow Gaddafi who
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.080]  we double-crossed who for eight years worked with the West and apologized and
[10:12.080 --> 10:15.840]  paid reparations and brought in US companies and European companies and
[10:15.840 --> 10:21.480]  then they set him up and brought in the jihadis and that is not a good
[10:21.480 --> 10:26.120]  Americana policy to try to destabilize countries and bring in tyrants so you've
[10:26.120 --> 10:31.400]  got Al Qaeda armed with 50 caliber Barrett's we're showing video of this of
[10:31.400 --> 10:36.720]  your TV viewer at info wars comm right now when they came in to Syria and then
[10:36.720 --> 10:44.760]  into Iraq so in some cases up to 300 trucks bought in the US these are
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.480]  cartels in Chihuahua I had thought you were rolling ISIS video and it looked
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.360]  almost identical and I knew those were American-made trucks that is making my
[10:53.360 --> 11:00.520]  my head spin how you can put these cartels right next to ISIS and it looks
[11:00.520 --> 11:05.120]  like the same people and that's exactly what the State Department and others
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.080]  have been admitting is that the cartels are now linking up with ISIS and they
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.320]  have similar tactics in fact you can put in the headline Mexican cartels and ISIS
[11:13.320 --> 11:17.280]  have similar tactics are basically merging and then we could show the video
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.640]  of the cartels again but the video I was wanting to show is the ISIS folks
[11:23.640 --> 11:30.520]  coming into Iraq wow that looked exactly like ISIS you're talking about 30 40
[11:30.520 --> 11:36.160]  50 or maybe more vehicles just taking over entire sectors of Mexico to
[11:36.160 --> 11:44.000]  illustrate my point about how lawless it is down there simply incredible I'm
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.960]  going to break this down and detail at the bottom of the hour headline info
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.320]  wars comm ISIS has camps on the US border but Obama says right when
[11:51.320 --> 11:54.800]  extremists are the greatest terror threat ISIS camps now have been
[11:54.800 --> 11:58.280]  discovered directly across the US and Mexico border that's by judicial watch
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.120]  I mean I can't find a time where judicial watch was wrong they just get
[12:02.120 --> 12:07.920]  government documents they double-check government sources they have broken on
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.240]  Republicans and Democrats basically everything I mean they were reporting
[12:11.240 --> 12:18.320]  back in 2001 2002 the Saudi connection to 9-11 that was one of our sources we had
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.080]  folks on from judicial watch then that's now all been confirmed and they're
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.000]  saying multiple camps right across the Texas and New Mexico border only about
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.880]  30 miles apart from each other because El Paso is very close there in
[12:32.880 --> 12:40.360]  southwest Texas to the New Mexico Mexico three corners you're kind of three
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.320]  different two states one country come together right there I guess you could
[12:45.320 --> 12:48.800]  say four corners because it's two countries and two states all come
[12:48.800 --> 12:53.840]  together right there but pretty amazing we're gonna be breaking that down at the
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.080]  bottom of the hour in details we are gonna be they think they've got it set a
[12:58.080 --> 13:05.160]  pile to take them in over the camp I I talk about it because it actually gives
[13:05.160 --> 13:10.760]  our people in my experience more safety from the US government or somebody else
[13:10.760 --> 13:14.680]  trying to shoot them down and blame it on somebody else or stop them trying to
[13:14.680 --> 13:18.800]  document this camp and we're not going to be stopped if we get stopped going in
[13:18.800 --> 13:23.560]  by air we're gonna go in by ground and I'm not gonna announce when that's gonna
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.480]  be obviously if that happens but I'll probably have to go down there myself as
[13:26.480 --> 13:30.520]  well and I'll have to wait till Buckley who's on vacation comes back as he grew
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.920]  up and was born in Guatemala and speaks fluent Spanish and he's actually hung
[13:34.920 --> 13:41.640]  around down there over the border in that area before but I'm not gonna get
[13:41.640 --> 13:47.000]  into that story so I've got to wait till he gets back till we do that but this
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.320]  is a big deal we're going to go out there and this is obviously a very
[13:53.320 --> 13:59.000]  dangerous area I mean on lakes bordering Mexico down in that area if you're out
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.840]  jet skiing or on a fishing boat they'll just drive up and shoot you and the
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.240]  politically correct media will try to cover it up there have been a lot of
[14:05.240 --> 14:13.320]  cases of that so pray for the crew down there Josh Owens and Joe Biggs coming up
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.480]  dashcam video shows Arizona officer intentionally running over suspect I
[14:17.480 --> 14:22.320]  had this in my stack yesterday but I didn't cover it because I hadn't had time
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.480]  to investigate the whole story I'm going to give you my take on this in just a
[14:26.480 --> 14:35.240]  moment I will say that I think the officer should be given a medal so we're
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.560]  gonna break that down here in just a moment then coming up Gunther Gross one
[14:39.560 --> 14:45.200]  of the top German intellectuals warns of a sleepwalking into World War in final
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.680]  interview AFP Germany's Nobel winning author Gunther Grass said he feared
[14:50.680 --> 14:54.600]  humanity was sleepwalking into World War in the last interview he gave before
[14:54.600 --> 15:01.400]  his death on Monday we have on the one side Ukraine whose situation is on
[15:01.400 --> 15:04.960]  improving in Israel Palestine things are getting worse and the disaster the
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.360]  America left in Iraq the atrocities of the atomic state the problem of Syria he
[15:09.360 --> 15:14.000]  told the Spanish newspaper el passes in the interview published Tuesday a day
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.920]  after his death break down some of his final quotes America spent 374 billion
[15:21.920 --> 15:25.480]  on big pharma drugs last year alone you heard me right how about a drug doubt
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.760]  population the main ingredient in the psychotropic drugs is fluoride that's
[15:31.760 --> 15:40.040]  the molecule they build off of and 374 billion dollars Chicago to pay
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.160]  reparations to police torture victims from the torture compound that was
[15:43.160 --> 15:50.200]  discovered two months ago secret torture compound and we're going to get
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.720]  obviously into a ton more Joel Gilbert proven right again he said that the
[15:54.720 --> 16:01.760]  communist mentor top pornographer top communist top Soviet spy on record in
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.120]  his sector Frank Marshall Davis the real father of Morocco St. Obama it's
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.880]  undoubted his film there's my real father we sell our info wars.com I didn't
[16:11.880 --> 16:14.560]  believe when I first saw it and checked it and I couldn't believe it I mean this
[16:14.560 --> 16:18.840]  film will really freak you out and the whole Kenya thing was a bait and
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.480]  switch we're gonna break that down the last 30 minutes the broadcast today but
[16:24.480 --> 16:29.520]  he has now basically been vindicated Obama has come out and said he owes his
[16:29.520 --> 16:36.960]  worldviews to Frank Marshall Davis it's unbelievable the video the audio is up
[16:36.960 --> 16:44.520]  on info wars.com simply amazing and we saw the pornography he shot with a
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.640]  woman that's the exact spitting image of Obama's mother on the same couch in the
[16:50.640 --> 16:56.040]  same house I mean it's the same pictures on the wall where Davis shot these
[16:56.040 --> 17:01.920]  Betty Page style porn and then it's his mother and then he would spend whole
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.240]  summers there for at least 10 years with him and his grandfather who was CIA was
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.800]  Frank Marshall Davis's quote best friend I mean that's in his book dreams of my
[17:11.800 --> 17:18.160]  father Obama's book that he lived with Davis a top communist pornographer and
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.880]  then we've got his mother from the private collection that Gilbert was
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.400]  able to purchase they've not denied it and it's his mother they didn't put a
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.520]  lot of the photos in the film boy let me tell you but back in the day they
[17:33.520 --> 17:37.800]  didn't have video people traded photos and fine she's in pornography I'm not
[17:37.800 --> 17:45.360]  judging her the thing is she she did that to be compromised and this is this
[17:45.360 --> 17:51.000]  was her boyfriend and that's why he said in the Harvard review that he was from
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.080]  Kenya he was the editor of the Harvard review and in three years he was the
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.960]  editor every issue for a month how many what's three times 12 that many times he
[18:00.960 --> 18:06.520]  said I am from Kenya I was born in Kenya his father looks nothing like him then
[18:06.520 --> 18:13.720]  they said he never said that then his wife said in two speeches in 2007 that he
[18:13.720 --> 18:21.120]  was from Kenya born in Kenya so that we would all believe that and then fight
[18:21.120 --> 18:27.120]  over that hiding the fact that his dad is Frank Marshall Davis the communist and
[18:27.120 --> 18:30.280]  he's now come out and says that he owes everything to that I'm gonna play the
[18:30.280 --> 18:35.960]  clip before he joins us but who I mean it's just it's just over the top and
[18:35.960 --> 18:38.840]  that's what the globalists will do they admit that they'll do stuff so over the
[18:38.840 --> 18:49.000]  top and so bold and so brazen that people can't even believe it our president
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.480]  who is the spinning image of Frank Marshall Davis I mean it's him that's
[18:52.480 --> 18:56.760]  his daddy I mean you look at my dad you look at me you look at my dad when he
[18:56.760 --> 19:00.720]  was my age I mean that that's my daddy you look at my mother that's my mama I
[19:00.720 --> 19:04.000]  mean I look like my mama probably more than my daddy
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  I 60% look like my mother 40% like my dad and then you look at Frank Marshall
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.960]  Davis I mean it is Barack Obama's daddy and he is a communist known KGB officer
[19:16.960 --> 19:22.520]  and a top pornographer to fund the communist operation and he was connected
[19:22.520 --> 19:25.440]  in with groups like the weathermen and others you know how they find out
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.480]  themselves bank robberies you name it I mean you just can't make it up I mean
[19:30.480 --> 19:37.200]  we are in the hands of hardcore scum I mean we are in trouble they are trying
[19:37.200 --> 19:44.000]  to bring this country down cloward and heaven style I mean he lives with Davis
[19:44.000 --> 19:50.760]  it's his daddy looks just like him and then he comes out and says it even talks
[19:50.760 --> 19:56.400]  like him talks like his daddy it's his daddy not that guy over there in Kenya
[19:56.400 --> 19:59.400]  looks nothing like him stay with us we're gonna come back with a cop from the

[25:18.040 --> 25:20.040]  You know what
[25:20.040 --> 25:26.720]  This video came out yesterday, and I didn't have time to research it so I didn't play the clip
[25:27.500 --> 25:29.500]  If you're a TV viewer
[25:29.740 --> 25:33.980]  You obviously just saw that of your radio listener. You probably heard about it or have seen it on the news
[25:33.980 --> 25:35.980]  But the video is up on info wars comm
[25:37.700 --> 25:39.700]  Dash cam video shows Arizona officer
[25:40.860 --> 25:46.380]  Intentionally running over suspect and they've got the civil rights groups out all freaking out
[25:46.380 --> 25:52.580]  when this gentleman on record and
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.500]  I've got a whole list of the things he did
[25:57.940 --> 26:01.740]  He robbed a 7-eleven with a club metal club
[26:02.580 --> 26:05.220]  Then an hour later. He set fire to a church
[26:07.300 --> 26:10.180]  And reportedly they get a bunch of other stuff to stole a car
[26:10.860 --> 26:15.220]  Went in manhandled a 30 30 and ammo at Walmart threatened a bunch of people
[26:15.220 --> 26:17.980]  basically shot at the cops I
[26:19.180 --> 26:25.100]  Mean if somebody's got a gun waving around shooting I'm gonna get out from behind the door, and I'm gonna shoot the guy with a rifle
[26:25.100 --> 26:26.020]  I
[26:26.020 --> 26:29.660]  Mean there's not and then see there's other cops pulling up
[26:29.660 --> 26:34.300]  And I guess they were just gonna let themselves get shot so the other cop just decides they're ramming
[26:35.820 --> 26:41.540]  Which is unorthodox, but that's the type of thing you want in my view if people are inside of school
[26:42.780 --> 26:44.420]  shooting people I
[26:44.420 --> 26:50.460]  Mean that stuff didn't go on a long time ago because everybody had guns inside the school the principal did or guns of them in their
[26:50.460 --> 26:52.340]  Trucks outside, and you wouldn't get away with it
[26:52.340 --> 26:57.540]  And in the old days the cops would just run right in and shoot you but nowadays they wait till a SWAT team gets there
[26:57.540 --> 26:59.540]  And they sit around for two or three hours
[26:59.580 --> 27:03.540]  It's just ridiculous. And so, you know, you could say the guy's a hothead
[27:04.180 --> 27:08.580]  And you could say he made a mistake. You could say he crashed the police car boys
[27:08.580 --> 27:12.020]  You got a guy waving a rifle around this just burning down buildings
[27:12.020 --> 27:16.860]  Robbing people aiming guns shooting guns. I mean, it's just in the story
[27:16.860 --> 27:20.220]  You can march all day with your gun as long as you're not pointing at people
[27:22.140 --> 27:28.660]  And I'm pro-second amendment, but I'm not for lunatics going around killing people and now they've got the different civil rights
[27:29.020 --> 27:34.780]  Organizations freaking out saying everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force
[27:35.820 --> 27:37.820]  Really the guy's still alive
[27:37.820 --> 27:42.300]  If I'd have been the cop that was already there and the guy's shooting I'd have just caught out and shot the guy
[27:42.300 --> 27:46.740]  I mean just no-brainer. You're running around shooting at people. I'm going to kill you
[27:46.740 --> 27:49.060]  I don't need any police training to know that
[27:49.620 --> 27:52.900]  There's somebody walking around shooting a gun out here. I'm gonna I'm gonna get my rifle
[27:52.900 --> 27:57.020]  Well, I'm gonna just take my time. I'm gonna look at what's behind the target. I'm gonna pull the trigger
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.700]  I mean, it's real simple
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.700]  And that's why we've got shotguns, too
[28:01.700 --> 28:09.780]  So we don't shoot people in another building But regardless, let's say in the heat of the moment
[28:09.780 --> 28:10.980]  I didn't think
[28:10.980 --> 28:16.220]  Everything is intent and I got a rifle and then it ricocheted off some you know building down the street
[28:16.220 --> 28:20.900]  I wouldn't get in trouble because my intent was to stop someone doing harm. It's the same thing with a cop
[28:21.060 --> 28:23.060]  You have to be in the heat of the moment
[28:24.900 --> 28:31.140]  Yourself to then be able to judge in my view and they're looking at suspending or firing the cop right now
[28:31.140 --> 28:36.060]  But then now they're going back the other way saying no no, maybe he acted, you know the right to put the guy down
[28:36.780 --> 28:38.780]  but that just shows the
[28:38.820 --> 28:46.300]  Extreme nature of the anti-police movement that that's fun about George Soros and the left that no matter what they do their attack
[28:47.260 --> 28:52.940]  And then you have the police responding in extreme way defending bad cops then no go after bad cops that are obviously bad
[28:54.300 --> 28:57.380]  You grab somebody for no reason put them a handcuffs pull your gun out shoot them in the back
[28:57.380 --> 28:59.380]  You need to get life in prison or executed
[28:59.380 --> 29:02.220]  You make you know you shoot some guy running away
[29:03.220 --> 29:06.820]  And then make jokes about it and then plant a taser. That's preventative murder
[29:07.740 --> 29:12.420]  So don't defend people like that. They're bad guys out there, but then to go to the next extreme
[29:14.180 --> 29:21.340]  When there's somebody going around with a gun shooting it and he's just a robbed and been stealing and burning buildings down I
[29:21.340 --> 29:27.360]  Mean that's that's just a no-brainer response
[29:32.220 --> 29:39.260]  So we're gonna come back and shift gears out of that story and get into bad police conduct Chicago to pay reparations to police torture victims
[29:39.260 --> 29:45.460]  We may be able to get our reporters up with the news on the Alcana base right over the Texas border and more stay with us
[29:45.460 --> 29:54.740]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.580 --> 30:01.300]  The BLM is at it again this time
[30:01.300 --> 30:05.780]  They're not trying to take a ranchers grazing rights pretending that they're protecting an endangered species
[30:05.860 --> 30:11.060]  Now they're going after the mining rights of one of the oldest continuing claims in the US
[30:11.060 --> 30:16.660]  So old that it's protected under the General Mining Act of 1872
[30:16.660 --> 30:21.660]  And they're not even giving the lawyers for the miners a reason but alone a day in court
[30:21.660 --> 30:28.900]  The Glease Mining District in Oregon reports that one of the mine owners has been given a cease and desist order with a deadline of Saturday
[30:28.980 --> 30:35.060]  April the 25th. They must remove all equipment and buildings and fill in the tunnels by then which is
[30:35.060 --> 30:41.820]  Impossible the owners the sugarpine mine have stated that they will fully disobey the order they say is illegal and invalid
[30:41.820 --> 30:48.260]  And they have called for assistance local chapters of oath keepers and three percenters have responded and others are on the way

[34:04.620 --> 34:07.260]  Here's the headline info wars calm
[34:07.820 --> 34:16.300]  Economic collapse blog story ices has camps on the u.s. Border, but obama says right-wing extremists are the greatest terrorists
[34:16.300 --> 34:23.340]  Right-wing extremists are the greatest terror threat ices camps have now been discovered directly across the u.s. Border with mexico
[34:23.740 --> 34:25.740]  And we've now confirmed that these
[34:25.740 --> 34:33.020]  training drills like the one in california last weekend are to take on sovereign citizens veterans and gun owners as we predicted
[34:33.660 --> 34:38.860]  Now from florida to california the videos are coming in and they are targeting to round up patriots
[34:40.060 --> 34:42.620]  Gee wonder why info wars was banned from the exercise
[34:42.620 --> 34:49.580]  Judicial watch highly respected has got the intel the documents congressmen have gone public as well
[34:49.900 --> 34:53.020]  We know thousands a month other than mexicans many of middle eastern
[34:54.220 --> 35:00.140]  Come across the border joe begs who was stationed at fort blitz before i got out of the army as a staff sergeant
[35:01.580 --> 35:04.860]  Wanted to go down there last year saying they say ices is over the border
[35:05.420 --> 35:07.420]  in from south texas
[35:07.420 --> 35:12.220]  With the early reports that have now been confirmed i want to go down there and show where i think they come across
[35:13.420 --> 35:17.660]  Right by this city park on the edge of el paso where it's a half foot deep water
[35:18.460 --> 35:23.420]  Turns out judicial watch with the mexican authorities and others have come out and said that exact
[35:23.900 --> 35:28.380]  One mile stretch is indeed where they're coming through and at quarter mile from there
[35:28.700 --> 35:32.620]  They leave these huge gates open at night and we have that footage as well
[35:32.620 --> 35:37.420]  So we're going to condense all this together into one special report tonight on the news
[35:37.980 --> 35:42.460]  But joe begs is there they're working on getting an aircraft at this point i've said they're going in
[35:42.460 --> 35:47.740]  I want to give too much about did they get one or when this is going to happen, but it's it's it's it's it's very soon
[35:48.380 --> 35:52.060]  But joe's going to give us a breakdown of what's happened so far via the magic of skype
[35:52.780 --> 35:59.420]  There on the border, uh, joe begs and josh owens you left yesterday at about six followed report late last night
[35:59.420 --> 36:01.420]  What have you learned since break it all down?
[36:02.540 --> 36:05.180]  Well right now alex we are standing outside
[36:05.820 --> 36:10.380]  Of an opera an opera is the area that is listed in the judicial watch report
[36:10.940 --> 36:19.100]  Saying that there is a possible isis taris cell operating over there that place is pretty much run by a lot of the drug cartels
[36:19.660 --> 36:21.180]  From war
[36:21.180 --> 36:24.700]  So we're standing on this mountain range just on the other side if we walk across so here
[36:24.700 --> 36:30.780]  We could be in an opera, but yes like you said earlier. We're trying to work on a aircraft right now a small plane
[36:31.020 --> 36:36.460]  To be able to hover over this area and fly around and try to get some footage and possibly spot this
[36:36.940 --> 36:40.540]  Area and get that footage out to you guys. I see the el norte train
[36:40.540 --> 36:45.660]  That's one of the actual trains the illegals jump on by the tens of thousands a day to come into the u.s
[36:45.660 --> 36:47.660]  Don't see any on that one
[36:47.660 --> 36:50.460]  But uh, but that is just a an amazing
[36:50.460 --> 36:54.460]  Uh image of you out there in the desert and the mountains with the train going through
[36:55.820 --> 36:59.260]  Yeah, there's a lot of activity out here. I mean, this is the one area though
[36:59.980 --> 37:03.180]  Where the border patrol actually have to have their armored vehicles
[37:03.180 --> 37:07.500]  They have to have the cages up over the windows because an opera is a pretty bad area
[37:07.980 --> 37:12.140]  I mean Juarez is bad given but this place right here the actual border fence
[37:12.460 --> 37:18.300]  Which is not even that great is right along the side of the city. So just splitting between
[37:18.300 --> 37:24.300]  You know the us and an opera is this little fence so I could see the fence looks like here
[37:24.300 --> 37:26.300]  What about 600 yards from that?
[37:26.460 --> 37:31.900]  Uh, yeah, it ends though right over my left shoulder and then there's nothing going up really that much
[37:33.420 --> 37:38.540]  Up to the top of the hill how many yards away would you say from the end of that black fence we see right there?
[37:39.340 --> 37:41.340]  Yeah, you're about 800
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.740]  800 yards. Yeah
[37:43.740 --> 37:47.740]  This is about the best view that we could get up high enough so you could actually see the city
[37:49.100 --> 37:51.500]  Well, I want to talk to you off air
[37:52.140 --> 37:56.780]  Uh during the next break to decide what we're going to do, but uh, everything's looking good right now
[37:57.740 --> 38:00.940]  Everything is good thus far. I'm trying to work on a couple different plans
[38:01.180 --> 38:04.300]  Like I said, we're going to try to take a trip out to the east portillo mountains
[38:04.780 --> 38:07.900]  Um tomorrow, which is about an hour and 20 minute drive
[38:08.140 --> 38:11.340]  I'll possibly try to fly over that today as well because they said that's where the
[38:11.340 --> 38:18.540]  Isis spotters are posted up in that mountain ridge trying to look over the mexican border and then when they give them the all clear
[38:18.780 --> 38:20.780]  They signal them through
[38:20.780 --> 38:27.260]  Amazing and again judicial watch says the camps there congress people say they're coming across. They've been caught coming across
[38:27.740 --> 38:30.780]  Why do you think they'd want to whitewash this and cover this up?
[38:31.260 --> 38:36.780]  And then have the one of the biggest domestic exercises ever to take on patriots at the same time?
[38:37.260 --> 38:39.260]  What do you think's going on job?
[38:39.260 --> 38:44.300]  Well, I mean even the local news around here is just saying oh, you know, we contacted border patrol officials
[38:44.460 --> 38:50.940]  They say that this article from the watch is basically bogus and there's no evidence to support these claims
[38:51.260 --> 38:53.660]  You know, and this is what we've been hearing for the past year alex
[38:53.660 --> 38:58.860]  I mean we keep hearing that you know, this isn't happening. The border is secure. It's not wide open and then eventually
[38:59.500 --> 39:04.700]  Everybody releases an article shows pictures where they've captured four, you know, iraqi guys with you know
[39:04.700 --> 39:08.860]  That are iso sympathizers and they're fine prayer rugs and they're fine, you know
[39:09.900 --> 39:15.420]  Translation books from arabic and they're do or aduro to english and all this stuff out here than prayer beads
[39:15.740 --> 39:18.780]  So there's something definitely going on. Well, it's the it's the
[39:19.500 --> 39:21.980]  Border patrol people that are actually leaking the information
[39:22.460 --> 39:26.940]  Then it's and it's in their reports thousands other than mexican. That's what they call it in the reports
[39:26.940 --> 39:30.620]  You can see iraq syria, Saudi Arabia, libya
[39:30.620 --> 39:37.260]  But then it's not just that there's also other jihadis from western countries coming in and this is where they're coming into the country
[39:37.980 --> 39:43.260]  Uh, and it's just amazing that they're trying to cover this up because they don't want folks to know the border is wide open
[39:44.380 --> 39:47.180]  Yeah, because you know, then that means that it shows that they're uh
[39:47.580 --> 39:50.540]  Almighty obama is not doing his job just like he promises
[39:50.540 --> 39:55.260]  He is because most of the sheep think he's doing a great job right now if they actually came out here to the border
[39:55.260 --> 39:59.740]  That's why I tell people all the time people always want to get mad and yell. I mean like oh, you don't know what you're talking about
[39:59.740 --> 40:05.820]  You're just crazy. Um, well, I've actually been out here numerous times. This is like my fifth trip to El Paso in the last year
[40:06.380 --> 40:11.820]  Um, nothing's changed. Nothing is improved. The border is completely and totally wide open in many places
[40:12.060 --> 40:14.140]  Maybe not the entire border everywhere
[40:14.300 --> 40:19.180]  But all you need is a gap and that word of mouth travels down south and everyone knows what that gap is
[40:19.420 --> 40:24.140]  And they exploit it and they go through it and there's nothing being done to stop it or patch it up
[40:24.140 --> 40:30.700]  Well, sure and and of course still the obamanoid support obama, but the majority of americans and all the polls aren't buying it
[40:30.700 --> 40:32.700]  So that's why the media is trying to keep
[40:32.700 --> 40:38.860]  Clamps on it, but jacari jackson and our other reporters last year went down to mcallin also in south texas
[40:39.500 --> 40:44.140]  Because of our border patrol sources and they were there saying they're ordered to let the illegals through
[40:44.620 --> 40:48.620]  And they give them vouchers and ship them in and that's now mainstream media
[40:48.620 --> 40:53.260]  So they don't want this getting out, but it is getting out that it's happening
[40:53.260 --> 40:57.580]  But the funny thing is though is when I go out and I show the borders where they're open
[40:57.980 --> 41:03.020]  You know the border patrol will try and sometimes hassle you sometimes they'll be like oh, what are you doing out this way?
[41:03.260 --> 41:06.620]  You can't get close to the border. I'll be like why not you're letting illegals through
[41:06.700 --> 41:09.820]  Why can't I as a citizen walk on my own soil?
[41:10.300 --> 41:12.860]  Which is all the way up to the fence. I can go wherever I want to
[41:13.180 --> 41:15.180]  So they want to try to hassle people sometimes
[41:15.340 --> 41:19.740]  Which I think is just trying to help cover up the fact that the border's open. Well, sure that's their order
[41:19.740 --> 41:24.060]  They get reprimanded or fired if they report on the illegals coming in that's in the news
[41:24.460 --> 41:27.260]  And they're even told let them go when they commit crimes
[41:28.060 --> 41:31.180]  Because that's what the criminal illegitimate government wants
[41:31.820 --> 41:37.020]  Just because the border patrol most of them follow their orders doesn't mean that we're gonna follow the globalist operations
[41:37.340 --> 41:41.900]  And again, I don't want to just make the border patrol the enemy here. They're really upset about what's happening
[41:41.980 --> 41:46.380]  But at the same time they're just replacing them with these with these political officers
[41:46.380 --> 41:50.620]  That will engage in the treason and I have been down at the border myself
[41:51.420 --> 41:53.420]  We have footage of it
[41:53.740 --> 41:56.780]  Down by big bend and they have the border patrol
[41:57.580 --> 42:01.660]  spotting with the binoculars and radios college kids, but also adults
[42:03.180 --> 42:04.940]  Drinking beer
[42:04.940 --> 42:07.100]  On the Rio Grande and throwing footballs
[42:07.740 --> 42:10.220]  And then they come up and give you tickets while the illegals
[42:10.940 --> 42:13.420]  Come across right in front of them. So they're not
[42:13.420 --> 42:18.460]  Okay, I was doubted. I mean, I've seen that tons of times. I mean quite frankly almost every trip I've been on
[42:18.460 --> 42:23.420]  I see border patrol agents posted up in their vehicles playing angry birds or something like that
[42:23.740 --> 42:26.700]  Or almost one time we were flying. I think it was what glenn spencer
[42:26.860 --> 42:31.660]  We're flying a guy was laying up on the hood of the vehicle just like posted up just like trying to get some sun
[42:32.140 --> 42:36.060]  Not watching what was going on not watching the fact that in that area every Arizona
[42:36.060 --> 42:39.900]  There's really no border and there's just barbed wire fence. They're not allowed to their job
[42:39.900 --> 42:44.620]  They've been ordered. I mean it was in the news two weeks ago like associated press. I remember the headline
[42:45.020 --> 42:47.820]  Border patrol ordered to ignore large groups of illegals
[42:49.020 --> 42:53.740]  Yeah, I mean if they pull over a van full of 15 people and the drivers drunk
[42:54.140 --> 42:56.140]  They're openly ordered to release them
[42:56.300 --> 42:59.580]  But then go out and find citizens who are the enemy. I'm telling you it's sick
[43:00.220 --> 43:02.700]  And then you don't even know who's it that large group who has
[43:03.340 --> 43:09.180]  These isis connections or intentions who are trying to meet up with other sleeper cells in the country to do harm, you know
[43:09.180 --> 43:14.700]  Right here in El Paso. You've got Fort Bliss, which is the largest tank division in the world
[43:14.700 --> 43:19.660]  I mean, there's 60 70 thousand troops here. That's a huge base. That's cash for six, right?
[43:20.540 --> 43:22.540]  Yes, you also have a huge
[43:23.260 --> 43:27.500]  Power grid location that we did some reports from last time when josh Owens and I were here
[43:27.660 --> 43:32.620]  These are big targets. You have white sands missile range where there's a lot of military stuff that goes on there
[43:32.780 --> 43:36.620]  There's a lot of stuff out here where a potential attack could happen
[43:36.620 --> 43:41.260]  I mean just over this other on the other side of the mountain over here. You have the university of texas El Paso
[43:41.420 --> 43:46.380]  This is a prime spot for something like that. That's why they need to spend that's exactly what don't hit
[43:46.540 --> 43:49.900]  They need the security. They need to beef up the security out here
[43:49.900 --> 43:52.380]  And they're not doing it because all of this stuff right now
[43:52.940 --> 43:55.740]  Is just it's just sad that they're not doing anything about it
[43:55.740 --> 43:59.580]  Well, how are they going to get away with it when they're al-qaeda boys isis boys?
[43:59.980 --> 44:03.900]  Attack a mall or attack that university or attack the military base
[44:03.900 --> 44:08.220]  I mean imagine 500 or 50 10 whatever the number is going to be
[44:08.700 --> 44:11.260]  Uh major Hassan's attacking the base
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.980]  And they won't even call it a terror attack when it happens
[44:14.620 --> 44:19.980]  Uh, I mean, it's just incredible because they got to keep that border open to collapse us into the north american union job
[44:21.740 --> 44:23.740]  Yeah, I mean exactly. I totally agree
[44:24.300 --> 44:27.100]  So hopefully we can get some information out here while we're out here today
[44:27.660 --> 44:32.860]  We're still waiting on this confirmation from a pilot to get out here and get footage over uh, uh, a rap
[44:32.860 --> 44:38.380]  And then get down to the east portillo mountains as well. All right. We know you guys can go in there as well
[44:38.460 --> 44:40.460]  We're in the judicial watch documents
[44:40.620 --> 44:48.060]  Um, they're saying one other thing too though the east portillo mountains for what I've been looking into is mostly uh overlooked by blm
[44:48.620 --> 44:53.980]  So if there's blm there, and then there's also these, you know reports of isis spotters, you know, that's another thing to think about
[44:53.980 --> 44:56.140]  What's going on there?
[44:56.140 --> 44:59.660]  Well, our government at the highest levels has been criminally aiding and abetting
[44:59.660 --> 45:02.780]  The leadership of isis, which is just al-qaeda in iraq
[45:03.100 --> 45:09.500]  Then they admit that and so just to confuse the public because it'd be too much if the government got caught funding al-qaeda
[45:09.500 --> 45:12.060]  So they just changed the name of confused people. Uh, it's just
[45:12.700 --> 45:15.980]  Really incredible if this is happening and joe if you see the border patrol
[45:16.860 --> 45:20.460]  You know, usually they follow you and act like you've done something wrong or the state police
[45:20.940 --> 45:25.980]  Go over to them. I mean, we're not the enemy even though they've been trained. We are and say hey, you know
[45:25.980 --> 45:30.220]  Are you aware of these judicial watch reports? And I mean, obviously
[45:30.940 --> 45:36.380]  They're gonna say go talk to public affairs and you talk to public affairs. They'll give you a card and call you in a thousand years
[45:36.940 --> 45:42.060]  Uh, but just continue you can do a man on the street asking folks if they're aware of what's going on
[45:42.780 --> 45:46.700]  Joe bigs and josh owens a great job. You guys be safe down there. Thank you
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.060]  All right, there they go from right there at the border
[45:50.060 --> 45:54.620]  And it's already moe caliente down there
[45:56.780 --> 46:02.780]  All right, let me now shift back into the news. There is obviously so much of it
[46:05.580 --> 46:07.580]  This is
[46:07.580 --> 46:11.340]  Really bizarre leaking of government officials addresses
[46:12.060 --> 46:14.860]  accompanied by note warning of fema crackdown
[46:15.500 --> 46:17.500]  by new world war satanist
[46:17.500 --> 46:23.580]  Publication of sensitive material blamed on right-wing hackers. We're gonna print that article off and
[46:24.140 --> 46:30.780]  Cover that coming up in the next segment. You have the video that he shot last night ices camp is covered at us border
[46:31.580 --> 46:34.220]  questions swirl over bizarre walmart closures
[46:34.780 --> 46:38.380]  Uh, we're learning that they've not called out permits on the supposed plumbing
[46:39.340 --> 46:42.860]  You know, that's made up when it's now it was six now. It's eight walmarts
[46:43.740 --> 46:45.740]  in the south
[46:45.740 --> 46:52.220]  You know, they turning into low-income housing. That's what one tip said is it shutting them down because people trying to unionize
[46:53.260 --> 46:54.860]  Uh
[46:54.860 --> 47:00.300]  Did did chinese communist by walmart? I mean, these are the stories all coming out. It's kind of a who done it
[47:00.780 --> 47:02.780]  What do you think's going on?
[47:03.340 --> 47:05.340]  There's another video with my son
[47:05.340 --> 47:08.220]  and morgan do robbed his son
[47:09.420 --> 47:12.300]  On children beg state to let them go outside
[47:12.300 --> 47:17.500]  Cps grabbing children from normal homes for them children being allowed to play outside
[47:18.540 --> 47:24.140]  Meanwhile the detailed report tsa workers caught manipulating body scanners groped genitals for sexual gratification
[47:24.860 --> 47:28.300]  That broke in cbs news yesterday. We show you some of the history of it
[47:29.180 --> 47:35.900]  Hillary visits college puts every day iowans on lockdown when she comes then calls herself just a normal person
[47:37.500 --> 47:41.820]  And goes on to say that she's going to wage war against especially the one percent number one
[47:41.820 --> 47:43.820]  That's all the fraud if you make
[47:45.020 --> 47:49.020]  I think it's like 250 thousand dollars a year. It depends on inflation. Maybe almost 300 now
[47:49.020 --> 47:53.340]  But if you make 300 thousand dollars a year, let's just give a high-end number to make sure we're accurate
[47:54.140 --> 47:56.140]  You are in the one percent
[47:57.420 --> 48:01.420]  I wish that you know 10 percent made 300 thousand or 20 percent
[48:01.580 --> 48:06.060]  You'd really have a booming economy then every economist knows a big middle class
[48:06.060 --> 48:11.100]  Is key to an upwardly mobile working class blue collar folks
[48:12.380 --> 48:16.780]  That's the it's the entrepreneur middle class in every culture that is the engine
[48:17.500 --> 48:23.500]  And big elites the ultra rich always wage war against it to consolidate power because their next big competition is coming out of a
[48:23.660 --> 48:28.380]  Middle class and political opposition is coming out because they can't be bought they have their own thing
[48:28.540 --> 48:31.660]  They don't want to be under your control. They don't want centralized board
[48:31.660 --> 48:39.580]  And so when we sit there and attack Hillary and go, oh, yeah, you're you're funded by the one percent you claim they're fighting them
[48:39.740 --> 48:41.740]  We almost give in to this class warfare
[48:42.540 --> 48:44.780]  Myself included that one percent is bad
[48:45.740 --> 48:51.900]  We did the math last year. I forget the exact math. I think it was point zeros. It was seven zeros and then a two three
[48:52.940 --> 48:57.740]  Because if you go off the Rothkopf Henry Kissinger group say there's six thousand people that own and run the world
[48:57.740 --> 49:02.780]  I agree with that number. It's a little big, but let's say six thousand you you average
[49:05.340 --> 49:09.020]  Six thousand into the different global wealth numbers that are out there and they vary
[49:09.820 --> 49:14.540]  But you always come up with a point zero zero zero zero zero zero and then some numbers
[49:15.660 --> 49:17.660]  That has half the wealth and growing
[49:18.220 --> 49:20.220]  In a few years they're set to have 60 percent of the wealth
[49:20.220 --> 49:27.260]  To a man and a woman these these these rich globalist billionaires except for a few families
[49:29.260 --> 49:33.580]  Fund taking your guns getting rid of borders taking your family breaking up the family
[49:37.660 --> 49:41.180]  The richest percentile of americans make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[49:41.180 --> 49:46.940]  So how could 135 thousand dollar salary make you a one percenter now see that's an article out of what the daily beast
[49:46.940 --> 49:53.260]  Well, that's out of the Atlantic. So they're saying 135 thousand the numbers. I've seen is really about
[49:54.140 --> 49:56.700]  300,000 because the rich are good at hiding their money
[49:56.700 --> 50:03.740]  But but the point is who buys cars who goes to restaurants who gets their hair done who could put the swimming pool in who hires nannies
[50:03.900 --> 50:06.380]  Who sends people to college who you know?
[50:07.580 --> 50:10.540]  Donates land to the for a park. It's the middle class
[50:10.540 --> 50:15.580]  And so hillary says the problem is people make on 135 thousand dollars a year
[50:16.780 --> 50:18.780]  Well, no
[50:18.940 --> 50:24.940]  No, no, no, it's it's it's billionaires like George Soros that get their money from government bailouts and Warren Buffett
[50:25.900 --> 50:27.500]  So when we come back
[50:27.500 --> 50:30.780]  We have a couple clips here hillary at the university
[50:31.100 --> 50:34.140]  I come like a regular lady when they shut the whole place down for the piece of garbage
[50:34.780 --> 50:38.220]  I'm running for president because I think the Americans and their families need a champion
[50:38.220 --> 50:43.980]  And she goes into how she's going to battle the 1 percent. Well, actually, it's true hillary's telling the truth
[50:45.180 --> 50:48.380]  That's the headline hillary's telling the truth about battling the 1 percent
[50:48.540 --> 50:55.740]  She wants to get rid of the lower 99.99999 percent of the 1 percent. That's her enemy for the super elite
[50:57.980 --> 51:04.220]  We the people grow cotton we fabric engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank
[51:04.220 --> 51:08.220]  Having it led back at interest forcing taxes to service debt this capitalism
[51:08.220 --> 51:14.220]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army
[51:14.220 --> 51:22.220]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237

[52:37.220 --> 52:42.220]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[52:42.220 --> 52:48.220]  But then burn you out in my experience where it's stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source

[53:53.220 --> 53:55.220]  Be vigilant but not fearful
[53:55.220 --> 53:57.220]  faketv.com
[54:04.220 --> 54:08.220]  We're back and here is Hillary who's gonna battle the insiders
[54:08.220 --> 54:10.220]  What a joke
[54:10.220 --> 54:14.220]  I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today
[54:14.220 --> 54:21.220]  I think we all know that Americans have come back from some pretty tough economic times
[54:21.220 --> 54:31.220]  And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work
[54:31.220 --> 54:40.220]  But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top
[54:40.220 --> 54:43.220]  And there's something wrong with that
[54:43.220 --> 54:45.220]  There's something wrong with that
[54:45.220 --> 54:47.220]  Oh really? You helped change the laws for derivatives
[54:47.220 --> 54:49.220]  There are times more than the typical worker
[54:49.220 --> 54:54.220]  There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive as they have
[54:54.220 --> 54:56.220]  And as I just saw a few minutes ago
[54:56.220 --> 55:01.220]  You see, they do this and then don't go after the actual elite but then just raise taxes
[55:01.220 --> 55:04.220]  But the productivity is not matched in their paychecks
[55:04.220 --> 55:12.220]  And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers
[55:12.220 --> 55:17.220]  Obama almost got two to one money from hedge fund people than the guy who ran against Ronnie
[55:17.220 --> 55:25.220]  And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills they need
[55:25.220 --> 55:27.220]  Which has been your plan along
[55:27.220 --> 55:29.220]  Make the best of their own lives
[55:29.220 --> 55:33.220]  And I looked at the figures, the average
[55:33.220 --> 55:36.220]  I mean we're shutting our power plants down to colleges
[55:36.220 --> 55:38.220]  They're carrying down dams
[55:38.220 --> 55:42.220]  Comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt
[55:42.220 --> 55:48.220]  And that's I think the ninth highest debt load in the country
[55:48.220 --> 55:59.220]  And people are struggling, I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans
[55:59.220 --> 56:04.220]  Knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money
[56:04.220 --> 56:10.220]  So we've got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track
[56:10.220 --> 56:17.220]  And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion
[56:17.220 --> 56:18.220]  Oh my goodness
[56:18.220 --> 56:19.220]  And I want to be that champion
[56:19.220 --> 56:25.220]  I want to stand up and fight for people so that they can not just get by
[56:25.220 --> 56:28.220]  But they can get ahead and they can stay ahead
[56:28.220 --> 56:33.220]  And that's why for, that's propaganda from CNN carrying that, we're analyzing it
[56:33.220 --> 56:41.220]  That's why you have presided for 25 years over the dismantling of the country
[56:41.220 --> 56:48.220]  And the debt bubbles and the college garbage and all of it and then you want to sit up there and act like you're fighting it
[56:48.220 --> 56:52.220]  By the way the guys were able to pull up my breakdown from Forbes
[56:52.220 --> 56:58.220]  Are you rich enough, the terrible tragedy of income inequality among the 1%
[56:58.220 --> 57:03.220]  And it goes on to say the 1% starts at $300,000
[57:03.220 --> 57:09.220]  What I had said according to Berkeley's Emanuel Seyes
[57:09.220 --> 57:14.220]  Not until you get to the top 1 tenth of 1% with an income of 1.9 million a year
[57:14.220 --> 57:20.220]  You achieve the velocity and start to escape Earth's monetary gravitational field
[57:20.220 --> 57:27.220]  And that is again the top 10% of 1% and then you look at just the top, top, top few percent
[57:27.220 --> 57:32.220]  That's the 1,000 plus things like 1,200 to something billionaires
[57:32.220 --> 57:36.220]  And then above them are the super ultra rich whose money is the state secret
[57:36.220 --> 57:41.220]  And that of course is the British royalty, the Rothschilds and the Dutch royalty
[57:41.220 --> 57:43.220]  All of their wealth are state secrets
[57:43.220 --> 57:49.220]  What's not a state secret is that we are funded by viewers and radio listeners like you

[58:52.220 --> 58:58.220]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[58:58.220 --> 59:01.220]  That was designed to smooth out and help children focus
[59:01.220 --> 59:04.220]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control
[59:04.220 --> 59:07.220]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it
[59:07.220 --> 59:10.220]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[59:10.220 --> 59:14.220]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[59:14.220 --> 59:17.220]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.220]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[59:19.220 --> 59:23.220]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[59:23.220 --> 59:25.220]  That children would actually like and take
[59:25.220 --> 59:29.220]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children

[59:48.220 --> 59:53.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:25.220]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.220]  I haven't even mentioned the fact yet that it's April 15th
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:35.220]  The real April Fool's Day was back in 1913
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:41.220]  And we got rid of senators being elected by the legislatures
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:46.220]  So the states could no longer have a checkmate on federal corruption and power grabs
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.220]  And we got the private federal reserve and its funding mechanism
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:55.220]  By its collection agency, the Internal Revenue Service, we got the income tax
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:01.220]  All in December of 1913
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.220]  Now 101 years ago
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:09.220]  And we've lived under it now for three generations
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.220]  Three generations, really four generations
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:17.220]  Now lived in this system
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:24.220]  Like Ron Paul said, 1913 was not a very good year, was it?
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.220]  We have Lucas Jewell joining us at the bottom of the hour
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.220]  Who got pulled over by the armored MRAP in Florida
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.220]  Formerly one of the producers for Adam Kokesh
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.220]  And we got Joel Gilbert popping in on a clip I'm going to play coming up
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:40.220]  Where Obama comes out and thanks
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:47.220]  And says he owes basically everything
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.220]  To Frank Marshall Davis, the top communist pornographer
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.220]  Who is his real daddy
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:02:00.220]  And shot some kinky porn with mama
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.220]  Obama's mama, I mean you can't make this stuff up
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.220]  I mean I just pinched me, am I dreaming?
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:14.220]  It just gets weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder and crazier
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:21.220]  I mean we have a Nazi collaborator funding the takeover of real media
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.220]  Trying to finance the show in the middle class and opening our borders
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:34.220]  Funding a war with Russia and the overthrow of Ukraine
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220]  And he's just walking around
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:46.220]  We've got Obama, the bizarro son of a communist pornographer
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.220]  Who he admittedly lived with when he was a kid
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.220]  It's just a freak show man
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:58.220]  It's a takeover, you wonder who would want to take America over
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:04.220]  Scum, trash, filth, mental patients, devils
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.220]  I don't know what you want to call them
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.220]  Who would want to wreck a free market bonanza
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.220]  Who would want to wreck all this liberty
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.220]  Who would want to wreck all this prosperity
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.220]  There's a reason everybody was kicking and screaming
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.220]  For 100 plus years to get here
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.220]  Because compared to other places, America was really nice
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.220]  I mean if you live in Switzerland or Luxembourg or something
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.220]  And you're real rich and part of the power structure, it's nice
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.220]  If you're not from there and aren't part of the end crowd
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.220]  It's not that good and you can't afford to live
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.220]  New Zealand, I've been there, but no folks that have been
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.220]  It's nice for now until everybody gets the word and goes there
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.220]  And it's too socialist, but it's beautiful
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:51.220]  But beauty does not make the place a utopia
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:56.220]  The only real utopia is liberty and freedom in the animating contest of competition
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.220]  And within the imperfectness of that contest
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:04.220]  And that experience is utopia
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:09.220]  I've got to say that adversity and exultation and victory and defeat
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.220]  And struggle and success and failure
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:18.220]  And all that goes into it is fantastic
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:24.220]  It's fun to sneak into the desert and try to find an al-Qaeda base
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.220]  Even though it's dangerous
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.220]  It's fun to sneak into Bohemian Grove and be questioned by the Secret Service
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:33.220]  And to get the video and infiltrate successfully, blow their operation
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.220]  Have them break in our hotel rooms, grab our stuff in the mail and everything else
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.220]  And still have copies outside of that that ended up hitting the world
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:44.220]  It's fun to expose the open borders and break a national news story
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.220]  And to show they're shipping the illegals in
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.220]  It's fun to expose that they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine to make them take it out
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.220]  It's fun to have victory over evil
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.220]  It's fun to do good
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:05:19.220]  The Soul Grows In The Sunlight of God
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.220]  Some of these companies even got tax rebates back
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.220]  Are you serious?
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220]  Thank goodness we have Hillary Clinton who's now attacking the 1%
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220]  She really means it
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.220]  Did you know that Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission report found that one-third of all income taxes
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.220]  Are consumed by waste and inefficiency in the federal government
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:46.220]  And 100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.220]  Which means that your tax dollars are paid to the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.220]  Bow down to your overlords and pay your stinking taxes
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.220]  Unless you're one of these Fortune 500 companies
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:24.220]  To do reporting for Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.tv

[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.220]  When I got on air 20 years ago
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.220]  I weighed 180 pounds
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.220]  I lifted weights 5 days a week
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.220]  I could swim 2-3 miles
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.220]  Then I discovered the new world order, the globalist, their agenda
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.220]  I started an access television show
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.220]  I was so dedicated to my work
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.220]  And hanging around with radio guys
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.220]  That I began drinking
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.220]  I began smoking cigars
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.220]  And then even cigarettes
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:23.220]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.220]  To looking like a job of the hut
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.220]  So I began a journey 5 years ago
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.220]  To shed the almost 100 pounds
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.220]  I started taking super male vitality
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.220]  And saw dramatic results in just a few weeks
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.220]  When I added to the mix
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.220]  The key products developed by Dr. Group
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.220]  For InfowarsLife.com
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.220]  The results were incredible
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.220]  Take the InfowarsLife.com challenge today
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.220]  And InfowarsLife.com
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.220]  Or give our crew a call
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.220]  They can answer all your questions
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.220]  Or tell you about any of the specials
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.220]  At 888-253-3139
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.220]  That'd be 9 a.m. to noon Pacific
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.220]  10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mountain
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.220]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.220]  Coming up we have the gentlemen pulled over
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.220]  By the MRAP armored truck in Florida
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.220]  We're gonna get his take on that situation briefly
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.220]  Then we have the filmmaker
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.220]  Joe Gilbert who made Dreams My Real Father
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.220]  We've now had congressmen come out
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.220]  And point out that Obama was raised
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:52.220]  By a communist pornographer
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.220]  A top communist
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.220]  It was fun about the Soviets
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.220]  To run newspapers nationwide
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.220]  I mean you're talking in the committees
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.220]  Working for people that killed tens of millions
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.220]  I mean just super creepy
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.220]  Tied into the weathermen, all of them
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.220]  I mean this is a sinister group
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.220]  And now Obama's come out and said
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.220]  Yeah he basically learned everything
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.220]  From Frank Marshall Davis
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.220]  Who we know in his own book
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.220]  Obama says he grew up with him
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.220]  And stayed with him on summers
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.220]  Then his grandfather was best friends with him
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.220]  Yeah and your mother basically was his girl
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.220]  And shot porn with him
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220]  And we've got him in the same house
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.220]  You were raised in with photos of you
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.220]  In the house on the same couch
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.220]  In the same room with the same pictures
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.220]  Where the porn shot
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.220]  And what's crazy is that no one picked that up
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.220]  They'll pick up, he's from Kenya all day
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.220]  And I admit it we got fooled by that
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.220]  I admitted all that
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.220]  Because again he was the editor
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.220]  Of the Harvard Law Review for multiple years
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.220]  And in the forward to it said
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.220]  You know it's a great honor as someone born in Kenya
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.220]  And you know to be here now at Harvard
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.220]  And blah blah blah
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.220]  And then his wife in the campaign
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.220]  In the first campaign saying he was born in Kenya
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.220]  And they put out fake birth certificates
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:06.220]  To upset us, to mess with us
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.220]  To make us take the bait
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.220]  I mean they put out the typewriter font
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:16.220]  Is the Microsoft Word font
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.220]  Selection where each typewriter like a snowflake
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.220]  Is a different blob
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.220]  Micro-splats like a
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.220]  Ice flake, like a snowflake
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.220]  All I did when it came out with Rob do
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.220]  The first thing I did was and it was in layers
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.220]  We put out that it was in layers, got millions of views
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.220]  You know huge viral videos, we were the first
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.220]  And I'm not a forensics person but I'm not stupid
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.220]  And I had to look at something to see if it's my signature
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:45.220]  And the first thing we noticed is it was in seven layers
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.220]  And people said well that was an accident
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.220]  They split the layers, there wouldn't be layers
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.220]  If it wasn't in layers before
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.220]  It was a fake scan
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.220]  And they put it out as the document
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.220]  To make it obvious
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:02.220]  Only now in hindsight we figure all this out
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.220]  So it was a deliberate forgery to get us off track
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.220]  Along with everything else, him not looking like his dad
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.220]  On and on and on
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.220]  The government not thinking it was his dad
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.220]  And throwing him out of the U.S.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:17.220]  That was just their cover
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.220]  So that we would never look at what was in his own book
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.220]  Hiding in plain view that he spent summers with Frank Marshall Davis
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.220]  That is just such a big deal because then they can blackmail Obama
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:33.220]  And control him with all of that information
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.220]  The video is on infowars.com
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.220]  Obama admits, noted communist, schooled him on white racism
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.220]  I'm going to play that clip in a moment
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.220]  And then, something very exciting
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.220]  I want to announce to the listeners
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.220]  I threw this initiative out just a week ago
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.220]  And our great reporters and researchers have hit the ground running
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.220]  So it was something really exciting
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.220]  I'm going to announce and play here in a moment
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.220]  But first, here is that clip ahead of the guest
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.220]  Joining us of Obama talking about Frank Marshall Davis
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.220]  The guy that published communist newspapers
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.220]  All over the U.S., big ones
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.220]  Worked for the Central Committee
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.220]  KGB operative
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.220]  Just incredible
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.220]  And he also ran distribution of a major porn operation
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.220]  That's how communists make their money
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.220]  That and Robin banks and stuff
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.220]  That's the weatherman though
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.220]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.220]  And the passage finally ends with me having a conversation
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.220]  With a close friend of my maternal grandfather
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.220]  A close friend of Graham
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.220]  It's a black man from Kansas named Frank
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.220]  Actually, at the time, a fairly well-known poet
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.220]  Named Frank Marshall Davis
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.220]  Who had moved to Hawaii and lived there
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.220]  And so I have a discussion with him
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.220]  About the kinds of frustrations I'm having
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.220]  And he sort of schools me on
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:57.220]  That I should get used to these frustrations
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.220]  So let me dig in
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.220]  And you look at him, he is his father's son
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:10.220]  I mean, that is daddy
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.220]  Unbelievable
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.220]  You'll see the video at mfolwars.com
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.220]  If you're a radio listener
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.220]  mfolwars.com forward slash show
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.220]  You can see it right there
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.220]  Totally blows me away
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.220]  Totally blows me away
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.220]  Now, let's shift gears into some good news
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.220]  You know, I had a thought
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.220]  On the internet-only streams
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.220]  I'm gonna put some of these on the network as well
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.220]  Maybe a listener can hear them
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.220]  We have the podcast ads, is what I call them
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.220]  That just the folks on the streams, the video feeds
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.220]  See, still a huge audience
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.220]  But not as big as the M&FM audience
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.220]  It's probably 80% of our audience
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.220]  Millions every day
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.220]  We have rated
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.220]  Last time we got ad agency condensed numbers
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.220]  That is a boil down
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.220]  Only on stations subscribing
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220]  To the rating system
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.220]  You have to subscribe to the numbers
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.220]  About 3 million listeners a day
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.220]  Terrestrial radio
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.220]  And it's grown since then
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.220]  4 million
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.220]  That's very important
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.220]  Because that's a big mass of people
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220]  That were able to hit
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220]  You can tell friends and family
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:11.220]  Tune into this local M&FM station
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:14.220]  But also, I'd like to have
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:15.220]  Part of the ads
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.220]  And I'm gonna have this
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.220]  Because I only have a few of the ads on the network
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.220]  But I'm gonna have to do this
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.220]  With their little one minute evergreen reports
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220]  About the history of liberty
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.220]  And standing up for freedom
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.220]  And this great continuum
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.220]  But also breaking news reports
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.220]  And analysis
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.220]  And I, boom, heard one air this morning
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.220]  I asked Jakari to do it last week
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.220]  And he just did a great one
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.220]  That's just one minute inspirational
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.220]  And then I just heard one that Rob Do did
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.220]  Perfect for tax day to day
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.220]  He's our news director on the nightly news
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.220]  And that's what all about my crew
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.220]  Just wild horses can't drag them away
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220]  They all want to work
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220]  They're up to like 8 or 9
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.220]  And as they go home to your family
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]  But they bring their kids up here
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.220]  Because they want to fight the tyranny
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.220]  I mean, it's like target fixation
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.220]  When you're in a B-17 shooting at Messerschmitts
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.220]  Coming in, you don't want to stop
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.220]  I mean, it's just, you're committed
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.220]  That's good, it's a fighting spirit
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.220]  And then I haven't heard David Knight yet
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.220]  But I'm sure it's going to be excellent as well
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.220]  So we're also going to take some of these
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.220]  And put video to them and air them on the nightly news
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.220]  But you'll be hearing these during the breaks
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.220]  Here on the radio show
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.220]  So let's go ahead and go to a compilation
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.220]  Of three of these that are airing today
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220]  During the breaks
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.220]  I was born on the prairies
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.220]  Where the wind blew free
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.220]  And there was nothing to break the light of the sun
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.220]  I was born where there were no enclosures
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.220]  Geronimo
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.220]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.220]  Where you're quizzed about your citizenship
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.220]  About having to submit to bag searches
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.220]  To ride public transportation
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.220]  His thoughts on non-violent offenders
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.220]  Riding away in prisons
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.220]  They say that in these current times
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.220]  We are more, quote, civilized
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.220]  But are we really more free?
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.220]  When the Persian army demanded
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.220]  King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.220]  The outnumbered kings shouted
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.220]  Molon Lave or come and take them
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.220]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.220]  By a much larger adversary
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.220]  He is not remembered for his loss
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.220]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.220]  And self-defense
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.220]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:18.220]  Arm yourself with knowledge at infowars.com

[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.220]  Your Federal Reserve tribute
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.220]  Known as the Income Tax is due on April 15th
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.220]  That is unless you're one of the following
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.220]  Fortune 500 companies that aren't paying any taxes
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.220]  Daily Mail reports the Fortune 500 companies
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.220]  That didn't pay a penny in 2014 income tax
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.220]  Despite being worth billions
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.220]  Some of the companies include
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.220]  CBS, Mattel, Prudential, Time Warner
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:47.220]  Owens Corning, JetBlue, Xerox, Priceline.com
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.220]  And perennial bomb maker General Electric
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.220]  Some of these companies even got tax rebates back
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220]  Are you serious?
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.220]  Thank goodness we have Hillary Clinton
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.220]  Who's now attacking the 1%
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.220]  She really means it
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.220]  Did you know that Ronald Reagan's
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.220]  Grace Commission report found that
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.220]  One-third of all income taxes are consumed
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.220]  By waste and inefficiency in the federal government
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.220]  And 100% of what is collected is absorbed
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.220]  Solely by interest on the federal debt
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.220]  Which means that your tax dollars are paid
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.220]  To the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.220]  Bow down to your overlords and pay your stinking taxes
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.220]  For one of these Fortune 500 companies
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.220]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.220]  And prismplanet.tv
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.220]  The BLM is at it again
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.220]  This time they're not trying to take a rancher's
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.220]  Grazing rights pretending that they're protecting
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220]  An endangered species
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.220]  Now they're going after the mining rights
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.220]  Of one of the oldest continuing claims in the U.S.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.220]  So old that it's protected under the
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.220]  General Mining Act of 1872
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.220]  And they're not even giving the lawyers
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.220]  For the miners a reason, let alone a day in court
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.220]  The Glease Mining District in Oregon reports
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220]  That one of the mine owners has been given
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.220]  A cease and desist order with a deadline
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.220]  Of Saturday, April the 25th
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.220]  They must remove all equipment and buildings
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.220]  And fill in the tunnels by then, which is impossible
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.220]  The owners of the sugarpine mine have stated
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.220]  That they will fully disobey the order
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.220]  They say is illegal and invalid
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.220]  And they have called for assistance
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.220]  Local chapters of Oath Keepers and 3%
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.220]  Have responded and others are on the way
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.220]  For more information and updates as the situation develops
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.220]  Stay tuned to the Alex Jones Radio Show

[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.220]  About the local AM&FM stations that you're listening to
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.220]  And support their local sponsors
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.220]  Here's my frustration, it's why I need two or three more
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.220]  Camera people, two or three more ground reporters
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.220]  And three or four more riders
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.220]  I need to be able to send
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.220]  I think Jakari Jackson and maybe Marcos Morales
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:43.220]  Or somebody, I'm not sure
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.220]  Out to this Oregon situation as it develops
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:49.220]  I mean, I covered it some yesterday
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.220]  They have total rights under federal and state law
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.220]  They believe only about 1% of the gold
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.220]  Has been taken out of this
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.220]  It's the clean type of gold mine
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:02.220]  Compared to some of the others that you cyanide
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.220]  They've shut down almost all our minds in this country
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.220]  It's a joke
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.220]  And they're not even giving a reason under law
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.220]  They're just saying we're doing it
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.220]  And that's because the globalist creditors
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.220]  Want everything kept in the ground until they take over
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220]  They always kick people off things
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.220]  Then move back in and open it up
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:22.220]  In fact, I've seen some estimates that were in the news
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:27.220]  That there may be as much as $10 billion of gold
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.220]  In that claim
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.220]  And you better believe in 10 years if they give it up
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.220]  The government will then hand it over to someone
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.220]  That says they're doing it economically clean
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.220]  That's how these businesses work
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.220]  Oh, it's for the environment
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.220]  I mean, it's just all take from you
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.220]  Give it to somebody else
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.220]  And they're just militarizing the police to go on
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.220]  And carry out their orders
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.220]  There'll be another stand down here

[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:43.740]  million rounds of AR-15 ammo and he asked for the feds to be to control the
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:49.700]  market and drive supply. Do fish swim in the ocean? Do women like to comb their
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:57.420]  hair? Is the Easter Bunny a bunny? Is Hillary Clinton a lying sack of filth? Is
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.940]  Obama the son of a top communist pornographer? DHS to purchase 62 million
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:08.500]  rounds of AR-15 ammo and then I want to change the headline it's an excellent
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:17.820]  article by Paul on top of the three billion rounds already purchased in
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:25.740]  last four years or we're gonna have a long sub headline that says you know
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:29.380]  bringing the total to well over three billion rounds purchased in the last four
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:37.340]  years is this a plan to dry up the supply? Yes he said he'll get the guns one
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.460]  way or another. He's been in the news you can pull the headline up that he'll use
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:48.020]  executive power to do it and I knew this was the case. What'd you say CJ? Oh sorry
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.700]  it's on Drudge. Oh our story's already on Drudge? Yes it is. Wow that's Drudge is so
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.860]  fast I mean Drudge is quicker than I am half the time that he's got one of our
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:58.020]  stories for me when aware of it. Homeland Security purchasing 62 million
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:04.780]  rounds of AR-15 ammo and there's now video I want to play that homeowner
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.740]  shoots down drone flying over his property. I should just read the Drudge
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.380]  report.com every day on air and he's better than focusing on news than I am.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.700]  Look at the left-hand side of Drudge. I mean look at those incredible headlines
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:23.980]  I've got it punched up right here. Europe is now indicted Google. That's going on.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:34.740]  The federal tax code is longer than hundreds of Bibles. How many pages is it?
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:42.780]  74,000. 74,608. Wow. Yeah because for some reason Drudge on that on that TV it
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.700]  cuts off the edge. We're gonna get a function where he can shrink it down a
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:50.380]  little bit because I know he's got an information corner to corner unlike
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.500]  info wars it looks like somebody shot it with a shotgun full of ads but but we
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:59.100]  are redesigning info wars. I'm sorry what were you saying? I was saying Drudge
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:04.420]  doesn't format correctly in new browsers so when you zoom or decrease it's still
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.020]  in the same side of the screen. I kind of like that though because it's just
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:14.140]  it's it's it's so original and it doesn't change just gets better. So here is
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:20.020]  that story DH has to purchase 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo and yes they're
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:26.020]  trying to drop the supply this is on top. Everybody keeps using the 2.6
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.460]  billion number from like three years ago. I've been adding it up and maybe
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:34.620]  Kit Daniels he's really good at this he really stays on this. Kit can you maybe
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:39.700]  update his article and say updated by Kit Daniels at the bottom or something and
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.900]  try to add up from all the articles we've done in the federal purchase orders
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.900]  a guesstimation because I don't claim it'll be exact there's so many orders we
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:52.460]  don't even know about but it was 2.6 a couple years ago I think two and a half
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:58.700]  years ago three years ago and then there's just hundreds of millions getting
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:02.340]  bought all the time like 20 million here 40 million there 1 million there 8
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.700]  million there 70 million here 99 million here 250 million here and then we knew
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:14.420]  it was about the ammo when it was like millions of rounds of ammo that they
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:26.140]  don't use 30 odd six Q43 38 special they don't use those rounds in the US
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:35.060]  military they use 223 308 50 caliber BMG what is it 50 caliber little short ones
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:38.020]  what do they call I can't remember any more APC I forget all the names I mean
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.700]  there's probably only ten rounds they use in the US military there's a good
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.580]  reason for that you don't want to have a whole bunch of different rounds it's
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:50.220]  very simple what's used they are buying I mean that's one article it was a
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.180]  kid or it's a Don Salazar did one I remember one last year where it was
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:29:02.180]  just like hundreds of cartridges they were buying up like 44 long cult that you
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.700]  can hardly even order I've got a 44 long cult it's amazing rifle great for
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.860]  shooting wild hogs just throw it right in the back of your truck small rifle
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:15.860]  super high-powered 44 long cult most people shoot the 44 cult which is still
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:20.380]  long it's not long cult you got to shoot long cult in those rifles but they're
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:28.740]  buying long cult they're basically buying everything up this story is big I'm
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:33.620]  gonna go out and shoot my long cult I'm gonna shoot my ferrets mainly I'm gonna
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:37.820]  go out and shoot my 223s I just I didn't use to be a big fan of 223s back
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.860]  you know 25 years ago when I would shoot AR-15s but they've really perfected
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:49.180]  them now I just love the 223 it's like a laser beam loving we're on the March the
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:56.300]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:03.220]  do you know what it means to be an American it's more than a flag it's more
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:07.300]  than knowing the star-spangled banner it's knowing the Constitution it's
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.540]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country's falling apart
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.820]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.900]  the right thing it's putting your life on the line to protect your country from

[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:29.780]  sometimes there's a video a photo a statement an image that no matter what
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:34.260]  the social engineers try to do with their PR stunts the public sees through
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.020]  brian williams saying that oh he was shot down in a helicopter you never
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.700]  forget the missile shooting up and exploding and the smell of it and
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:44.100]  everything and then oh actually I was ten minutes behind an hour behind two
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.340]  hours behind actually I was nowhere around it I just misremembered it and
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:51.020]  now he's made a bunch of other stuff hillary clinton saying she was shot at
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:54.940]  and attacked in the air and on the airfield in bosnia with cbs news they
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:34:00.140]  show the footage none of it happened it's those simple lies that people can
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:08.020]  wrap their minds around and the image of a armored tank pulling a citizen over
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:12.860]  and then getting in their face and saying stand right there that tells up
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:16.660]  not a thousand words but a million words and we're gonna talk to lucas jewel
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.660]  I think it's been on the show before back when he worked with Adam Cokesh
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.020]  he's a former navy air traffic controller who woke up in the military and
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.140]  got out as conscious his objector he went on to manage libertarian activists
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:34.940]  Adam Cokesh's operation for wallb and he has joined us before he's running for
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.300]  city commission in gainsville florida successfully and as a student majoring
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:47.380]  in economics at santa fe college facebook j v i l l e j vile and we're
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.740]  gonna be talking to him in a moment about getting pulled over by the tank
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:56.180]  and roll some of that video and describe it for the audience oh by the way the
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:02.860]  story up on info wars dot com and now up on drudge report dot com is dealing
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:08.780]  with another 62 million rounds and I'm gonna be honest I don't know what the
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.980]  number is now about a year ago kit daniels added it up and it was over three
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:17.540]  billion rounds have been purchased in the last four years by homeland security
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:21.500]  and including the illegal types under nato their hollow point that's just the
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:26.940]  law it's a Geneva convention their anti-personnel rounds because they hurt
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.620]  people too bad they're banned I mean that just shows how silly it all is the
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:33.740]  point is they're buying illegal ammo it's for us they got the targets of the
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.740]  patriots the training is for it the manuals are for it the drill out
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:42.380]  California over the weekend that we were banned from it was sovereign citizen
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.300]  gun owners veterans they were practicing attacking we have it on video we played
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:51.140]  it yesterday so while we have ISIS bases five miles over the border of El
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:56.140]  Paso judicial watch reporting on our reporters are down there reporting on it
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:02.820]  as well we're here bracing for the government basically declaring us to be
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:13.900]  the open enemy and they bought up not just the 45 ammo for your colt 9-11's
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:18.100]  that the military still has sometimes and the burritos they have with the
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:23.660]  millimeter 9 millimeter and the 223 and the 308 and the 50 cal BMG and all the
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:30.060]  rest of it they're buying up hundreds of other different exotic cartridges we're
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:35.700]  breaking that down more and we'll also get Lucas Jules take on that in just a
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:41.260]  moment and I've got my little decorative 100 year anniversary colt 9-11 right
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:47.260]  here and again we bring guns out on the show sometimes because it's our
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:52.100]  American and free human birthright to not be disarmed slaves you can go back to
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.260]  300 and Greece to understand that wasn't jacari Jackson put on earlier it's the
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:01.140]  fact that you shouldn't be scared of a citizen with a firearm you shouldn't be
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:04.620]  scared of the image of a free man or woman with a gun I mean where are the
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:09.380]  feminist groups saying armed women and I'm not usually into fancy dandy guns
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:14.540]  pearl handled guns but you know you got to celebrate a colt 9-11 you got a you
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:19.660]  got to pay your ties to the gun manufacturer colt or the enemy will
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:24.500]  take this company down they are suing them of course so you shop with the
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:28.420]  good guys you vote with your dollars and if you got the money this is a sweet
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:31.820]  shooting 45 as it gets
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:41.300]  I'm so good and sweet loving little firearm such a nice little super shock
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:48.540]  holopoint round before some anti gunner since we an email it's illegal to use in
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:54.180]  warfare holopoint it's not illegal for citizens to have them self defense okay
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:38:00.340]  let's continue now here another report on info wars com Hillary hasn't driven a
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.100]  car since 1996 to show how disconnected from reality I wonder if she's driven in
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.580]  a tank well yeah we know that presidential vehicles pretty much are
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:12.580]  tanks on wheels and we know that the thousands of in wraps that they promise
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.220]  were just for terrorists are now being used at checkpoints on the highways to
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:20.180]  intimidate the public will be talking about that as I said in a moment but
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:25.980]  first off briefly we're running a special on fluoride shield that is
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:34.100]  basically a key later it's got I think you guys have that door open just a
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:42.780]  little update it's got what is it five ingredients it's got the nation I and I
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:47.340]  am but four other ingredients that are known to pull toxins out of the body and
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:51.500]  it's something that I take on a daily basis you can get a free bottle of it
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:58.700]  that is a huge value absolutely free when you get it with two bottles of
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.580]  survival shield x2 that are already discounted right now with free shipping
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:09.980]  so that's a win-win a free bottle that is a 29.95 value with the two bottles of
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:14.660]  survival shield x2 and free shipping and that is well supplies last we are set

[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.460]  when we're about to sell out of something I may not have it for a while I
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.900]  discount it instead of jacking up the price on it which is what I guess a lot
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.420]  of folks would do I just do counterintuitive things it seems to work
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:33.020]  by the grace of God so you can get a discount on that before it sells out

[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:50.140]  religiously because I'll admit it I forget all the time to take it so I
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:53.980]  even had a reminder on my iPhone I had the crew telling me to do it to every
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:58.220]  day remember at least twice a day to take the oxypower only did for like six
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:01.980]  days of that period but the others I took you do that once a month the others I

[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:34.940]  seen it on the show info wars life.com or 888-253-3139 and lastly
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:41.540]  it is important to remember just as I said with the second amendment to vote
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:47.660]  with your dollars and to support the broadcast because that's how we get the
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.900]  word out as free will we're not here like the IRS today with a gun to your
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:55.340]  head taking your money to then give it to George Soros to give it to the media
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:59.580]  to try to demonize the American people we're here fighting the onslaught
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:04.060]  globalist takeover of America and if we just get people to realize how huge
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:08.260]  this takeover is and what amazing times we're alive in it's game over for the
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:17.800]  globalist so we have to get out of our comfort zones and we have to really take
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:32.740]  action I think the answer for our guest I think the answer is to do things like
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.260]  go to the public events they're gonna have with the MRAP to condition the
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.860]  public to accept it and nicely interview these cops and say you know you
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.980]  threaten me to get in front of my car you were gonna arrest me do you enjoy
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:47.780]  being on a petty power trip and do you understand that you're gonna have your
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:53.860]  rights violated by the system as well I would have events public education
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:58.300]  events I would you know get the local city park and not even call a
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:03.500]  demonstration but call it an educational event about community policing see
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:07.140]  zig when they zag and then actually reach out to the police and to the
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:12.180]  public and talk about why they're being given these caches of weapons why is the
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:16.260]  government buying billions of rounds of ammo with three billion a couple years
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:21.420]  ago I mean it's it's we've got to add it all up as best we can and explain it's
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:24.300]  as best we can and just link to the different purchases it'll be far bigger
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:27.300]  than what we say but they would get up and say we didn't buy one million rounds
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:30.660]  we didn't buy a million rounds with it's always we didn't buy we didn't buy as
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.100]  they arm and train to take on the American people that admit it so we
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.020]  have to have a discussion about this and there is a discussion about the fake
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:40.660]  drug war and about the militarization of police and about the surveillance grid
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.380]  and how the DEA is caught dealing the drugs we just continue to do that but
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:49.380]  realize they're compartmentalized in all these agencies they're not all bad a lot
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.420]  of them are good and are some of the most awake people out there and so the
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:58.300]  system just hopes we attack the government itself here's an analogy that
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:03.540]  I'm going to my guest there are many cases in history where an Islamist is
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:08.420]  radical with hijack a plane or others criminals sometimes and they found that
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:12.340]  if they tied up the pilots or made them fly for them and take their jackets off
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:16.700]  they would put them on sometimes they wouldn't even button right and that
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:21.580]  suddenly if the hijackers were wearing official uniforms everyone would
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.020]  start doing what they said more that's the authority at a primitive level of
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:29.340]  a uniform we recognize as humans going back that that's a warrior that's the
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:33.340]  chief and it it's just archetypal programmed into us because back then the
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.460]  warriors and the chief your little band of a hundred people they're almost
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:40.140]  always really were on your side it was about barely surviving it was all big
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:45.740]  family things so we see somebody uniform as as like our daddy basically and they
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:50.500]  didn't always put the uniform on you put a uniform on it was to go to war because
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.860]  another tribe of a thousand people was coming down the river burn everybody
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:57.220]  out killing the men and taking the women and so you've made the decision to get
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:03.340]  ready to fight now are you going to question the the the warriors and their
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.900]  uniforms no you're not your body's designed to gear up and do what they
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:16.460]  say so this is all the conditioning that's going on but DHS to now get 62
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.820]  million more rounds of the AR-15 ammo to drive up the price but also to hoard it
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:24.100]  for a civil war and that's what every indicator shows they're doing and the
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:27.380]  globalists are bold enough to try it I hope to expose it cause an actual debate
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:31.820]  about it so they have to back off all right facebook.com forward slash j v i
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:37.180]  l l e Lucas jewel naval veteran joins us while he's talking we'll roll in the
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:40.820]  background some of the video and then cue it up to where the cop you know says
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:45.540]  get over there I'm gonna arrest you but you flipped them off I probably wouldn't
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.340]  have done that I'd have pulled over and confronted them nicely about you know
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:53.100]  what are you out here to do to condition the public to your armored vehicle and
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.820]  you know I understand society's teeter on the edge of collapse but you know that
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:45:00.100]  was done by design you know I would simply give them films and books because
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.540]  I found it's more effective but I'm not hey it's your first amendment to flip
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:07.700]  them off and I get it you're mad we're being overrun it's a standing army I
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.900]  get it so I so I can almost admire you know at one level the fact that you're
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:18.220]  bold so Lucas jewel thanks for coming on with us thank you for having me Alex
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:24.260]  and while I can certainly agree that what I did wasn't quite I would say you
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.500]  know the government has done some very implied things to be also exactly so I
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:32.900]  mean it's true we're lining up for a war on this country my I'm trying to stop it
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.060]  but but I mean I get your anger so so describe what happened well I was
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:42.180]  driving down University Avenue here in Gainesville Florida right in front of
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:47.780]  the University of Florida and I see an armed personnel carrier with a bunch
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:53.500]  of guys dressed up like GI Joe's in the back of Kevlar and I see this driving
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:59.180]  beside me on University Avenue and I have a lot of issues with the police
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:03.860]  state and police militarization so I just wanted to express my negative
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:09.940]  feelings towards that vehicle and towards those officers and I did it by
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:15.300]  extending my middle finger towards those officers
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:19.740]  well I could say I've been flipped off by the Marines and Secret Service
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.940]  covering Bilderberg and I didn't flip them off so you know they were they
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.940]  weren't harassed I mean so you know that's their first amendment that you
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.500]  know that you know they don't like me for whatever brainwash reason but so
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:34.780]  what happened next break it down so they proceeded to follow me in this armored
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:41.420]  vehicle for about two miles and then I turned onto another road and they that's
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.340]  when they turned behind me and turned on the red and blue flashing lights that
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:54.100]  were on the top of this vehicle soon after I'm pulled out of the vehicle I'm
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:59.780]  assaulted by an officer you know one officer says I'm not allowed to film
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:06.540]  him because my phone might be a gun which is completely ludicrous and if you
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.420]  watch the video the officer who tells me that I that I can't point my camera at
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:14.340]  him because it might be a gun he eventually said that I can point the
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:19.820]  camera at myself I just can't point the camera at him so if you really was
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:25.460]  afraid that my camera was a weapon why would he want me to still hold it well
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.500]  that's an unlawful order and they're in a public place and so until you're under
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:35.540]  actual arrest he can't turn the camera off right and and I didn't turn the
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:41.740]  camera off you know they you know they're wearing Kevlar they're wearing the
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:49.900]  same camouflage the United States Marine Corps wears and they they really I feel
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:55.580]  like took on the attitude of those uniforms you know they they dress they
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:00.380]  dressed up playing soldier and so they finally got someone who they could
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:07.660]  bully and they tried to bully me well I didn't know that they'd assault you and
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:10.660]  said that you couldn't film I just seen the part of them threatening to arrest
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.700]  you and pulling you over I guess the full videos on your website we're now
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:20.380]  rolling it now describe the assault well the officer tells me to stand in
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:25.460]  between the headlights and hand him my driver's license so he gives me two
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:31.580]  orders at once I handle my driver's license and I'm walking towards the
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.900]  headlights and he tells me again to stand in front of headlights and you can see
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:39.300]  in the video I'm moving towards the headlights and that's when he assaults
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:44.940]  me and says you know he's gonna arrest me for resisting or something like that
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:51.540]  we'll play that clip in a moment that's where I think these officers really do
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:55.620]  show themselves to be wannabe GI Joe's they think you're an al-Qaeda operative
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:00.780]  inside Fallujah as they pull you over they should have just let you flip them
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:06.060]  off and been you know bigger men about it and then they grab on you and threaten
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:10.700]  to arrest you you can be seen to be doing what he says he's playing games
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:15.700]  with you and it's all about he wants you to know that he's your boss well that's
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:19.820]  not how free countries work and so if you want to put on a uniform you're
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:23.380]  agreeing to take a lot of crap so don't get into the uniform and then be on a
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:28.940]  pity party all day that somebody flips you off and then go and abuse them
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.380]  verbally and the rest of it for that but hey the good news is your story is a
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:36.620]  national story it's all over newspapers everywhere being played on the news man
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:40.860]  pulled over by tank and people are really understanding this is a fraud so the
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:45.860]  good news is it's turned out to be good yeah you know I think this has been
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:52.420]  very good and on multiple fronts one everyone should know that we do have
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.540]  the right of expression and we can't express ourselves even in ways that are
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:50:02.100]  unpleasant such as extending your middle finger so I hope that people realize
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:08.020]  that we're allowed to do that and also I I hope this facilitates the debate
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:12.300]  about police militarization I hope that happens and of course I can have my
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:16.060]  opinion too I don't think flipping police office a good idea a lot of them
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.260]  understand the first amendment a lot of them don't I mean just like I wouldn't
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.900]  flip off random men you can get them fight real quick doing that but I
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:28.860]  understand you can do what you want you have a first amendment I'm just saying
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:31.260]  I don't think it's a good idea I want to play the clip you're talking about as we
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:34.700]  go to break and come back get some final comments from you and talk about
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:37.620]  some of the journalism you're involved in you've done a lot of great work let's

[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:09.740]  just have tanks sitting around our armored vehicles with about five or six
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:16.300]  guys in camo come up and bug their eyes out at somebody it's just pathetic but

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:30.420]  flicking off police and I don't go around flicking off police but this was
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.860]  the first time that I'd seen an armored vehicle with I understand it was
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:37.860]  emotional it was in the heat of the moment I'm not judging you I get what
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.620]  you did right this isn't it this isn't a cop this is something that I commonly do

[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:20.340]  alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:24.940]  jones see what I do with the police or anybody is I give them benefit of the
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:28.620]  doubt I'm not saying jules wrong he was in the heat of the moment flipped them
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.660]  off he's younger than I am I've done similar things when I was younger he I
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:35.980]  would have pulled over and then when they try to say don't film me I would have
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:41.100]  said this is America I'll do whatever I want and when they threaten to attack me
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:44.460]  I'd say go ahead and by the way I'm not just saying that I've done it with the
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:49.740]  austin PD got to be 10 years ago footage is on YouTube I've done it in New
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:54.420]  York where army guys come running up with their guns and threaten to attack me
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.780]  if I don't stop filming when I just get their face I go let's go I mean that's
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:02.300]  in in game I just said come on and I wouldn't look it for trouble but I mean
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:07.460]  you want to fight let's go I mean you know that's treason and and so I'm not
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.900]  saying Lucas is wrong I think you showed a lot of restraint when they're
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.660]  thuggishly telling you don't aim your camera at them but Lucas you were
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:15.140]  talking about when you were conscious of the objector getting out of the Navy
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:19.020]  not want to be part of these evil wars like the ones helping al-qaeda take over
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:25.980]  Syria go ahead and make your point yes sir so I had to file a 14-page
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:32.220]  application to explain how my beliefs had changed since I'd been in the
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:39.620]  military and I explained that through listening to your show through watching
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:48.220]  documentaries such as freedom to fascism in game police day loose change you
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:53.340]  know that that's what caused me to see this in another perspective and that's
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:02:00.940]  what made me incapable of fighting for this empire well it's certainly true
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:03.700]  that more and more a military does serve the corporate interests that have seized
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:08.940]  control of this nation and and so they gave you your conscious objector out
[02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:14.660]  yes sir I it's a hard fight and I would just encourage anyone in the military
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:20.980]  listening to go to GI right hotline go to the GI right hotline website and talk
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:25.540]  to them about becoming a conscious objector I think it's a really it's a
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:29.300]  really good program and chances are if you're a listener to the Alex you don't
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:35.820]  show you can convince the military that you don't need to be there no they get
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.620]  it that you understand that the military I mean it's kind of the border
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:41.260]  patrol and we drive through and they want and what they want to search us we
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:44.100]  go but you don't search the illegals they go yeah you're right go on we have
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:49.260]  to go on tape I mean it's just the military the border patrol none of it
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:53.700]  does the constitutional duty and now with Jade Helm with them wanting to train
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:56.540]  to take on the American people we've now confirmed that they've in Jade Helm
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.740]  stuff it's already starting they've got trucks that say 3% on it for the drills
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:05.340]  they're practicing taking on sovereign citizens we have video I mean Jade Helms
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:10.180]  really the exercises that are beginning ahead of it they're gearing up a major
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:14.660]  operation they're buying billions of rounds of ammo you'll have to be a
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:18.900]  conscious issue a subjector most the military I think it's gonna say no when
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:21.220]  they ask him to march out and try to carry this out what do you think the
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:28.060]  politicians are thinking I think that they're control-free says you sometimes
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:34.700]  say and I feel like they are disconnected from reality even at the local
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:40.900]  level sometimes you know I recently ran for for state of commission and even in
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:47.060]  the city government these city commissioners and the county commissioners
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:52.580]  feel as if they're elite and feel like they're superior people and they are
[02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:57.300]  very disconnected and I don't think they understand how angry we are about this
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:01.860]  well I mean I agree their minions don't know what's going on but up on top they've
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:05.900]  got the NSA spy grids the algorithms they know that the country's on the verge
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:09.420]  of revolution they want to steer it to some type of leftist burned down cities
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:14.620]  kill all the police so the feds and the UN come in we don't want that I mean it
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:18.340]  only helps them even if you hate the cops which I don't killing them burning
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:21.340]  things down only helps the globalist that's why they're funding it we've got
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:25.620]  to take the counties and cities back reach out to the police we can see Jade
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:29.220]  Helmsman to reach out to military and in police and to see he'll go along with
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:33.020]  the takeover we need to be reaching out we need to counter everything the enemy
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:37.580]  does well Lucas what are you doing these days I'm a student here at Santa
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:42.860]  State College going in my degree in economics after that I plan to go to
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:49.540]  law school and fight that way all right very very exciting people can follow you
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:54.860]  at JVILLE at Facebook Lucas Jewel thank you so much good job with your overall
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:05:01.780]  report got a lot of Colonies recently in full wars requested press credentials
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:06.140]  to film a dirty bomb drill in Richmond California we were denied access because
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:10.060]  the deputy director of public affairs at the California military department
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:14.300]  felt that we would somehow misconstrue the activities of the exercise turns
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:18.940]  out the dirty bomb drill also included training for dealing with self-identified
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:23.780]  sovereign citizens I do recognize that some sovereign citizens have been
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.820]  involved in extremist activity but I also recognize that sovereign citizens
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:32.460]  are habitually lumped in with law abiding conservatives and libertarians with
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:37.180]  recent civil unrest I get training for crowd control and I most definitely want
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:41.500]  our military police and federal agents to deal with the public safely but I
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:45.100]  don't want citizens viewed as an enemy for quoting the Declaration of
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:51.220]  Independence or our US Constitution you can find more reports on info wars calm

[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:29.220]  doing what is a rally you're listening to the alex jones show a modern
[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:38.420]  local belief in a rally is rallying for a politician or a pep rally the night
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:45.260]  before a playoff game and of course those are archetypal simulations of a
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:50.300]  tribe about to march off to battle to defend their land in the morning and
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:55.180]  there is a rally to get fired up and say bye to everybody and have a good time
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:09:01.100]  and daddy spends some time with mama say bye to the kids in the early morning
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:07.420]  light and march off and fight to the death so we say rallying patriots
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:12.220]  worldwide you would have a flagman you go back to medieval warfare and write
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:17.060]  through to the Renaissance with different units in a battle if people got
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:21.340]  too broken up they would give the orders with the flags that flags back at the
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:25.140]  top giving directives and then down lower they had sub flag directives you
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:29.700]  have someone swaying a flag blowing a horn certain number of blows there was
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.980]  different ways to communicate so that you knew you need to be over here you
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:38.940]  need to rally and really there's so many hundreds of millions of people that
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:45.380]  know what's going on worldwide that's a conservative number that it's a piece of
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:48.340]  cake if you just don't expect that you've got to defeat the whole global
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:53.300]  system by yourself you just got to vote with your dollars or vote whatever your
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.980]  currency is you got to not comply with stuff that you know is anti-human
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:01.980]  unconstitutional you've got to support people in corporations and governments
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:06.980]  and individuals that do the right thing sometimes even in a bad organization and
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:09.540]  you've got to stand up against those that are bad and you got to have a little
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:15.780]  backbone I mean I don't think of it as any big deal in fact only think I can
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:19.460]  think of it's probably 15 examples do you guys queue up an in-game it's like
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:24.900]  towards the end I know Biggs put it one of his reports where the National Guard
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:28.100]  just comes running like 25 yards up to me it wasn't National Guard was army
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:36.260]  sorry and they have sidearms on it looked like 45s to me I thought they
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:42.860]  carried nine millimeters by now and they basically say you know you turn that
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:47.220]  camera off or I'm gonna you know basically attack you and I said no and it
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:50.620]  wasn't and after the after I stood them down and then following them yelling at
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.460]  them to their van because by then I'm quite frankly wanted to get in the fight
[02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:57.660]  nothing gets me more excited than like five six guys want to fight me I don't
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:04.180]  know why I just so you want a primitive mode I want to attack and everybody's
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:08.860]  like wow you just ran all those guys off into their van oh my gosh and it just
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:14.180]  made me realize how domesticated people are like that's a normal response of
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:18.700]  people getting in your face telling you can't film in America I don't live in
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:26.940]  North Korea I don't live in a third world help it where we have no rights at
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:31.900]  least maybe you want us to live there I don't and sure they could have probably
[02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:35.740]  ended up beating me up or shooting me but then it'd be like the Alamo just a
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:42.340]  little example of it or it'd be like Gallipoli the 300 I'm not here to try to
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:46.820]  live and try to only take care of myself I'd rather that be that way but I
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:51.460]  understand that I'm here to be attacked I'm here to be demonized I'm here to be
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:55.180]  lied about and I see people all the time they go man they were on MSNBC again
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:11:58.700]  last night I don't even tune into it to see now and they were saying that you were
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:03.140]  racist and a terrorist again and that you need to be basically arrested or and
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.620]  then I actually later see the clip I mean we can play these clips here I mean
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:09.020]  there's there's dozens and dozens and dozens their audience is so small though
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:12.380]  that I'll hear like yeah I was in a restaurant they were tagging you on the
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:17.500]  TV I saw the closed captioning or yeah I was at work they had it on CNN you name
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:21.460]  it why do they do that because they're scared ladies and gentlemen and it's
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:25.700]  not because I'm anything special it's because I'm just willing to stand up to
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:32.140]  a pack of scumbag liar crux it's criminal to say I'm involved in the
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:37.340]  Boston bombing it's criminal to set up there and say I need to be arrested
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:42.620]  folks if they can arrest me they can arrest you understand that so I'm not
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:45.340]  a per bragging about I've got this courage it isn't even courage we're
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:52.020]  being overrun I would have to have the most mindless blind dumb courage to not
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:57.380]  fight I can't help it I mean I'll use the analogy if I woke up one night there
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:00.460]  was a burglar in my room we've all seen surveillance footage of stuff like this
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:03.180]  happening people freeze and let them attack them I mean I'll go completely
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.140]  crazy and attack the person I would panic not even in my fear it's not the
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:16.140]  word it's fight or flight I would attack them because it feels good just like if
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.580]  I woke up and felt something on my face and jump out of the bed there's a
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:24.900]  spider on the bed I'm going to try to kill it because I am scared of it not
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:30.100]  because I'm a hero I told the story one time to my kids I woke up parents had a
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:33.860]  three-story house in Northwest Austin with all these bugs in it was a
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:40.380]  beautiful house upon a hilltop and his favorite house I've ever lived in but it
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:45.280]  had Texas centipedes that are like ten inches 12 inches long I'm not
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:50.940]  exaggerating it's huge biggest in the world everything's big in Texas I guess
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:56.220]  and scorpions four or five different species you'd be walking on the hall
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.900]  won't be on the ceiling just fall on you and sting you I mean it was just it was
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:05.860]  a menagerie of insects and so I lived on the bottom floor it was a skinny house
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:10.700]  it was like it was big house but point is I lived on the bottom floor and that's
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:16.100]  before they were all coming in and it was like all the time it'd be a wolf
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.740]  spider in the bed a tarantula a scorpion I started getting where I get in my
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:24.900]  bed clothes every night I was like okay you guys just get rid of this house I
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.500]  want to buy then I got out of high school moved on anyways they ended up
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:32.500]  moving as well but it was a great house but horrible with the bugs but it wasn't
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:37.140]  that I had courage I was checking the bed every night it was the opposite I
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:39.500]  didn't like bugs in my bed I wanted to do something about it
[02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:45.340]  seeming I'm fighting the globalist over I want to get rid of them I want to
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:49.260]  reverse them I want to expose them I want to overcome them I want to stop
[02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:53.580]  them but I'll tell you the story one night I was laying there I had my hand
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:56.020]  out went on the bed and I felt something on it touching touching it
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.620]  touching it there's a little lamp right here I turn it on control myself and
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:05.620]  look and there is a five inch long flesh colored millipede or centipede in my
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:10.300]  hand eating a little flat from the gym so back then I worked out really hard
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.980]  with heavy weights you know all the torn it was chewing on my callus having a
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:21.140]  little snack and I'm with and you know grabbed a book and smashed it I don't
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:24.460]  know why I'm telling that story in the analogy of the New World Order it's just
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:28.420]  it's not courage that I killed the millipede or centipede I don't know what
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:33.860]  species that was it was that I didn't like it and it was gross and it's the
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:36.780]  same thing that's why I don't want to be thanked for doing the job and I hammer
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:42.180]  this a lot because it's so important this is not something I should be
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:49.420]  thanked for this is normal I mean the president is ruling as a dictator on
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:54.340]  every issue now the borders are completely wide open the country's
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:58.020]  already being folded into a North American Union that union the Asian and
[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.460]  EU union I have clips of Bush in in-game on C-span saying they're gonna merge the
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:08.860]  three unions that's the plan since the 70s the trilateral plan that you guys
[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:12.500]  you guys ever find the very Goldwater quote Senator Goldwater about the
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.100]  trilateralist plan to overthrow the country and bring in world government
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:18.900]  with three global arms yeah we had that the other day well you have the other
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:21.940]  day I never covered it it's fine just just get it because people won't believe
[02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:29.020]  me we know the plan it'd be like if you had little kids disappearing out of
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:32.180]  their backyards and then a guy has a car wreck and the back of the van bus
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:38.500]  opened and they find photos of the missing dead kids and a handwritten
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:42.660]  journal why the guy did it and a video of why he did it and then you just he
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:46.860]  goes but it's a conspiracy and the cops let him go it's a conspiracy theory that
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:51.980]  those are photos and the cops are holding photos of the dead children that
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:55.180]  are missing and the cops okay you says a conspiracy theory thank you sir we
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:59.300]  believe it's not you we have all the proof do you understand how frustrating
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:03.500]  this is I don't want to be thanked by anybody in the middle of a total
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:07.100]  globalist takeover I'm like at the Alamos swinging a musket here with
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:11.100]  bullet wounds politically in me they're already killing my name or trying as
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:14.700]  hard as they can they're so discredited it's having a dual effect I'm like the
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:19.180]  walking dead or something politically I just keep coming but it doesn't matter
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:22.380]  because we're launching new generations of people who they haven't
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:26.500]  assassinated their names but if they want to assassinate my name before
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:32.220]  assassinating me so realized I did all this through self-preservation I did it
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:36.820]  because my instinct was to not get on my knees and suck on someone's boots while
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:41.340]  they put a gun in the back of my head I'm never going to do that and there's no
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:44.860]  excuse for people in government and corporations now to live in denial we're
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:50.380]  going into hardcore tyranny things are falling apart the public on average is
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:53.980]  very decadent and degenerate and self-serving that they're living off all
[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:58.380]  the liberty we had and don't appreciate it so they're bad as well I look in the
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:04.000]  mirror I'm bad as well I'm not on a high horse but man we can't let George
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.100]  Soros start World War 3 with the Russians let's let's go ahead and go to
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:12.700]  the top Nobel laureate just died he said we're going into World War 3 the
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:16.580]  trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:20.260]  consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:24.380]  the political governments of the United States the trilateral Commission
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.300]  represents a skillful court in an effort to seize control and consolidate the
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:34.260]  four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical what
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.980]  the trilateral Commission intends to create a worldwide economic power
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:42.340]  superior the political governments of the nation-states involved as managers
[02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:47.860]  and creditors the system they will rule the future US senator Barry Goldwater in
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:53.700]  his 1964 book with no apologies and let me give you the rest of story and every
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:59.420]  sociologist psychologist knows this when the elite are done battling with the
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:03.380]  nation-states the individual they're going to turn on each other the three
[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:06.140]  unions are going to have trade wars that's part of the plan that's how
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:09.580]  smart these guys are and then out of that global collapse this is David
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:14.020]  Rockefeller right you might want to read it you pull that up I guess out of that
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.660]  global collapse they didn't bring in the one-world government with the castle
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:24.500]  society and you know what drives it what its operating system is eugenics eugenics
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:30.380]  it's eugenical and it's of the devil I just got chills
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:35.020]  oh man these people and I you know I mean I knew this stuff was real 20 years
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:38.500]  ago but man 20 years of so much of it's now come true and then I look at the
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:41.980]  next chapters of the book that happened pretty much the way they say they will
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:47.740]  it's a little bit different I just go man whoo the people knew the dark road
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:52.940]  we're going down people be saying let's turn around right now because we're
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.980]  marching right into Mordor right into hell itself and you could smell the
[02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:01.660]  stench from the producers of the multi-award winning documentary on
[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:07.100]  novel lie Oklahoma City 1995 free mind films is proud to announce the release

[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:57.900]  blurb into Watson's article to explain that that's clearly not all of it they're
[02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:08.420]  covering up but since April 2012 he's got the spreadsheet from FedBizops 2.11
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:12.300]  billion they just keep saying 1.6 I say it's over 3 billion but kit broke it
[02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:20.380]  down 2.11 billion so 2 billion 100 plus million rounds of ammo not including
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:28.580]  blanks war in Iraq used an estimate 66 million rounds a year or 5.5 million

[02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:41.740]  feds have bought enough ammo that we know of to wage a 32 year war in Iraq or
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:45.300]  more likely here in the US and we're gonna add to that no we know and you can
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:47.780]  link to it they're training to take the American people on I mean think about
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:53.420]  that and it's not if it's true it is true that the government like it's it's
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:57.580]  Manhattan project times 10 I mean it is just tens of billions a month we know
[02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:03.660]  of is just hardening everything digging in training to fight the three
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:08.620]  percenters the gun owners the veterans what do they have plans so horrible that
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:12.180]  the people will fight back because the one plans been do the tyranny so
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:15.660]  incremental that we just kind of put up with but now it's getting so crazy what
[02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:20.220]  are they planning they're gonna come after the Patriots they're gonna start it
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:24.020]  after the federal buildings were hit today under shopping mall by the three
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:27.780]  percent group it'll be like that we were able to take out the leadership of the

[02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:36.860]  for Alex Jones he you see all the other newscasts they did it they said because
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:42.180]  he told them you know here well we took out the terrorist leader Jones on his
[02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:45.740]  way to work he claimed he was against violence but we all know the truth yes
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:50.340]  run polls also involved I mean I'm telling you folks that's whenever they
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:53.220]  blow something up who do they blame
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:58.660]  ever the cops get shot who they blame me you think that's a power trip they do
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:03.300]  that you think it's fun to have these killers looking at me well just gives me
[02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:08.420]  energy I just know I'm whistling past the graveyard whatever's gonna be done
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:12.500]  the other people have the nerve to go up against these folks because let me tell
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:15.860]  you something it isn't nerve to go up against them they're already here
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:18.740]  they're gonna get all of our innocence they're gonna keep hurting children and

[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:25.020]  they're kidnapping and all the sex rings and all the Satanism and then ask you
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:28.740]  to care about your life of course you don't and that's what being Christ like
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:32.740]  yes not that I'm Christ like in many ways I'm very worldly and I'm evil that's
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:38.940]  why God has used me and many others who were evil like Saul of Tarsus and many

[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:33.560]  communist official newspapers went to Cuba Russia you name it Frank Marshall
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:38.100]  Davis who was also a famous pornographer and clearly Joel got in the
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:42.780]  private collection of someone in shows and his mother there at the house in
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:47.660]  porn with him and this is where Obama grew up and his grandfather was you know
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.860]  best friends with this guy that's his dad so the whole Kenya thing was a
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:56.060]  distraction that's why he said in the Harvard Law Review that he was the editor
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:35:59.780]  of that he was from Kenya over and over again I mean in the official intro I'm
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:03.420]  so honored to be from born in Kenya to be here now at Harvard and shows you can
[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:07.860]  advance his wife said he was from Kenya in speeches because they were scared to
[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:12.500]  death of the Frank Marshall Davis issue then they put out fake birth certificate
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:17.060]  you name it to make us get on the case knowing they were fake with the fake
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:21.560]  typewriter font and all in were the C's the D's the A's the C's everything's the

[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:31.540]  fake period fake that's a fraud right there so it's the still a fraud but it's

[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:42.180]  by calling 888-253-3139 but now this new video and it's up on info wars.com of
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:47.660]  Obama talking about learning how to obsess over race and everything from
[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:53.620]  Frank Marshall Davis video Obama admits noted communist schooled him on white
[02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:59.460]  racism gateway pundit it's up on info wars.com here's the clip passage finally
[02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:03.660]  ends with me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather
[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:09.980]  a close friend of Graham's a black man from Kansas named Frank actually at the
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:13.900]  time fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis who had moved to Hawaii
[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:18.500]  and lived there and so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of
[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:24.180]  frustrations I'm having and and he sort of schools me on that I should get
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:29.940]  used to these frustrations so let me dig in. And he's such a communist now
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:34.580]  though he tells Africans they can't have air conditioning or a car as he rolls
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:39.700]  around like the richest king on earth but bowels every other king or clean he
[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:44.100]  sees I mean it's just it's just as they push communist ideology from the piles
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:48.460]  of gold they sit on they've stolen so Joe Gilbert dreams of my real father
[02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:52.840]  will play some video this in the background for TV viewers story of
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:57.860]  Reds and the deception I tell you how amazing suddenly Frank Marshall Davis
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:02.860]  is getting a lot of attention so kudos there we salute you on your groundbreaking
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:08.140]  research Joe. Thanks great to be back with you you know my film dreams for my
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:14.700]  real father this came out in 2012 and it's just fascinating to me to watch
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:19.740]  how long it takes for people to really pay attention and realize it it's coming
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:24.580]  out more and more the influence of Frank Marshall Davis is undeniable he had a
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:29.660]  profound ideological impact and I can talk about that but all the research is
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:33.980]  in and I think I've convinced a lot of people and demonstrated that Frank
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:38.300]  Marshall Davis was Barack Obama's real biological father it's her she did
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:43.700]  lesbian porn everything yeah and he then became his ideological mentor there's
[02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:49.300]  absolutely no question he says it the Kenya story is simply a cover story
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:55.340]  because he knows Americans would be uncomfortable if he said my father was a
[02:38:55.340 --> 02:39:01.500]  Soviet agent when doctorated me into the Marxist ideology and I am wanting to
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:05.020]  come and live in the White House so I can help spread this all over the country
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:09.820]  that wouldn't work so he had to say my father was a goat herder from Kenya and
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:13.580]  I'm gonna bring people together so the reality is that Obama is what we call a
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:19.100]  red diaper baby this means the child of a Communist Party USA member and I want
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:22.940]  to tell you Davis was not only a Communist Party member he was a
[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:27.820]  Communist propagandist and he also acted as a Soviet agent people don't
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:34.060]  understand this he went from Chicago to Hawaii in 1948 on the orders of the
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:39.060]  Kremlin to help start a strike and organize the dock workers with the goal
[02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:42.460]  of it's taking over the Hawaiian government and expelling US Naval
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:46.220]  Forces and he had massive funding I was able to start major newspapers you name
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:52.540]  it that's correct so first he started a strike for six months the goal was to get
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:56.980]  rid of US Naval forces and allow for Soviet expansion in Asia this strike he
[02:39:56.980 --> 02:40:00.940]  organized eventually failed and he went on to become a Communist propagandist and
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:08.500]  writer for years and then as you can see in 1960 he fathered the current
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:11.900]  president of the United States who has hidden this background and that's the
[02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:17.140]  profound manipulation of the electorate is he tried to make people think his
[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:22.900]  family was from Kenya rather than the reality that he was a radical and the
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:27.660]  child of a Communist Party member and he was indoctrinated into this ideology
[02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:33.420]  which calls for the elimination of the United States and we played into it you
[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:36.700]  didn't know I want to go back briefly this is so incredibly of new info on how
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:39.740]  you with others discovered this I mean he really you deserve a Pulitzer prize
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:42.580]  for this I'm not just kissing your butt I don't say that's a lot of our guests
[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:46.900]  because I even bought a hook line and sinker it was designed for me for me and
[02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:52.220]  Dr. Corsi and others because I mean look he says in the Harvard review every
[02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:56.260]  issue you know hey I'm the editor I came from Kenya was born there it's
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:00.100]  amazing I could be here you know as the guy he says it in literature he does it
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:05.820]  in book proposals he does it his wife says it in speeches in 2007 and then
[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:09.100]  we're just going it's a fake birth certificate you say you're from Kenya
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:13.300]  we're being attacked the media will never play the clips of why we're saying
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:18.140]  he's from Kenya and then the whole thing was a setup he was really the son of
[02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:22.580]  one of the top communist agents in the US and then his grandfather was at
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:28.620]  Middle East CIA and his mother a sex operative I mean you can't make that up
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:37.460]  it's a the saddest the saddest story is that America was deceived people sent
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:41.860]  their kids to the army people worked all their lives to protect the right to vote
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:47.660]  and people went and voted in an election with a complete deception Obama
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:51.820]  lied about his personal background but he also lied about his political goals
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:56.940]  he said Obama care is not a tax I'm gonna cut the deficit in half he never
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:01.060]  intended to do any of these things it was a complete lie following the
[02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:05.500]  ideology to use a big lie to take power and then once you take power use the
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:10.140]  tools of state like the IRS the control of information to keep a permanent hold
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:15.940]  on power so the tragedy is far beyond Obama's family it's what has happened to
[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:19.740]  the United States and how he's degrading our relationships and our allies
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:23.580]  around the world the United States cannot exist in the world as a lone
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:28.260]  democracy between two oceans we need strong allies who share our values in
[02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:33.900]  Western Europe Israel Australia Japan and he's used the power of state to degrade
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:39.180]  our alliances well he won't let us have one gold mine one copper mine he's he's
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:43.460]  shutting down power plants every week China's opening new ones that he's
[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:47.780]  raising taxes he's opening the borders completely saying we'll pay for everybody
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:52.580]  free I mean he is destroying the country I just can't believe that the elite are
[02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:56.780]  allowing him to do this because I mean the elite are corrupt but man I mean is
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:43:00.820]  this a communist double-cross of the robber barons what's going on well
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:04.620]  Obama's election was not a sudden political phenomena it really was the
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:09.260]  result of an American socialist movement that has been quietly infiltrating the
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:16.300]  US economy media entertainment for decades so Obama was able to to take
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:20.820]  power with the cover of all these people who simply the media rather than
[02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:25.300]  investigate his story I've been to Hawaii twice which is twice as much as all
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:30.260]  the media combined they simply repeated his story my father's a goat herder
[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:33.660]  from Kenya I'm gonna bring people together the reality he should have said
[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:36.780]  which they would have brought if they even asked him is what was your
[02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:40.700]  relationship with Frank Marshall Davis what was the impact on you why did you
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:45.420]  follow in his footsteps all the way back to Chicago where you teamed up with
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:52.180]  your real father's buddy Vernon Jarrett the father-in-law Valerie Jarrett working
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:55.740]  for a communist news and of course his dad had been in Chicago right actually
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:59.340]  started that newspaper didn't he well Frank Marshall Davis was a Chicago
[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:05.660]  journalist he joined the Communist Party in 1932 only 15 years after the Bolshevik
[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:09.620]  Revolution he was one of the original black Bolsheviks along with Paul
[02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:14.780]  Robeson and the communists manipulated journalists and black people into
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:18.580]  thinking that if you follow communism will eliminate racism they didn't
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:23.900]  realize that if you follow communism you eliminate everybody not just not just
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:30.220]  you know racism but everyone becomes impoverished and the societies end up
[02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:34.620]  decaying biologically and economically so Davis was one of the original black
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:39.540]  Bolsheviks and as I said he acted on behalf of the Soviet Union as a Soviet
[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:43.340]  agent went to Hawaii how profound is it that the president of the United States
[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:47.780]  is the son of a Soviet agent and don't think that the Kremlin and the Russians
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:52.980]  don't know who Obama is and they would not use that against him knowing that
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:58.340]  he's keeping such a profound secret and that's why certain elements of the CIA
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:02.460]  and the Ford Foundation that's helped funding his whole life like him there
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:06.140]  too because they can use that and control him as well yeah the president
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:11.740]  United States cannot have a big secret like this we know that Bill Clinton was
[02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:16.220]  speaking to Monica Lewinsky from a cell phone from the White House and there's
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:20.980]  no doubt that that could easily have been intercepted by Chinese agents other
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:25.980]  foreign agents and used against the president as blackmail so Obama has set
[02:45:25.980 --> 02:45:29.900]  himself up and set off up the whole country with his false narrative that
[02:45:29.900 --> 02:45:35.060]  he's the son of a Kenyan goat herder when in fact he's a red diaper baby of
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:40.180]  the son of a radical American communist who taught him and indoctrinated him
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.860]  into a radical ideology and I think in my film I show that he followed in his
[02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:49.380]  father's footsteps to Occidental to study with Marxist professors he went to
[02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:54.060]  New York to go to socialist scholars conferences he hooked up with Bill
[02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:58.860]  Ayers and went to Chicago back where his father started in the communist movement
[02:45:58.860 --> 02:46:04.220]  and Obama became a trainer for ten years for acorn any road you can see the
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:08.180]  whole thing let me ask you this you're really smart guy and I respect your
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:12.300]  opinion Joe Gilbert the filmmaker joins us I get dreams from my real father and
[02:46:12.300 --> 02:46:16.060]  there's no place like utopia both available at info or store.com we're on
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:19.260]  his side as well just just support the filmmaker support this operation as
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:22.900]  well show this to your friends and family I mean if this doesn't wake him up
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:26.340]  nothing will it's really wakes a lot of people up when they see the irrefutable
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:30.260]  evidence that his dad is a communist agent for a pornographer and that his
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:35.460]  mom is in Lesbo porn you know it just shows how compromised he is forget the
[02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:39.740]  moral judgment about the stuff just just that alone let me ask you this how do
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:42.980]  you think Obama's doing what do you think he'll try in his last two years in
[02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:48.340]  office where do you see this country going because I don't see them not going
[02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:56.300]  for broke as bad as he really is. Just like his other predecessors in the
[02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:01.540]  weather underground and SDS don't forget Bill Ayers became a mentor later in
[02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:06.340]  1969 Bernadine Dorn with the weather underground declared war on the United
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:11.900]  States I think Obama is taking a chapter out of that book and he is
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:17.500]  declaring war in the United States without actually saying it just like
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:22.380]  they had a war against the cops kill the cops this was the mantra back in the
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:27.620]  late 60s. George Soros again 33 million to fund the with people chanting kill
[02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:31.380]  the cops well what is their end game this is the original movement all you
[02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:35.100]  have to do is look back to the communist movement of the weather underground
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:41.940]  prairie fire the goal is to eliminate the American middle class and destroy the
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:47.380]  foundation of the capitalist system they know that church-going hard-working
[02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:51.780]  people will never buy into this progressive nonsense so their their goal
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:56.180]  has always been to eliminate the middle class raise taxes give away their
[02:47:56.180 --> 02:48:00.780]  health care to poor and illegals flood the country with immigrants degrade our
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:05.660]  position abroad do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:11.300]  supports the free market system and that is the only threat to they're having a
[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:16.340]  permanent hold on power the goal is to keep a permanent hold on power and the
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:19.620]  cloud and heavens almost here we've been maneuvered towards total bankruptcy
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:23.500]  we're beyond that they haven't pulled the plug yet they've done the kids down
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:27.940]  they are just distracting us with every crazy issue you can imagine the great
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:33.820]  commas are Michelle tells our kids what to eat Joel I know you got a big breaking
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:36.620]  news story that'll be out tonight or tomorrow at world net daily can you tell
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:41.580]  us what it pertains to yeah I'll give you a hint I've developed
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:47.300]  relationships over the last year or two with close Obama confidants and
[02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:54.140]  relatives and I will be dropping a major interview with a major Obama family
[02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:58.820]  member tonight and you should see tomorrow world net daily unless there's

[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:15.180]  the Kenyan family people who read the news you kind of get the picture that
[02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:18.940]  Obama made a very big deal out of the Kenyan connection out of all these
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:24.060]  relatives in order to get elected once he was in office he never talks about
[02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:29.940]  them again and never has anything to do with them and the Kenyan
[02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:35.900]  Obamas have been paying attention to this and wondering why this strange
[02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:39.780]  strange behavior his whole life he actually interacted with him a lot he
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:44.180]  visited Kenya several times he hosted the Kenyan relatives and once he
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:49.180]  achieved the presidency all of a sudden you never hear about them nor do they
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:53.300]  hear from him and we're gonna find out tomorrow what's really going on if it

[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:08.940]  control the market dry up supply and the article has now been beefed up it's on
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:15.820]  dredgerport.com it's going extremely viral right now they are buying on top
[02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:22.140]  of the two plus billion rounds they're confirmed to have bought another 62
[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:29.780]  million rounds of AR-15 ammo for Homeland Security not the military they
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:32.180]  claim is for the border patrol even though they're rationing the border
[02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:38.980]  patrol and not letting them have it but of course experts have told Michael
[02:55:38.980 --> 02:55:43.980]  Savage and others and it's actually a plan to shut off the general public being
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:47.100]  able to have access to it and cause shortages which has already happened and
[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:52.220]  they've also called for the ATF to do similar things we've got a breakdown just
[02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:56.020]  on the fed biz ops side there's a bunch of other places they get the ammo it's
[02:55:56.020 --> 02:56:03.260]  two billion one hundred eighteen million two thousand rounds of bullets 40 cal
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:07.900]  seven point six two three nine nine millimeter three fifty seven six three
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:12.540]  oh eight Remington twelve gauge really seven sig and two two three Remington but
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:15.220]  I know about a bunch of big purchases that are hundreds of other weird caliber
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:20.060]  so that's just just just some of what kit found it's way over that that's enough
[02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:23.220]  ammo that we just showed to kill around 30 percent of the world's population
[02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:27.900]  furthermore US soldiers were shooting around 5.5 million rounds of ammunition
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:32.060]  per month during the Iraq war 66 million rounds annually using that figure the
[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:38.700]  feds have stopped holding up ammo the past two years to fight a 32 year war and
[02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:44.660]  that story is up on info wars calm and prison planet calm let's make sure we

[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:58.540]  everything it can to shut us down to shut you down and to kill memes and to
[02:56:58.540 --> 02:57:03.500]  not let us dominate we're still getting bigger moving forward but I mean we got
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:09.300]  to get a lot bigger to really blow up the Death Star politically but we're
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:12.380]  not the only operation out there I mean we're bringing the enemy down we're
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:14.940]  hurting them bad as well they're moving so quick right now they're trying to
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:19.300]  play catch up but I'm just not here to do this in half measures and go half
[02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:27.500]  speed I'll be honest I went probably 95 speed until about 10 years ago but I
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:33.180]  didn't want to be a major leader I just out of a thing of non-arrogance and I
[02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:36.820]  thought kind of small and I saw much success we had about 10 years ago I
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:40.940]  said no the enemy attacks me they hate me people want me to fail I'm going all
