[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.280]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:38.280 --> 00:47.640]  so much for joining us already Monday the 19th day of May 2014 and we're going to be live here
[00:47.640 --> 00:55.560]  for the next three hours if you go up to drudgereport.com I still believe it's there correct if you go
[00:55.560 --> 01:02.080]  to drudgereport.com right in the middle column is a story that went up Friday night that I thought
[01:02.080 --> 01:09.960]  was so important that I continued to keep it up on the front page of info wars.com till last night
[01:09.960 --> 01:16.680]  and I'm going to ask and I rarely do that I'm going to ask the writers to repost that red
[01:16.680 --> 01:24.760]  link to the front page of info wars.com right now but right now you can find it at drudgereport.com
[01:24.760 --> 01:32.680]  in the middle of the middle column police now armed for war against returning veterans and
[01:32.680 --> 01:41.800]  this five minute video clip from Fox News in Morgan County Indiana illustrates everything we've
[01:41.800 --> 01:46.680]  been talking about and of course it's been said that one man dies it's a tragedy 10,000 dies
[01:46.680 --> 01:52.880]  a statistic to quote Joe Stalin we can have all the army documents in the world that are
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.640]  admitted to be declassified and real with the military training to confiscate our guns and
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.160]  arrest libertarians conservatives veterans gun owners but when you actually have them on the
[02:04.160 --> 02:10.960]  news rolling it out like it's a good thing saying the next war won't be with the muslim radicals
[02:10.960 --> 02:19.080]  it won't be with Russia it will be with the veterans and they sell it like it's a good thing
[02:19.080 --> 02:26.040]  this is something directly out of the running man and then you see the dramas the sitcoms the
[02:26.040 --> 02:32.440]  movies the cultural rollout is who are patriots that like George Washington private property the
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.880]  second amendment family values men or men women or women terrorist terrorist does I believe is
[02:38.880 --> 02:47.800]  the Spanish way of saying it so mom and apple pie will get you in gitmo being for standard
[02:47.800 --> 02:56.920]  prosperity standard what works proven is evil being good is evil so they're they're making
[02:56.920 --> 03:01.480]  the segue I was the first to tell you about how they roll out wide al-qaeda I was the first to
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.200]  tell you they were going to mesh it with the military veterans I was the first to give you
[03:05.200 --> 03:10.720]  the documents people couldn't believe it folks I know the enemy I'm not bragging I'm saying you
[03:10.720 --> 03:18.840]  need to listen to me this is a real foreign collaborator occupation those are not words that
[03:18.840 --> 03:25.960]  is not rhetoric that is real so obviously we're going to talk about this because the story broke
[03:25.960 --> 03:30.920]  after I got off the air friday kind of got buried over the weekend drudge wisely at the mighty
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.680]  drudge report calm waited till sunday night into Monday morning to put it up knowing it's important
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.280]  needs to get attention this story is big and it's not that long of a story but it gives
[03:42.280 --> 03:47.000]  some background and it ties into everything so we're going to cover that because here's the
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.280]  deal if we cause a public debate about this if we force a discussion about how the veterans
[03:54.280 --> 04:01.480]  are quietly being demonized and that a civil war is being prepared like emperor palpatine
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.680]  wanting to wipe off the jedi in episode three I mean that's literally what's being prepared
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.560]  they use the military to set up the world government believing that they're fighting
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.400]  tyranny worldwide they set up the world government now they know the military won't go along with
[04:15.400 --> 04:22.720]  the final tyranny they've got to have order 66 executed on them execute order number 66
[04:22.720 --> 04:30.520]  literally and by the way George Lucas said I'm using a popular cheesy movie as a way to
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.360]  illustrate this he said it can film festival and that came out in 99 or 2000 whatever it
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.320]  was he said oh 2001 is it that's an episode three came up that's right he said this is
[04:40.320 --> 04:46.480]  how the world really works I wrote this to reflect what's currently happening 911 had
[04:46.480 --> 04:52.240]  just happened so I guess 99 2001 2003 when it came out check we'll check the date the
[04:52.240 --> 04:56.280]  point is that's basically what's going on and they're getting ready to have a civil war
[04:56.280 --> 05:03.160]  against the military stay with us the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a
[05:03.160 --> 05:08.840]  long time but now they're expanding making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.520]  all the major networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL
[05:14.520 --> 05:19.440]  has become a political weapon against the second amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC tells
[05:19.440 --> 05:23.120]  us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of private
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.240]  idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.520]  that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we
[05:31.520 --> 05:37.120]  are not the alternative media we are the true media the establishment dinosaur press is

[08:55.680 --> 09:02.080]  to discredit it and they are making their move to fully gut the u.s. borders entirely
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.600]  and complete our journey into slavery with a giant voting block that is a lap dog to

[09:49.160 --> 09:56.280]  very same special interest i know you know that and it's blue blood republicans like
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.320]  him that have helped destroy this country and again i know i'm stating the obvious it's
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.680]  just that no other country in the world can you go there and have a baby and have it paid
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.480]  for by the state nowhere in the world can you be a foreigner and come to the country
[10:09.480 --> 10:16.040]  and get free tuition or in state tuition there is a giant magnet to bring poor unskilled
[10:16.040 --> 10:23.600]  immigrants here to drive down wages and politically balkanize and break up the country the globalist
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.720]  get rid of nations putting them into larger super states and then break the super states
[10:28.720 --> 10:36.880]  up along non-continuous sub region lines that is the management system of the romans and
[10:36.880 --> 10:43.120]  then later the venetians who then basically moved operations to what is now the uk and
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.280]  they've all written books on the subject going back to macchiavelli 500 years ago this is
[10:48.280 --> 10:56.040]  public history for anyone who is informed i don't know about nfl football i don't know
[10:56.040 --> 11:03.360]  about the latest dancing with the stars information i do know about contract law i do know about
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.960]  admiralty law i do know about military history i do know about political systems and how
[11:08.960 --> 11:15.000]  things really work not how we're told they work but how they really work and it doesn't
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.360]  mean i'm a master of this knowledge because as you approach becoming what you would think
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.480]  of being a master you discover that you're always actually a student and the world the
[11:25.480 --> 11:36.400]  universe is the teacher god is the master and this country is going to be taught and
[11:36.400 --> 11:41.240]  bent over the knee of the universe and this planet is and is going to go through some
[11:41.240 --> 11:50.040]  extreme pain because we are repeating history in the worst of ways twisted with it is a
[11:50.040 --> 12:00.160]  high-tech system of technocratic malice and anti-human viciousness that is unrivaled in
[12:00.160 --> 12:09.040]  the annals of known history on this terra firma on this orbiting planetoid in deep space
[12:09.040 --> 12:16.040]  off the arm of the milky way galaxy in our star system just like to point that out where
[12:16.040 --> 12:22.040]  we are right now and remember that tv and movie stars and people showing off and acting
[12:22.040 --> 12:29.720]  cool is the matrix and that realizing you're in the universe and the universal time flow
[12:29.720 --> 12:37.920]  of the space time continuum is to exist is to be conscious and realize in a zen way that
[12:37.920 --> 12:45.720]  fully incorporates into my christian beliefs that we are a moment in forever that is forever
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.120]  think about how incredible that is that you ever had consciousness and ever had a thought
[12:51.120 --> 13:02.960]  and could ever create is the fulcrum of life itself and of conscious sentient being it
[13:02.960 --> 13:06.920]  hit me so hard last night as I was laying down to go to bed and I took my children to
[13:06.920 --> 13:19.160]  sleep that art and beauty and virtue and I know I'm stating the obvious but but it hit
[13:19.160 --> 13:25.880]  me so hard is the answer to evil if we will just be loving if we will just be virtuous
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.720]  if we will just be honorable if we will just be strong if we will just not be cowards if
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.040]  we will believe in others as well and believe that they can be good and believe that they
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.000]  can be honorable we will find each other in this world and we will come together kindred
[13:42.000 --> 13:50.040]  spirits and build a better world we have to love each other and we have to care about
[13:50.040 --> 13:58.200]  the innocent but we also have to have the will as you can go too far and submit to corruption
[13:58.200 --> 14:04.800]  and evil truly good people have to stand against evil and even though we don't want the power
[14:04.800 --> 14:12.080]  even though we don't desire the stage we must take the stage or be supplanted and blown
[14:12.080 --> 14:21.600]  out the airlock of history by the enemy PLA troops are sitting on China-Vietnam border
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.600]  looks like China could basically invade there's all sorts of confrontations going on in the
[14:26.600 --> 14:32.560]  ocean and oil rigs I'm going to be breaking that down it's huge a quote a lot more terror
[14:32.560 --> 14:37.720]  attacks are coming our way says former NSA chief as they hype fear ahead of the total
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.520]  police state takeover Kerry tells Yale grads to keep faith in government every time I see
[14:42.520 --> 14:48.600]  one of these speeches Obama or Hillary or Kerry or Michelle Obama gives a speech it's
[14:48.600 --> 14:55.280]  keep the faith it's like a Baptist church or Catholic church going keep the faith brethren
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.400]  believe in God God will not forsake you but this is literally keep the faith in the state
[15:00.400 --> 15:07.440]  keep the faith we'll need a few good men to keep the faith this is really sick you can
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.280]  debate the existence of God all day but let me tell you something there's no debating
[15:11.280 --> 15:19.080]  that nine times out of ten the state ends up delivering nightmare systems broken systems
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.600]  but in most cases when it delivers a nightmare it's on purpose it's not broken it's not on
[15:23.600 --> 15:33.080]  accident then it's Waila is broken Cuba is broken North Korea is broken Communist China
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.960]  and the United States run by the globalist are not broken they're working just like they're
[15:38.960 --> 15:45.560]  supposed to dehumanizing so all that and more is coming up we have the niece of Dr. Martin
[15:45.560 --> 15:50.960]  Luther King joining us to talk about the culture of death and how the black communities
[15:50.960 --> 15:57.920]  have been tested and targeted as the beta test for virtual annihilation and if you don't
[15:57.920 --> 16:03.440]  believe 52% of blacks never getting out of mama's womb isn't a mass genocide I don't
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.480]  know what is and for me that's the litmus test of all these people shooting their mouths
[16:09.480 --> 16:14.600]  off that if you don't like socialist death panels and Obamacare you're a racist or if
[16:14.600 --> 16:21.400]  you don't turn your guns in you're a racist all of this is a total desperate panic move
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.760]  to create racial division and race war in this country because the globalist are on
[16:25.760 --> 16:32.000]  their heels right now and are running around like foaming at the mouse psychopaths trying
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.680]  to destroy everything they can and blow up the country politically and financially and
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.720]  culturally and spiritually before it all goes down that's their exit strategy at scorched

[24:32.160 --> 24:35.480]  a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge
[24:35.480 --> 24:44.000]  to to build IEDs and and to defeat law enforcement okay let's stop right there everything that
[24:44.000 --> 24:53.880]  that Indiana SWAT team commander in Morgan County just said is a lie we weren't seeing
[24:53.880 --> 25:05.560]  of the violence before that we're seeing now the violent crime rate is down 52% since 1992
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.560]  the Justice Department saw numbers and those are very accurate numbers because they're
[25:08.560 --> 25:15.160]  compiled off of homicides and stabbings and shooting and they're amongst with statisticians
[25:15.160 --> 25:21.420]  worldwide amongst the best in the world the FBI's been doing it since the 20s when jay
[25:21.420 --> 25:27.400]  groover started it the violent crime rate folks I don't need to believe the statistics
[25:27.400 --> 25:34.000]  I grew up in Dallas in the 80s where there would be 20 people dead some days in the summer
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.840]  I grew up visiting family in in downtown Dallas for church in a middle class area and hearing
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.200]  gunshots when I was a little kid and went to DC for the first time I was about eight
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.200]  we had a balcony in our hotel and went outside and heard shots and then heard shots the next
[25:48.200 --> 26:02.320]  night the crime peak in this country was in the 1980s but again this is a total rollout
[26:02.320 --> 26:07.600]  with no troops planning IEDs none of that happening the only event was Timothy McVeigh
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.480]  in 1995 total government operation we know who did it the names of the people from police
[26:13.480 --> 26:18.440]  officers they weren't able to kill they did kill some of them doctors and police officers
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.040]  Terrence Yeking and others that saw the feds the other cops and people that worked there
[26:23.040 --> 26:30.920]  spoke out before they could be killed Don Browning head of the K9 unit I'm naming names
[26:30.920 --> 26:35.800]  Oklahoma City PD told by the FBI you keep talking we're gonna kill you and your wife
[26:35.800 --> 26:43.000]  you've been on this show video Skype Jane Graham HUD saw the feds planting the bombs
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.080]  and said what are you doing oh we're working on the phone system because she would use
[26:46.080 --> 26:55.240]  the access stairs for exercise oh she saw McVeigh with known FBI agents she saw on the
[26:55.240 --> 27:03.240]  newsletter you understand that we know who put the building up I'm risking my life even
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.760]  bringing this up but I don't care the truth is what matters I'm not backing down so they
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.240]  got one event to claim all the veterans are going to kill everybody because one that
[27:11.240 --> 27:14.760]  did something really if a guy with red hair goes out and kills people are all redhead
[27:14.760 --> 27:18.740]  suspects or if a black person kills somebody or all black people suspect or of a woman
[27:18.740 --> 27:25.840]  kills somebody or of a Catholic or of a Buddhist kill somebody or I am sick of this authoritarianism
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.400]  where you're all guilty because someone else said something veterans statistically have
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.640]  some of the lowest crime rates out there and everybody knows that they do have a higher
[27:35.640 --> 27:41.720]  tendency for mass shootings but it's still extremely low mass shootings only kill 167
[27:41.720 --> 27:49.320]  people in 2013 more than half of them were gangs shooting each other honey bees killed
[27:49.320 --> 27:56.200]  almost 300 look it up but we're going to play pretty much the whole newscast and I want
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.800]  to talk about it and get into all the other news but this this article is up on info wars
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.040]  dot com police departments everywhere getting DHS training the last six years and they tell
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.560]  them look it up in the training manuals that are online it's not a question of if but when
[28:11.560 --> 28:19.880]  you will be hit you will be hit the veterans are going to kill you now I'm going to say
[28:19.880 --> 28:25.880]  this 10 years before Vietnam on record they were doing jungle training for Southeast Asia
[28:25.880 --> 28:32.920]  because they could tell the endo French we're going to get thrown out they were out by 1960
[28:32.920 --> 28:40.160]  the US was really there from 60 to 64 covertly 5000 troops died we know of then 58,000 died
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.480]  after that until 1975 when they officially started the whole thing with the Gulf of Tonkin
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.600]  false flag they start these with false flags it's declassified Gulf of Tonkin to get us
[28:49.600 --> 28:58.320]  into Vietnam was stage and ladies and gentlemen a more than a decade before they got ready
[28:58.320 --> 29:01.960]  for the desert storm and all that they were already get ready to set up Saddam by telling
[29:01.960 --> 29:04.800]  to invade Kuwait and the rest of it and they ran a wreck war they were getting ready for
[29:04.800 --> 29:11.280]  desert war and now for the decade it happened under Bush but it's already under Obama they
[29:11.280 --> 29:23.640]  are now preparing for war with gun owners veterans pro-lifers libertarians Americans
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.960]  good people and so we're here covering this to force a debate about it because if there's
[29:28.960 --> 29:34.120]  a debate about this they're not going to be able to do it but it will be they will stage
[29:34.120 --> 29:40.040]  a false flag and then that will be preceded by the quote civil war they're going to blow
[29:40.040 --> 29:43.680]  up schools you name it blame on the liberty movement then they're going to come after
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.720]  us in a purge then a real civil war is going to start I think it'll kill probably 300,000

[34:04.640 --> 34:09.920]  across the board we've held them back they're at least a decade behind their own globalist
[34:09.920 --> 34:15.040]  documents by brzezinski kissinger and others they're trying to accelerate their program
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.760]  right now and finish it and they're now operating in a race to the finish line because they realize
[34:20.760 --> 34:26.340]  if they fail they're going down one hundred percent even though they have a low probability
[34:26.340 --> 34:33.680]  of succeeding even midterm they are now racing because it's the only chance they've got
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.640]  and you can see the massive preparation for false flag terror attacks that are staged
[34:39.640 --> 34:46.880]  in this country to be blamed on the liberty movement to then launch a purge against the
[34:46.880 --> 34:55.840]  resistance against the counter revolutionaries that's you and I
[34:55.840 --> 35:00.120]  once that launches the plan is to have the liberty movement wipe out the military and
[35:00.120 --> 35:07.000]  police and vice versa this is what the globalists want do you understand that ladies and gentlemen
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.440]  we cannot let it get to this we've got to stop this program we stopped the open arming
[35:14.440 --> 35:24.400]  and bombing for al-qaeda in Syria we stopped the public turnover of Egypt al-qaeda we have
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.640]  been stopping a lot of their operations not just us here in America but others worldwide

[35:37.120 --> 35:44.640]  they think they can get away with it and I want the globalists to know your own people
[35:44.640 --> 35:50.000]  who compartmentalized listen to this show because they recognize what we talk about
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.320]  here is true as prima facie around its face because they're there every day seeing what
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.280]  I'm talking about going on internally they know I know when I'm talking about the navy
[36:02.280 --> 36:09.640]  shields the army special forces the CIA people the defense intelligence people the defense

[36:20.640 --> 36:24.840]  most of these people are good men and women who actually got into their jobs for the right
[36:24.840 --> 36:34.200]  reasons and you've been operating under compartmentalization I'm here to blow the compartments
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.880]  the compartments are good to fight an outside enemy in a time of war the compartments are
[36:39.880 --> 36:45.640]  bringing the nation down allowing the disease to quietly spread house to house building
[36:45.640 --> 36:51.520]  to building facility to facility we have got to decompartmentalize this whole operation
[36:51.520 --> 37:00.440]  right now and blow this operation right now the globalist are the most unmitigatedly sickening
[37:00.440 --> 37:10.080]  wicked evil warmongering anti human pieces of unspeakable filth to the point of words
[37:10.080 --> 37:20.720]  cannot describe the pit of hell stench that emanates from them spiritually if you have
[37:20.720 --> 37:29.720]  any common sense any life force any will to survive any will to thrive any will for justice
[37:29.720 --> 37:38.200]  any will for light you should set your full will against the enemy and I'm telling you
[37:38.200 --> 37:43.240]  if you just set your will against evil and ask for God's guidance even don't believe
[37:43.240 --> 37:51.800]  in God you have to ask God in your heart and I have to ask you have to give permission
[37:51.800 --> 37:57.560]  you have to make a decision and just say I recognize darkness from light I recognize
[37:57.560 --> 38:06.920]  good from bad I want to be good to quote judge smells from caddyshack do you want to be
[38:06.920 --> 38:14.600]  good Danny I want to be good sir good Danny very good and we can make jokes about that

[38:20.000 --> 38:29.240]  crook that's what that's all about we will lose everything ladies and gentlemen in fact
[38:29.240 --> 38:33.360]  I love that new promo piece that an activist I've seen for more than a decade on the streets
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.000]  of Austin with info or signs and anti-floride signs Scottish John cut Buckley will you get
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.720]  that loaded in the computer so I can play that before we go to break I'd like to play
[38:43.720 --> 38:49.200]  Scottish John because I think he says it all I told him in Jacobson just cut whatever ad
[38:49.200 --> 38:56.520]  you guys come up with and they come up with a much better promo than I would come up with
[38:56.520 --> 39:02.160]  he says in that great Scottish accent we better get involved now we're going to lose everything
[39:02.160 --> 39:09.080]  and everybody knows in their gut we're going to lose everything the military has been training
[39:09.080 --> 39:16.200]  the police so the police can then train to take on the military and you have the hypothetical
[39:16.200 --> 39:23.840]  argument that well the military could turn against us and he is going to that's a self
[39:23.840 --> 39:29.120]  fulfilling prophecy you could say the police are going to turn on us they have all this
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.560]  training and you know what they are in the big departments because they're under homeland
[39:33.560 --> 39:39.200]  security ladies and gentlemen local SWAT teams in big cities are already under homeland security
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.880]  for quote special events you're going to aid the secret service of the presidents here
[39:43.880 --> 39:47.480]  and then it expands out to everything else being infrastructure protection to where your
[39:47.480 --> 39:53.080]  local police have been internationalized not just federalized but I want to play this clip
[39:53.080 --> 39:59.600]  from the story up at rogerport.com in the middle column police now armed for war against
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.600]  returning veterans and again in the training manuals that we published that are in the
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.840]  article I'm going to have Watson add some of our previous stories in this just stories
[40:08.840 --> 40:14.880]  get a lot of attention they say it's not a question of if but when we're going to have
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.440]  this war with the veterans and then you learn the Marines the army all of them that's the
[40:19.440 --> 40:22.720]  main mission and what was it three years ago responding to one of our articles that was
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.560]  on Drudge big sis came out and said we don't apologize it was an AP we don't we don't apologize
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.640]  headline was DHS head stands behind controversial report labeling veterans number one threat
[40:35.640 --> 40:42.680]  I'm going to explain this again they're openly saying veterans are the number one terror
[40:42.680 --> 40:49.680]  threat when all the statistics say the opposite and then the globalist are the ones running
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.720]  al-qaeda launching chemical attacks blaming it on Syria getting caught trying to attack
[40:53.720 --> 41:01.760]  military bases in Egypt to overthrow the government our government is so criminal folks it publicly
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.520]  funds al-qaeda now like you're so stupid you won't figure that out well you know what litmus
[41:06.520 --> 41:12.480]  test Ted Cruz Rand Paul both get up and say our government runs al-qaeda now it's evil
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.120]  we shouldn't be part of it what happens they can't launch the full attack they have to
[41:16.120 --> 41:22.240]  back off because they told the truth all you do is did Ted Cruz and Rand Paul get discredited
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.040]  for saying our government runs al-qaeda no they got carried on people's shoulders because
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.840]  the military already knew it didn't want to be part of it that sounds crazy that our government
[41:30.840 --> 41:38.480]  runs al-qaeda but it's true my grandmother a few years ago I grew up knowing this guy
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.400]  lived down the street he was a guy with really bad arthritis and a wheelchair and some neighbor
[41:43.400 --> 41:47.480]  got in his face and slapped him around or something so the next day he came out with
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.520]  a gun and shot him and says oh you know where's where's where's such and such oh he's in prison
[41:52.520 --> 41:58.240]  now you know he shot and killed the neighbor it just happened well it's kind of like well
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.840]  our government just runs al-qaeda or oh they just found dead bodies in Bob's backyard yes
[42:02.840 --> 42:11.120]  it's crazy but it's going on so let's go ahead and play the head of the SWAT team in Morgan
[42:11.120 --> 42:20.760]  County Indiana sergeant Dan Downing saying we're going to be patrolling the streets get
[42:20.760 --> 42:27.040]  everybody acclimated that's one I see these trucks all the time in Austin DHS has them
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.920]  you know to our day's evaders credit he says Austin doesn't need any of those well you've
[42:30.920 --> 42:41.200]  got some other smaller ones but DHS has got him here in town I see him driving around
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.600]  those are meant to go to your house and burn your house down they're meant to go and dig
[42:45.600 --> 42:52.960]  people out folks they're not meant when you go on the defense if you actually got attacked
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.280]  I mean why not give Abrams tanks you know the military knows how to drive one why a bunch
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.080]  of veterans and go to an armory and take it over and get tanks we better get rid of the
[43:01.080 --> 43:07.320]  armories see they're saying we can't trust each other watch everyone homeland securities
[43:07.320 --> 43:12.520]  for the veterans the one group they know just like schmendley butler who's going to stand
[43:12.520 --> 43:20.480]  up to a domestic takeover and say no they have analyzed where the threat comes new alternative
[43:20.480 --> 43:25.280]  media info wars dot com world net daily drudge report dot com things like that openly demonized
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.880]  by the globalist talk radio they don't control they want to shut that down the free internet
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.640]  state government the john warren defense authorization act says their training to take on the american
[43:35.640 --> 43:42.040]  people and to quote takeover governorships and legislatures the feds are openly saying
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.280]  we're prepared to take over your states and take over your city councils and we're going
[43:46.280 --> 43:53.880]  to run things they're prepared for the feds to give orders so evil that the american people
[43:53.880 --> 43:58.280]  little put up with anything are going to stand up and say no and our state houses are going
[43:58.280 --> 44:06.880]  to say no and what are they going to say no to total military occupation gun confiscation
[44:06.880 --> 44:11.920]  they know there's already county commissioners and mayors in multiple places and what was
[44:11.920 --> 44:19.520]  it in Lubbock last year saying saying you know the county judge that they like the county
[44:19.520 --> 44:25.080]  mayor said we know they're planning on confiscation they're going to come down the road and armored
[44:25.080 --> 44:28.960]  vehicles we've got to prepare for war and why did he know that because dhs had come
[44:28.960 --> 44:33.720]  into Lubbock we talked to them his office he said he would come on but never did but
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.480]  we talked to the chief of staff they said no the judge knows this because we got visited
[44:37.480 --> 44:41.800]  by dhs with the takeover plan and I said they've got to come on the air and tell this story
[44:41.800 --> 44:46.600]  well you know he may come on Mr. Jones he knows who you are I mean folks they're coming
[44:46.600 --> 44:52.520]  in to the cities and the county saying are you prepared for war and a lot of the police
[44:52.520 --> 44:58.960]  are going okay yeah yes sir salute the flags salute obama as they prepare for a total takeover
[44:58.960 --> 45:08.000]  do you understand what's happening here treason there's no debating this is vc french guys
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.200]  you print me the wikipedia vc french I want to read that to folks the vc french the french
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.520]  folks fought the Germans in world war one with the US and England to beat them the french
[45:17.520 --> 45:23.600]  used to be very militaristic their people finally woke up and said no to it but the vc friend
[45:23.600 --> 45:29.280]  over 90% of the general staff of the french military were nazi sympathizers and they stood
[45:29.280 --> 45:34.880]  down at the marginal line and then the british expeditionary force was forced to dunkirk
[45:34.880 --> 45:42.720]  and had to evacuate they stood down the french stood down and were given power the french
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.720]  military over france that's how three days after the invasion hitler was able to come
[45:47.720 --> 45:53.480]  visit paris and the police were on his side and held the crowds back they arrested hundreds
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.160]  of thousands of people the analogy and I'm begging media even mainstream if you love
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.880]  your kids out there you know who you are you better write about this folks are we're gonna
[46:03.880 --> 46:08.840]  lose everything and at least my testaments here warning people up front the vc french
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.160]  model folks how do you think they took down saddam the first time bought off most his
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.520]  generals the second time in 1993 they bought them almost all off there was almost a complete
[46:17.520 --> 46:23.840]  stand down except for a few units loyal to saddam and baghdad then iranians came in along
[46:23.840 --> 46:27.960]  with saudi arabian proxy armies and began battling each other for control of the country
[46:27.960 --> 46:36.880]  shiat versus suni and only when us or coalition forces got in between them did they get killed
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.080]  it's on record they bought them all off this is how they did it folks they bought them
[46:41.080 --> 46:47.480]  off delta force in the nineties was buying off county commissioners and mayors and police
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.520]  chiefs and we knew because thomas sanchez the head of emergency management in kingsville
[46:52.520 --> 46:57.560]  came on my show and said that they are it was a vietnam vet army intelligence to pay
[46:57.560 --> 47:02.520]  him off to go along with gun confiscation it was a test it was going on in every county
[47:02.520 --> 47:08.040]  in the country then they went to the police chief of san antonio tried to buy him off
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.280]  with two hundred thousand in a briefcase delta force i went to the travis county and austin
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.760]  swat teams they laughed at me six months later lieutenant bet called me so police come office
[47:16.760 --> 47:21.160]  he goes delta force was here it's all true my god what's going on he was fired a month
[47:21.160 --> 47:29.920]  later made up you know racism bs no he was fired because of the delta force situation
[47:29.920 --> 47:33.520]  he thought he laughed at me in his office i'm a ring corps veteran vietnam we're not
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.000]  trying to take on america never happened i said i will be here soon he literally laughed
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.480]  at me he didn't he didn't laugh later he didn't laugh when they fired him no i'm sure he might
[47:46.480 --> 47:50.880]  be still alive last time i already was a security guy at the austin airport this isn't a game
[47:50.880 --> 48:00.520]  ladies and gentlemen i've had military attack me in a parking lot telling me to shut up
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.080]  and they gave a lot of respect for me when i beat the hell out of them and they beat
[48:04.080 --> 48:08.440]  me up pretty bad as well but the whole point is is that i'm not shutting up or backing
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.680]  down i know how real all this is they got military crawling all over us folks that are ready
[48:14.680 --> 48:17.880]  to carry out this treasonous activity and they're going to hunt veterans down if you
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.240]  were in special forces and ran serious operations and you haven't joined them or you haven't
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.840]  given an offer to join them you're on a kill list i'm sure you already know that so just
[48:26.840 --> 48:31.240]  be ready we're not going to be caught flat footed when the new order makes this move
[48:31.240 --> 48:36.400]  if they do we're hoping to stop it but if we don't stop it we're going to win against
[48:36.400 --> 48:40.000]  the vc french we're going to put up a lot bigger fight than the french resistance did
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.840]  in the first few years and i'm just an information person organically here warning you if this
[48:45.840 --> 48:50.120]  all goes hot folks that will be the end of me even if they don't kill me i won't be on

[55:34.520 --> 55:45.280]  I can really focus on and really try to stop things is that what is the DHS doing openly
[55:45.280 --> 55:51.640]  training the police that they will fight veterans and conservatives libertarians this is a political
[55:51.640 --> 55:58.520]  takeover police should be just outraged I know a lot of them are but they're now mainlining
[55:58.520 --> 56:02.600]  these stops were all over the country they're going yeah we are training we expect the veterans
[56:02.600 --> 56:09.480]  to attack any moment they've always in the last few years had death panels for vets and
[56:09.480 --> 56:12.800]  people why are they hyping that up right now they're going to blow something up and say
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.160]  the vets got mad because they didn't get health care and so now don't trust vets it's it's

[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:46.840]  rules yeah my kids were on the private school a couple years ago a home school fully now
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.720]  it was a good school but to be accredited it was it was like a handouts from michelle
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.160]  obama every few months and like telling the kids what was good to eat it was like horrible
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:03.480]  gmo lunchables and stuff house republicans are proposing to let schools opt out of healthier
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.800]  school lunch i mean it's like prison food now it's worse than food i've had in jail the
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.600]  times i've been arrested as a protester never never convicted me i mean i've been quite
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.240]  a few times in the hoose calvary stuff and i was in juvenile a couple times because it
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.320]  would be a big fight and you know somebody goes to the hospital they take it as y'all
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:28.240]  regardless and you're in there over the weekend and you know i mean it was prison food is better
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.360]  than what they feed in the schools why not parents put up with it now they're saying parents
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:38.720]  can't bring the lunches under under dhs under michelle health and human services and what
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.400]  in denver and chicago the school districts are saying parents you can't be trusted oh
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.760]  they use allergies you might put peanuts in so you can't be trusted yeah because we're
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.640]  so sickly now from gmo that it triggers people's allergies so kids kids are like invalids now
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.400]  pretty soon half the kids will be dying pediatric cancer is already up over 10 000 on average
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:05.240]  look it up and the answer will be we have gmo patties for your kid you can't pack a
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:10.080]  lunch for your prisoner hell even in most prisons they let family bring you food when

[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  insider groups in fact i remember we showed some photos a while back of uh if you just

[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.320]  shots of it it's unbelievable all right your calls coming up i can hear from some police
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.840]  too i mean i know you're all training that the vets are going to kill you any minute
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.840]  and i guess when they blow stuff up blaming on the vets and try to arrest a bunch of them
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.040]  the vets will fight back they won't go to the fema camp and it'll be self-fulfilled look
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.520]  at their terrors so i guess we're just too stupid to stop the civil war i guess that's
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:02.160]  what people want people hate the vets so much they want war with them a chemical spill contaminating

[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.920]  all over the country they have military drills that didn't go live with the marines and the
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:27.840]  army remember east st louis last year where they said no this is martial law this has
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.520]  been going on for a long time but it's building up an accelerating let's go back to the newscast
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.320]  for your tax dollars at work and instead of being blown up scrapped or given away to a
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:43.400]  foreign country surplus u.s. military hardware is coming home from the wars being assigned
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.800]  to the streets and back roads of central indiana to keep who's your safe oh time of escalating
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:56.240]  homeland violence now this is all scripted if i had to bet it was written by homeland
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.960]  security justice department maybe southern poverty law center they keep saying in a time
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.920]  of escalating violence in a time of escalating crime and the cop later says the head of the
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:14.920]  swat team because you know of all this horrible violence the veterans none of that's true
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.440]  but and then they roll out the old 70s swat show when they popularize everybody's got
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.720]  to have a swat team this is how they program the public let's go back to it 70s TV show
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.120]  swat showed state-of-the-art policing heavily armed cops drove into danger in the back of
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:36.320]  what was essentially a bread truck by 2010 for some police departments not a lot had
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.720]  changed as the Merrillville police department posted a video of its swat team in training
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  writing up to a scenario to the side of a Chevy suburban swat team commanders knew there

[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:06.440]  county sheriff's department the value of the vehicle was $650,000 it didn't cost us any
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:11.600]  money at all they sell it like they're getting something free this is all a sigh of i've
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.960]  seen literally over the years hundreds of newscasts like this they had marines army

[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.760]  treason but let's play the clip of the swat team commander who gets to be a military
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:39.280]  guy and feel like he's a vet while he drives around the rural area looking for meth labs
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.840]  i mean this is a total joke folks the government brings in most of the narcotics let's go ahead
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.800]  and play the clip of him saying for the veterans when i first started we really didn't have
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:55.600]  the the violence that we see today the weaponry is totally different now than it was and and
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.560]  my the beginning of my career plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:06.080]  military to have the ability and the knowledge to to build ids and to defeat law enforcement
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.040]  and he goes on in the full clip effect after we go to your calls i'm going to play the
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:17.200]  full clip because in the full clip he says quote he goes on to say quote we don't want
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.680]  to be outgunned by the veterans he goes on to say we were actually approached and asked
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.640]  why we have this i'm gonna put the full interview coming up but i want to go to your calls again
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.400]  this isn't just in this county they they ordered more than ten thousand extra of these in the
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.400]  last five six years before that in the last decade they had a bunch of other ones and
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.040]  they're deploying them everywhere and telling them because folks i have family that's involved
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:50.120]  in it okay i mean i knew about this a decade ago but now it's coming to an ahead they're
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.080]  getting ready for something and it doesn't mean we can't back it down but they are training
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.240]  to take on mom and apple pie john wane is the enemy john dear tractors the enemy your
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:07.360]  granddaddy's the enemy they train literally in zombie repulsion attacks here's christian
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.800]  science monitor no prank on halloween u.s military forces trained for zombie apocalypse
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.200]  and they practice mowing down men women and children dressed in rural clothing we caught
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.960]  video of this previously at urban warrior deployments those are my police state films
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.760]  and so now they go oh it's just for zombies when they practice mowing down crowds of
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:37.600]  people that's the cover for it this is total treason mike jason ernie adam john we're
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.400]  going to get to all of your right now ernie in tennessee what is your breakdown on this
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.560]  they're getting pretty bold we know it was going on secretly this shows me they're thinking
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:51.920]  about going operational yeah i've got to uh i've got to agree with you alex it looks
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.920]  like they're uh they're just finally coming out with it they're just admitting it and
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.960]  i really hope these police officers wake up well you're supposed to just lay down and
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.440]  let them take you to reeducation center i mean i guess you're gonna let them take your
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:11.840]  wives and kids off i mean do the cops really think people aren't gonna fight yeah i don't
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.480]  know you know veterans outnumber the police how many to one a hundred to one i don't know
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.520]  i don't want this to happen i know you don't want this to happen but what are you gonna
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.080]  do if it does happen i'm not gonna stand by and and and let them destroy my country they're
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.840]  destroying the future of my children and my grandchildren alex well here's the deal there's
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.520]  going to be a lot of bad stuff that happens on both sides that's war if this goes down
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:39.200]  and and and if there's going to be problems and they're going to stage atrocities and
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.160]  blame it on the liberty movement to try to win the scyop but the vets know it's a scyop
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.640]  and aren't going to stop this is only going to get worse once it starts and again there's
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.400]  no veterans doing anything right now no ied's no cops being targeted they are literally
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.400]  getting the police to pick a fight with veterans i mean i think the police are smart enough
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.840]  to understand the globalists hate their guts and want us to kill each other i mean don't
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.760]  they understand that well you know i would like to think that but to be honest with
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:12.840]  the alex most of my friends most of my inner circle are retired military i live 30 minutes
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.080]  north of a very large navy base in millington tennessee and my veteran friends are starting
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.920]  to wake up to actually what's going on they've served they've seen this but on the other
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:30.080]  side of the point i know a lot of police just from um for my my profession and most of them
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.280]  do not have a clue and do not want a clue they just don't want to hear about it well civil
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.920]  war starts they're going to get a clue real quick i believe so again i you know i pray
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:47.280]  it doesn't happen but uh men they sure are pushing for it well just know that when they
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.560]  knew commissure city or blow up a school and say we did it you know i warned everybody
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.200]  i really appreciate you god bless uh adam in west virginia you're on the air go ahead
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:04.040]  uh yes sir i think it's absolutely terrible that the veterans are public enemy number

[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.680]  30 times bigger than the manhattan project this secret police state project against america
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:12.280]  this treason this vc france takeover is is just mega massive and they've had it going
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.400]  in in slow motion forever but but it finally hits a flashpoint what does your gut tell you
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.880]  um i i don't know when i when i was in the national guard they had the snipers dressing
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:29.800]  up with like environmental protection agency coveralls on and they broke down their rifles
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:35.720]  and put them in toolboxes and they were going into the projects and like in between dc and
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.640]  baltimore and like prince george's counting they were working with like the f behind stuff

[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.880]  the veterans which we've always had in this country as they prepare to stage this new war
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.160]  we're gonna play that clip over some calls where he says don't worry we're not coming for your guns
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:39.640]  well maybe this SWAT team guy isn't but if he gets the orders that will happen and the globalists
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.280]  have taken the guns everywhere they're in control and they admit that's their goal and that's how
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.000]  they'll try to start a civil war let's go ahead and I mean you see the massive preparation for it
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.560]  they're not doing this for nothing let's talk to Mike in California what's your take on this
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:01.400]  hey Alex will you show us your work um yeah I've got quite a bit of insight retired marine
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.440]  number combat tours graduated a police academy so I got some insight in the mindset really to tell
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:13.320]  you the truth it's more paranoia on their part than anything uh that cop up an LA that was his
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.840]  name I can't even remember now that went off the off the whales off the rails and uh you know the
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:24.120]  guy was yeah had some tactical training not a whole lot but he you know they but you could see
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.800]  from their response they overreacted everything the guy did so the fact of the matter is they know
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:37.160]  that launching any kind of an offensive against very highly tactical trained military at this point
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.480]  returning veterans is stupid that they're just paranoid they're scared they want to be prepared
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:51.400]  for guys like uh that LA cop now having said that we're not really worried about it we're not concerned
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.000]  about it if they come after us we know it's a big mistake and we'll just we don't have guns we'll
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.160]  just stay there there they can't win it's a bite that they can't win you've said it numerous times
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:08.520]  so we're just sitting here waiting I'm just doing my job going to work and do what I do every day and
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:14.600]  if that's something they decide to do we'll just say no we're on the line you're not doing it
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.400]  and trust me don't back off we're not just sitting here the reason why they haven't had any
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:25.560]  big scale problems with veterans is because we're not scared of them we're not worried about them
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:32.440]  because they can't win we as well I'll say this we were just playing Sunday Pentagon clips with
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.320]  them admitting that nobody can defeat a low-tech group that refuses to surrender that's why I say
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.120]  resistance is victory I mean if the globalists really try to start a civil war with the American
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:49.080]  people and gun owners I mean it's the only thing they have is a psi op to stage terror attacks
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.880]  and blaming on us hoping that then the people turn against us but that's not going to work
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.920]  because everybody knows they're staging the terror attacks I mean we we have hammered that so hard
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.120]  that I don't see how they're going to get away with it but I'm telling you the globalists are
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.600]  emboldened they are going ahead with it I mean they're not spending hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.240]  the last 10 years training the police for war with gun owners and conservatives for no reason
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.920]  and they intend to go ahead with this they're going to stage a race war in the middle of it
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.880]  to really confuse things and and and again it doesn't make sense to you you're saying well
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.240]  we'll kick their butt yeah they want us they want the American gun owner to take out the police
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.360]  and military forum and so there's the master stroke how do you stop that from happening
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.120]  well stopping from happening we just fight them I feel like it's in for instance when we go through
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.520]  a door somewhere you shoot the force first two or three Marines through the door that doesn't
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.880]  mean they're stopping we're still coming you may take out they may take out a few but we're not
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.240]  going we're not going to stop the the blood of our forefathers is still in us from this day
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:03.080]  you just have to be around them you have to be in active duty to active duty units in a combat
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.760]  situation to understand how well they adjusted changing situations on the battlefield how determined
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:15.640]  they are and even though there's there's always a little distraction on on what our background is
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:22.920]  or where we come from we always center back on on to target and get back uh get back centered
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.120]  well I will say we have the globalist in check if we use it the fact that literally 80 plus percent
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.120]  of military that I run into that are active duty are listeners that's got a really scary
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:37.720]  establishment that the core listening audience of this show is veterans in active duty why do you
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:44.120]  think that is because they're on the inside and they see the truth you awaken them you you
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.800]  you start them doing their own research you you you make them proactive rather than being reactive
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:54.280]  and you have to understand that that's what brings us through the door to the recruiting office in the
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:29:01.640]  first place it's that mindset you just you just give us a tool you're you just give us the exactly
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.960]  I'm not doing anything I'm saying America's being taken over they're training for war against the
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.520]  American people what are we going to do and and the veterans are saying we're going to figure it out
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.240]  and the globalists are scared and they should be I mean we could arrest these globalists so quickly
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.240]  try them and and really fix this country it wouldn't be perfect but it'd be a lot better than

[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:47.160]  we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created each i have a dream
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:57.400]  that one day on the red hills of joy sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:04.760]  on will they be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:12.280]  my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:20.920]  of their skin but by the content of that character i have a dream well i share that dream that we
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.160]  judge people on what they stand for and who they are not what color they are where they came from
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:31.080]  and also have a dream that we not abort another 53 million 54 million babies since roe v wade
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:39.000]  and that we not kill 52 percent of black people and especially because that is a genocide going on
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  for every black person that is aborted and you've only you know got half of the as many
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.920]  white or Hispanic blacks are being targeted and dr alveda c king joins us she's got a new book
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.800]  coming out king's rules she's going to come back on with us for a longer interview in late
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:01.800]  june to get into her book that look forward to reading but in the 10 minutes we've got thank
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.360]  you so much for coming on with us doctor i'm so grateful for joining you and your listening
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.760]  audience is just a blessing well you've got 10 minutes let's get into the black genocide that's
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.880]  going on with abortion and uh you know where dr king would have stood on that and uh where all this
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:23.640]  is going and how we hopefully awaken america well we know here in the 21st century it's written on
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.000]  for a long time but it was more of a secret in the 20th century and the 19th century during the
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  time of slavery when slavery was abolished in america there became a big question of what to do
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.920]  with the former slave because they we as the people have been oppressed not allowed to read
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:47.880]  you have to be well educated and we were free labor for america and so the abolitionists
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.640]  after president lincoln signed the emancipation the abolitionists would say that these are human
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.760]  beings and they should be treated fairly and so there's been that ongoing struggle you know
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.200]  the history of jim quo laws you know because here at my uncle dr martin the king june the 20th century
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  civil rights movement well the eugenics movement led by people like margaret sanger who found his
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:17.400]  planned parenthood she was an affiliate of a dog Hitler who created that horrible movement against
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:24.200]  the genders that holocaust so they were compared after working together and their plan was to reduce
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:30.760]  the negro population which is now the america american population and one of the plans included
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:37.560]  sterilization and what was called birth control which today is shots and fields and things like
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:44.280]  death row for vera the hhs mandate in america saying that you have to give free birth control
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:51.000]  who's the needy and of course with the african americans being at the top of that list to eliminate
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.320]  the birth of african americans and when african america still could be planned parenthood as a
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:04.520]  leader the largest abortion provider is saying help them to abort those babies so that's the short
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:12.120]  version of what the genics and genocide has come to be in america i've worked for a priest for life
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:18.760]  as the director of african america and it is my mission to educate americans and really people
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:25.240]  around the globe that eugenics and genocide still exist in america in the 21st century
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:31.080]  well obama care funds abortion and tries to force churches to pay for it and
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:37.480]  obama's been a great poster child for increasing african basically forced abortions in africa
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.880]  where they won't let people on their own land and they unless they have abortions in china they
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:47.800]  have forced abortions inside the foxcom factories but as long as they dress it up as liberal it's
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.080]  okay as long as they say it's the democratic party it's okay again i don't romanticize the
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:58.520]  republican party but the truth is they were the ones that created the nra to arm newly freed black
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.520]  slaves to protect themselves from the klan it was the republicans that helped get the civil
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:09.080]  rights act passed i don't get how the democrats have flipped history on its head and call anybody
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:15.000]  who's against black genocide racist well that is really the country that we're having calling
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.880]  evil good and calling good evil and that is happening and and as you say i don't really
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:26.760]  promote party politics i say that you have to have people in both parties insisting that
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:32.040]  all the leaders do the right thing i am a conservative and i'm happy to be one but i
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:38.040]  believe that level should also be uh enlightened and know the truth when you say that it's okay
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.680]  to kill a little person in the womb it used to be you said you didn't know that was a human being
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.560]  but those are pretty awesome sounds and science have distraught that improving that those are
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:53.480]  babies are human beings i bought that life when i was a young woman and i ended up having two
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.280]  abortions and a miscarriage due to the harm to my body from the abortions and the harmful
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:05.800]  fertility blockers that they call birth control and so today i know that abortion kills babies
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:13.400]  and women we've got laquita reeves laquita wilson kind of use many african american women
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:18.920]  who've been killed by abortion jennifer morbelli a Caucasian lady there's a long list the growing
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:25.960]  list of women who've been killed by abortion bothers in abortion meals and millions and millions
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  of babies have been killed about one third of those babies even though our african americas
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:38.920]  make up about 13 percent of the population but we are tricked into having about one third of those
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:44.680]  abortions and then we want the politicians well to say this is women's right and reproductive
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.880]  rights and there's a war on women that is trying to keep women from exercising our reproductive
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:56.440]  rights no there is a war on women and we see that war on women even most recently with the 300
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.920]  little girls in nigeria who were kidnapped christian girls and things like that the war on women are
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:07.320]  as you mentioned in china forcing the women to have abortions after one child but we see that here
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:13.480]  on the war of our women on the wombs of our women with these women being slaughtered in the abortion
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:21.560]  meal and obama care is specific that we give to women free birth control or access to birth
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:28.360]  control through our insulin policies that birth control that is linked to breast cancer cervical
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:35.960]  cancer impression high blood pressure growth all of the chemical procedures that are either
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:42.200]  surgical or oral or shot that uh that birth control that you're interested in it's not
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:49.400]  it's death care to give women these products that make the woman's body feel as though it is fixed
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:55.560]  but you cannot conceive and it's going to be linked to blood pressure growth diabetes um
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.600]  heart attack and they're not telling anybody about this as you see the woman who's an actress
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.080]  who's an abortion counselor selling women on it in new jersey taking a picture of the baby and
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.880]  saying how much she gave birth it was wonderful to like you know kill the baby i mean what did you
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:15.480]  think of that i've never seen anything that's satanic that was on youtube and see what she did not do
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.800]  she did not show her abortion she showed a picture first she may not have really been
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:24.840]  having an abortion either see that could have been doctor but she's showing oh this is pleasant this
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:31.640]  is fine now i know i can at least get pregnant they didn't show the baby then torn up with the
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:38.680]  torn apart you know they didn't admit that many times that once the baby's are avoided they ship
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:44.440]  the uh remains of the baby to be burned at the energy the energy plant you know there's so much
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:51.720]  that's not being told to us and it is fantastic and there are many actresses though who have come
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:58.120]  for it and said that they really did resent their abortions uh we have i suppose it also is an actress
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.640]  somewhere recently they committed suicide because she could not get over her abortions oh it's
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.520]  incredible dr elvita c king is our guest she's a pastoral associate of priest for life director

[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:36.520]  not a republic he was not a democrat his dad was a republican and today i'm a republic and the
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:42.280]  part of the king july and his own work said i don't need to join either party because i might need
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:48.680]  to speak to people in those parties but he was more like that billy graham or different characters
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:54.760]  and creatures we don't know what their political persuasion is because when they go to their
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:44:00.920]  white house or when they cancel these leaders they want to do it from a position of the bible
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.320]  which is higher than any political party so martin the king july in his own words was an independent
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:14.520]  yes well listen in the time we've got left tell us about the new book when it's coming out
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.880]  and uh just your take on obama i mean i think of him as the opposite of martin luther king the way
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:26.600]  msnbc and al sharpton try to invoke racial division uh because they're busy stealing all of our
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:33.400]  futures obama care raising taxes on poor people what's your take on obama i just think it's amazing
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:39.720]  that people wanted to say that obama was the realization of the dream of dr martin the king
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.560]  junior dr martin the king july wanted a preacher of the gospel of jesus christ president obama
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.040]  has actually said that america is no longer a christian nation and i know that my uncle would be
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:56.680]  very upset to hear that uh my uncle was a man of god and he loves us always and he was a preacher of
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:02.680]  the gospel civil rights leaders yet but definitely a future he was not a politician so we have to be
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:09.240]  different that president obama is a politician martin the king junior was a man of god and you
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:15.080]  can know more from past uh president obama said martin the king junior then you can to mosey
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:21.960]  martin the king junior was more like mosey and uh of course president obama is not so i just hope
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:28.520]  that people will re-examine history and to know that martin the king junior was pro-life his wife
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:34.280]  for that he was pro-join just like this is barba bush and there's a lot of us are pro-join and
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.640]  think a woman should have the right to choose a bush and but their husbands do not that was
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:46.280]  the truth of martin the king junior he did not even go to the martin thank a awards program when he
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:52.280]  was offered that award his wife went and accepted the award because he was pro-join sure and people
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:58.600]  weren't as informed and people weren't as informed obviously back in the 60s and things we understand

[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.040]  admitting the main enemy the terrorists are now the veterans how did we go from the veterans
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:30.440]  marching off to supposedly fight the people that did 9-11 which was the iraqis not saudi arabia
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:36.280]  who supposedly was behind it and then now 12 years later it's flipped on into the patriots i mean
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:41.880]  this is a scandal much bigger than them having death list on veterans at the va we've told you
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:48.920]  that for years they've had death panels there it's terrible but what about preparing for war on veterans
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:55.720]  it just shows how maniac out of control the establishment is max what's your take on this
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.520]  yeah i'm hearing wisconsin uh and i don't know if you're aware of this but they produce the m-wraps
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:08.760]  they along with uh majority of the other trucks for the military here in oshkosh wisconsin
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:16.760]  and they have a stockpile of about 10 000 sitting um partially at the oshkosh airfield and partially
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.960]  now you've done your intel uh they made 6 000 of another type uh smaller when i forget the name
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.680]  of it they bought a bunch from blackwater they made out and was of virginia and then i saw the
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:35.240]  order a few years ago uh for 10 000 to be cash and then deployed to police and and so you came up
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:41.320]  with a good number of 10 000 is it still 10 000 uh well they're always moving them and what's nice
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:47.000]  that us the taxpayers we get to pay for parking non-stop for those 10 000 just sitting in the lot
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.640]  they're already paid for and i talked to one of the guys who works on them he says that they can
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.680]  actually be hacked and drive up to 120 miles per hour now imagine one of those suckers driving into
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:03.080]  your house at 120 miles per hour yeah you're saying it has a governor on probably 80 miles an hour
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:10.600]  but you can uh you can bypass that and go 120 yep and they just i think last week got the contract
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.640]  for the unmanned version which are starting to produce i think either this year or next year
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.240]  yeah everything's going to be unmanned people think of a robot is robbie the robot
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:24.680]  no it's drones it's ground attack uh it's an armored truck with guns all over it nerve gas you name
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:28.840]  it we're not going to be fighting troops or swat teams there'll be no troops there'll be no swat
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:35.160]  teams there's going to be technicians overseeing uh robotic vehicles and uh this is this is the
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:38.760]  way it's i mean they're done with us i mean this is the end of humanity as we know it
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.480]  if this rolls out it's an ai system do you agree with that analysis
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:49.960]  yeah yeah i think we can turn around and maybe use this technology for good you know uh use maybe
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:55.080]  the military technology to fight wildfires clean up our oceans clean up our planet and
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.960]  oh they'll always be good uses the problem is it's directed by evil people it's like you could
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.920]  argue oh give women birth control but it came from eugenesis and literally at all hitler
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:09.640]  i mean margaret sanger got awards from hitler and was buddies with him and they sent love letters
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:16.280]  to each other and then they call her a liberal god in time magazine i mean it's just it look look
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.760]  of course robot trucks can be good to fight fires they're not going to be used for that
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.520]  they're going to be used to come against the people and again we're allowing an engineering

[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:41.160]  have been holding all veterans talking about how they're shocked so far that they're openly on
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.640]  the news we played the clips earlier showing that the main enemy is the veterans and the
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:49.320]  police need armored vehicles and all these weapons to fight veterans because you know
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:53.560]  there's such an explosion in veteran crime and it's not even true they just say well the crime
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:57.640]  rates weigh up and veterans are horrible and you know we have to be ready to kill them and uh
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.560]  and eat your bunnies fly and i mean it's just it's just it's incredible but this is what a
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:08.760]  takeover looks like joe in texas thanks for holding her on the air what's your take as a marine vet
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:16.040]  on this hey alex you spent a while so i talked to you uh i'm uh who good news is is uh got a
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:23.800]  fellow marine uh brother minor served with in central america and uh he's got up around east
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:30.360]  texas and we're training civilians or he has rather he'd asked me a couple years ago to come
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:38.040]  and help him and he's training civilians and i talked to him about 10 months ago and he had told
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:45.880]  me that uh that he told me he said uh joe uh american people get ready to see some things
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:54.440]  they've never seen in their life and uh you know he's saying i've seen it and good news is is that uh
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:02:00.840]  you know that there's uh some veterans out there training civilians and they know what's going on
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:10.520]  and uh fortunately uh you know and i had people up here where i'm a neighbor hill country person
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:17.000]  like you and they all think there's going to be you know helicopters flying down the river and
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.320]  and i told him i said you know it's not going to be helicopters coming down a river
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:26.120]  there's going to be foreign troops coming over the top of those hills and you're not even going to
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:32.600]  know they're there but fortunately uh we're you know we're prepared we know what's going to happen
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.040]  how would you describe this takeover we're watching in slow motion
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:47.480]  i would i would describe it as uh history as history repeating itself and that you know
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:55.400]  it's time like it says in the bible for for us to take our plows and tournaments swords and i
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:01.880]  think that it's a it's a repeat of history and just like you know the fall of roman empire
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:11.720]  way back there uh 12 14 years ago i got the opportunity to read none dare call a conspiracy
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:19.000]  and it's all cooperative just like you spoke alexon and uh they just want them you know
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:23.560]  they want us to come down to the point of being their slaves and they're the masters but
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:30.600]  but i don't think it's going to work i've built a home up here with my wife and in uh in the sticks
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.520]  and i'm not ready to give it up i mean i could go to very crews and places like that but i'm not
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:41.880]  going to you know i'm not going to leave my home and my children are here and and grandchildren
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:48.600]  and i'm not going to leave and this is history repeating itself and it is and the globalists
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.880]  are so bold because america's been asleep for so long but they're illegitimate they're a fraud
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:00.600]  so the key is to work in the info war to wake up as many people as we can that may back them off but
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:06.760]  there's a catch 22 though where we back them off so far they then feel completely cornered
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:11.800]  so they launched the attack to begin with all i know is justice be done may the heavens fall
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.520]  we're just going to do the right thing work for peace prepare for war and let the chips fall
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:22.600]  where they may what do you say to that job i say simplify god bless america and all the above
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.440]  christian pro-life and we're going to be the ones that are coming after because i'm i'm all the
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:35.320]  above and several other veteran friends of mine the same way and you know we've even volunteered
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:41.480]  to help other veterans coming back and uh god you know god bless the ones that are helping the
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:46.600]  civilians know what to prepare for absolutely they're scared of the little leadership coming from
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:50.840]  the military from the veterans we're going to talk to bruce michael and jim and a few others when

[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:34.280]  craziness is going to break out everywhere not just our crazy elite bruce in tennessee thanks for
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:42.520]  holding you're on the air worldwide hello bruce i can hear him in the background just put him on
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:50.200]  hold let's go to jim and indiana jim you're on the air go ahead yes yes sir you're on the air
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.400]  worldwide go ahead thanks for holding yeah i'm three miles from the morgan county sheriff's
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.760]  department that was the subject of your report on two miles from martinsburg just the county seat
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:08.520]  from morgan county and just seems like there's a more darkness than there's our fair share here
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:13.000]  you remember four years ago two martinsville police paid 10 year old at a daycare center
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:20.840]  a year after that uh west middle school student shot another student and then we have this story
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:26.200]  and that's just the tip of the iceberg with this little mayberry type town you know i just forgot
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.200]  one of my buddies about seven eight years ago was outside the town you just mentioned because i
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.000]  remember him talking about it and they were having a barn party with a bunch of girls drinking beer
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.120]  he just got out of the army and a swat team and armored vehicle showed up and arrested a bunch of
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:49.800]  them and they didn't even have any charges but later let them out of jail so i guess well i mean
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:53.640]  if you do anything there they said they were out the middle of cornfields you know drinking beer
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.720]  i mean you can't do that in america where can you and here comes the armored vehicles what are the
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:05.880]  police like there the city police i i don't get anywhere near they're all portly bi and looking
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:10.840]  down at you type guys that think they're they're the gods of the universe that the sheriff's department
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.280]  that most of the guys are pretty good guys in fact i applied to be a reserve officer
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.920]  several years ago um so yeah i didn't even know that they had this enraved vehicle you were talking
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:29.720]  about so you broke this story that's how good of a show they put on well it is a creepy quote swat
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:34.200]  team commander out in the middle of a small town you know saying we need this for the veterans
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.920]  that's super creepy but i think most these guys talking like this aren't veterans and they have
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:43.320]  a real dislike of veterans because they always wanted to be soldiers and they're not so now
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.280]  they're playing soldier and i guess they're just imagining and fantasizing how they're gonna you
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:55.160]  know crush the veterans feel attention in the interview and i went in to be a reserve you know
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:00.840]  i went in with a three-piece suit fresh haircut and it was obviously that it was obvious to them
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:06.600]  that i was a veteran i wasn't ashamed to mention that i spent 10 years in the navy but most of the
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.320]  guys on the panel out of the five person people that were interviewing me were looked
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:19.960]  for lack of better work scared that i would show up in a suit and want to serve with them
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.600]  knowing that i'm not afraid to say or speak the truth
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:32.920]  well that's the thing about a tyranny is is that you you get a lot of slobs and cowards
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:38.360]  who want to have the image of being a man but don't want to actually have to walk that walk
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.800]  and again a lot of police i know are veterans and are some of the best people i know so i don't
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:49.000]  want to paint with a broad brush but you know anytime you see these guys lapping up homeland
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.880]  security baloney you know something's wrong with them i mean how did that cop with a straight face
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.600]  talk about with the exploding crime of the veterans and all this violence increasing we
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:04.920]  got to have this the crime rates down 52 percent in violent crime i mean you you'd think a swat
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:11.800]  team guy would know that you're fairly educated that that guy was just reading off his script
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:17.560]  oh yeah the whole thing the crime around here is way down everybody's got a concealed care permit
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:21.800]  nobody messes with anything and if there is crime it's just petty break-in stuff
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:26.760]  i know i know the only places you have out of control crime are big cities
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.280]  and the Austin police department overall does a really good job trying to focus on crime in my
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:35.240]  experience but they've been kind of covering up shootings and racial attacks downtown
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:40.120]  because i know folks that live down there and it's it's getting creepy because here's the deal
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:45.640]  this country's collapsing only three cities in the u.s are really growing fast at lana austin and

[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:07.880]  and and it's coming everybody knows it's coming and and the the the issue is that the you know
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:12.200]  it's probably going to happen in the urban and suburban areas they're going to come back to
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:18.280]  weapons you want to come back to people that's going to be the first strike and and you know

[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.400]  who's who but yeah you're absolutely right really you know really good points you make and look here's
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:37.800]  the deal the globalists are anti-human they want to replace us with machines they want us to act
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.920]  like machines they're anti-family anti-woman so who are they going to hate first warriors they're
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:49.160]  going to hate the guardians of humanity the protectors of men and women and children they
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:55.560]  love people that are honorable they love men that aren't cowards that's why they in every regime when
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:19:00.200]  hitler took over finally he exterminated a bunch of the top military and even low level
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:06.760]  i mean it's the same purge over and over again once they take over they go after the veterans

[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:19.160]  thing uh again the hundred miles in the illegals are being legalized by fiat but the border patrol
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:23.240]  is now a domestic police force and i'm not bashing the border patrol they do a lot of good work they
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:28.120]  got a tough job i experienced there they don't act super arrogant which is just what you know what i
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:35.240]  don't like uh but uh they have been beating people up and stuff it's just out of control so that's
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.600]  all coming up right now let's go back to your calls carl in washington thanks for holding
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:46.600]  your on the air go ahead can you hear me alex loud and clear buddy what's what's your take on
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:51.560]  the feds openly saying and the police saying they're training for war with their new enemy
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:58.600]  not al-qaeda enemy number one is veterans what do you think of that i think it sucks but uh
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:05.320]  for all the sacrifices that all of us have given uh i wanted to say something alex and uh i think
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:11.560]  most of the war veterans will agree with this that they have a right to be afraid of veterans and
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:19.400]  that's uh what i found out when i went when i went to i went i was in vietnam but what i found out
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:27.880]  was uh when you're faced with dying or living and these types of things you find out who you
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:34.680]  really are it's easy to talk about it when you're sitting home and how bad you might be or whatever
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:41.080]  and most of these policemen i don't it's kind of a warning i guess i'm saying is it's one thing to
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:50.920]  train it's another thing to base the music and most of the veterans uh to say that they're not afraid
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:59.720]  i think they've just learned how to act or they know who they are under under that fear so uh i'm
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:05.960]  calm i'm not i'm like you are i'm not i'm not going to roll over i'm not not we're going to give it
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:13.960]  up if i got to die i will die doing this as opposed to allowing them to march me into a
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.160]  FEMA camp or or whatever they choose to do it'll be an emergency center for your safety
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.320]  just remember there's going to be a lot of sigh option all this as well
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:31.400]  but i don't want to talk about it like it's foregone if we don't stop it it's just going to be so
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:40.360]  horrible i want to stop it i i don't want this to happen but um i had one question i wanted to
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:46.920]  ask you do you think that um this uh american spring will make any kind of a difference you know
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:52.040]  i've seen this whole american spring thing and and it happened this weekend and really nothing
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:57.560]  happened and i and i think is it's uncoordinated and because it is so grassroots it's easy for some
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:04.280]  you know bad parties uh that i've seen pop up in the past to try to you know hijack it and control it
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.600]  and uh you know it's just really hard to say americans are going to stop following orders
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:14.760]  and go protest everywhere i think we should all just be doing that constantly but mainly talking
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:20.600]  to friends talking to family going to the state house calling talk radio calling c span saying no
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:24.840]  uh civil disobedience you know if you think something's unconstitutional or you're going
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.400]  bankrupt and can't pay all these taxes that are too high the elite don't pay taxes i'm not saying
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:34.440]  don't pay i'm saying make your own decision start you know not going along i mean if the
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:38.200]  illegals don't pay taxes most of the time and are above the law why should you pay them all when
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.280]  you can't pay them i mean it's really and i never used to talk like that it's getting to a point where
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:49.880]  it's just a system so lawless and so evil uh that it's totally a legitimate and to follow
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:55.080]  its orders are suicidal uh but there are a lot of good people i know involved people keep asking
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:59.720]  me for like a month you know it's here the american spring american spring well the arab spring was a
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.840]  globalist google funded stir up the muslims to overthrow their countries to put in al qaeda
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.920]  and and to have saudi arabia take over all those countries that's not a good idea i'm not saying
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:14.440]  people are bad that want to you know go out and call in american spring it's kind of like
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:19.240]  anonymous as the government involved in some of it but most of anonymous is good i'm just saying
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:24.840]  anything like that it's easy to say you're part of a group that's ambiguous and then have something
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:32.680]  slapped on you uh so that's where i stand uh basically on that you know it's just like all
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:37.640]  these calls hey we're gonna have trucks block dc and all this stuff and then it doesn't really
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:43.880]  happen it just it all smells bad to me just when something smells bad i don't promote it if you hear
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:50.440]  me not promote something it's goes my gut tells me stay away from it well they're right back we're

[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:26.200]  on a while just the interviews were bad phone or bad bad video that's just you know i just uh but
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:33.560]  go ahead okay my my assessment on the big picture what's going on and i'm a veteran from over 20
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:41.480]  something years ago back in the late 1980s and i realized that how i was was a part of a police
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:47.880]  force for the international banks the Rothschilds and Rockefellers that's all this is it's just a
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:53.400]  big exactly now they're going to drones and robots in the next 10 years now the war on veterans the
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:59.000]  old army they're phasing out humans literally this is public so they got a wage a war and demonize
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:05.320]  and at the final war against warriors because it's a war against humans period by the globalist
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:11.240]  and of course they hate warriors first of course any occupying force wants to wipe out the warriors
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.600]  first go ahead right and and that's it they're going to have to resort to transhumanism etc
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:21.560]  whatever they're doing the the robot i see these uh robot dogs or something that they're a robot type
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:27.080]  of critters sorry it's official that by 2020 no more combat aircrafts that aren't drone and they're
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:32.760]  going to ground everything but go ahead right right but this is this is the deal the way i got out
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:37.560]  and the reason why they're attacking veterans is because we they know that all we are is ponds in
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:43.880]  their scheme according to Henry Kissinger all we are stupid dumb animals to be used to settle foreign
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:49.240]  conflict that's a quote that's a quote great point i appreciate your call that's it it's like a
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:54.840]  cannon you know you drive by the vfw you drive by the state house there's old cannons and they've
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:01.000]  got lead poured down i'm or they're spiked they're done with you they hate your guts and here's why
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:07.240]  they really hate veterans when they take everybody's pension funds and take everybody's bank accounts in
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:11.960]  phases they're going to take it in pieces this is the globalist program worldwide psychologically
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:17.560]  they take 20 30 percent at a whack thinking you'll put up with it and in a decade you're totally
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:21.960]  bankrupt they know that veterans when their pensions are taken are going to get mad
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:28.200]  so they're coming for you chad and jennesy thanks for holding her on the air
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:36.920]  hey alex go ahead uh you got a couple different uh issues to bring up uh one you know i'll listen
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:44.520]  to the uh recording of the uh swad officer whoever was speaking you know they they do this fear
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.800]  longing actually out of all the veterans it's only a small percentage that would even know
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.480]  how to make an ied to begin with but there's no ied is going off except for the boston thing
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:59.640]  which was as phony as a three dollar bill that's the thing and the cops like they're going to be
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:04.920]  veterans killing everybody and we got to patrol the corn fields they're everywhere is there one
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.040]  under here is there one over there no the globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on vets go
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:19.320]  ahead uh the second point that i'd like to bring up is is that uh i believe right now this is a
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:25.240]  testing phase i believe you know you have to prop again to us the indigenous population that you
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:33.080]  are getting ready to try and make social change with so i believe that right now they're putting
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:38.040]  out all this to see what are we going how are we going to respond exactly we got a freak out make a
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.720]  big deal out of it and push back and they'll back off exactly so i believe that the best thing that
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:49.080]  people can be doing is going to their local police facilities questing in all these uh
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.160]  operating procedures that they're starting to come up with if the your town is getting these
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:00.440]  in wraps and uh heavy equipment and everything and i agree and don't be apologetic i mean i would
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.840]  be serious and say listen you know this country's being taken over by tyranny you know foreign banks
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:09.240]  are raping us you know here's the news articles are training for war on the vets the vets aren't
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:13.400]  doing anything they're trying to stage a takeover they know the vets are going to be part of it
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:19.080]  serve your community and your family and your family name and god don't be a little coward that
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:24.440]  becomes a federal pimp i mean police in the past would never be part of this and we and we've got
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:31.160]  to agree with you go ahead sorry i'm ranting no no it's fine and i really uh like to say that people
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:34.520]  are going to have to get out there and talk to these people and ask them you know you don't have
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:41.160]  to be combative with them but ask them like we have never had these types of threats going on all
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:46.760]  over the place like other countries like israel and palestine why is it now that we are starting
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:53.160]  to push and say that our own people are going to start doing all this why is that why would anyone
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:58.920]  if anyone was going to do any of these things what would be their motivation look look exactly force
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:04.920]  a debate it'd be like if somebody came to a church and said i'm worried and arson's going to burn
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:10.200]  this place down you watch you need to buy insurance and then next week it burns down who's the first
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:17.960]  person the cops are going to talk to oh you're asking me yes well of course it's going to be the
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:22.520]  people they want to demonize well but i mean listen if i come to your house and you're a new neighbor
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:28.920]  that moves in and i said there's been a lot of fires uh chad with new people that move in
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:34.040]  hope nothing burns down because we don't like neighbors if your house catches on fire who's
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:41.400]  the main suspect going to be uh it's going to be the neighbors okay the globalists are saying the
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:46.840]  vets are getting ready to start a civil war and bomb the police as an excuse to train the police
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:53.640]  for war against the veterans how obvious is it who's going to stage stuff because nothing's happening
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.800]  they have a nationwide preparation for this who does that tell you is going to stage it i mean
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:05.880]  they say it's coming for sure how do they know that because they've already planned it they
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:13.800]  already have absolutely red-handed total and they've done it before so i mean if they're going to
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:20.680]  fund al-qaeda to kill 300 000 people mainly christians uh in um syria do you think they'll stage something
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:25.320]  here i have an article today saying why does christian persecution get worse in every country the
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.080]  us liberates the u n admits christians are under the greatest persecution ever the globalist hate
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:38.200]  christians they hate anybody that it doesn't worship them john carrey's running around saying
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:43.720]  keep faith in his yell speech in government it's their god their god they want us to worship bill
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:50.120]  clinton no you understand they so so of course you're the enemy anything else i'm sorry i'm ranting
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.400]  no that's it they want you to worship the state the state is god the state there is nothing
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:59.960]  about the state and that's why they hate christians that's right god bless you i appreciate your call
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:08.120]  i mean we are in the hands of just desperately wicked people i don't know how to explain anyone
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:14.200]  i mean it's so over the top that in cartoons and movies just everywhere the listeners send them in
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:20.520]  every week sitcoms dramas it's like the bad guy that's going to nerve gas new york's a veteran
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:25.000]  who's a christian the guy that's a child molesters a veteran a christian the guy that murders his
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.160]  wife's a veteran a christian the guy that tortures children's a veteran a christian the guy cooking
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:33.960]  methamphetamines a veteran a christian you know the bad guys in cartoons now against the fantastic
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:39.960]  four you know or wear track ordered hats and love george washington i mean it's so obvious that
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:43.800]  they're not doing all this without planning to pull something
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:52.920]  i mean this is like if i see a raccoon climbing up on top of trash can i go watch i'm gonna try
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:57.560]  to dump that trash can over and eat the trash i'm no rocket scientist folks i've seen raccoons
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:03.240]  top over trash cans i mean it's like saying that guy's walking up to his door he's about to put a
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:09.720]  can and open it well how do you know that because he lives there i mean this is a no brainer folks
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:15.080]  like when i see a perch come up to my line to bite it with my kids that perch is about to hit
[02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:23.160]  that line watch as he's coming in boom reel the perch up i mean they're they're openly saying
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:27.720]  conservatives libertarians christians veterans are terrorists there's going to be a war with us
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:33.400]  we're going to stage terror attacks two plus two equals four they've got a history they stand a game
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.920]  they've done it before they're rolling it out when it happens they did it
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:47.400]  there is one chance out of 20 that there's mentally ill copycat veterans out there
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:52.200]  that hear so much in the movies where veterans are going to bomb stuff that they might actually do it
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.760]  there is a chance that that you mentally ill people might act big deal you got a better chance
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.000]  being struck by lightning than being bombed you got cops running around in giant armored vehicles
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:08.120]  shaking and fear when you want to be scared of the 18 wheelers coming on the highway while
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:13.640]  you're writing tickets that kills i forget the number i think it's almost a thousand cops last
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:18.920]  time i saw a year are killed being run over writing tickets and only the last few years the cops go
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:23.400]  around to the passenger side and not sick or with their butt sticking out the middle of the highway

[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:32.920]  of you you ought to be scared of of of cancer and the glyphosates in the water oh but it's
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:39.160]  invisible it's not sexy to be afraid of that i mean you're literally under mind control
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:44.760]  let me tell you what i do now and i'm gonna do it more and more most of them i'm busy going
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:49.400]  somewhere so when i see a cop bowed up sticking their chest out acting weird it's usually only
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:55.960]  federal uh people uh armed park rangers i see do that at the texas coast and other places i go over
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:02.040]  and say why are you so imperious what's that mean you're arrogant like you're king they're like who
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:07.400]  are you what's your problem my problem is you act like a really weird person like i've been to third
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:19.560]  world countries and cops act like you're acting and what what is your problem do they hire you
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:26.680]  because you're ocd and like to boss people around what's ocd well you need to look it up or you have
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:40.520]  a borderline personality disorder what's wrong with you i mean i just can't handle it i can't
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:46.520]  handle people trying to say i'm their slave so they can feel powerful let's go ahead and talk to
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:53.400]  devon in california you're on the air army vet what's your take on all this uh nice to speak
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:59.640]  with you alex uh yes my name is devon i served in iraq i was very young when i went in very naïve
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:04.680]  believed i was fighting on the side of the world police um i have quite a few points i want to
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:09.320]  bring up to you first i'd like to bring up the story about uh davonite the staff sergeant joe
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.520]  bergs technically they were arrested because they're detained against their will out for ap hill now
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:20.760]  my experience i wish the station at uh fort hood texas uh with a fourth infantry division um my
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.800]  experience with uh uh mouth sides is that they dress them up depending on the war zone that you're
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.840]  going to be infiltrating so when i was stationed at fort hood they made them look like the middle
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:36.600]  eastern homes and buildings and so forth uh another thing that they had done was they had
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:42.360]  our hired uh individuals who looked middle eastern so the one thing that i know exactly
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:47.320]  they're hiring they're hiring caucasian black hispanic role players with john dear hats and
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:53.240]  training in baptist churches what does that tell you exactly so that's how you condition the soldier
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:58.120]  it's depending on the environment that you train them in so if those so if to keep an eye out for
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:04.600]  that see what type of people that they hire exactly they admit they're openly training for war on
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.480]  libertarians christians conservatives returning veterans gun owners so that's what i'm saying
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:16.040]  folks the the the government is pure rogue now preparing for war with us what should we do about
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:22.680]  that yeah well now that i'm uh i've been uh living in california which is a pretty
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.920]  pure in this state you know i have to deal with all the gun laws here anyways uh another point
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:32.920]  i wanted to bring up was the uh indiana police sergeant in morgan county which definitely you
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:38.040]  know threw me off my chair when he was talking about war with veterans because we've been with
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:43.480]  our knowledge to build ied now what was the last time a returning veteran actually improvised an
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:48.920]  ied and set it off as an american fruit well actually teaching everybody about ied's and hyping
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:52.920]  it will actually introduce it as a new weapon that's what i'm saying you'll have real people
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:57.400]  start ied being because they're it's like when i teach kids don't commit suicide but show them

[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:25.080]  friendly bases and now apparently you get arrested just for coming on to the base is what it seems
[03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:31.000]  like and uh also this other one in camp la june i'd gone through that mount course uh several
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:36.120]  years ago before they put up these churches and everything else and it seemed like a very basic
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:41.560]  scenario where the instructors would walk you through different things and how to do them now
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:46.360]  it seems like all it all it is is geared and focused towards coming out to the american people all
