[00:00.000 --> 00:21.480]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:21.480 --> 00:46.480]  the Info War. To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:46.480 --> 00:59.480]  Got a long line of heartache I carry it well. The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[00:59.480 --> 01:15.480]  Bad luck when been blowing at my back. I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back.
[01:15.480 --> 01:25.480]  Alright, we are live. It is the final day of the first month of 2017.
[01:25.480 --> 01:34.480]  We're now 10 days into the Trump era and it couldn't really get any better than this when it comes to him delivering.
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.480]  Obviously, big Supreme Court pick coming this evening by the president, another big announcement.
[01:40.480 --> 01:47.480]  His energy, his focus, just dominating the globalist on every front, reversing them, not just here but on a planetary scale.
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.480]  His nationalist movements go from exploding to supernova.
[01:52.480 --> 02:01.480]  Trump has also announced that he will definitely pull out of the Paris climate deal and carbon taxes that are only leveled on Europe, Australia, the United States and Canada.
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.480]  No one else. He's pulling out of those. That will supercharge the economy.
[02:06.480 --> 02:19.480]  He says he will do a big number to Dodd-Frank that was written by private Federal Reserve shareholders openly to take over small banks and other small lending facilities and community banks,
[02:19.480 --> 02:33.480]  as well as credit unions and basically not let them loan to the public while the big megabanks gorged on trillions of liquidity, much of it, interest-free and in some cases absolutely free.
[02:33.480 --> 02:38.480]  So fighting for the little guy, fighting for Main Street, not Wall Street again.
[02:38.480 --> 02:48.480]  And a good Main Street is good for Wall Street if Wall Street doesn't want a consolidation and doesn't want a controlled system and a crony capitalist quagmire.
[02:48.480 --> 02:51.480]  That's why a lot of Wall Street is good.
[02:51.480 --> 03:00.480]  It's only the few top big ones that want a monopoly and that's why you see the markets surging $2.2 trillion.
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.480]  Unprecedented. We've got all of that to break down, just more of him telling the truth, more of Trump delivering.
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.480]  I look at all three of the gentlemen that they say are frontrunners.
[03:11.480 --> 03:22.480]  Now, I was told about a week ago from several sources that the individual they know that say is in the lead, is in the lead, but Trump can change his mind last minute.
[03:22.480 --> 03:35.480]  So we're going to see what happens today. I don't know if I'm pronouncing this fellow's name correctly, but Neil Gorsuch is the guy that I heard about weeks ago as being in the lead.
[03:35.480 --> 03:43.480]  And then I was watching Fox this morning and they were saying he's in the lead and that there's been talking points already circulated about why he's the best to a bunch of top conservative pundits.
[03:43.480 --> 03:58.480]  But look, something could come in on him any minute. One of the other individuals in the running is a judge who's been on the bench with Trump's sister.
[03:58.480 --> 04:08.480]  So who knows what's going to happen. I've looked at them all. They are worlds better than the type of people Obama would have put on the court.
[04:08.480 --> 04:14.480]  Are they perfect? Absolutely not. But I've tried to burrow in into some of their records and they're all pro-gun.
[04:14.480 --> 04:21.480]  They're all pretty much strict constructionist that don't really make comments from the bench or legislate from the bench.
[04:21.480 --> 04:32.480]  They execute according to the strict jurisprudence of our republic and even transcending that English common law.
[04:32.480 --> 04:43.480]  So looks good. Another promise kept by Donald J. Trump.
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.480]  I know that Napolitano's met like five times with Trump and it wasn't the front running.
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.480]  But Trump just said, you know, the original list didn't have you on it. I just can't do it around one.
[04:52.480 --> 04:59.480]  So there you go. Trump is pigheaded in a beautiful way. We'll be back.
[04:59.480 --> 05:06.480]  There's one ex-official that's calling on Mexico to, quote, unleash drug cartels to punish President Trump.
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.480]  He's suggesting that drugs should be allowed to flow freely into the US.
[05:09.480 --> 05:13.480]  Of course, I'm talking about former Secretary of Foreign Affairs George Castaneda.
[05:13.480 --> 05:19.480]  He's calling on Mexico to punish Trump for his actions on deporting illegals here in the US and building a border wall.
[05:19.480 --> 05:24.480]  He's suggesting that criminal cartels should be allowed to run drugs freely in the US.
[05:24.480 --> 05:34.480]  During an interview on CNN, the ex-official suggested that drug cartels could be unleashed on the US as retribution for, quote, Trump's aggressive stance toward Mexico.
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.480]  He goes on to say, Mexico has a lot of negotiating ships in this matter.
[05:38.480 --> 05:43.480]  For example, drugs that come through Mexico from South America or drugs that are produced here in Mexico all go to the US.
[05:43.480 --> 05:50.480]  This is not our problem. We've been cooperating with the US for many years on these issues because they've asked us to and because we have a friendly, trustful relationship.
[05:50.480 --> 05:56.480]  You know what, pal? That relationship does include a wall which is being built whether you like it or not.
[05:56.480 --> 06:21.480]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.480]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more, and it supports him and it supports Infowars, our whole operation.
[06:32.480 --> 06:37.480]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[06:37.480 --> 06:41.480]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode.
[06:41.480 --> 06:46.480]  Nationalist movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go pre-order, so you get it first.
[06:46.480 --> 06:56.480]  At Infowarsstore.com, the making of a president by Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones. I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.

[08:00.480 --> 08:15.480]  We've got it.
[08:15.480 --> 08:20.480]  Well, we warned of it.
[08:20.480 --> 08:30.480]  Lou Dobbs warned of it. Ron Paul warned of it. I made a documentary film titled Battle for the Republic that was based on it.
[08:30.480 --> 08:43.480]  That was the prediction that there would be an attempt to break Mexico, part of Nevada, New Mexico, and even Texas away and be part of Mexico,
[08:43.480 --> 08:53.480]  or be its own autonomous state outside of Mexico, outside of the United States. And the Club of Rome, the Council on Fire and Relations,
[08:53.480 --> 09:04.480]  the TPP documents have also shown this, the NAFTA and GATT, BAMF Canada, North American Union, partnership agreements.
[09:04.480 --> 09:13.480]  It's all been covered at nauseam. Remember Lou Dobbs ten years ago, harping on it every night, having top ratings, and then getting fired from CNN?
[09:13.480 --> 09:22.480]  Remember Lou Dobbs coming on the broadcast discussing it? Because it's an admitted plan by the big foundations and the colleges to break off part of the United States
[09:22.480 --> 09:31.480]  and create a, quote, Chicano nation. Now, I was taught this at Anderson High School here in Austin, Texas in the art department.
[09:31.480 --> 09:44.480]  I took art, you know, one hour a day when I was a senior, and all it was was a America bashing fest, and of course it was an old liberal white lady that was leading it.
[09:44.480 --> 09:53.480]  And she took it to a field trip to UT, not once, but twice, where we were brainwashed for an entire day with lunches provided by the Ford Foundation
[09:53.480 --> 10:02.480]  about the Chicano nation and how white people are inherently bad and how the Southwest is going to break off and be part of Mexico or be its own state.
[10:02.480 --> 10:12.480]  This has not come from Mexicans or Hispanics. It is a totally made up cosmology developed in the 1940s and 50s by the Ford Foundation
[10:12.480 --> 10:21.480]  as a long term strategic plan to break up the United States. Now, of course, once it breaks up and becomes an autonomous zone, it's controlled by the globalist.
[10:21.480 --> 10:29.480]  They create mega regions, destroy the old nation states' rights, destroy their cultures, play people off against each other, vulcanize them,
[10:29.480 --> 10:40.480]  and then break the area into sub-states, just like you're seeing in the Middle East. This is the old game of empire, a corporate global empire coming in destroying the nation states.
[10:40.480 --> 10:44.480]  So look at DrudgeReport.com. We'll play a clip of this in a moment from CBS News.
[10:44.480 --> 10:53.480]  California's sanctuary state dims move to block Trump's picks. We're going to get to all that, and it's being announced as well.
[10:53.480 --> 11:02.480]  You're hurting California's trade because you're keeping out a few thousand people here and there and following the same law that most countries follow and the same law that Mexico follows.
[11:02.480 --> 11:11.480]  This is so egregious and so horrible. We are deciding to just ignore your laws and basically begin the process of breaking away
[11:11.480 --> 11:18.480]  and accelerate the process of a referendum for secession from the Union.
[11:18.480 --> 11:26.480]  The only problem is there's only two state constitutions I know of that authorize that, and that's the Texas Constitution and the New Hampshire Constitution.
[11:26.480 --> 11:38.480]  Several others have similar right to revolt clauses, but Texas is called the lone star state because it entered by treaty as a nation to the Union.
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.480]  And then shortly thereafter pulled out for the Civil War that was forced back in.
[11:42.480 --> 11:48.480]  But the point is still under treaty, Texas could succeed. That's what's called the Republic of Texas.
[11:48.480 --> 11:53.480]  By the way, I'm not calling for that because that could be used by the globalists as well to break the country up.
[11:53.480 --> 12:00.480]  But if the country was already totally dominated by globalists, then we'd have to revert to secession just to reconstitute the Republic.
[12:00.480 --> 12:10.480]  I'm a Sam Houston type of guy. The whole Civil War was a sucker job by British intelligence to destroy the south and the north so the British could control western expansion.
[12:10.480 --> 12:18.480]  That failed. And I'm not an exercise bashing the British. This is just what they were doing. What you're hearing here is the real historical fact, not what's taught in schools.
[12:18.480 --> 12:24.480]  Now, let's just continue here with the news. There is a lot to get to. Obviously, Trump is making right on his Supreme Court pick.
[12:24.480 --> 12:35.480]  The top three all have very conservative, strict constructionist backgrounds or literal interpretations of the Constitution, light years better, worlds better than what we would get with Obama.
[12:35.480 --> 12:44.480]  And we also have a lot of economic news we're going to be getting to today as well. We're going to get the latest hoaxes on the travel ban and a lot more.
[12:44.480 --> 12:58.480]  But first off, it really is frightening the ignorance of a lot of the supporters out there of mainstream media lies, a.k.a. the Democratic Party minions.
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.480]  They'll believe anything. Trump has enforced a law that Obama put on the books in 2013.
[13:04.480 --> 13:15.480]  He has followed the Constitution. Even the Attorney General that had been appointed just as an interim until sessions is approved or not approved.
[13:15.480 --> 13:23.480]  That should be happening today as well. She came out. We have clips of that coming up and said, I had to do this for conscience, basically.
[13:23.480 --> 13:33.480]  Another thing, she's a big rock star. When her own lawyers and in her own statement, she admits what Trump is doing is constitutional. He's not barring people on their religion.
[13:33.480 --> 13:41.480]  Does Congress shall make no religion or Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof?
[13:41.480 --> 13:47.480]  Glad the Democrats are suddenly discovering the First Amendment that they've been waging war against when it's religious in nature.
[13:47.480 --> 13:58.480]  The First Amendment begins with a religious rights, not being given, but simply being pointed out that government had no jurisdiction over those.
[13:58.480 --> 14:12.480]  And if you look at what Trump's doing, it is literally word for word what was passed in 2013 and in 2008 by Obama, Obama has bombed five of the six countries that Trump's talking about.
[14:12.480 --> 14:20.480]  They're all basically, except for Iran, failed states who don't even have regular flights to Western countries.
[14:20.480 --> 14:33.480]  I mean, they are literal Somalia folks is a hellhole. Sudan is a hellhole. They don't have functioning real airports unless that's a military base in Sudan to bomb Christians in the south.
[14:33.480 --> 14:43.480]  These are people sworn to kill us who still have slave blocks at which horses and women are sold weekly.
[14:43.480 --> 14:52.480]  Women are sold as sex slaves in Sudan and in Somalia.
[14:52.480 --> 15:02.480]  We're bringing people to the United States, your TV viewer will show you this image that literally where outfits out of the Arabian nights and are on another planet.
[15:02.480 --> 15:20.480]  Okay, I mean, it's just like setting grizzly bears loose in your neighborhood, completely whacked out, running around beating, torturing, murdering, you get caught saying you're gay, you're dead.
[15:20.480 --> 15:37.480]  But in upside down world, we all get lectured about how we're not tolerant and how we're bad and get to see weirdo feminists chanting Allah Akbar and putting on hajjibs to certify their full conversion to Stockholm syndrome.
[15:37.480 --> 15:52.480]  So it is simply incredible. And then Trump just goes, oh, if you don't have a vetted passport and you can't prove who you are and you're in a database that you're probably a terrorist or connected to him, you don't get in.
[15:52.480 --> 16:01.480]  I mean, you show up in some of these airports and you see people are bringing in. Again, they don't know what planet they're on.
[16:01.480 --> 16:14.480]  I saw people trying to get yaks for David have some photos of it. Don't believe it. And what appeared to be pygmy.
[16:14.480 --> 16:23.480]  Camels into the parade route of the president and they were turned away. I mean, it's, it's crazy. It's like there's chickens flying around the airport or something.
[16:23.480 --> 16:33.480]  And that's all fine and dandy, but you can't take people from caveman world where women are, you know, chained up in the basement and then bring them here and then bitch it us.
[16:33.480 --> 16:41.480]  Because, you know, where these evil Westerners, according to them, have women sitting up on pink pillows compared to their cultures and then complain all day.
[16:41.480 --> 16:47.480]  It just doesn't match up with reality. It's not congruent. It is essentially mental illness.
[16:47.480 --> 16:56.480]  There's a video up on info wars.com I shot last night where I break down the fact that Trump is signaling the awakening of liberals.
[16:56.480 --> 17:05.480]  And by that, I mean true liberals that want freedom, lower taxes, private property and to be left alone to lead our lives as we see fit as long as we don't hurt somebody else.
[17:05.480 --> 17:16.480]  That's the true definition of liberal. And even the mainline kind of establishment fascistic liberals are waking up because finally their God, the state, has been toppled or captured.
[17:16.480 --> 17:21.480]  By the evil golden toad, Donald Trump.
[17:21.480 --> 17:32.480]  And so because the golden toad, as I call him, has gotten back in the office of America and they see that spirit rising, they're all panicking because they're God.
[17:32.480 --> 17:41.480]  That they worshiped. That's what atheists worship. They admit it in many cases. The state had failed them.
[17:41.480 --> 17:54.480]  And so now they admit they're out buying guns and masks. They're going out and getting shooting classes and waiting for the civil war against the evil, the evil patriots who were buying guns because we wanted to protect ourselves from an oppressive government.
[17:54.480 --> 18:10.480]  See, you've now become an American. You finally understand that you need to individually protect yourself and your family. You finally get it. You finally clicked one step into a wider world and are now beginning to ascend the stairs and join us on our long march.
[18:10.480 --> 18:13.480]  On our long march of human destiny.
[18:13.480 --> 18:26.480]  Meanwhile, the super rich are preparing for the end of the world because of Trump. They're accelerating all that. Why? Why not just promote prosperity and not use division to control people and try to unify humanity around basic tenants?
[18:26.480 --> 18:34.480]  We're still going to have disagreements. We're still going to have problems, but they're not going to be manufactured. You're not going to be adding oxygen to the fire.
[18:34.480 --> 18:42.480]  But now you're learning the state is not God. It's dangerous. It could do things that scare you. Even if it's a fantasy, your fear is about Trump.
[18:42.480 --> 19:00.480]  Still, you're now coming a few more clicks into the realm of reality. And I don't say that in a patronizing way, but if you look at the dumbed down gruel that is extruded out against the American people daily and that is taken up like its mother's milk by acolytes of MSNBC and CNN.
[19:00.480 --> 19:10.480]  And if you go and look at these throngs of people at their own demonstrations, they look like a psychic intergalactic spider sucked about 95% of their soul out.
[19:10.480 --> 19:26.480]  I don't care what color they are. They have weird translucent skin, growths all over their faces, big jowls hanging even at young age, just kind of stumbling forward like Gollum with their hands extended like they're groping in the dark, even though it's high noon.
[19:26.480 --> 19:41.480]  I mean, I looked at them and I was like, my God, this is a fallen, ugly, stupid group of people with the only light in their eyes is like some murderous greed and envy of anything better than them.
[19:41.480 --> 20:00.480]  Now that said, we're going to break down the latest on the immigrants, the latest on the Supreme Court, the latest on so many fronts and the latest on the move to begin the cultural breakaway of the Southwest into its own squalorous Northern Mexico like fallen state.
[20:00.480 --> 20:12.480]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark US government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices. The time to protect yourself is now.

I'm going to flip through the book and show you some of the big photo and graph sections. It really is a doozy of a book. It is an amazing book and it breaks down the real history of what happened in this election and where we're going in the future.

It's a drop in the bucket to fund the operation. But everything comes together to make it possible whether you buy a t-shirt that says Trump is my president or whether you get the making of the president 2016.
[25:13.480 --> 25:25.480]  This is the definitive inside book that's got information in it when I was reading it two nights ago when 10,000 of them arrived and I first read the book that I didn't even know. He has left a lot of stuff.
[25:25.480 --> 25:43.480]  Never before seen photos of Trump. Never before seen, I'm not even sure if I can show all the stuff in the book. I didn't ask Roger. He's on to Mara. But I'm going to flip to the book for everybody coming up.
[25:43.480 --> 25:58.480]  That said, this short segment is kind of a no man's lands. Let me just tell you some of the other stuff coming up. Oprah Winfrey makes me sick. Oprah Winfrey, because I know all about her, is bad news. She's a super manipulator.
[25:58.480 --> 26:27.480]  She is the richest person in an entertainment history, which is fine with me. But she's been engaging class warfare all along. And she funds the United Nations, a massive tax exempt foundation that's tied into Bill of Melinda Gates and population control, one world religion, and convincing Africans to basically roll over and die.
[26:27.480 --> 26:44.480]  She is a New World Order Aluminist of the worst seconding order, and she's been caught in secret meetings with Warren Buffett and Dr. Evil himself, Bill Gates.
[26:44.480 --> 26:59.480]  And I mentioned this this morning to some of the crew that she's now getting a 60 minute slot. And I said, you know, she's been in secret world government population control meetings. And they're like, really? And I said, yeah, go look it up.
[26:59.480 --> 27:13.480]  And they pulled up a whole bunch of mainstream news from the last decade. But again, before that was ever even in the news, I was told about Winfrey and her activity. She is uber bad.
[27:13.480 --> 27:28.480]  And the people think that Obama was the blackface to sell death to Africa. No, he was just the he was just the delivery man.
[27:28.480 --> 27:44.480]  The black widow pun not intended, but someone that destroys her own culture, her own people, a woman that is a vicious predator is called a black widow. And she is a black widow in every shape and form.
[27:44.480 --> 27:53.480]  And the politically correct world people be like, don't call someone a black widow that happens to have chestnut skin, even though she acts like a black widow.
[27:53.480 --> 28:11.480]  And despite the fact that I would call a white woman doing these types of things, a black widow, Bill Gates is a big fat black widow. In fact, that's my most common allegory or analogy or comparison to the globalist is psychic and but also cultural spiders.
[28:11.480 --> 28:31.480]  I liken it to whatever the creatures are and under the skin with Scarlett Johansson, they interdimensionally is saying we ate your innards and only leave your skin floating in a vat in a underwater portal to another dimension.
[28:31.480 --> 28:44.480]  Oh, that's in the science tech today. A bunch of top scientists are out saying we're in an alternate dimension, artificially constructed, that they can pick up the computer code projecting it. Boy, they really want to tell you that God isn't real.
[28:44.480 --> 28:54.480]  But creations been manufactured and they know how to give you a real creation, a real reality. You just got to tune out of this one and come into their matrix.
[28:54.480 --> 29:05.480]  So they're now assaulting reality itself and thus God's mind. God's dream. Because all of this is just God's dream.
[29:05.480 --> 29:16.480]  Row, row, row your boat, gently downstream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream. Sometimes I guess in God's dreams, they're nightmares.
[29:16.480 --> 29:26.480]  God has a conscious dream that creates free will and new creatures. All in the great continuum of the consciousness of God.
[29:26.480 --> 29:37.480]  Now when we come back, we're going to start burrowing in piece by piece of the news and the clips now that I have pontificated in a cogitory way.
[29:37.480 --> 29:48.480]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the InfoWare. Get the making of the present in 2016. Signed exclusively at InfoWareStore.com or by calling 888-2533-139.
[29:48.480 --> 29:59.480]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.480 --> 30:09.480]  We've seen politicians from across the world like whining, sniffling babies over Trump's immigration ban. We've seen city con declare actual war on President Trump
[30:09.480 --> 30:14.480]  because he has the nerve to point out that some people come from terrorist places and we should have a temporary travel ban.
[30:14.480 --> 30:23.480]  We've seen Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, actually cry stating that the Statue of Liberty is shedding tears because Liberty has taken such a hit this week because of Trump's ban.
[30:23.480 --> 30:29.480]  I've got news for you people. The countries that are on Trump's ban were actually identified by President Obama.
[30:29.480 --> 30:34.480]  At least 20 alleged terrorists since 2014 have come from countries affected by Trump's immigration ban.
[30:34.480 --> 30:39.480]  There's an article up today on the Daily Caller and identifies these 20 alleged terrorists.
[30:39.480 --> 30:44.480]  In the past three years, they were actually immigrants or refugees from seven majority Muslim nations.
[30:44.480 --> 30:49.480]  That President Trump has temporarily banned in his migration ban on Friday.
[30:49.480 --> 30:54.480]  These countries include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
[30:54.480 --> 31:20.480]  We'll be allowed to immigrate to the U.S. for the next three months. I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.

[33:25.480 --> 33:35.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:35.480 --> 33:47.480]  What's California up to? Hmm, might have heard of this before. Now it's official. They want us to cede. MSHIM's reporting it like it's completely normal.
[33:47.480 --> 33:54.480]  What the fact is, there could be retaliation by others. Same, we're going to cut you off if you cut us off.
[33:54.480 --> 34:02.480]  The World Trade Center in downtown Los Angeles alone has helped attract more than a billion dollars of foreign investments into LA County businesses.
[34:02.480 --> 34:14.480]  But President Trump's executive order imposing travel bans on seven majority Muslim countries that have sparked nationwide protests and outrage may have unintended consequences on our local economy.
[34:14.480 --> 34:30.480]  NAFTA negotiator and former U.S. Trade Representative and Secretary of Commerce Mickey Canner says he is deeply troubled by the ripple effect and anxiety the travel ban may cause to our local businesses that extends beyond the seven banned countries.
[34:30.480 --> 34:43.480]  We are a global city in Los Angeles and our international trade really drives this economy. If we can't travel freely and if there are restrictions that are limited on our travelers and our businesses, this again can have dire consequences.
[34:43.480 --> 34:57.480]  Stephen Chung, president of the World Trade Center in Los Angeles, also worries the money that freely flows from international investors could slow and we could be subject to increased tariffs and immigration and travel bans as well.
[34:57.480 --> 35:05.480]  He says if there's fear of travel restrictions, many investors won't be willing to take the risk to invest here.
[35:05.480 --> 35:15.480]  And the report is up on drudgereport.com. You can read the full report where they talk about basically becoming a sanctuary state. Let's talk facts.
[35:15.480 --> 35:30.480]  Globalism was sold as free open trade and free movement of people that aren't criminals or terrorists. Instead they've been bringing in criminals, terrorists, you name it, but more importantly, bringing people in and then declaring culture war with people that aren't white.
[35:30.480 --> 35:40.480]  So flipping it, getting white people to go along with the idea of being a multicultural civilization and not being race based as every other group is race based.
[35:40.480 --> 35:49.480]  Chinese don't let big groups of outsiders come in. Japanese don't let you do that. Nigerians in Africa don't let you do that. You try to go to Muslim countries, they don't let you do that.
[35:49.480 --> 36:00.480]  Even if you're a Muslim, a bunch of you move in from another country, they'll kill you. They'll blow you up. They'll throw you out. That's tribalism. That's territorialism. Try to stick your hand in the beehive. They're going to sting you.
[36:00.480 --> 36:15.480]  But we were taught, get rid of your territorialism because we're Christians. That's what unifies us. So that's our ethos. Never fully realized, but in the West, creating the greatest open free societies ever because of that operating system.
[36:15.480 --> 36:24.480]  And the globalists have been using that against us. Oh, sure. Let's build up the third world. Yeah, let's develop them. Let's share the world's wealth and come together. And let's do all this.
[36:24.480 --> 36:34.480]  And then meanwhile, they teach in the high schools and colleges, all whites are bad or inherently evil, must be gotten rid of. Whites must be suppressed. They must be disenfranchised.
[36:34.480 --> 36:41.480]  They must have everything they have taken away. Give us your houses. Give us your cars. Give us your children.
[36:41.480 --> 36:50.480]  There's a new clip that I forgot to tell the crew about. It's up on infowars.com in a Paul Watson video where Black Lives Matter says it's time to start killing whites.
[36:50.480 --> 37:00.480]  And says, quote, give us your cars. Give us your houses. This is a person with a bullhorn leading the group.
[37:00.480 --> 37:12.480]  Give us your house, your property. We need it. We need it. Reparate Black and Indigenous people right now.
[37:12.480 --> 37:19.480]  I'm going to go back to this in a minute. Where have I heard this from? The Vikings pulling up? You know, give us everything? Or an African tribe raiding the next tribe?
[37:19.480 --> 37:26.480]  Give us all your stuff for Hitler invading countries in Europe? Or the communists taking over countries? I mean, I've heard this before.
[37:26.480 --> 37:38.480]  A real genius, arrogant, full of herself, totally racist, but believing only white people can be bad. So she's like, give us your cars. Give us your homes. Give us everything.
[37:38.480 --> 37:52.480]  And by the way, it's time you start dying. I mean, this is one of the stupidest, dumbest, just racist idiots.
[37:52.480 --> 37:59.480]  But it's, oh, how beautiful, how sweet. Here, here's some Apple funding. Here's some Facebook funding.
[37:59.480 --> 38:09.480]  Here's some more globalist funding so we can just bring people in and then mix them all together in a big confused mess, a tower of babble, which the globalists can then control.
[38:09.480 --> 38:18.480]  So there's your problem. And teach total dependency. I saw three articles yesterday in mainstream news about, don't use the word mother and father.
[38:18.480 --> 38:25.480]  So it's gone from three years ago, four years ago, being recommended at universities and being laughed at as academic kookiness. No, it's not academic kookiness.
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.480]  It's a plan to officially, in medical facilities, do not say expectant mothers in paperwork.
[38:31.480 --> 38:41.480]  A tranny might come in to your gynecology department, even though she has a penis and might be hurt. Hey, here's the deal. You can be a tranny. I don't hate you.
[38:41.480 --> 38:50.480]  The point is, don't hate women. Let them have what they have. They're uterus. They're ovaries. No, but see, this is a dominance. This is a takeover. This is a exploitation.
[38:50.480 --> 39:00.480]  Now, the Alberta schools are saying, don't use it. It is really, really expanding. Don't say mother and father.
[39:00.480 --> 39:09.480]  And they're doing it and they're teaching your kids and they're coming in and telling your five-year-old or six-year-old daughter or son about all these other sexual ideas
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.480]  and all these other sexual systems.
[39:14.480 --> 39:21.480]  Imagine if, like, the scientists are trying to teach the male puppy at seven weeks how to not be a male.
[39:21.480 --> 39:26.480]  You'd be like, they're trying to screw up its life force. They're trying to kill that species.
[39:26.480 --> 39:33.480]  That's what you do with fire ants or screw worms or whatever group you're trying to eradicate as you target their reproduction.
[39:33.480 --> 39:43.480]  And we're being targeted chemically, biologically, culturally, and then there's all the white papers admitting they're doing it to us.
[39:43.480 --> 39:53.480]  And I go out to these parades and I see the males that, for whatever reason, genetically, were more predisposed to submit to this and for it to be more evident.
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.480]  And they have no sperm count. They have necks that are probably two inches around.
[39:58.480 --> 40:04.480]  I mean, I'm not kidding. Horrible sunken eyes, young and old. They look like living dead.
[40:04.480 --> 40:11.480]  They don't look effeminate because there's always been men that are effeminate. Whatever.
[40:11.480 --> 40:18.480]  The women are like hyperastrogen goblins and the men are like little skinny zombies.
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.480]  And it's like, look what they did to you.
[40:23.480 --> 40:34.480]  And then I think about it. Now, compared to say my dad's dad, I'm a pretty masculine, tough guy, but he looked a lot more masculine and tough than I did and acted like it too.
[40:34.480 --> 40:42.480]  That was just normal. That's how men acted. Everybody was real polite and real nice back then because everybody better be nice and polite because something will break out real quick.
[40:42.480 --> 40:53.480]  Now it's the future of the chemicals and everything and the TVs and not the kids don't play outside anymore and this is massive cultural death.
[40:53.480 --> 41:05.480]  And then you bring in a bunch of third world people totally confused who already have inferiority complexes given to them by the media and then they tell them you feel inferior because evil white people destroy them.
[41:05.480 --> 41:12.480]  And most whites go, gosh, I'm not racist. Let me capitulate to whatever you want. But you're not really capitulating to whatever they want.
[41:12.480 --> 41:31.480]  You're capitulating to the terms of surrender. The global social engineers are issuing through the giant throngs of orc-like, goblin-like, troll-like people.
[41:31.480 --> 41:39.480]  And I mean, let's just be honest. This is what 10 hours of TV and sitting on your ass all day eating GMO does.
[41:39.480 --> 41:46.480]  The women in every species, when men cease to be men, when males cease to be males, women then take that roll up.
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.480]  And they've done all the biological tests. They know what they're doing.
[41:51.480 --> 42:02.480]  And so we have mutant women that look like men and we have men that look like dead people. And that is who we are now. And it's going to get worse.
[42:02.480 --> 42:15.480]  You think a 91% sperm count is bad? That's 91% down? Soon it'll be 100% in most people. It'll be children of men. It'll be exterminism.
[42:15.480 --> 42:21.480]  But don't worry. You'll be able to go to the globalist and they'll have some recombinant 5, 6, 7, 20 parents.
[42:21.480 --> 42:28.480]  Oh, and we're able to give you a designer embryo with your genes but with some backdoors. And they admit all this.
[42:28.480 --> 42:36.480]  Oh, we're going to culturally control and X out traits so your son or daughter will be beautiful and strong and won't be predisposed to have all these problems.
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.480]  But they're going to be lacking something because they're not going to be human.
[42:41.480 --> 42:48.480]  Somebody, when you hear, you know, first embryos or first, you know, first babies from three dads and it's always weird.
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.480]  Like, we're gay so we want to have a embryo that's all from us.
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.480]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. You don't have mitochondrial DNA, Jack. You don't.
[43:00.480 --> 43:07.480]  Two men having a baby isn't a baby. Even if you're a planet and a woman. It's not a human. It's a humanoid.
[43:07.480 --> 43:12.480]  You're now in a science fiction movie but because you say, oh, it's two gay men having a baby.
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.480]  It's like, oh, no discussion about this humanoid or three lesbians that live together.
[43:17.480 --> 43:23.480]  I saw them in the news. We're going to have a baby soon. They're almost ready and she's going to carry it.
[43:23.480 --> 43:28.480]  The scientists are going to create it with our loving DNA and then we're all going to have our baby.
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.480]  And of course, it's all based on a woman baby, a man baby.
[43:32.480 --> 43:45.480]  It's so, you're living in a fantastic science fiction book but it's real.
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.480]  A couple big announcements.
[43:49.480 --> 43:56.480]  I am going to form a nucleus of a Washington bureau based around writers, an investigative journalist.
[43:56.480 --> 44:02.480]  And then in phase two, within six months, I plan to have camera people and editors on site.
[44:02.480 --> 44:09.480]  I can lease it out and find help but then you can get infiltrated pretty quickly and people will try to commit crimes in your names.
[44:09.480 --> 44:11.480]  We've got to be careful. That's the type of stuff we deal with.
[44:11.480 --> 44:15.480]  The media matters admits that's type of operations they run infiltrating organizations.
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.480]  So we've got to be very, very careful.
[44:18.480 --> 44:26.480]  Again, I've had people try to set fires in the woods when I'm covering a military event and say that I was burning buildings down.
[44:26.480 --> 44:29.480]  I mean, it's serious doing my job and it's serious working for us too.
[44:29.480 --> 44:36.480]  We've gotten strong enough now and we've got a president in the White House so we've got more and more friends in the system as we try to devolve it back to the states.
[44:36.480 --> 44:39.480]  But it's a serious thing to work for Info Wars.
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.480]  You've got to watch your six, especially if yours truly.
[44:43.480 --> 44:51.480]  We're going to deploy people to DC and who better to deploy than people that have already lived there, already been pressed there, already had credentials there.
[44:51.480 --> 45:07.480]  So Dr. Jerome Corsi, PhD, number one New York Times bestselling author, three times, who successfully is credited with torpedoing two Democratic attempts at the White House,
[45:07.480 --> 45:17.480]  is a real thoroughbred of journalism and defense of this republic, a man who's tirelessly been exposing NAFTA GATT, the TPP, the New World Order, gun control,
[45:17.480 --> 45:20.480]  globalism in general, will be joining us.
[45:20.480 --> 45:23.480]  He's also known Donald Trump for 40-plus years and been in business with him.
[45:23.480 --> 45:25.480]  So it's a good contact and a good journalist.
[45:25.480 --> 45:26.480]  We're honored to have him.
[45:26.480 --> 45:32.480]  He's now going to be the Washington bureau chief and I'm going to try to build an operation with probably 10 people.
[45:32.480 --> 45:37.480]  It'll take money, obviously, and funds, but I tend to do it first rate.
[45:37.480 --> 45:44.480]  And that's why it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the making of the President 2016.
[45:44.480 --> 45:46.480]  I want to show TV viewers.
[45:46.480 --> 45:49.480]  If you're a radio listener, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[45:49.480 --> 45:57.480]  You can actually see the video feed of this, but the making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution.
[45:57.480 --> 46:00.480]  Every book we sell, I don't know how Stone's going to do this.
[46:00.480 --> 46:04.480]  He's already mailed us 500. He's got to do thousands more now.
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.480]  Signature cards will be put in each book.
[46:09.480 --> 46:10.480]  So there you go.
[46:10.480 --> 46:12.480]  Roger Stone is one tough cookie.
[46:12.480 --> 46:13.480]  We appreciate him.
[46:13.480 --> 46:15.480]  President Donald J. Trump.
[46:15.480 --> 46:20.480]  There's an even better tweet he put out about how he's tough and loyal, but whatever.
[46:20.480 --> 46:27.480]  There's your quote from the President and it has got amazing photos in it and graphs and history.
[46:27.480 --> 46:29.480]  And I love right here in the back.
[46:29.480 --> 46:32.480]  It says, who wore it better?
[46:32.480 --> 46:34.480]  Photo, courtesy, Stone called truth.
[46:34.480 --> 46:37.480]  Dewey defeats Truman.
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.480]  And that's what we predicted that they would say that Hillary was invincible, but that wasn't going to happen.
[46:41.480 --> 46:47.480]  We knew the internal polls and you've got President Trump on the New York Post.
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.480]  So it absolutely is historical to see that happening.
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.480]  And it breaks down the deplorables, the history of that.
[46:55.480 --> 47:03.480]  It just gets into everything in the blueprint going forward and what Trump and Bannon and others are really planning to do when it comes to restoring the Republic.
[47:03.480 --> 47:11.480]  Folks that stood up with their rate t-shirts and really took over Democratic events, they are featured in the book as well.
[47:11.480 --> 47:18.480]  The fact that there's some evidence linking.
[47:18.480 --> 47:25.480]  Senator Ted Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald, that's all in there and how he dropped out two days after that was announced.
[47:25.480 --> 47:27.480]  Milo's in there, the Drudge reports in there.
[47:27.480 --> 47:32.480]  There's just so much incredible, incredible information and background and history.
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.480]  The famous look of Bill Clinton, whenever the rape of women came up.
[47:36.480 --> 47:45.480]  In fact, of course, Stone had that all set up beforehand to have those women there, bringing out his illegitimate son here on the broadcast.
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.480]  I mean, it's all there. This is just the photo section of this.
[47:49.480 --> 48:01.480]  It's got Trump at Stone's wedding and dancing with his wife and it's got Hillary for Prison theme and that in Stone's yard.
[48:01.480 --> 48:04.480]  It's got so much more. It really is amazing.
[48:04.480 --> 48:07.480]  But the book is first rate.
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.480]  This is something everybody wants on their coffee table, wants in their business, wants to give as a gift.
[48:12.480 --> 48:19.480]  I mean, this is show classy official release, the making of the president book at infowarstore.com or call toll free.
[48:19.480 --> 48:33.480]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine and Stone's coming on tomorrow.
[48:33.480 --> 48:34.480]  He's got more quotes here.
[48:34.480 --> 48:46.480]  Breathtaking in its scope and detail. Stone explains how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest upset in American political history.
[48:46.480 --> 49:00.480]  Variety says we're living in the age of stone and indeed his journey from Dick Nixon's dirty trickster to Donald Trump's man in the trenches does roughly mirror the trajectory of the American right.
[49:00.480 --> 49:04.480]  It's bigger than that. I mean, Stone doesn't like to take the credit, but it's true.
[49:04.480 --> 49:15.480]  As Nixon wrote about it about, hey, you need to go to lunch or go to a baseball game with his Trump fellow and also Roy Cohn, the big anti-communist lawyer that was the real mentor behind Trump.
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.480]  I'm not saying did it for Trump, but you know, behind a lot of him learning the ropes early.
[49:20.480 --> 49:32.480]  And then basically Nixon meeting with Trump and then telling Reagan, you got to have this guy in the White House. This guy is going to end up being president someday.
[49:32.480 --> 49:37.480]  And that's what Reagan famously said. I felt like I was shaking the president's hand, not the other way around.
[49:37.480 --> 49:43.480]  There's just always something about Donald Trump and Roy Cohn picked up on. He was super smart, obviously.
[49:43.480 --> 49:46.480]  You see him demonized by Hollywood. It's all just made up crap.
[49:46.480 --> 49:55.480]  He, of course, was the right-hand man of Senator Joseph McCarthy. That's what I'm telling you. This is like deep state patriot right wing return of the Republic.
[49:55.480 --> 50:06.480]  This is people that have been there for 50, 60 years, 70 years. The left would call it lurking trying to save the country, but now you really see it happening.
[50:06.480 --> 50:15.480]  So, oh, leftist, you have sleeper cells. You get people to run for office and, you know, then they activate and really show people who they are on the left.
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.480]  How about from the American perspective of restoring the Republic?
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.480]  That's what Trump said in his inaugural speech. He said, this isn't about left and right and parties now.
[50:24.480 --> 50:36.480]  This is about the American dream and the destiny and bringing God back in and having a level playing field and producing prosperity and wealth and not producing a bunch of division.
[50:36.480 --> 50:46.480]  It's big. And you mark your calendars, January 20, 2017, the day America was reborn. I said that in the morning. Hadn't talked to Trump about the speech.
[50:46.480 --> 50:59.480]  And then actually came out and said, because it's what he had to say. It's not that we're synced. It's that we're synced to the Republic and the spirit of liberty that is rising.
[50:59.480 --> 51:08.480]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation. Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[51:08.480 --> 51:15.480]  Let me just read a little thing here from a gender point one. The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[51:15.480 --> 51:22.480]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat, do the collective. Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to become a few guns.
[51:22.480 --> 51:23.480]  Oh, yeah.
[51:23.480 --> 51:30.480]  I think it ain't going to sit well down my way at all. It ain't going to sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[51:30.480 --> 51:33.480]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[51:33.480 --> 51:41.480]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag. Perich, mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper.
[51:41.480 --> 51:47.480]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand. DVDs now available.
[51:47.480 --> 51:55.480]  starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin. Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[51:55.480 --> 51:59.480]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[51:59.480 --> 52:04.480]  Had it been the sweet Paris air permeating the night, the intoxicating way her beauty had overtaken him.
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.480]  Whatever the case back then, Jordan Dunlevy is still in love with the memory of Lauren, the woman he'd lost so many years before.
[52:10.480 --> 52:21.480]  In Bookstore on the Sen, the journey of a conspiracy analyst, author C.L. Hendeman, ties conspiracy theories, mystery, irony and romance into the stimulating novel that masterfully interweaves the past with the present.
[52:21.480 --> 52:40.480]  Available on Amazon and Kindle and at Bookstore on the Sen.com. That's S-E-I-N-E.com. Bookstore on the Sen.com.

[54:23.480 --> 54:36.480]  All over the country, there are Muslim marches on capitals and I want to be clear here.
[54:36.480 --> 54:47.480]  I don't say this to kiss the rear end of the Muslims. I say it because I've been a respectful, real person who a lot of Muslims just thought was the greatest thing since sliced bread when I was against the Iraq war,
[54:47.480 --> 54:59.480]  against the Libya war, against the Syria war, because I'm against going and bombing and invading countries to destabilize them so Islamic State could come out of Saudi Arabia and take over.
[54:59.480 --> 55:06.480]  That's the admitted plan. That's the great evil of what Obama and Hillary and John McCain and Lindsey Graham did, bipartisanly.
[55:06.480 --> 55:11.480]  And that's what Trump is opposing and blocking and that's why they're so angry with him.
[55:11.480 --> 55:24.480]  Obama destabilizes all these countries, has a deal to open up Europe, flood Europe with refugees, to have a crisis, to codify globalism and have us accept all these refugees and open borders,
[55:24.480 --> 55:31.480]  and instead from Germany to France to the UK to the US to Australia, people are revolting against it.
[55:31.480 --> 55:45.480]  The only place they're going in the other direction is for pretty boy Trudeau in Canada. So it's crazy. These elites all have bodyguards, they live behind walls, they're protected,
[55:45.480 --> 55:55.480]  and any Muslim knows that their countries are the most dangerous places on earth and that radical Islam is always trying to overthrow those countries that aren't oppressive.
[55:55.480 --> 56:01.480]  I wish the Muslims weren't like this. I wish they weren't killing millions of Muslims every few years.
[56:01.480 --> 56:07.480]  But the biggest group killing Muslims is Muslims and Muslims have a Muslim problem.
[56:07.480 --> 56:14.480]  So you're running to the left to protect you and love you when you know the left doesn't have any of your values, you claim.
[56:14.480 --> 56:23.480]  I mean, you execute people that are homosexual in your own countries, women don't have any rights, and then you have women's marches led by Muslim women.
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.480]  It's a cruel joke, and most Muslims I've known are really smart, cool people.
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.480]  I don't say that patronizing. I mean, you know, engineers, doctors, you name it, lawyers, they're smart people.
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.480]  I'm talking about Arabs I've known, people from the Middle East, Persians, you name it.
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.480]  But usually, I love your show, you know, these are corrupt states and the Mullahs are bad.
[56:43.480 --> 56:49.480]  Again, upwards of 80% of people in Iran don't like their government.
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.480]  People leading Muslims here and in Europe and in the Middle East and in Asia are the radical ones.
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.480]  They're the bullies. They're the ones in control. That's why they've got to be opposed.
[57:00.480 --> 57:06.480]  Now, coming up, we have Owen Shroyer and crew at the Texas Capitol where the Muslim capital march is ongoing.
[57:06.480 --> 57:09.480]  He'll be joining us coming out in about 45 minutes.
[57:09.480 --> 57:16.480]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, investigative journalist who's starting our Washington Bureau for Info Wars, is going to be joining us.
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.480]  This will be all over the newspapers by tonight.
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.480]  And what do they see? We're going to be hiring work with him in a nucleus of long-term journalists,
[57:25.480 --> 57:29.480]  three number one New York Times bestselling books.
[57:29.480 --> 57:34.480]  That's going to be the guy, haunt showing, editing, reading over things, making sure it's all vetted, knock on wood.
[57:34.480 --> 57:43.480]  He's never been sued, got the sources, member of the press club on and on and on, lived in D.C., much of his life in Virginia as well as New Jersey.
[57:43.480 --> 57:50.480]  He's going to be joining us on the show as a guest, but he works with Info Wars now. He's employed by Info Wars.
[57:50.480 --> 57:53.480]  So we're very, very excited about that.
[57:53.480 --> 57:55.480]  And then we're going to go into the third hour.
[57:55.480 --> 58:02.480]  Dr. Steve Pachinnick, formerly with different intelligence agencies, will be joining us to give his view on the ongoing attempt for civil unrest in the country.
[58:02.480 --> 58:07.480]  And how he thinks the first 10 days of Trump have gone, that's all coming up.
[58:07.480 --> 58:14.480]  I haven't gotten into more on the travel ban, which isn't a travel ban and isn't a Muslim ban.
[58:14.480 --> 58:20.480]  And by the way, Trump set to let in close to a thousand refugees just this week, but they're vetted.
[58:20.480 --> 58:23.480]  We know who they are, and they're women and their children.
[58:23.480 --> 58:28.480]  They're not military-aged men that have Facebook pages going Allah Akbar with Islamic jihad stuff.
[58:28.480 --> 58:34.480]  Oh yeah, 80% of the refugees that came into Europe were military-aged men, and close to that had fake passports.
[58:34.480 --> 58:39.480]  This is the jihad army. I mean, Europe's taking them back for, quote, retraining and social work.
[58:39.480 --> 58:41.480]  And to quote, rehabilitate them.
[58:41.480 --> 58:43.480]  Okay, they're letting jihadis in.
[58:43.480 --> 58:45.480]  All Trump's doing is what's saying.
[58:45.480 --> 59:05.480]  More I think about it, it's just crazy.
[59:16.480 --> 59:25.480]  Supermail, vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:25.480 --> 59:29.480]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[59:29.480 --> 59:31.480]  And this part is most important.
[59:31.480 --> 59:38.480]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:38.480 --> 59:42.480]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and resecured.
[59:42.480 --> 59:44.480]  You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[59:44.480 --> 59:47.480]  That's infowarswives.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[59:47.480 --> 59:49.480]  Take action now before we sell out.
[59:52.480 --> 59:55.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.480 --> 1:00:21.480]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:28.480]  Our republic has been down, but not out. And now across the planet, nation states on the verge of extinction.
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:42.480]  Not perfect, but based on foundations of culture and society are rallying to pull away from the giant squid that is the new world order.
[1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  And in the depths of lies in a sea of fraud, I MSM, we do battle as we struggle towards the surface.
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:59.480]  What a time to be alive, my friends. What a time to be alive.
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:13.480]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us. I was going to have Owen Schreuer at the Muslim capital march that's happening across the country, the nation's capital, state capitals and federal capital on in like 45 minutes.
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:18.480]  But he tells me that the Muslim march is petering out. So I'm sure we'll have excerpts of that later in the broadcast.
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:31.480]  We also again have so much news that it's mind boggling. But Paul Joseph Watson from London will be heading up our new London bureau. He is going to be hosting the fourth hour as well.
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:42.480]  So that is all coming up. We obviously all eagerly await the Supreme Court justice nomination, but all three men that are at the top of the ticket.
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:49.480]  Have very conservative backgrounds and pedigrees and are strict constructionist. So we should know by this evening.
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:56.480]  But either way, slice it looks like Trump is delivering on going with judges that he said he would from the original list that was issued.
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:04.480]  That was compiled by a big computer program and the stat organization for the most conservative judges in America.
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:10.480]  And then Trump has been selected from that is what he does as a businessman is he uses computer models.
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:16.480]  And I'll assure you, just at the level we're at in commerce, we have access to a lot of templates and data systems.
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:24.480]  The general public isn't available to quite frankly use or understand in everyday transactions.
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:38.480]  But the stuff that Trump gets from the big, big firms like Bloomberg and others is like NSA and Booze Allen and all these other organizations.
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:45.480]  I mean, that's what Trump's. Oh, I'm going to get intelligence from three or four socialist, globalist, liberal CIA people.
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:54.480]  Handpicked by Obama to come over here and spy on me and jack on jack with me when his own generals are saying don't get near these people.
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:59.480]  Everybody knows there's a whole bunch of CIA is probably seven, eight of them.
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  There's the left of CIA. There's the army mercenary arm of the CIA. There's the Catholic arm of it.
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:15.480]  I mean, this is this is so much. And you sit there and you look at it and you see him like the CIA says Trump.
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:25.480]  No, not good. The CIA, Brennan, an admitted Wahhabist and a communist in college.
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:31.480]  How do you make this stuff up? Dirt bags. What he is still threatening the president today.
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:40.480]  I mean, that is that is unprecedented that shows he's got big, powerful multinationals behind him who are trying to figure out how to take Trump down.
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:48.480]  But Trump has a lot of the good people in government on his side.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:54.480]  And he has the American people on his side and the MSM is so discredited that the more they attack him, the better.
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:59.480]  You know, Spicer and everybody, I know we're smart guys, but they keep trying to get the media to be nice and stop lying.
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:05.480]  Just just just go in there and battle them and let them tell lies and expose their lies and destroy them.
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:08.480]  Instead of arguing with them, just expose them, move forward.
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:19.480]  And I almost don't want ABC and CBS and CNN and MSNBC cut out of the briefing rooms, even though they are proven fake news and globalist and foreign owned, multinational owned.
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:28.480]  I want them there frothing and flailing and you know, lying and just doing what they do because it just further destroys them.
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:35.480]  They know they're destroyed. They know they're hated. They know they're the political equivalent of zombies.
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:43.480]  They're the walking dead. They're the undead dinosaur reanimated movement and they only exist in the fantasy world.
[1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:50.480]  But if you believe in the fantasy world and tune into them, then you are in a world of zombies because it's fantasy.
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:59.480]  You can always live in Neverland and make believe I choose not to and more and more people are breaking with the fantasy world.
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:06.480]  There's one ex-official that's calling on Mexico to, quote, unleash drug cartels to punish President Trump.
[1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.480]  He's suggesting that drugs should be allowed to flow freely into the U.S.
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:13.480]  Of course, I'm talking about former Secretary of Foreign Affairs George Castaneda.
[1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:19.480]  He's calling on Mexico to punish Trump for his actions on deporting illegals here in the U.S. and building a border wall.
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:24.480]  He's suggesting that criminal cartels should be allowed to run drugs freely in the U.S.
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:34.480]  During an interview on CNN, the ex-official suggested that drug cartels could be unleashed on the U.S. as retribution for, quote, Trump's aggressive stance toward Mexico.
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:37.480]  He goes on to say, Mexico has a lot of negotiating ships in this matter.
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:43.480]  For example, drugs that come through Mexico from South America or drugs that are produced here in Mexico all go to the U.S.
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:44.480]  This is not our problem.
[1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:50.480]  We've been cooperating with the U.S. for many years on these issues because they've asked us to and because we have a friendly, trustful relationship.
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:51.480]  You know what, pal?
[1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:56.480]  That relationship does include a wall which is being built whether you like it or not.
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:24.480]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:29.480]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing it for years and people that currently are testing it for us,
[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:30.480]  they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:31.480]  What did they really say about them?
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.480]  They want to know how do they get it?
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:34.480]  Where do they find it?
[1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:38.480]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:41.480]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:42.480]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:43.480]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:44.480]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:45.480]  It's waterproof.
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:46.480]  You can wear it.
[1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:47.480]  It's comfortable.
[1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:48.480]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:50.480]  Again, funding Infowars.
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:53.480]  Get the game changing in nanotech tubes.
[1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:54.480]  It's a win-win.
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:55.480]  $200.

[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:16.480]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:25.480]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:29.480]  I love getting up in the morning to see my children spend time with my family.
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:36.480]  But I love getting up now because it's like we're in another world, isn't it?
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:39.480]  Or in between two worlds.
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:45.480]  We've got the globalists, and they're playing for war and poverty and collapse and racism.
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:49.480]  And class warfare, and then you've got Trump just delivering pure Americana.
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:52.480]  Every promise he said he would engage in.
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:57.480]  We're 10 days in, and the word that's been used is dizzy.
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:08:58.480]  It's amazing.
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:03.480]  We're going to break down the imminent Supreme Court announcement, the huge hoax that it's a crisis.
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:04.480]  He's been discredited.
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:06.480]  He stopped people from these countries.
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:08.480]  California's going to succeed.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:10.480]  All of it lies.
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.480]  He did exactly what Jimmy Carter and Obama and everybody else did.
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:15.480]  He did his job.
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:16.480]  Imagine if he let people in.
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:17.480]  There were terror attacks.
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:19.480]  The media would then blame him.
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:21.480]  They covered up for Obama.
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.480]  But it didn't work because the mainstream media isn't the only media.
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:28.480]  Now, Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be with us for the balance of the hour here in about five minutes.
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:30.480]  We're going to him with big announcements.
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:38.480]  investigative journalist Dr. Jerome Corsi has officially joined Info Wars as the man is going to set up our Washington Bureau.
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:45.480]  But I want to go to Owen Shroyer because we're going to have him on later, but the Muslim march on the Capitol is happening in every state, supposedly, and in DC.
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.480]  The Muslim march on the Capitol is breaking up right now.
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:51.480]  He's down there getting a report.
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:54.480]  Owen, tell us what you've witnessed.
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.480]  Well, Alex, it was kind of a mixed bag out here.
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:05.480]  There were a pretty good number of protesters, but kind of what we've seen lately with the protest is where they don't want to admit that they're actually out here protesting Trump.
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.480]  So they kind of, you know, will steer it in a different direction.
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  They didn't really mention the travel ban much when the speakers were talking.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  Most of it was just talking about trying to make Muslim American relations better, which I think we can all get behind that.
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:19.480]  We just want it to be based in truth.
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:27.480]  Now, the best part of the event, and I actually captured this on footage, and I think it kind of illustrates exactly what we're dealing with here with the double thing.
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:32.480]  Now, they were protesting because of Trump's travel ban and because of Trump's wall.
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:37.480]  Now, I tried to get in and film the speaker, Alex, and you know what happened?
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.480]  They made a wall around me and banned me from getting in.
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:44.480]  So they're out here literally, this is literally happened.
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:51.480]  I have it on video chanting no ban, no wall as they banned me from getting into the event and walled me off.
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:53.480]  So, and okay, I understand it.
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:54.480]  You want to protect the speakers?
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  What do you do?
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.480]  You build a wall just like Trump wants to do.
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:03.480]  Down here, they're going to do a wall. So there it is, come back, do your piece and say we see the hypocrisy show the Great Wall of China.
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:04.480]  But when they do it, it's okay.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  When Mexico has a wall on its southern border, which they better have, Guatemala is dangerous, it's okay.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.480]  Obama wanted to give $75 million to help support that wall, by the way.
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.480]  That's right.
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:19.480]  But then, meanwhile, they won't let us get into the Trump inauguration, but then the women march the next day, nobody stops them.
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:23.480]  And then now, everywhere you get around leftist, they try to ban everybody else's speech.
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:25.480]  They put signs in front of your face.
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:32.480]  They build walls. So the headline is, Muslims decry Trump wall and then build their own.
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  I mean, this is amazing.
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:35.480]  But you know what? But here's the thing, Alex, these weren't Muslim people.
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:39.480]  These were the same white women that yell white male privilege at whatever Trump protests.
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  The Muslims that I met out here were nice people.
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:45.480]  They said, hey, I just came out here to meet Americans and say, look, we're not bad people.
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  We can actually get along.
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:47.480]  So it was amazing.
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:50.480]  By the way, we're not trying to lionize the minorities and the Muslims.
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:55.480]  It's true, the nasty ones, unfortunately, are mainly weird, ugly white women.
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.480]  I don't understand this.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:01.480]  So like I said, and I actually spoke to a few Muslims, we have it on camera.
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.480]  They're out here like, oh, you know, the travel ban.
[1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:04.480]  Maybe I like it. Maybe I don't.
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:07.480]  But I just came out here today to show that I'm a Muslim American.
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:08.480]  I'm a citizen.
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:10.480]  I love this country and I want to protect this country too.
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:13.480]  But we need to know that you don't have to look down upon us.
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:14.480]  You don't have to look bad.
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  We're not the bad guys.
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:21.480]  And then the sad thing is, unfortunately, again, the non-Muslim people out here are permitting you from talking to people.
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:22.480]  They say, go home, go home.
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:23.480]  We caught on video.
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:24.480]  Go home.
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:25.480]  Don't talk to them.
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:26.480]  They just want confrontation.
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:27.480]  Go home, go home.
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:28.480]  Please don't talk to them.
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:29.480]  Like, wait a second.
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:30.480]  We're trying to come together.
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:31.480]  We need to talk.
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  So it's a mixed bag.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.480]  Well, you know why every rally you go to around the country that's funded by Soros,
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:39.480]  and he admittedly funds it all, about half of it total, but every major group is,
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:43.480]  they're afraid that their followers who are dumbed down will talk to a real person
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:47.480]  and might go get a hamburger or, you know, a drink with you.
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:51.480]  And so they've got to keep their little dwindling numbers together and keep them in the cult.
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:54.480]  Cults never let you talk to outside groups.
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:01.480]  That's the main hallmark, and the Democratic Party has gone from a bunch of cooks to outright cult.
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:04.480]  And before you go to Jerome Corsi, you're exactly right.
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:06.480]  We've captured that on video multiple times.
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:09.480]  The one last point I'll make before you go to Jerome is we tried to go.
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:14.480]  There was a prayer, a unity prayer happening at the First United Methodist Church right here behind me.
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.480]  I tried to get into that.
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:16.480]  I couldn't get into that.
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:17.480]  You know why?
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.480]  Because they want to register and vet the people getting in.
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:21.480]  I get it completely.
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:22.480]  Let's keep the event safe.
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  Again, it's just the irony and the hypocrisy.
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:28.480]  You know, you're making some good points, and I know Dr. Corsi's sitting there.
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:31.480]  He's happy for you to continue for a few more minutes.
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.480]  Other observations, Owen?
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:39.480]  Well, there was one man who was out here who was protesting Sharia law.
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:42.480]  He had a sign that said Jesus saves and a no Sharia law sign,
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:45.480]  and he was kind of met by people that were singing at him.
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:48.480]  Again, but the weirdest thing about this is,
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:55.480]  if the people that were singing at that guy in support of bringing together Muslims and Americans,
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  they're not even Muslim.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:59.480]  It's the same thing in a Black Lives Matter rally.
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.480]  All the people are white.
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:03.480]  All the people that are out here were white.
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:05.480]  The Muslim people that I talked to were just like,
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:08.480]  hey, yeah, we're just out here to show that there are people in America that are Muslims
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.480]  that are just law-abiding citizens.
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:11.480]  That's what they really wanted to do.
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:14.480]  Well, any Muslims that have really been in violent Islamic countries,
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.480]  a lot of them came here to escape it,
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:18.480]  and they're really what you call moderate Muslims,
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:20.480]  or what jihadis would call heretics,
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.480]  and they're the ones usually getting killed in attacks.
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:27.480]  Let's be clear, most Muslims in this country are hardworking good people,
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:31.480]  but the dominant culture of Saudi Arabia that's taking over all of Islam
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:35.480]  is incredibly oppressive and just absolutely out of control
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:38.480]  and trying to hin-peck everybody into submission right now,
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.480]  and they're using the terror attacks that are coming from their own organization
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.480]  to try to then call for censoring our speech.
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.480]  That's why it's not compatible.
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:51.480]  We cannot take people into the country that come from these war-torn areas
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:54.480]  because most of them are the invaders that couldn't take over Syria,
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:57.480]  who came from all over the Muslim world to take it over
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  and steal somebody's house or farmland.
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:02.480]  They've had their butts kicked into Europe and into the United States right now.
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:06.480]  Well, and look, we've been talking about the interference,
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:08.480]  the U.S. interference in the Middle East for a long time,
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:11.480]  and all the wrongdoings that our government is responsible for over there.
[1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:13.480]  So you sit here and you try to scratch your head and you say,
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:16.480]  five of the seven countries that are on the travel ban,
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:19.480]  Obama bombed for eight years, eight years.
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:23.480]  You don't think there's people in those countries that hate us because we bombed them for eight years?
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:27.480]  Exactly. Obama, more than anybody in Hillary, destabilized the whole Middle East.
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:30.480]  They funded the Arab Spring. They're behind this whole thing.
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:33.480]  We'll talk to you more once you get back in studio later and follow those reports.
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:34.480]  I can't wait to see those.
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:35.480]  You got it, Alex.
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:40.480]  Wow. Talk about hypocrisy being illustrated and writ large for all to see.
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:45.480]  The left blocking people getting into their public meeting at the first Methodist church
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:50.480]  that's literally run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is unbelievable.
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:53.480]  I've been there. I've been a guest there before. It's pretty shocking.
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:58.480]  And then on top of that, just down the street, 200 yards away at the Capitol,
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:03.480]  the liberals are out there protecting the Muslims from the press.
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:07.480]  When all they want to do is talk to them, you should want to talk to the press.
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:12.480]  Now joining us for the balance of the hour is Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.480]  Follow him at Twitter at Jerome underscore Corsi.
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:20.480]  He formerly has done a great job for, I guess, 12 years or so with WorldNet Daily.
[1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:23.480]  What three-time number one New York Times bestselling author.
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:26.480]  He basically pioneered along with Lou Dobbs and others.
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:28.480]  I'd give great credit along with him for wars and drugs,
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:33.480]  but really Corsi and Dobbs more than anybody exposing NAFTA GATT TPP globalism.
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:35.480]  And so so much of what he's worked for.
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:37.480]  We're now seeing take place.
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:44.480]  So I'm really honored to have him as the lead man to be our Washington bureau chief
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:47.480]  and to set this up in Washington, D.C.
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:50.480]  And how successful it is is up to him, myself, you, the listeners,
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:55.480]  and of course, all of you out there that support the broadcast by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:59.480]  So Dr. Corsi, it's great to have you here with your maiden voyage.
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.480]  I mean, it really had made you been coming on the show for about 12, 13 years,
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:04.480]  but it's great to have you.
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:10.480]  Well, Alex, it's a real honor to join InfoWars, to join Alex Jones and your whole group.
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:12.480]  You've done great reporting over the years.
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:16.480]  I'm honored now to be an official part of InfoWars.
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:23.480]  I'm very excited to get to Washington to establish press credentials at the White House
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:28.480]  and to create the Washington News Bureau for InfoWars.
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:34.480]  I this morning called and got the information from the White House press office.
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:42.480]  I've now filed the email I was requested to for press credentials, all my birth certificate.
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:46.480]  My birth, I have to have a birth certificate, of course, Barack Obama.
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:52.480]  And, you know, all the information, drivers licenses, social security numbers.
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:56.480]  And I've asked for passes for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week.
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:02.480]  So hopefully as soon as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday next week, InfoWars.com is going to be
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.480]  in the press briefings at the White House as White House accredited press.
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.480]  Well, I want you to be able to continue, but everybody knows I'm not at a loss for words.
[1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:16.480]  The media really likes to imply that we're the fake news, they're the real news,
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:21.480]  but the president himself keeps saying, no, you're the fake news and exposing them.
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.480]  We're the press that helped get the president elected along with Breitbart and Drudge
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:28.480]  and WorldNet Daily and others and Daily Caller does a great job too.
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:34.480]  We're all in this together battling the Glenn Becks and other Judas Goats, you know, of the world.
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:39.480]  And we've even, you know, seen the attempt to coot Fox to bring in a bunch of leftist globalism fail.
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:43.480]  And so we're seeing the ascension of, you know, patriots there like Tucker Carlson.
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:48.480]  So a lot of exciting things, but, you know, I was in a Facebook mentions and just mentioned that
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:52.480]  I ran into some senior people that had worked in the campaign and are working for Trump.
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:55.480]  They're like, oh, we love Paul Watson. When's he coming? Are you going to have a bureau?
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:59.480]  Blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, oh, I'm sure I just took it as a foregone conclusion that that would happen.
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:03.480]  You know, I certainly am not going to quote what the president's told me, but I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:07.480]  And the hundreds of articles saying Jones caught lying. He doesn't have credentials.
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:11.480]  They haven't been issued yet. They haven't issued any. It's starting next week, as you know.
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:16.480]  So, so they take everything we do and twist it to make it sound like we're outcast. We're failures.
[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:22.480]  It's so ridiculous. Info wars and your work and all of it is seminal and changing the world.
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:28.480]  And we're not bragging. We're explaining why MSM demonizes us and belittles us, hoping that our listeners
[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.480]  and viewers think they're small as well when they have changed the world.
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:39.480]  When what we're doing is now taking over the planet. I mean, the globalists admit they're in full panic
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:44.480]  and they admit in internal papers that have been leaked that they want to shut down drudge info wars by name.
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:51.480]  But then Dr. Corsi, we don't have any power and we're a big joke. The truth is we're changing the world.
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:58.480]  And Alex, I had press credentials in 2012. I was traveling press with Romney's campaign on his airplane
[1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:04.480]  for three weeks at the end of the campaign. White House press office today didn't think there would be any problem.
[1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:11.480]  Info wars and Alex Jones and me getting press credentials was very cordial conversation.
[1:20:11.480 --> 1:20:20.480]  I expect to be cleared perhaps tomorrow in order to be able to know I can get credentials when I show up at the White House on Monday.
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:29.480]  Now, the real fake news and my first article within four words today pointing out that Google is now trying to worm its way
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:39.480]  into the Trump White House. I mean, this is a huge organization, Google, that has been a solid backer of the Clintons
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:49.480]  and Democratic leftist causes. In fact, Eric Schmidt, the founder of Google, actually was one of the top campaign
[1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:57.480]  advisors for Hillary Clinton. He considered himself the top outside advisor and I'm going to put together an article for tomorrow
[1:20:57.480 --> 1:21:05.480]  showing that the father of fake news is none other than this guy, Brock, down and running in a media matters.
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:11.480]  And his co-conspirator in the fake news is Google, which is now trying to block organizations.
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:13.480]  They won't even say which organizations they're blocking.
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:21.480]  And let's be clear, they had almost daily meetings three times a week officially with Obama and then daily meetings with Hillary
[1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:29.480]  and Podesta crafting what search terms were allowed, controlling the entire narrative beyond communist Chinese style censorship.
[1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:35.480]  And now they're trying to weasel into the White House like they're these big friends. Now, Google has a lot of great services
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:40.480]  and some good people. I'm not saying I hate the whole organization. You know, we've done a lot of big things through their platforms like YouTube.
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:49.480]  But the issue here is this is a group that literally, as you said, was the high command of Hillary's operation.
[1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:56.480]  And so Trump needs to be absolutely aware of these people. If this isn't folks letting on the Trojan horse, I don't know what is.
[1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:09.480]  Well, and also Google has all of these capabilities of taking clicks and gaining information, profiling, micro profiling, perhaps the whole population.
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:19.480]  Anybody using a Google search engine and what Schmidt and Google were doing for Hillary was taking this data on us as Internet users.
[1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:22.480]  So when they go to your door, you they have a computer with everything about you.
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:27.480]  And let's be clear, they have intelligence files on everyone, including the president.
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:36.480]  Yes, that's right. And these intelligence files are being used by the Democrats and Hillary to go take what Obama did and his data managing techniques.
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:41.480]  And this is very powerful. When these people show up at your door, they're targeting you to vote.
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:48.480]  They know what you like, you know, what subscriptions you have to magazines, what you watch on TV, what you click on the Internet.
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:51.480]  They've got all this data and Google offered.
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:23:01.480]  And we see it in the WikiLeaks released emails from Podesta, where Eric Schmidt was offering to provide all this data to Hillary and to create a data file.
[1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:07.480]  And that is literally a billion times what Nixon got impeached for. I mean, this is what's about to be impeached for.
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:09.480]  I mean, explain how big a deal this is.
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:15.480]  Openly, publicly, and it's in the WikiLeaks saying, we're going to give you intelligence files on everybody.
[1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:28.480]  It completely violates any privacy idea. I mean, it means anything you do on the Internet now, if you do it through Google, is going to be subject to being provided to Democratic operatives so you can be profiled.
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:35.480]  Now, we know the Democrats, when they were in charge of the federal government, they were taking this information, they were giving it to the IRS.
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:42.480]  You had an apartment justice that was completely politicized, CIA under John Brennan totally politicized.
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:56.480]  This data that Google has is enormously powerful if it can be used either to get voters for Hillary to the polls or punish and prevent those that the data, the Google data,
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:03.480]  shows the Democratic operatives are voters that are going to be of supporting Trump or supporting conservative causes.
[1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:17.480]  This is really a fake news is a made up term, which is the code words for keeping conservative views off the Internet, keeping Alex Jones out of the public view.
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:24.480]  That's what fake news is all about. That's where Google, that's where Brock, that's where the left is headed and make no mistake about it.
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:31.480]  Their final aim is to say we're fake news and InfoWars does not have a right to exist.
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:41.480]  Dr. Corsi, you're on target as usual, and that's exactly what they were planning to do when Hillary got in because they believed she was going to win because they were basically skewing the poll numbers.
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:45.480]  They tried to steal a bunch of states. We now know that, but they failed.
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:50.480]  And so now they're in panic mode from your research and talking to folks in the Beltway and others.
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:25:00.480]  What are your biggest concerns? Because I don't want to get too confident here. That's why I've committed to basically spend everybody's capital we've got and mortgage the house down the road if I have to,
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:12.480]  to really fund us being in D.C., New York and other areas to be there exposing fake news, when the MSM crawls out of their hole because we have to be on the field as real media.
[1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:20.480]  We have to step up to the plate and basically just by beating there, move these people out of the way.
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:34.480]  Well, that's my whole commitment to create a Washington Bureau for you, Alex, for InfoWars because it's going to take an army of our journalists who are trained to present the truth, to research.
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:47.480]  Because you've got, I mean, just watch any White House press briefing, even write the few that Trump has held and you've got, you know, the front row is still the comfortable mainstream media, CNN and Scots there.
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:58.480]  We ought to get banned and others and Spicer. They should create maybe a lottery where it literally is a deal with numbers in it and it scrambles and then people reach in and get what they get and that's where you sit.
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:13.480]  And get a bigger room, get a room where we can really set up and have a number of people in this audience who are not just the, you know, selected Washington correspondents who are all of a like ideological leftist agenda.
[1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:25.480]  We're all set out to attack everything Donald Trump does. We've got to do is establish a Washington Bureau. We've got reporters capable of digging down the facts and countering the mainstream media line.
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:37.480]  Sure. And here's an example. Imagine Breitbart, who is now there or Imphal Wars or Drudge had a correspondent. Imagine we would ask the right questions like you've been criticized with non existing, you know, proof of being funded by the Russians.
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:51.480]  But what about Saudi Arabia in this news article print such and such bragging that one fifth of Hillary's funding comes from them or what about the Communist Chinese in the people's daily openly bragging that Trump will not be elected because they're putting funds in the campaign.
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:58.480]  Why isn't the president and you defending yourselves with the fact that the proof is Hillary was foreign finance, not you.
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:12.480]  Well, and also what about these protesters who obviously we just saw from the report in front of the Capitol, you know, I'm not. These are paid protesters. These are what Kramer was doing.
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:25.480]  We had exposed Astro Turf keep Astro. These are Astro Turf protests. These are thugs. You know, I was at the inaugural with my wife and these protesters are there.
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:34.480]  You know, foul mouth in your face wanting to fight crazy, you know, recruited professional thugs who probably don't have a clue what they're out there.
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:43.480]  I'm glad you were able to get in. We had to go to three different entrances and I saw them beating women up on purpose and the police ordered to do nothing and we have it on video.
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:53.480]  It was just so insane. And then you go on the news and they said Alex Jones was kicked out of the inauguration and arrested showing footage of the police protecting me in Cleveland.
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.480]  So they didn't even get the right city.
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:04.480]  The woman right in front of my wife was attacked by one of the protesters. Fortunately, at least grab the guy and protected her.
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:10.480]  But I mean, we were walking in all kinds of different ways to get into the inaugural balls of the convention center.
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:15.480]  It took us over two hours just with the protesters and yet people did persist and get in.
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:20.480]  But these protesters were violent. They should have all been arrested by the police.
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:25.480]  Police are standing there watching them. They're not sweeping the streets. They're not clearing them.
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:28.480]  We've got to realize that these are not your 1960s.
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:34.480]  Absolutely. You've got a right to go protest. I do it all the time. Do it in the area. Don't block the street. Don't attack anybody.
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:41.480]  But no, I mean, I've been arrested twice for doing nothing demonstrating but because I was being loud.
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  Okay, fine. The point is, is that they literally were attacking people in front of me. I couldn't believe it.
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:29:03.480]  Well, and I've got the information. I'll be developing an article here very quickly that Russia is actually supporting and funding these terrorists who are out as protesters to disrupt Trump and to disrupt the inauguration of these other events.
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:10.480]  This is Russia. You know, the whole idea that Russia was wanting to elect Trump is nonsense.
[1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:21.480]  Russia was funding through the workers of the world and through other communist groups the recruiting of these crazies to be protesting Donald Trump and disrupting rallies.
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:24.480]  Russia's whole goal was to create chaos.
[1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:29.480]  Now, this is bombshell because I've known you 15 years. I've never seen you make anything up.
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:34.480]  The whole narrative we've been shown is we have WikiLeaks that Hillary was doing this and Soros was doing this.
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:45.480]  Well, why would Russia be doing it as well? Is it a double game or when will we see the proof of this? I mean, I'm not denying that you've got this information, but this would really, really get so sophisticated it makes my head spin.
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:48.480]  I'll start rating it up for tomorrow. You'll have it tonight.
[1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:51.480]  All right. Well, let's flesh it out more when we come back. Incredible. Stay with us.
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:59.480]  The Empires on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.480 --> 1:30:05.480]  We've seen politicians from across the world like whining, sniffling babies over Trump's immigration ban.
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:14.480]  We've seen city con declare actual war on President Trump because he has the nerve to point out that some people come from terrorist places and we should have a temporary travel ban.
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:23.480]  We've seen Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, actually cry stating that the Statue of Liberty is shedding tears because Liberty has taken such a hit this week because of Trump's ban.
[1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:29.480]  Here's some news for you people. The countries that are on Trump's ban were actually identified by President Obama.
[1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:34.480]  At least 20 alleged terrorists since 2014 have come from countries affected by Trump's immigration ban.
[1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:39.480]  There's an article up today on the Daily Caller and identifies these 20 alleged terrorists.
[1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:45.480]  In the past three years, they were actually immigrants or refugees from seven majority Muslim nations.
[1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:54.480]  President Trump has temporarily banned in his migration ban on Friday. These countries include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
[1:30:54.480 --> 1:31:18.480]  To be allowed to immigrate to the U.S. for the next three months, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.
[1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:29.480]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,

[1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:30.480]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:32.480]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:40.480]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:44.480]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:53.480]  Living Defense, infowarsteam.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarsteam.com.
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:33:20.480]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:38.480]  America is really just 10 female regions under global governance. But I may have to get rid of that liner because now if Trump succeeds, we have restored the Republic.
[1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:50.480]  And notice with TPP, he didn't just, you know, take TPP and then use the negotiation power he has as an executive to make Congress bow down in favors and then make them, you know, do his will.
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:58.480]  He just said, it's unconstitutional. I didn't negotiate it. The American people weren't involved. Congress wasn't involved. It's dead.
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:08.480]  And the power goes back to the states. And he's doing that on every front. Real estate's getting all these perks and all these, you know, free government bailouts and deals.
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:13.480]  Trump just killed that. And meanwhile, look at the investment pouring in to the United States.
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:19.480]  I'm going to go back to Dr. Jerome Corsi for the balance of the hour, get more into this Russia report that I know he's been working on for months.
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:25.480]  He's going to break tomorrow at infowars.com. And I want to run over the gamut of news with him as well.
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:36.480]  But before we do that, remember Hillary's book, stronger together. Well, it only sold 2,912 copies.
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:43.480]  That's right. That's what it sold. Isn't that just cute? Dr. Corsi sold 100,000 books in one week before.
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:48.480]  Well, we've got the making of the president 2016 by Roger Stone that is so powerful.
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  And we have got these right here at infowars.com and you can get them signed for 1995.
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:03.480]  That's hard cover out of the gates, discounted by $5. Some places bookstores are selling us for like $29.95.
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:08.480]  And it's got never forcing photos, graphs, documents. I mean, it is really impressive.
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:18.480]  And I am so honored to be a big part of the book and how we defeated them and where we're going into the future.
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:28.480]  It really is historic. Get yours today at infowarsstore.com or call toll 3888-253-3139.
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.480]  Really exposes the arrogance of the Clintons and David Brock and all the rest of them.
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:38.480]  And, you know, here's the good news. All I care about is winning. I'm not in competition with anybody else.
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.480]  It's a patriot. I'm just moving forward against the globalist.
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:44.480]  And I understand you're singing from the same sheet of music listeners and viewers.
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:47.480]  And that's why I appreciate you. I'm so humbled.
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:53.480]  You see, I haven't had time to go back and brag about how you went out and wore the Bill Clinton's Arapah shirt
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:59.480]  at hundreds of rallies and took over the media and changed the narrative away from Trump supposedly abusing women with no proof.
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  All the fake lawsuits that have been dropped. We don't have time to sit here and give ourselves credit for all we did.
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:11.480]  But understand we do need to take some credit in the future because it's a blueprint for victory.
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:14.480]  They just hope we forget about all this, but Trump isn't.
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:21.480]  If Trump delivers, which he's beginning to do in ways that are really hard to believe how fast he's moving.
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:25.480]  I mean, this is, he's overperforming in my view.
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:29.480]  If he just keeps doing this, he's going to go down like George Washington 2.0.
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:34.480]  And he's going to be able to secure our children and their children's futures.
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:37.480]  And as goes America, goes the world.
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:41.480]  As Texas goes, goes the nation. And as the nation goes, so goes the world.
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:46.480]  Eisenhower was fond of saying, and you see that happening now, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:50.480]  And I'm very proud of much of the resistance coming out of Texas, not just me.
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:56.480]  They dispatched Beck down here to try to take over and he failed. I don't want to fight with Beck, but he's a true Judas Ascariot.
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:59.480]  So get the book, The Making of the President 2016.
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:01.480]  We've got an 18-wheeler load of them.
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:04.480]  And, you know, the six, seven bucks I make on each book.
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:06.480]  Roger gets a few bucks and the publisher gets the rest.
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:08.480]  Funds are operations.
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:11.480]  So we just saw a lot of books to set up a Washington bureau.
[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:15.480]  We just saw a lot of nutraceuticals, a lot of supplements, a lot of Bill Clinton rape shirts.
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:17.480]  A lot of Trump is my president shirts.
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:23.480]  By the way, you want to meet like-minded people, go out and wear a Trump's My President shirt from infowarstore.com.
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.480]  They'll do it in the leftist area. They'll try to kill you.
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:27.480]  But in most areas, you'll meet a lot of like-minded people.
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:29.480]  That's what this is all about.
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:33.480]  Not about what color you are, but about the ideas in your mind like Martin Luther King talked about.
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:38.480]  And finally, we have available, it's ending soon, 25% off.
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:43.480]  Alexa Pure High Quality Water Filtration Systems, already the best quality system at the lowest price.
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.480]  Not 25% off. You cannot beat these deals.
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:53.480]  And 25% off Alexa Pure Air Systems, Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filter, that are $180 something discounted.
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:59.480]  At $200 something, it's just a blow away deal compared to competitors that are $400 or $500.
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:03.480]  We've got it for $149 right now.
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.480]  Nobody's got an air filter system like this for anywhere even close to $250.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:10.480]  Leading competitors are $400, $500.
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:13.480]  I bought similar systems three, four years ago for $800 apiece.
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:19.480]  Now granted, stuff's getting less expensive because of miniaturization and technology and automation.
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:24.480]  But there's no excuse not to go to m4warstore.com and get the products today.
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:27.480]  And then separately, we're about to sell out a super mill vitality.
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:30.480]  We have 10% off Secret 12, Vitamin B12.
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:32.480]  And I'm taking off on an airplane today.
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:35.480]  I'll be live tomorrow from Los Angeles.
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:38.480]  I'm going to be on the Joe Rogan experience tomorrow.
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:44.480]  Find out more just by Googling his podcast or going to his YouTube channel upwards of 20 million viewers a week.
[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:46.480]  Does the show three times a week.
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:53.480]  And that'll be 130 time, 130 time Pacific that we go on.
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:39:00.480]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to Dr. Jerome Corsi doc.
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:04.480]  Let's flush out this Russia thing and listen, you've broken so many big stories over the year.
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:08.480]  You got the secret documents on NAFTA and GATT and TPP.
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:10.480]  And I mean, you've been a game changer.
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:19.480]  I know there are leftist foundations in Russia that the State Department sends money to that then come back and were against Trump.
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:24.480]  And there was also Russian groups that were for Ukraine being overthrown, but they were really globalist groups.
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.480]  I know you've not been an enemy of Russia or anything.
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.480]  You've supported Trump, wanting to have peace and go up to jihadis.
[1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:39.480]  But I really respect you when you say you've got the investigative reports and the witnesses and people to prove that some type of Russian funding was actually trying to disrupt Trump rallies.
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:41.480]  The question is, who would be behind it in Russia?
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:47.480]  So, so, so break down a little bit of a prelude or an order of what's coming tomorrow.
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:54.480]  Well, I also want to say that Roger Stone's book, and I just posted a review on Amazon.
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:40:00.480]  This is the definitive book of the 2016 campaign and it's written by a master.
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:08.480]  I mean, there's hardly anyone more experienced who knows Donald Trump better, more political operative than Roger Stone.
[1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:17.480]  If you want to understand what happened, why Trump won and why Hillary lost, how Hillary lost, you've got to read.
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:18.480]  You must read.
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:22.480]  This should be required reading in all political science bureaus around the world.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:25.480]  Instead, they're just trying to ignore why Trump won.
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:27.480]  It's got information in it.
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:30.480]  And Roger, really, I think this is Roger's best book.
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:39.480]  He really kind of pours out his soul on this one and his deepest strategies so you can understand that, you know, Trump's victory did not just happen.
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.480]  It was, you know, and you're discussed very extensively in the book.
[1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:52.480]  Alex Jones is made focused on as one of the key reasons why Donald Trump won.
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:58.480]  Your audience, you know, Richard Dixon is called a silent majority and Donald Trump knows it himself.
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:40:59.480]  He's acknowledged it.
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:03.480]  You personally, Alex, and we both know that.
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.480]  Well, it's an amazing time to be alive.
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:09.480]  Let's talk about the Russians and then what you expect the globalists to do to try to stop Trump.
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:20.480]  We're going to understand that Putin, it plays all sides and Russia is always for causing disordered confusion, chaos.
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:31.480]  Russia's benefited from this as part of the whole, you know, fundamentally communist strategy for destabilizing a society in preparation for overturning the government.
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:36.480]  Russia can say all it wants that it's not communist, but Putin's still KGB.
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:41.480]  I think Trump can deal with Putin, but this is going to be a matter of power politics.
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:44.480]  It's not, you know, I've looked Putin in the eye and I see his soul.
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:45.480]  Forget about that.
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:47.480]  Putin's a nation state.
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:51.480]  He's got strong interests and we have to be a nation state with strong interests.
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:42:01.480]  We have to define it maturely with Putin who's going to do what and, you know, when there's legitimate evidence and there is workers of the world, other organizations that are communist funded,
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:17.480]  operatives being sent back to Russia for training, brought back here to the United States, funding coming out of Hillary's campaign through the Democratic National Party into these groups, these operatives,
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:21.480]  operating below the surface to higher thugs.
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:22.480]  And we saw them.
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:24.480]  I mean, I saw them firsthand with my wife.
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.480]  We both going to test to it.
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:29.480]  These are not 60s protesters at the inaugural.
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:31.480]  These are constant.
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:34.480]  Every other word is a foul word.
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:37.480]  Throwing stones, breaking windows.
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:39.480]  These are anarchists.
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:40.480]  They're nuts.
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:48.480]  Some of them are mentally ill, charging in to attack people who are simply trying to go to the gala, you know, to the inaugural gala.
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:54.480]  This is not organized political protests of Martin Luther King Variety.
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:58.480]  This is organized chaos and disruption.
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:42:59.480]  Sure.
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:05.480]  But going back to my point, Russia legitimately is trying to build up its families, bringing back Christianity.
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:11.480]  I don't lionize Putin, but he has made a lot of free market reforms.
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  He has been exposing globalism and promoting nation states, resisting that.
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:19.480]  I understand most governments play a double game as well.
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:24.480]  I just think in general, the globalist anger at Russia, I think is legitimate.
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  I mean, Russia more and more is blocking globalism.
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:36.480]  Well, I mean, there's certain things that Russia does and Putin does that can be to the advantage of ending globalism and advancing the cause of freedom.
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:45.480]  Don't get me wrong, but it's like our government does all kinds of things that if Americans knew what our government was involved in would never approve of.
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:48.480]  So too, Putin plays both sides of the game.
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:51.480]  And Trump is going to have to be sophisticated, and it is.
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:57.480]  I mean, Trump knows that everybody's writing for themselves in international politics.
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:08.480]  And Trump is going to have to deal with Russia and Putin as a nation state that has ambitions in Ukraine, the Crimea, Eastern Europe, its sphere of influence,
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:11.480]  and is going to act to destabilize other countries.
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:12.480]  Rules are going to have to be set.
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:20.480]  We're going to have to expose when Russia is inappropriately working with the Soros left to fund disruptive protests.
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:32.480]  I mean, it's also important because here, Roger Stone is being attacked as being the architect behind WikiLeaks or get Trump as the elected president.
[1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:45.480]  The truth is, Russia did everything it could to attack the Trump campaign and funded these groups who were in the streets protesting, causing riots.
[1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:55.480]  Well, I mean, I want to see it because all I'm saying is Putin is outlawing Soros' groups and rolling up his organizations in Russia.
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:03.480]  So, I mean, I can believe that the way bureaucracy works, you can have leftist in the Russian system that we're going for Hillary.
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:04.480]  I mean, we know that.
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:07.480]  I just don't see it as if.
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:14.480]  But I was also told by some other smart folks that they said, listen, Putin on the surface says he likes Trump and hopes if Trump gets elected,
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:15.480]  they can work together.
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:18.480]  But overall, they want to work with Hillary because they have her penetrated.
[1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:25.480]  They have her emails and they know that Hillary's people got 35 million for the uranium.
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:28.480]  She met twice secretly with Putin.
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:31.480]  Kissinger is an advisor to Putin.
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  So there is some triple sophisticated game going on.
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:45.480]  And Hillary, you know, this I wrote about extensively, I mean, Hillary, it was being paid as was Podesta through money-long during connections in Russian banks.
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:53.480]  They're being paid millions of dollars for transferring U.S. technology to Russia under this, you know, failed reset.
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:54.480]  Sure.
[1:45:54.480 --> 1:45:57.480]  So Trump needs to bring that out and burn the Democrats because here's the deal.
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:45:58.480]  I'm not a vindictive person.
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:45:59.480]  They're not giving up.
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:05.480]  They've got TV shows and movies and vice calling for his death in the New York Times saying he needs to be killed.
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:06.480]  It's a daily drumbeat.
[1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:08.480]  And so we're under attack.
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:11.480]  We haven't won yet and they're doing illegal things.
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:13.480]  And I think Trump needs to take the gloves off.
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:20.480]  I mean, I know he wants to stabilize the economy first, show people prosperity, but they might kill him by the time he gets that done.
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:28.480]  And these protests, what the left is engaging in right now is classic Soviet adjutant propaganda to agitate,
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:30.480]  to create disruption.
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:43.480]  If you take a look and see these protesters in the street through the lens of KGB-funded type protesters through communist organizations operating in the United States,
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:50.480]  as well as Soros, you see the far left is just buying into what would be called agit-prop.
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:52.480]  Well, sure, agitation propaganda.
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:55.480]  But larger than that, I think it's more of a wind-up toy.
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:47:03.480]  Like, the old Soviet Union has pretty much fallen apart and they're kind of more of a Russian Federation and a new Russian Empire is what they're trying to go back to.
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:05.480]  So I agree they want to rebuild and expand.
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:06.480]  No one's debating that.
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  The issue is they haven't expanded much yet.
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:14.480]  And then meanwhile, sure, they're following some old Soviet diagram and template and operating system.
[1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:17.480]  But I don't really see that being directed out of Russia.
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:20.480]  Well, you'll see the evidence starting tomorrow.
[1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:23.480]  It's a big story and you'll see it starting tomorrow.
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:26.480]  But the point is we can deal with Russia.
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:33.480]  For instance, we can cooperate with Russia and Turkey and Egypt in the Middle East to defeat ISIS.
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:38.480]  It doesn't mean we're suddenly going to become your best friends with Putin.
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:41.480]  We can cooperate when the interests match.
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:46.480]  We've got to constantly understand that when the interests don't match, there's going to be conflict.
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:47.480]  Absolutely.
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:55.480]  But expanding on that, why won't Trump, when the Saudi Arabians and the Communist Chinese admittedly funded Hillary,
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:58.480]  and then there's no evidence of a Russian connection to Trump?
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:47:59.480]  That's been documented.
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:02.480]  PP Gate, all of it totally made up, pulled out of Hillary's rear end.
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:03.480]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:04.480]  That's where it comes from.
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:05.480]  Or I guess John McCain's.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:07.480]  Why won't he then bring that up?
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  Why won't he go after him?
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:09.480]  He's got them.
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:16.480]  Well, there's about to be a new day here in the whole new Attorney General and the whole new office of the Attorney General.
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:17.480]  Department of Justice.
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:24.480]  And you're going to have a situation in which the Department of Justice is going to be empowered to investigate a lot of things.
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:26.480]  Hillary Clinton did not get a pardon.
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:29.480]  The Clinton Foundation is still in operation.
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:30.480]  And I agree.
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:32.480]  What does it signify that Obama didn't give that term?
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  Well, Obama would have had to make the pardon public.
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:41.480]  He can't do a private pardon that is not known.
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:43.480]  If he did, I think it would be illegitimate.
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  The pardon has to be efficient.
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:47.480]  Let's shift gears then.
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:55.480]  Let's shift gears to the Supreme Court that we're hearing about tonight, the new pick, and then other things Trump faces after the break.
[1:48:55.480 --> 1:49:01.480]  But first, just as an American as a patriot, somebody had been defending this country for 50-something years.
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:03.480]  State Department, anti-terrorism, you name it.
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:05.480]  What do you think of Trump?
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:07.480]  Because he's almost too good to be true for me.
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:12.480]  It's so ridiculous how he's doing everything he said he would so decisively.
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:13.480]  And look at what he does.
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:16.480]  It's all so researched and so well done.
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:17.480]  It's almost uncanny.
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:21.480]  Well, I've known Trump for, you know, four years, watched him in New York.
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:27.480]  I virtually lived in the plaza for about two or three years, and I was working in financial services.
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:28.480]  Trump is the real deal.
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:29.480]  I said this from the very beginning.
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:31.480]  You said this two years ago on my show.
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:32.480]  I did.
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:33.480]  Trump is the real deal.
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:34.480]  I mean, he is going to deliver.
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:37.480]  He's going to deliver far more than anybody expects him to deliver.
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:39.480]  He's going to keep the campaign promises.
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.480]  He's going to rip into this left like the left has never seen it.
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:54.480]  You think Trump cares if the left goes insane because he had a limited travel ban on seven
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:56.480]  countries for a short period of time.
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:49:58.480]  Trump doesn't care if they all go nuts.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  He's going to continue the ban.
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:01.480]  He's within his legal rights to do it.
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:07.480]  And Trump is happy to expose the left as being completely off the wall and insane and lying
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:10.480]  and distorting what he really did.
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:12.480]  Trump trapped the left into this.
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:14.480]  Well, he's going to do it continuously.
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:16.480]  Supreme Court nomination is going to be one.
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:22.480]  I think that all patriots who love America and who wants the Constitution restored are
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:24.480]  going to be able to embrace and champion.
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:30.480]  And you're going to see Schumer and the others in Congress, no matter who the nomination is,
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  launching up to protest and obstruct.
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  The American people, I think, are going to get very sick and tired of seeing the Democrats
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.480]  just trying to block Trump to go back to a failed agenda of a bombing.
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.480]  All right, you're really a banking expert.
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.480]  That's what you really did until you were a journalist 20 years ago.
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:47.480]  I want to get into the world economy.
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:53.480]  Can Trump stave off a world financial collapse that Dent and Ron Paul and others believe is
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:54.480]  basically overdue?
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:59.480]  They both say Trump's doing great stuff, but they think it's a day late, a dollar short.
[1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:02.480]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:07.480]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:09.480]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:12.480]  I'm Charity Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:18.480]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:24.480]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:33.480]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:34.480]  We're the solution.
[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:37.480]  Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:42.480]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin,
[1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:46.480]  theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:55.480]  or a shed some tears over the red, white, and blue, Revelation, the movie.info.
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:58.480]  American's need to see this film, Revelation, the movie.info.
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:51:59.480]  Let's fix it.
[1:51:59.480 --> 1:52:01.480]  My name is Robin.
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:02.480]  I'm 47 years of age.
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:05.480]  I absolutely love One World Way.
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:10.480]  It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein powder.
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:13.480]  One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:16.480]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:19.480]  I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors,
[1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:23.480]  and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:27.480]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way.
[1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:32.480]  I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Way too.
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:38.480]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it.
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:44.480]  Thank you, synergistic nutrition for perfecting a protein powder in the product One World Way.
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:49.480]  From taste to how it makes me and my family feel, you get an A plus plus.

[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:22.480]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.480]  With George Pratt, his partner and brother Billy too.
[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:34.480]  They crossed the Yukon River and found the bonanza gold.
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:39.480]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Rome.
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:43.480]  Sam crossed the majestic mountains too.
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:48.480]  There's an article backing up what, of course he was just talking about in this big article that's on Infowars.com.
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:53.480]  Google's Eric Schmidt. Trump and men will do evil things.
[1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:57.480]  And this is just out today.
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:03.480]  Report. Hillary allies think Obama, not Putin, cost her the election.
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:07.480]  Where do you think Hillary goes? What's her legacy? She looks sicker than ever.
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:11.480]  I mean, I don't think the left and the globalists themselves realize how much trouble they're in.
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:15.480]  I mean, I see the Davos forum with the Communist Chinese president coming and saying,
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:21.480]  don't worry, I'll prop you up and lecturing us even in the Wall Street Journal how we should censor the alt-right.
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:27.480]  I mean, it seems like they don't realize how much trouble they're in though.
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:35.480]  Well, I think that's right, Alex. I think you're going to see, step by step, Donald Trump is going to take on the left.
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:40.480]  He's going to take on Hillary Clinton. She's not out of the woods yet. She's not been pardoned.
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:45.480]  The foundation is still operating. Every day that foundation stays open.
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:50.480]  The Clintons are guilty of enurement, benefiting out of that foundation personally.
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.480]  There are criminal charges that should be brought and they shouldn't be excused.
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  You asked about the financial issue. I think you're going to see also Trump taking on Janet Yellen at the Fed.
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:07.480]  The entire Obama administration, the Fed has kept interest rates at zero.
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:13.480]  It's a fake non-growth, but it hasn't been the depression it ought to have been under Obama.
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:18.480]  The job growth has been non-existent because it's all been part-time jobs.
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:25.480]  You have millions and millions of more people who've just dropped out of the labor force and another $10 trillion in debt.
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:33.480]  I mean, if the Fed had not been a willing accomplice, Obama could not have pulled off this crime on future generations.
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:40.480]  And now the Fed isn't going to issue QE3 because Trump's in, so what effect does that have? Can Trump pull us out of this?
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:44.480]  Yeah, I think the key element, the first and most important is growth.
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:51.480]  I mean, with economic growth, there's a lot we can do that you never saw explored by Obama because the growth was anemic.
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:53.480]  All you had with Obama was regulations.
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:55.480]  Well, it was selective. It was only to the elites.
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:05.480]  And that's right. You saw the very top getting exceedingly wealthy. So Eric Schmidt now has $11 billion and that's what his net worth is.
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:11.480]  And the average person is wondering about how they're going to make their car payments and their mortgage payments, credit card payments.
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:15.480]  Most people are living paycheck to paycheck in the United States.
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:30.480]  And the elite in Hollywood and the Eric Schmidt's and Google are having these Obama permitted and Hillary permitted fortunes to be achieved by having monopolies that should not be existing.
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:34.480]  I mean, Google's power, I think I'm going to continue to write on this Google theme.
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:48.480]  It also involves regulatory decisions that were made in Google's favor, control of data. You're going to see Google being exposed for what it is, which is a democratic data operation.
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:56.480]  And I dare Google to try to start blocking info wars as they've done on Chrome and other areas and they had to pull back because we're exposing this.
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:02.480]  We have a right as citizens to not be manipulated and to not have you dominate and control the press in the White House.
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:09.480]  I'm not out to get Google. Google has been out to get us. And I'm sorry, their monopoly stops when it touches my First Amendment.
[1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:20.480]  Well, and also it's a process of defending ourselves. I mean, if Hillary had won, you can bet the FCC, which was in the process.
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:24.480]  Oh, they admitted they were going to start shutting down a free press. I mean, Obama signed that law.
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:27.480]  Come back and do five more minutes, Dr. I'm going to let you go. We have another guest coming up.
[1:58:27.480 --> 1:58:36.480]  I want to talk about that. Obama signed that law two weeks before the election, or two weeks before Trump got in saying federalize all media.
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:41.480]  What is Trump going to do about that?
[1:58:41.480 --> 1:58:49.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:49.480 --> 1:58:57.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement. Roger Stone's new book is coming out in a couple of weeks.
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:05.480]  It's exclusively available at preorderandinfowarsstore.com. It's the making of a president and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:12.480]  The inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the future and what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:19.480]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium. It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more.
[1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:27.480]  And it supports him and it supports info wars and our whole operation. So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:31.480]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode.
[1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:37.480]  National's movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go preorder. So you get it first at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:43.480]  The making of a president by Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones. I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[1:59:43.480 --> 2:00:11.480]  Please pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now sir, the first to have it shipped to you.
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:27.480]  In the age of wonder, another world, another time, his life was green and good until the present day.
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:39.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:49.480]  I want to pull back and just get Dr. Corsi's take on the unprecedented historical moment we're now all living through.
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:57.480]  A true battle that's joined massive money and power but an empty, evil ideology versus free humanity.
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:02.480]  And I don't script this like we're the good guys or the bad guys. That's the way it really is.
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:11.480]  We're promoting freedom, they're promoting tyranny. And their alliance with Islam and orthodox and radical forms of it is truly insane.
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:20.480]  And the elites having to go run for the hills and build armored redoubts for societal collapse when they themselves are pushing conditions they admit are causing that.
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:30.480]  It's like they're so greedy they just can't help it. And their real greed is consolidating into monopolies and killing the true free market system that could grow us out of this.
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:39.480]  Asking Dr. Corsi can we get out of this financial collapse they've opened up and he said, yeah, if we grow out and Trump is working around the clock to do that.
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:47.480]  But in closing, a lot of big stories daily coming in FullWars.com. We're going to be getting some more folks working under you and covering a lot of stuff as it breaks.
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:52.480]  But also commentary on the media, exposing fake news. We need you to do that, Doc.
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:02:01.480]  Great commentary on air, but also articles just just, you know, pointing out where they're deceiving what they're doing, what the special interests are up to. But in closing in the three minutes, we've got left.
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:04.480]  Just what is it like for you?
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:13.480]  Well, let's say fighting 10 years ago against this to now see they've capitulated globalism is admitted, world governments admitted, the authoritarianism of it is admitted.
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:17.480]  And so they really have no moral argument now. It's very strange.
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:25.480]  Well, going back to when I was first on your show, maybe 13, 14 years ago, I mean, it goes back, we've been doing working together for years.
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:33.480]  We were talking about the security and prosperity partnership in North America, waiting in North American Union, and we expose these things.
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:47.480]  And today, it's openly clear that the globalists had a plan to not only destroy the United States, but to go do this Trans Pacific and transatlantic partnership for global government.
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:03:02.480]  These are fundamental crises that between liberty and the forces of globalism, forces of government control, statism that have been going on fighting probably since human beings have existed
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:05.480]  since governments have existed, but it's never been more critical.
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  And the debate is about the Internet is about that's why I'm so honored to be with you.
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:19.480]  It's about live streaming. It's about what we're doing right now, millions of people watching, you know, on the Internet, live time.
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:23.480]  And what we're going to do is we'll have an apprentice program for journalists in DC.
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:27.480]  We're going to recruit young journalists. We're going to be out in the field recording what's going on.
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:33.480]  It's going to be very exciting because we've got to show people what's actually right.
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:39.480]  I mean, you could easily retire. I mean, I could sit back at this point, but this is epic history.
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:43.480]  We've got to do it or the enemy's going to win, but we have a real shot now of winning.
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:48.480]  We were fighting 20 years ago, not knowing that we could ever even turn the corner, but just out of sheer will.
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:52.480]  Now it's ours to lose, I think I have no intention of retiring.
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:04:01.480]  I mean, look, it's right now the Internet is the cutting edge, the front line of the battle, live streaming what we're doing right here.
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:12.480]  This is the front line because Hillary Clinton, if she'd been elected, would have had the FCC with fake news, all of this, you know, not mantra.
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:16.480]  The NDAA, Obama signed to put the CIA over the FCC.
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:25.480]  You know, what the left realizes in their complete panic over it is that the mainstream media, NBC, CBS, they're all dead.
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:31.480]  Nobody's going to watch them in 20 years, maybe not New York Times dead, Hollywood dead.
[2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:36.480]  You know, these are all bypassed ideas and technologies.
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:45.480]  You don't need a New York Times, but Obama would establish a Ministry of Truth and he would have censorship over what is permitted to be said in America.
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:48.480]  You've already got the mainstream media acting.
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:52.480]  That's right, and we grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat.
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:56.480]  Thank you so much, Doc. We'll talk to you soon. Great to have you with them full wars.
[2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:59.480]  I'm really honored and thrilled to be with you. Thank you, Alex.
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:06.480]  There's one ex-official that's calling on Mexico to, quote, unleash drug cartels to punish President Trump.
[2:05:06.480 --> 2:05:09.480]  He's suggesting that drugs should be allowed to flow freely into the US.
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:13.480]  Of course, I'm talking about former Secretary of Foreign Affairs George Castaneda.
[2:05:13.480 --> 2:05:20.480]  He's calling on Mexico to punish Trump for his actions on deporting illegals here in the US and building a border wall.
[2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:24.480]  He's suggesting that criminal cartels should be allowed to run drugs freely in the US.
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:34.480]  During an interview on CNN, the ex-official suggested that drug cartels could be unleashed on the US as retribution for, quote, Trump's aggressive stance toward Mexico.
[2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:38.480]  He goes on to say Mexico has a lot of negotiating ships in this matter.
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:43.480]  There are multiple drugs that come through Mexico from South America or drugs that are produced here in Mexico all go to the US.
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:50.480]  This is not our problem. We've been cooperating with the US for many years on these issues because they've asked us to and because we have a friendly, trustful relationship.
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:56.480]  You know what, pal? That relationship does include a wall which is being built whether you like it or not.
[2:05:56.480 --> 2:06:09.480]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for infowords.com.

[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:36.480]  Through the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:38.480]  The general public doesn't.
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:42.480]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:42.480 --> 2:07:46.480]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:53.480]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:53.480 --> 2:07:58.480]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:39.480]  Many bridges I've got to cross. How many times must I explain myself? For I can talk to the boss. For I can talk to the boss.
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:46.480]  Roger Stone's new book officially comes out tomorrow, but everybody that pre-ordered it, we're shipping them out today.
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:09:03.480]  And everybody that buys a book at InfowarsStore.com making of the present 2016 how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution by Roger Stone gets a signed name plate that is in the mail, I'm told, by Stones.
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:10.480]  We only had 500 of these he signed. He's got to sign a lot more and get them to us because we're selling thousands of these a day.
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:18.480]  Obviously it's just not coming out. That'll slow down. It sounds like a lot of money. It's not. You know, we make $6, $7, $8 maybe or less on a book.
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:28.480]  Stone makes a couple bucks. The publisher makes the money. It takes a lot to fund this operation to set up a Washington bureau to get more reporters here, more people.
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:34.480]  But in the face of the New World Order and in the face of the fact we're having such success, we've got to do it. It's responsibility.
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:44.480]  So get the making of the present 2016 and also support our local AM and FM affiliates, support their sponsors, become a sponsor, send the station 20 bucks a month, 100 bucks a month.
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:52.480]  If people that have money, whether it's meek amount or grandiose, will put it into action, it'll change the world.
[2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:59.480]  People think holding on to something gives them victory. No, it's going all in, especially when we're turning the tide.
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:04.480]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:14.480]  Most men live their lives out in horrible nightmare shallows, can never actually affect any changer, live in a time where they could be involved in the destiny of the species forever.
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:25.480]  We live in a time of just the deepest, greatest blue ocean we've ever seen to paraphrase William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:30.480]  There is a tide in the affairs of men which take it at the flood leads on to fortune omitted.
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:41.480]  All the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. How'd my paraphrase do?
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.480]  My modern paraphrase.
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:11:00.480]  So we are alive in a sea of possibilities right now and a huge animating war against insiders and globalists and parasites and people that would shackle humanity and hold us back from our greater destiny.
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:07.480]  Now, Trump picks Bannon for National Security Council. He's also bringing the CIA in.
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:16.480]  This is a big deal. I can tell you right now, you read Bannon's writings when he said we're basically brothers when it comes to our political views.
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:19.480]  I'll just leave it at that before the media goes off the deep end.
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:29.480]  But a lot is going on and the enemy is scared. We have ideology that's real. We have prosperity that's real. We have Americana, the sexiest thing this world ever saw.
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:37.480]  Not that every even fully got realized, but we're going back to what made us great and all the special interests are howling right now.
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:42.480]  Paul Watson's host of the fourth hour from London, England.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:47.480]  I should also add that we're listener supported, not just buying the book. We're about to end some sales.
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:58.480]  We know that Tali's about to sell out. 10% off DNA force is about to stop. We just got our secret 12th, mythical bollum and high quality vitamin B12 that's taken under the tongue. Very bust out there. That is 10% off right now.
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:05.480]  Our probiotic biome defense just got back in stock. Biotruce, selenium, the purest, strongest, most organic out there. We have that.
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:14.480]  Knockouts and amazing natural sleep aid. All of it are really amazing products and you really can't lose because you know you're funding an organization that's up at...
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:21.480]  I was at 11 o'clock at night last night working after the kids went to bed. I'm like, okay, go to bed now. I'm about nine. I'm going back to work until, you know, midnight.
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:28.480]  And it's not work. It's fun. And it's so good that you've supported us. We've supported you. We've been able to do this.
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:45.480]  So please shop with the good guys in FullWarsStore.com. They have a special ending this week that's 25% off on the air filtration systems and water filtration systems unprecedented sales on the Alexa Pure Breeze and Alexa Pure Pro water filtration systems in FullWarsStore.com or in FullWarsLife.com.
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:58.480]  Triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Okay. I've got like 15 clips I want to get to. I've got all the science and tech news that's amazing I want to get to. And I've got 46 and a half minutes left here.
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:09.480]  Okay. And we're going to get Pachennic on. His line just dropped. So we're going to see when we get him back on. But I have got a ton to cover here and we're going to attempt to go to all of it.
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:25.480]  But this really is an amazing time to be alive. I want to go to the acting AG Obama appointed was told Trump's travel ban was legit but still played politics anyways.
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:34.480]  And that's what's important. She admits in letters that it's legitimate. It's a repeat of what Obama did and what Jimmy Carter did and what Reagan did and what Bush Sr. did and what George W. did.
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:51.480]  But they lie. They lie. And they say that it's unprecedented and it's a ban on our religion. Well, here's the deal. Most of these Muslim countries have a ban on Christianity or animism or Buddhism.
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:14:05.480]  So speaking of that I'll play that clip and then we're going to go Dr. Steve Pachennic. Here's the acting AG Obama appointee. You'll say I'm not going to do what you say and Trump said good you're fired Prince of Ordination. Boom direct action.
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:20.480]  Here it is. The acting Attorney General of the Justice Department refusing to defend the president's executive order. Should she be fired. Absolutely. There's no question about it. She was kept on merely to have some continuity for department
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:30.480]  who's a basic. Do we really want to continue that? No, not our but the basic integrity of the Department of Justice rests on being non political and it's being reported.
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:41.480]  He certainly clarified that miss. It's being reported that the department's own internal general counsel the Office of Legal Counsel reviewed the executive order and approved of it.
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:50.480]  So she's flying in the face of her own best lawyers. Well, she's flying in the face of so much. I don't know that we can parse it down to something that isn't material.
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:57.480]  I mean, this is a egregiously dishonorable conduct on her part. John Bolton. Great to have you.
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:11.480]  What it is is open rebellion and we're in a state of soft civil war and the Soros crowd and others aren't giving up their their intensifying their operations. So when I asked Dr. Steve Pachanic, who obviously was had a psychological operations, the State Department
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:23.480]  Works and other agencies, one of the co-founders, but General Boykin Schumacher of Delta Force. I want to get his takers on the state of the Union right now before we get to the topics he wants to cover as we don't, you know, prescript these live interviews.
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:36.480]  For me, Trump's over delivering very impressive. I'm really worried about him. They're selling a narrative of assassination and coup and how great that's going to be in the New York Times and HBO. I mean, it's just everywhere.
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:47.480]  And I'm really concerned that they have an attitude like they've got something big planned and they're not giving up in the face of just prosperity in Americana.
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:54.480]  So I want to get your view on the current developments and so far what you think of President Trump.
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:16:09.480]  Well, I think he has delivered exactly what we expected him to deliver what you and I have been talking about for 12 years or more. And that is he's brought a business man's perspective to the running of government.
[2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:31.480]  It's been over 100 years since we've had a business man and the only one was Hoover, quite frankly. But what you're seeing now is the quietest, most effective revolution that you, I and my fellow consorts doesn't matter who they are implemented through the ascendancy of Trump and his family.
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:46.480]  Trump doesn't need to do this. His family doesn't need to do this. What he is doing is exactly what I do or others do in the business community. We come in, we clear out an institution in ASAP time.
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:54.480]  That means you don't have a chance to protest or any time to rip, to drive an anti-deformation.
[2:16:54.480 --> 2:16:57.480]  The Kabuki Theater is over. The man of actions here.
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:06.480]  That's correct. And I think everybody has to understand the state of the union is fine. We're not in a civil war.
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:18.480]  Number one, there is no civil war initiated by the left of the press. What's happening is you're hearing the girdling of a dying institution, both in the media and in the left wing.
[2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:21.480]  But you agree that they are trying to sell an uprising?
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:31.480]  Well, they can sell whatever they want, but they can't mimic or ate what you and I and a group of others have done very quietly, very sort of voce.
[2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:43.480]  What we effectively did way before that they had any idea that was coming in. And actually we have to thank Hillary for being so incompetent as well as her $100 million coterie.
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:46.480]  That's right. We shouldn't be too arrogant. We were facing massive incompetence.
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:59.480]  Oh my God! On the contrary, I want to thank Hillary. I want to thank the Dewey Square group. I want to thank all of those who were paid off and were totally, completely incompetent.
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:06.480]  Every Democrat, every newspaper and every piece of content that had a narrative that was a kumbaya narrative.
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:09.480]  Is it their arrogance that made America finally reject them?
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:20.480]  Well, it's not only their arrogance. It really is, Alex, as you and I know, competency. You and I share as we do with millions of Americans. We're small business people.
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:23.480]  We're anything but close to $500 million.
[2:18:23.480 --> 2:18:26.480]  We don't show up. The donuts don't get made.
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:35.480]  Well, that's correct. I mean, that's a great way to say it. But honestly, we're not bankers. We're not VCs. We're not sick offense. We're not parasites.
[2:18:35.480 --> 2:18:40.480]  What you have seen is the end of an era of parasites.
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:48.480]  And Trump knows that. You would come on 10 years ago and say, we need farmers. We need ranchers. We need auto park producers. We need working people, building a world about people.
[2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:55.480]  Trump gets that. It's not about robots. He's making it about people again. The globalist wanted to demoralize us and control us.
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:19:01.480]  Trump gets that it's about giving people satisfaction of being self-sufficient again.
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:11.480]  You hit it on the head, Alex. You and I talked about it. I wrote a blog years ago that the greatest national security problem we have in the United States is not our debt.
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:22.480]  It's not even ISIS. It's the fact that family farmers are less than 6% of our country. No one is going into the family farm business because it's too hard.
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:32.480]  I have friends who work 18-hour days, 7 days a week. We don't see that in the upper crust. We don't see that in the Hillary's. We don't see that in the Washington Post.
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:39.480]  I don't see that in the bankers that Goldman Sachs or Lloyd Blank find who comes in and defies in order on immigration.
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:44.480]  But we are seeing 18-hour days out of Trump. That's not put on. He literally is a machine.
[2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:54.480]  Actually, I'm very impressed. As a physician, I'm a little bit worried about a man who's a little bit younger than myself who has this kind of energy.
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:57.480]  He goes 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[2:19:57.480 --> 2:20:01.480]  I was about to say, though, he's the oldest president ever elected.
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:07.480]  Well, he may be the oldest in terms of age, but he is the youngest in terms of attitude.
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:08.480]  I agree.
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:19.480]  I hate to sing the praises of Trump too much, but if you study history, don't you agree that this is a real anomaly? This is a real unicorn.
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:27.480]  It's what you said, Alex. It's what we work together. It's what millions of you listeners have heard all over the world.
[2:20:27.480 --> 2:20:34.480]  This is the American Revolution. I talked about it. I wrote about it 20 years ago in fiction and in blog.
[2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:42.480]  You made it possible. Roger Stone made it possible. I have a bunch of others, but this is a real secondary revolution.
[2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:48.480]  It's not filled with guns. It's not filled with hatred. It is simply a concept called change.
[2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:55.480]  And America is frightened because for too long, we...
[2:20:55.480 --> 2:21:05.480]  I'm going to reconnect with you because it's totally degraded. We're going to come back with him. He's making some powerful points.
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:12.480]  The second American Revolution is here. Make no mistake. Trump is doing everything exactly how you level playing fields.
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:18.480]  Quite frankly, it's a tip towards the small business person in local communities and in African American communities.
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:25.480]  Because he knows the globalists are going to use that as a time bomb to bring the country down. So just from a self-serving position for his kids and himself,
[2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:30.480]  he also cares about those people. He's trying to like, here's jobs, here's support, here's a life, you know.
[2:21:30.480 --> 2:21:35.480]  He's telling the elites, you better invest here or the whole world economy is going to go down. Now's the time.
[2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:44.480]  So this is a very pro-human approach we're seeing. Instead of this bean counting, Michael Bloomberg, technocrat view, your Skype was breaking up.
[2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:50.480]  I have to ask Michael, is it better? Let me see what I can do.
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:55.480]  It's okay. It's a little bit better. We're going to come back to you in a minute. But again, ladies and gentlemen, the wonders of Skype,
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:22:03.480]  the wonders of talking to somebody in Florida and I'm here in Texas and you're watching in Japan or Russia or Mexico or Canada or right here in Austin, Texas.
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:21.480]  But I don't say this as a patronizing thing to pat you on the head. I'm going to say it very, very slowly. I am completely humbled and I am thankful every minute of every day that I'm conscious for everyone that's helped us.
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:34.480]  From Matt Drudge, to my parents, to the crew here in this office, to you. And I know you're thankful to me as well. We're in this together. This is real. I really want prosperity and justice.
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:46.480]  I really want to stop racism. I really want to empower humanity. I really want to conquer cancer with God's help. I really do believe in humanity.
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:53.480]  And there are a lot of us and we're going to come together and we're going to build systems that outperform anything the globalists could ever create.
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:23:06.480]  And we are going to change the world. Why wouldn't we? Look what we're promoting. Everything is good in the understanding that we have love for our fellow humans.
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:17.480]  It's easy to dominate and control weak people and then feel powerful because you're smarter than them, but that is a curse. And see, you don't think like that, so you're blind to the enemy.
[2:23:17.480 --> 2:23:24.480]  I was blind for a long time too, but you have to admit what they're doing. And you are the reason in full wars is so successful.
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:29.480]  You are the reason and they're trying to block us. They're trying to censor us. They were going to bring in a real authoritarianism under Hillary.
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:37.480]  But good people in our government, good people in corporations and business and daily life and just you took action.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:44.480]  You know, Dr. President, you're back now with a clear shot. You were breaking down the Second American Revolution. How big this is. You're right.
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:53.480]  We should celebrate this more, not just to pat each other on the back, but to recognize what is successful and what has worked and then deploy it further.
[2:23:53.480 --> 2:24:01.480]  Because I know you want to say they failed. They're over. We're beating them. You know, Trump's Blitzkrieg. But I mean, they are involved in some counter strikes here.
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:04.480]  So let's let's flush this out.
[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:12.480]  Let me put it this way. This is far bigger than just an American Revolution. It's something that you and I talked about.
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:26.480]  The break up of the EU is imminent. I've said it for years. Theresa May, Prime Minister of England did the smartest thing possible, came to see Trump, said that they're going to negotiate a separate agreement with Trump.
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:32.480]  Prime Minister of Japan Abe came to see Trump. South Korean ambassadors are coming to see Trump.
[2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:44.480]  What's happening now is that America has redefined its position in the world, taken out of the notion of the multilateral context, which was really not to our advantage.
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:55.480]  All the membership that we had in all these WTO United Nations was worthless. We were spending countless numbers of billions of dollars for absolutely nothing.
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:25:04.480]  And Trump looked at the problem. He saw what we had to do. We had to withdraw and reconfigure ourselves into a position of power.
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:11.480]  We're not isolationists. This is not a...
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:18.480]  Your side broke up, but I'm going to say this. If you really look at it, it's major Americana cultural expansionism.
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:26.480]  Our real power is being Americana, so all the tyrannies of the world are the ones that better be upset. And you know what, Donner Pachennick?
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:33.480]  Tyrannies and centralized systems are upset. Again, your skype's breaking up. That's why I interrupted.
[2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:39.480]  Let's do this because he's really on fire today. Let's get him on phone right now. Thanks.
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:42.480]  You know, skype's a weird thing and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:48.480]  Skype's been working great at my house for two months and then just not working after that. Let me plug down.
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.480]  We're going to come back and I won't plug. And then tomorrow I'm going to take a lot of phone calls.
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  I'm going to be on the road. I'm going to be also on Joe Rogan's podcast tomorrow as well.
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  That's at 3.30 Central Standard Time, 1.30 Pacific Standard Time.
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:12.480]  So I'll do three hours here. I'll take an hour break, drive over to his place, over to the studios and do the show with Joe.
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:18.480]  And I've been friends with Joe for 18 years, but the real reason this is important is I've never been on the podcast.
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:24.480]  I just, I just never gone out there to be on it. And so Joe about five years ago goes, I'm not doing your show anymore until you come on mine.
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:29.480]  And then he's always busy and I'm busy and we play phone tag. It's never happened.
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  So he's done three or four interviews since then, but he's always like, you know, I told him, why don't you do my podcast?
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:41.480]  And I don't think, he knows, I don't really think in a Machiavellian way. I mean, I can, but I don't operate like that.
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  Like, why do you get me on your show, but you don't come on mine?
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.480]  And it's just because he doesn't have guests to be a sky.
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:56.480]  And Joe's a big comedian. He has 10,000 people show up to here and do his routines.
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:01.480]  I'd say he's in the top 10 comedians right now. Some multi, multi-talented guy.
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:08.480]  And so he comes to Austin, I'm able to have him on the show, but normally it's, you know, just more screwing around the morning or whatever.
[2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:12.480]  Joe talks about some really intelligent, thought-provoking things on the air.
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  And again, he has a really wide audience of people that I think are seeking the truth.
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:22.480]  So that's why I rarely travel to do interviews and I really don't like Los Angeles, but I am going out there because I want to reach out to Joe's audience.
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:26.480]  So you don't want to miss that. That'll be tomorrow on his podcast.
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:30.480]  And now going back to Dr. Steve Pacinic. Sorry, I've been interrupted by Skype, not my fault though.
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:34.480]  Get back into this de-evolution. What's happening and what you expect?
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:39.480]  I mean, I want to believe you that we're really beating their pants off right now.
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  But again, just part of me wants to watch my six. Go ahead.
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:50.480]  Thank you, Alex. And I do apologize for the Skype. It's not interference from anybody else, but just my incapacity to run.
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:56.480]  Let me make it clear. This is not about self-congratulation.
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  There's nothing here where we, who were part of this revolution, including the Trump family, are successful.
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:07.480]  Success really gets defined on a continuous basis.
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:14.480]  What's happened is Trump and Bannon and the others have understood very clearly.
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:21.480]  We've taken out every civilian who has in the past or will in the future created a necessary war.
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:29.480]  How was that done? Well, that was done paradoxically by putting in generals and military men who've been in combat
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:35.480]  who understand that we're wasting our men and resources on wars that make no sense.
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:40.480]  I.e., you have James Mattis, you have Kelly, you have Flynn.
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:45.480]  You have a whole group of these generals, Pompeo, who all were trained in the art of war.
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  Now, in contrast, you had the liberals, or the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bill, the Hillarys, the Madeline Albright,
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:29:02.480]  and Condoleezza Rice, all of who came out of a very soft background, which had no consideration about how you do war,
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:07.480]  how you increase it, how you begin it, how you maintain it, and how you end it.
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:16.480]  So what we had was the incompetency of civilians, not over just one presidency, two presidents, over decades.
[2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:22.480]  We hadn't had a president who'd been in the military since Bush Senior and James Carter.
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:29.480]  And it wasn't an accident that under Jimmy Carter and Bush Senior, we were asked to put in more military people
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:32.480]  in order to stop wars that had occurred.
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:38.480]  The second part of all of this is we no longer want to be tied to financial transactions,
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:41.480]  which have no benefit to us, the American people.
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:45.480]  All right, Doc, let's come back and break down this huge Trump revolution.
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:48.480]  We're 10 days in. He is delivering. This is historic.
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:52.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:59.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:05.480]  We've seen politicians from across the world like whining, sniffling babies over Trump's immigration ban.
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:12.480]  We've seen city con declare actual war on President Trump because he has the nerve to point out that some people come from terrorist places
[2:30:12.480 --> 2:30:14.480]  and we should have a temporary travel ban.
[2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:19.480]  We've seen Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, actually cry stating that the Statue of Liberty is shedding tears
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:23.480]  because Liberty has taken such a hit this week because of Trump's ban.
[2:30:23.480 --> 2:30:29.480]  Here's the news for you, people. The countries that are on Trump's ban were actually identified by President Obama.
[2:30:29.480 --> 2:30:34.480]  At least 20 alleged terrorists since 2014 have come from countries affected by Trump's immigration ban.
[2:30:34.480 --> 2:30:39.480]  There's an article up today on the Daily Caller and identifies these 20 alleged terrorists.
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:44.480]  In the past three years, they were actually immigrants or refugees from seven majority Muslim nations.
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:49.480]  That President Trump has temporarily banned in his migration ban on Friday.
[2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:54.480]  These countries include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:57.480]  They won't be allowed to immigrate to the U.S. for the next three months.
[2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:20.480]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:31.480]  in the coming years.
[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:36.520]  so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to infowarsstore.com,

[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:30.520]  years, people that currently are testing it for us, they didn't just say outstanding and what
[2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:35.080]  they really say about them. They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it. A lot of my
[2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:41.080]  law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing. The backpack body armor is only $200.
[2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:45.480]  I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick. It's got a 20 year warranty. It's waterproof.

[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:20.040]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[2:33:20.040 --> 2:33:27.080]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:35.560]  The reason I harp on the fact that Trump is delivering on every front is this is just amazing.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:42.040]  We have seen a historical time in the last two years and now
[2:33:43.160 --> 2:33:45.880]  the time we're going into is going to be even more historic.
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:54.360]  And what we have is a group trying to take over power and this huge centralized system
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:33:58.760]  that actually wants to empower the individual and wants you to have hope
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:06.280]  and really wants to get back to normal human values that transcend whether you're an American
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:11.880]  or Russian, Chinese, Mexican, it doesn't matter. And when you see somebody like Steven Bannon
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:17.240]  who openly wants to make people so prosperous that we break the will of political correctness
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:22.680]  and the people that really have a vision and an understanding of the really sick
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:28.920]  psychological control that the nanny state was trying to put into society. And we've got a long
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:34.680]  way to dig out, but the worm is turning very, very quickly. So as Pachinic was just saying,
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.320]  Dr. Pachinic, this isn't about, oh, look, we're having big victories. Oh, look, Trump's so great.
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:42.760]  It's about, wow, this is what it looks like when somebody really takes action
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:46.680]  and doesn't care what the other side has to say and is committed.
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:54.200]  It really is magic to see. And that's why they so over centralized in the executive branch
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:01.720]  that now it's their biggest enemy as Trump can reverse everything, just copying Obama's executive
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:05.640]  orders and laws, but tweaking them. Then when they attack him, he says, wait a minute, I was doing
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:11.320]  what Obama did, but actually implementing it. And so what freaks me out is I'm so used to dealing
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:16.760]  with Democrats and Republican establishment types that just go off press releases and are so lazy
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:19.800]  and work like five hours a day and don't even know what they're doing themselves.
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:24.920]  They're just arrogant in their power and MSM covering up for them. And the counterattacks are
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:31.240]  so ham-fisted that it was like battling people that were mentally retarded, quite frankly.
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:35.640]  But they still had power, so it was still an adversary. Watching Trump now, I look at what
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:41.000]  he does, it's so well researched and so well executed. So he's put the best people in charge
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:47.240]  of every area. All he's doing is restoring the operating system we were under, say, previous to
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:55.560]  1960. That's my view, but with a high tech overlay and with a push to really decentralize the
[2:35:55.560 --> 2:36:01.560]  technology and devolve power to the States, America 2.0, and he said that in his inaugural speech.
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:06.440]  Dr. Pachennick, what was it like for you to see that inaugural speech? Are your colleagues you
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:10.440]  talked to, other people that have been trying to keep this country free for decades and decades?
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:17.480]  Is it surreal for you? Because for me, it is just bizarre to see this paradox.
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:24.520]  Well, let me just say, when I heard the speech I cheered. I thought it was to the point it was
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:32.680]  brief and it was comprehensive. Was it surreal? Not really, because when somebody like you or I
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:41.240]  think about a regime change, which this was, and it's too late for the people on the left or the
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:45.480]  media or whatever you want to call it, it's too late for them to implement any other changes.
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:51.560]  All they can do is create obstructions, which are not really valid. As you see the Schumers
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:57.880]  who start to cry and it isn't genuine or the Black fines who raped our government and our
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:04.440]  people from Goldman Sachs and they're complaining, the reality is those days are over and what we
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:09.960]  will see now is the breakup of the government and it's beginning with the State Department,
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:14.920]  where I had work, which I said. And what's crazy is hearing you and Bannon and others,
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:20.120]  Trump is literally doing it, he said, I'm breaking it up, get ready, and then he starts doing it.
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:28.120]  That's correct. And that whole concept that I'm going to do it and subsequently you Americans or
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:34.360]  whoever you're, wherever you're involved, you have to pay the price. No one has realized that
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:39.400]  a particular issue and that's what the press doesn't understand. That's what the Hillary's
[2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:44.360]  don't understand, the Democrats don't understand. There are consequences. The consequences have
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:50.760]  been obviated for too long under the Clintons, under the Bush. All that stuff was nonsense
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:56.520]  because it was covered up. There was a lot of covert operations. But what we've done is to bring
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:03.160]  all of the problems up to the surface. Trump has done that and he said, okay, now analyzing
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:07.880]  these problems, this is the way to go. We're going to make the government smaller, which by
[2:38:07.880 --> 2:38:12.520]  definition should have been smaller. We're no longer going to have a million people on the
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:17.240]  Pentagon supporting a million soldiers. That's not going to work. We're no longer going to
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:23.400]  have 20,000 foreign service officers who really don't do very much. Sure. What do you make of
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:30.120]  a policy or anything else? We're going to take that down. So by self-definition, the people
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:35.320]  select themselves out if they think they can protest against Trump. I don't have a problem with that.
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:41.560]  That's your right. But the consequences, you can't hide behind anonymity the way the State
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:47.400]  Department officials are trying to do. They want to have that change and the counterbalance to Trump,
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:52.680]  but they don't want to be named. I would rather have them named and say, okay, you don't have to
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:58.120]  work here. We don't have to pay you for 20 years of being in the foreign service. I'm not sure what
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:03.640]  you've done. I'm not clear what the outcome is. And quite frankly, this is what I used to do in
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:10.360]  management. And we used to get rid of people one after another. Now, the system is not used to the
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:16.200]  sweeper or the cleaner. And that's really what Trump has been doing. And people like yourself or
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:21.880]  myself, we can articulate the point of view, we implement it. But then what happens, it becomes
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:28.040]  infectious. The Hillary and the Clintons and everybody else becomes irrelevant. What becomes
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:34.280]  relevant is that we become the focal point for England. Now the biggest problem is-
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:38.520]  Noghri, we're now the role model all over and the dominoes. I mean, look at LePage. She's
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:43.560]  racing the first place in- Correct. Nationalist movements are exploding. Why do you have your
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:48.600]  top story? You sent it to me. Let's briefly talk about this. What does it signify that he's put
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:53.400]  Bannon in for National Security Council, but brought the CIA back in after decades as well?
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:59.080]  And then I want to circle back around to the outgoing CIA head openly threatening Trump,
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:05.800]  unprecedented. Well, I wrote the article about Bannon. It's not the first time. It's really the
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:12.360]  second time where I support a man like Stephen Bannon. He's born of the Democratic Left, pro-labor,
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:19.000]  pro-democrat, came out of Norfolk, Virginia. But thanks to his own desire to make something of
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:25.080]  himself, he went to Virginia Tech, then got a master's degree at Georgetown, then volunteered to go
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:32.520]  into the Navy, became an officer in the Navy, was involved in surface warfare, and then decided
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:38.760]  to go into sex to make money, left go into sex, and then started a business in Hollywood. Now,
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:44.920]  that's a polymath individual. To me, that's what America's about. It's no, it's not a straight
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:50.760]  road to anything. It's about Renaissance men. I'm sorry? It's about Renaissance men. Oh, yeah. But
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.880]  on the other hand, it's about America. Every American in a way is a Renaissance person because
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:01.880]  they have the ability to decide what they want to do. They don't have to stick to one profession.
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:08.040]  They're no longer a guard gear to be one thing like the foreign service or the CIA,
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:13.080]  where you put 25 years in and then you get a pension. Those days are gone. The pensions won't
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:18.600]  be there. That's the sad news for America. But the people who are entrepreneurial,
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:23.480]  like the Steve Bannon, like yourself and others, those are the ones that will flourish.
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:28.120]  Well, when you put that uncertainty into the system of being entrepreneurial, which is the
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:32.920]  basis of this country, then all kinds of things happen. Sure. Let's walk through some of the
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:37.800]  headlines on your site. You point out Democrats suffer from senile dementia, claiming Putin puts
[2:41:37.800 --> 2:41:41.720]  words in Trump's head. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the women's march you've exposed.
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:46.760]  I mean, let's talk about then, if they are defeated then, what do they do because they've got tens of
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:50.600]  millions of people? I've been out there. I don't need a psychology degree to know they're mentally
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:56.200]  ill. Well, it's not an issue. I, you know, I differ from you in a little way because I know the
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:02.920]  people who are protesting. But if you think about the protest, women getting together and
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:09.080]  protesting that we are women and we want a liberated freedom or whatever, it's not relevant.
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:16.440]  It was so awkward and so basically a net that it didn't really address the question of change in
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:21.960]  the federal government. It's not about abortion. It's not about your rights to have it or not
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:27.160]  have a child. It was so out of tune. It was as if they were playing an instrument in another
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:32.280]  court and another time and another way. I agree. They're not synced up with anything. I mean,
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:38.680]  we're in the zeitgeist. Everything we're doing is like this human will to succeed and propel and
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:44.440]  invent and trailblaze and discover and everything they do is like trying to pull us down. As a
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:49.240]  psychiatrist, what do you call that? Do they hate themselves? So they're projecting their loathing
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:53.640]  because I'm not being a mean person, but no, I don't want to get into the zeitgeist. Well,
[2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:58.040]  what I call themselves is what I called Hillary, Condoleezza, and Madeline Albright in that
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:04.360]  untutored. They were basically people who came out of the so-called elite schools,
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:10.040]  so either Stanford or Harvard or whatever, and they thought that was sufficient and necessary
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:15.560]  just to keep them for the rest of their life. That wasn't the case. The simple case is you can
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:20.600]  protest whatever you want. You have to articulate it, but it's not relevant to the United States
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:26.760]  because the real people who voted for Trump were exactly the people who we've talked about and who
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:30.200]  listened to the Alex Johnson. You said this a thousand times and hearing you and Bannon,
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:35.240]  it's like the same person. I've been talking to you 15 years now, Doc, not 12. He says they don't
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:40.120]  get us. They don't know America. They don't know who they're dealing with. They're not even in the
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:45.560]  same universe as us. That's really it. They are literal alias. It's as simple as that. I mean,
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:50.040]  you're going to Los Angeles. I worked in Los Angeles. It's not real. I mean, there's a movie
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:55.320]  called La La Land, which is terrible, but they think this is a representation of what they're
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:44:01.800]  about. It's literally not relevant to the way of life in America. Once Hollywood was relevant,
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:08.280]  it is no longer relevant because of the internet, because of the Alex Jones, because of the webinar.
[2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:14.120]  So what's happening is you're seeing arcade systems disappearing in very quick time.
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:22.040]  So we're like watching ships sink, basically? Well, they're not sunk completely, but they're
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:26.760]  getting water on board. They are sinking very rapidly. It's more kind of the death of an
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:31.320]  elephant. Could they reinvent themselves if they joined with the American system of the
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:35.640]  Americana? Could they go from being historical to being historic?
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:41.560]  Yeah, that's a good point, Alex, because if you see a guy like Bannon who came out of the
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:49.400]  Democratic left and came out of pro-labor and all and switched, he went to the side where he
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:57.000]  understood that real America was not about elitism. It was about work, about achievement and failure.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:03.480]  That was not inherent in the left, where it had labor unions, where you had a steady income,
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:11.160]  where you had a pension. Those days are gone. The notion of consistency and security, that's gone
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:18.920]  for the individual. For the nation, no, because we grew and we did our best when we had to develop
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:23.160]  technology, when we had to take great risks. And that's where we are right now. Well, it's just
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.000]  like children. If you don't make them strive, make them learn, make them go under pressure,
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:31.960]  they turn into just demonic spoiled brats. And America has somewhat turned into a spoiled brat,
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:36.920]  but it was not equally distributed. So you're being very positive today in closing here.
[2:45:36.920 --> 2:45:41.880]  What are the pitfalls? What do we have to look for to make sure we secure this victory? Because
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:46.040]  I am just in celebration mode, quite frankly, which I've never been in for 20 plus years.
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:49.480]  Like a great feeling of completion. I know we've got more fights to come, but
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:53.880]  the fact that Trump is delivering is just breathtaking. It's much better than I thought it
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:59.960]  would be, but I still want to guard the victory. What do we do? Well, we have to be patient. The
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:06.280]  initial incision by the surge in Trump doesn't necessarily mean that the operation successful.
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:11.480]  Like any operation where we literally are changing the metabolism in the state of the
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:16.520]  patient, which is what America is in, we have to wait for the completion of the operation.
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:22.040]  Who are the people who will implement the change? How good are they really? How effective are they?
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:27.560]  Is Trump going to monitor that? And those are the kind of things that we have to watch out for.
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:32.920]  So the revolution has just begun. But remember, in every revolution, those of us who are the
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:38.920]  flame keepers or who initiated like yourself and your people will be watching. It's not
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:43.400]  a given right now. Sure. Bandit came out and he said, keep us honest. We're fighting all these
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:48.200]  special interests. It's dizzying. Please watch our backs. Please criticize us. Don't just get
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:52.200]  behind us. He said that two weeks ago. Let me ask you this then. As a psychiatrist, but also as a
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:57.800]  doctor and as a veteran and all the other things you've done, looking at it from a psychiatric
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:02.600]  position, I don't see Trump as a narcissist like they say in these overblown terms. They use too
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:09.720]  much. He is like about almost OCD, about success, victory, piles of work, delivering on what he
[2:47:09.720 --> 2:47:15.160]  says he'll do. And the ultimate task is to defeat all these other elites. He sees that we're given
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:21.000]  everything they had. And so it's almost a good thing that he's hyper dominant and sees his victory
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:26.360]  like a big dog hauling us back a big deer by the neck. I mean, it's almost very dog-like. I don't
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:30.680]  mean that in a in a diminutive word. I understand what you're saying. Let me, let me make this very
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:35.800]  clear. Every one of us has narcissism. There's what we call malignant narcissism. There's what we
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:42.520]  call healthy narcissism. In the case of Trump right now, he is manifesting a very healthy amount
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:47.640]  of narcissism saying, look, I'm going to change, but it's not only me. Sure. But that's what I'm
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:51.640]  saying. I'm not a psychiatrist, but explain. I don't use the terms you use, but it seems like
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:48:00.200]  his whole identity and will is about empowering us. He sees us as him. I mean, that sounds very
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:04.920]  positive, but also can have some dangerous connotations if they're setbacks, but break it down.
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:13.800]  Well, the connotation, when you have a leader as strong willed as Trump, you also have the notion
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:20.200]  of the higher, I don't mean in a negative way about Trump, but the higher the monkey climbs,
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:26.680]  the further he falls. One of the things that Trump has to watch out for is what we call in the
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:33.160]  business idealization and devaluation. That means everyone he meets or however great he is,
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:38.920]  the higher he goes and the higher he claims somebody else goes, the further it is possible for
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:46.680]  someone like me or others to devalue him. So there's an inherent failure issue within success.
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:52.920]  And that's something that Trump and his people have to understand, particularly Jared, Ivanka,
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:49:00.360]  and the Goldman Sachs boys. They can't go out of too far ahead of the course or the revolution.
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.480]  Otherwise, the revolution will come back to bite them. That's an inherent part of every
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:11.560]  revolution that I've studied involved in. And so what we tend to do in the more effective regime
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:18.360]  change is we lower the flame, we keep it a far more quiet, and we make sure that our potential
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:26.600]  opponents can be successful in certain ways. It's not the greatest thing to make sure that we have
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:31.720]  defeated anyone. We haven't defeated anyone. These are part of America. They're all part of the
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:37.240]  process. We're trying to empower them and hoping we can be good enough to really be worthy of this
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:44.040]  great object. Well, the point is, remember, this is just the beginning, my friend. And in the beginning,
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:49.240]  there are many things that look very, very positive. But like anything else, as you have
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:56.200]  repeatedly stated, he is only a human. He knows that his capacity is limited by the fact you only
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:03.640]  have 24 hours a day. He gets tired. He has people who are beyond his family reach. He has to depend
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:08.920]  on others whose ideas are not his and have countervailing. Sure. Well, I've talked to folks
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:13.720]  who've been around Trump ever. He's been working like 20 hours a day, the first few. And I don't
[2:50:13.720 --> 2:50:18.680]  want to get into it, but he is like literally just going in and collapsing. So he's, I tell you,
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:25.800]  he's really doing it though. Well, remember this, Alex, we have many leaders in the military who've
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  also been on duty 24 seven. They have countervailing points of view. And I would certainly caution
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:43.160]  or put a very pleasant advice to Trump and his people to exceed to those of those military
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:49.720]  generals who see things differently. In other words, don't assume that everything he does may
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:54.360]  be the only way to do it. Do understand that the people... Well, I mean, he let Madison point all
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:57.720]  his own people. Same thing with Flynn and the rest of them. Let's do one more segment. And then Paul
[2:50:57.720 --> 2:51:02.280]  Watts is coming up from London. I'm Alex Shoves. Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem

[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:22.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:54:27.960 --> 2:54:33.160]  We've been resisting the globalists and corrupt consolidators of power who want to show it all
[2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:37.960]  up. They think humanity's ugly because they themselves are so ugly, but we have to also
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:45.880]  resist our lesser angels and be good people. We've got Roger Stone's book, everybody that gets it,
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:51.080]  it's signed here, no additional charge, and it's discounted $5, $19.95 out of the gates because I
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:58.760]  bought so many of them, I can discount them, at infowarstore.com. Call toll free at 888-253-33139.
[2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:06.760]  Roger's on the show tomorrow. Now we're talking to Dr. Steve Pachennick. We're almost out of
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:10.760]  time. Paul Watts is going to be taking over. I got to most of it today. I made it five minutes into
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:16.920]  Paul's Town to do a few more clips I want to cover, but make no mistake, I think humanity's coming
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:25.960]  back up to the surface when Trump said in his inaugural speech that March, January 20th, 2017
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:32.680]  is the day that America basically was reborn. I think the whole movement to put Trump in was that,
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:39.000]  but it really was the spoiled brat nature of Obama and Hillary and Obama coming out when
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.520]  Trump did the same thing he's done and bitching. It's like they're so comical. I don't normally
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:49.960]  downgrade my enemies, but if you look at Madeline Albright and Hillary and all these people and
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:56.680]  Michael Moore, I mean, they're like caricatures of losers and it makes me feel bad. How did we ever
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:04.360]  get into a position where these people were ruling over us? Dr. Pachennick? Well, you have to remember
[2:56:04.360 --> 2:56:12.840]  that whatever was the institution is gone. How we got there, it's a multi-level issue. It was
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:21.240]  attention, it was unions, it was all kinds of covert promises and over promises, but the reality
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:28.600]  is we're coming into a new era where literally a businessman and an executive has taken over
[2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:34.520]  a company called America. Now, people say you can't run America like you run a company. That's
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:41.160]  not true. There are many things that we can do as business people where we can change the nature of
[2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:46.280]  our... But I mean, life is a business. It's all calories. It's all numbers. It's all
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:52.840]  survival. It's all procreation. Life is a business. Well, it's a business because we began as a
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:58.200]  business. We started with a revolution called the Tea Party. Every one of our founding fathers
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:06.200]  in the business of real estate or tobacco or cotton and every one of our subsequent entrepreneurs
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:13.640]  came out of the fact that we created in part with England the Industrial Revolution. We are now in
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:19.320]  the process of deciding which countries we want to do business with, which countries we do not
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:24.280]  want to do business with, which country we will go to. Which is part of sovereignty saying America
[2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:29.320]  decides like a woman who we get in bed with. I mean, it's about basic sovereignty. That's why
[2:57:29.320 --> 2:57:36.760]  they're so pissed. Well, that's correct. Basically, what we're doing now is we're negating on the notion
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:42.680]  that we've absolved ourselves of responsibility in the past, meaning we no longer going to acquiesce
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:50.440]  to some group of 110 different nations which may or may not contribute to world peace or the weather
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:56.440]  or Saudi Arabia heading up the human rights board, you know, jokes like that. I'm sorry.
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:00.760]  Saudi Arabia, you know, heading up the UN human rights board, jokes like that. That's absurd.
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:07.160]  And now what's going to happen, despite the fact that Trump has businesses in Saudi Arabia,
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:12.920]  the following countries will be in serious trouble. And I'm not throwing that out as a threat. I'm
[2:58:12.920 --> 2:58:18.360]  just saying it's evident. One is Saudi Arabia. They have an unemployment rate among their youth
[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:26.920]  of over 40%. Next is Qatar, then Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Then you go into Turkey, which
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:31.000]  has trouble. Then you're going into Germany. Hold on. Do five more. This is important on
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:35.720]  geopolitical. The Dr. Steve Pachinic, who's overthrown plenty of tyrannical regimes. Who he
[2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:40.600]  thinks the next dominoes to fall are. I tell you, those Islamic regimes are such spoiled, rotten
[2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:48.680]  people. They treat their people horrible. I'd love to see them fall. We'll be back.
[2:58:49.560 --> 2:58:56.040]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[2:58:56.040 --> 2:59:00.680]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us. It's been something that I've been
[2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:06.200]  working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process
[2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:12.760]  is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups
[2:59:12.760 --> 2:59:17.480]  on the end of our chromosomes. And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it
[2:59:17.480 --> 2:59:23.320]  has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It
[2:59:23.320 --> 2:59:29.400]  works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to
[2:59:29.400 --> 2:59:35.560]  deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star reviews. I take this.
[2:59:35.560 --> 2:59:40.920]  This is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the profit we make. We fight the global,
[2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:46.280]  we fight the new world order. Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free
[2:59:46.280 --> 3:00:06.280]  888-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:25.000]  We're going to google this or search it in this live on air. But I think Saudi Arabia has got
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.960]  something like 8,000 princes. And the lowest level one gets like 5 million a year. I mean,
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:34.520]  I'm going from memory. We can pull it up. Just the number of princes and then what they get a year.
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:40.200]  The general public's real poor. He's smart off against the government to execute you if you're
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:45.240]  homosexual to execute you. And then, you know, when they have a bombing campaign, a guy flies
[3:00:45.240 --> 3:00:50.360]  one air mission from 20,000 feet and drops a bomb with no any aircraft on the village.
[3:00:50.360 --> 3:00:54.840]  They buy him a $300,000 Bentley and give him an iron cross, basically,
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:59.720]  a congressional medal of honor flying cross. I mean, I don't want to sit here and bash
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:06.280]  Saudi Arabia, but what a joke. And some made up royalty the British created, you know, in the 1920s
[3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:11.560]  or whatever. You were getting into failed states and just talking about those. I mean,
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:16.520]  failed states different than one about to fall. But yeah, you talk about 40% of, you know, people
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:22.360]  in Saudi Arabia being unemployed. Break that down, Dr. Pachett, in the next few minutes,
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:26.840]  other places you think are in big trouble. Well, the biggest problem besides the Middle
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:32.360]  East, Saudi Arabia and the Sunni countries will be China. And it's not an issue of a military
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:38.040]  confrontation. It's an issue that President Xi, who was really what we call a princely,
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:43.640]  the son of a major revolutionary, really can't handle the economy, which is totally
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:52.200]  messed up. There is a huge outflow of cash that's going into the United States and elsewhere.
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:58.440]  He has a major devaluation of the yuan. He has companies that are so corrupt that they're making
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:03.640]  up numbers for the bonds that they're selling in the trillions of dollars, and he has political
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:09.320]  unrest. What that means for the United States is that we're not going to war. We simply have to
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:15.800]  stabilize and help him to stabilize his own government before he thinks that an external war
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:21.400]  can help him out. The truth of the matter is that China is both economically and politically very
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:28.040]  fragile. They have no water. They have to depend on the Himalayas and the water that goes into India.
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:33.480]  If there's going to be a war, my prediction would be that it would be between India and China over
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:43.480]  water rights, because China has less than over 500 million people have no water. Then you go into
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:52.360]  the countries in the EU. England is going to drop out. Germany now has the basis of the
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:58.280]  foundation of the EU. France is in a terrible shape. Spain is in terrible shape. Greece is in
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:04.920]  terrible shape. Italy, Portugal, terrible shape. The one country that seems to be cleaning itself
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:11.880]  out even better than we have is Brazil. Brazil has indicted its former president, Lula, the president
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:17.000]  before that, its vice president now. And they're having a very similar nationalist, anti-globalist
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:22.440]  movement. Correct. And the Brazilians are lovely people. They're not aggressive. They're wonderful
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:29.720]  Catholic from Portugal. And they have effectively neutralized for their senior people and are
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:36.120]  continuing to do that in their Congress. So I see a very optimistic future for Brazil. I do not see
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:43.800]  one for Venezuela. He should be taken ahead of it. Argentina will come back up and other Latin
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:50.120]  American countries as well, hopefully Chile. What happens with Cuba? America will still be the
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:55.160]  load star for most of the countries around the world. Not because we're going to send troops,
[3:03:55.160 --> 3:04:00.920]  but simply because of the model that we're instituting now of an internal revolution without
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:07.320]  violence becomes a very important paradigm for people all over the world. It started in
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:13.000]  Arab Spring in Egypt. It didn't succeed there because in turn the military had to be put in.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:19.640]  But now what the world is going to watch is how effectively Trump and its people can literally
[3:04:19.640 --> 3:04:26.920]  make changes. 1776 worldwide. That's right. Could you call it 1776 worldwide? Yeah. I think it's a
[3:04:26.920 --> 3:04:33.640]  valid point. This is more significant in any way than, well, I can't say more. It's equal to the
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.160]  world. It's a continuum as you said. 1776 because we're literally in the 21st century where the
[3:04:39.160 --> 3:04:45.400]  new commodity and the new way of relating is through binary numbers. Sure, sir. In that original
[3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:50.520]  route though of 1776, now is into the mighty tree. Thank you, Dr. Pachennick. StevePachennick.com.
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:54.200]  Find his books some more there. Thank you, sir. I'm going to come right back and introduce Paul.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:57.640]  Plus, I got the real numbers of the Saudi princes. It's worse than I said. Stay with us.
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:02.680]  There's one ex-official that's calling on Mexico to, quote,
[3:05:02.680 --> 3:05:07.320]  unleash drug cartels to punish President Trump. He's suggesting that drugs should be
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:11.480]  allowed to flow freely into the U.S. Of course, I'm talking about former Secretary of Foreign
[3:05:11.480 --> 3:05:16.760]  Affairs George Castaneda. He's calling on Mexico to punish Trump for his actions on deporting
[3:05:16.760 --> 3:05:21.800]  illegals here in the U.S. and building a border wall. He's suggesting that criminal cartels should
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:27.800]  be allowed to run drugs freely in the U.S. During an interview on CNN, the ex-official suggested
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:32.840]  that drug cartels could be unleashed on the U.S. as retribution for, quote, Trump's aggressive
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:37.800]  stance toward Mexico. He goes on to say, Mexico has a lot of negotiating ships in this matter.
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:41.640]  For example, drugs that come through Mexico from South America or drugs that are produced here in
[3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:46.280]  Mexico all go to the U.S. This is not our problem. We've been cooperating with the U.S. for many
[3:05:46.280 --> 3:05:49.960]  years on these issues because they've asked us to and because we have a friendly, trustful
[3:05:49.960 --> 3:05:55.000]  relationship. You know what, pal? That relationship does include a wall which is being built whether
[3:05:55.000 --> 3:06:00.120]  you like it or not. I'm Margaret Howe reporting for info wars dot com. Ladies and gentlemen,

[3:08:13.640 --> 3:08:18.760]  from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:24.760]  All right. I'm about to turn this over to Paul Watson, hosting from London, England with all
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:29.400]  the important information he's got to cover there about eagerly awaits. But just finishing up,
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:34.440]  I went off memory and said nine, 10,000 Saudi House members getting millions of dollars of
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:39.320]  peace, some billions a year. And I'm sorry, the numbers grown since I looked at it six,
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:42.920]  seven years ago or whatever. I just had my head nine, 10,000, but I said, check it.
[3:08:42.920 --> 3:08:51.000]  15,000 members of the Royal House, but 2000 get the hundreds of millions a year.
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:56.680]  But the lowest level gets like a Bentley and, you know, every year in a helicopter,
[3:08:56.680 --> 3:09:03.240]  every 10 years in a jet and $3 million a year, higher ups get billions a year. I mean, this
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:10.920]  is, this was all set up by British intelligence between 1901 and 1930. I mean, they were building
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:16.040]  it and turning it loose. The most radical form of the hobbyism, they would, they would attack the
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:21.720]  spice trail. They would attack the caravans going through Mecca.
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:25.960]  All right. I'm going to turn things over to Paul Joseph Watson. I've got this selfish question to
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:29.800]  my friend. Give me your honest assessment of Trump. I mean, I know about a year and a half ago,
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:33.800]  you had cold feet, but like team, you love him now. Obviously he's been delivering, but 10 days
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:38.360]  in, I mean, what would you call what's happening and the establishment media only intensifying
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:44.840]  your lies, Paul? Well, it's amazing, Alex. I thought going into the first 100 days of Trump
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:48.920]  would be, you know, holding his feet to the fire and making sure that he followed through on what
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:54.920]  he promised. Turns out that we didn't need to worry about that at all. He's going at light speed
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:09:59.800]  with everything that he promised. And of course that's, that's brought this mass frothing
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:06.040]  temper tantrum, the toys out of the prem temper tantrum to the four. Again, the left is completely
[3:10:06.040 --> 3:10:12.280]  determined. They would rather see America collapse than Trump be successful. That's the point that
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:17.240]  it's gotten to now. And you can see it with this travel ban. I mean, we've seen a narrative over
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:23.960]  the past couple of days, which is, oh, what if this offends ISIS? What if this offends terrorism?
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:29.480]  Yeah, they'll get us if we don't capitulate and run a white flag up, even Khan's dad goes on TV and
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:37.400]  goes, you will now face attack. I mean, it's like, wow, how veiled is that asshole? Well, the, excuse
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:42.520]  me, I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, the foreign secretary or the home secretary in the UK has
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:48.200]  just come out. This is on BBT and the road travel, Trump travel band could help ISIS.
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:53.480]  And she's saying it's a propaganda opportunity for so-called Islamic State. Well, number one,
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:59.880]  the very existence of the West and America is a propaganda opportunity. Number two, you actually
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:04.280]  look at what ISIS supporters have written. And we had a big article about this yesterday.
[3:11:04.840 --> 3:11:10.600]  And they are enjoying this because they say directly in their own words, this division that's
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:17.160]  caused by these leftist protesters rioting at the airports, smacking Trump supporters and knocking
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:24.200]  them out with metal objects while chanting, peaceful protest. The ISIS supporters love that.
[3:11:24.200 --> 3:11:30.200]  They want more of that because they see this division as a way to. And then CNN spins it and
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:35.720]  blames Trump like it's his fault. ISIS is attacking and his fault. ISIS is exploiting
[3:11:35.720 --> 3:11:40.920]  their own Soros protesters. I don't see this going well for them though. His Gallup poll numbers
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:47.800]  and Rasmussen only go up now upwards of 60%. We know those are even skewed polls. So what does this
[3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:55.160]  bode poll? Well, it bodes for a second Trump term. I mean, we had a Rasmussen poll yesterday,
[3:11:55.160 --> 3:12:02.120]  58% support the travel ban, only 33% oppose it. Again, in complete contradiction to this
[3:12:02.120 --> 3:12:08.760]  frothing media narrative, the whole country is in a tumultuous hissy fit against Donald Trump's
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:14.680]  travel ban. Complete BS. Most Americans support it. Most Americans think it's reasonable.
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:19.560]  The Americans that do support it don't think that it goes far enough. There's all this rhetoric
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:25.800]  about, oh, why aren't Saudi Arabia on the list? Well, number one, America actually gets detailed
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:31.240]  information about Saudi Arabia exports its tariffs. It doesn't let it go on its own country. So
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:36.280]  they've got real databases on them. Little more sophisticated, but they do send America
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:41.880]  intelligence on Saudis coming into the US. So at least we know who they are. Unlike, you know,
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:46.520]  Iraq and Syria, which don't, that's one reason. Another reason they're looking at adding more
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:53.240]  countries to the list. This list is based on seven countries chosen by the Obama administration,
[3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:59.000]  which of course, the left didn't give a damn about back in 2011 when Obama banned Iraqi refugees
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:03.560]  for a period of six months, double the amount of time that Trump's banned them. And again,
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:08.760]  you've got, you know, Chuck Schumer out there crying back in 2015, and we're going to play the
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:14.200]  clip later. He called off the back of the Obama administration's recommendations for basically
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:20.680]  the same system, a limit on refugees, basically extreme vetting. So in 2015, he's advocating
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:26.680]  the same system in 2017. He's crying. Well, that's my last question, Paul. Is this,
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:33.480]  as they call us fake news, it seems like they've only gone more insane and are now
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:40.760]  attacking basic pillars of known fact, just like Trump is enforcing Obama orders,
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:45.720]  and they act like he's like murdering Islamic children or something. This is totally insane.
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:50.360]  Separately though, very, very briefly here, because we didn't preach, you know, playing
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:55.880]  this live on the radio and TV. You've been with me now, what almost six, but it's 16 years, Paul.
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:14:01.400]  He's done a great job. You've seen him for worse grow from just you and myself and two or three
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:06.920]  others when I first hired you to where it is now. I know I've got to start a Washington bureau, a
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:11.160]  London bureau with at least a few people under you. I know we've got to do this because we're
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:15.080]  going to change history. We've already done it. It's responsibility. I can't just sit here and
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:23.000]  sit idly by. It is about restoring this republic, but encouraging people to support us and buy the
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:27.240]  books and buy the videos and buy the t-shirts and buy the non-GMO heirloom seeds and buy the
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:32.440]  water filtration systems that are 25% off right now. I mean, where can you say supporting an
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:38.040]  organization has had bigger effects on the world than supporting info wars? I don't say that from
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:43.560]  a position of a power trip. It's the opposite. I don't want to grow. I hate managing people.
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:48.440]  I don't want to do all this, but it's the responsibility that I've got to carry out.
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:52.840]  So I want to thank listeners for the support, but Paul unscripted. I know you're a private guy,
[3:14:52.840 --> 3:14:56.760]  but what has your journey been like and where do you think we're going from here? I mean,
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:01.240]  don't you have that same sense? I mean, last night I was texting you at 11 o'clock at night.
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:06.200]  My time you were texting back and I guess five a.m. You were still working. I gotta go to bed.
[3:15:06.760 --> 3:15:11.080]  I mean, I know you just work all the time now. It's an animating spirit. Trump feels it.
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:14.680]  Your take on that and I'm going to let you take over. I'm gone. I want to hear what you have to say.
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:21.480]  Well, the numbers are clear. We're having as big an impact, more of an impact than we've ever had
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:27.160]  before. I get literally, what, 2000 messages a day from people all over the world saying,
[3:15:27.160 --> 3:15:33.960]  we love you. You woke me up from leftists, from millennials, from Muslims, people you wouldn't
[3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:38.600]  normally expect the big difference. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Trump's people know you particularly
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:42.120]  are breaking the conditioning of young liberals. In fact, your scene now is more and more of a
[3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:47.880]  secret weapon, even more than Milo, Paul. You don't realize it. No, I get messages from people,
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:54.040]  not just like college students, not 16, 18 year olds, but literally some of them are 10, 11 years
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:15:58.840]  old and they're already watching my videos. They're watching info wars. They're already
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:03.560]  noticing the brainwashing in the schools. This is a massive revolution that's taking place,
[3:16:03.560 --> 3:16:08.520]  a restoration and we are capturing the minds of the next generation. We're literally redpilling
[3:16:08.520 --> 3:16:14.280]  the next generation because our arguments resonate. I mean, our Twitter feeds, our Facebook feeds,
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:20.360]  we're now competing for example, with BBC News, we're beating them on Twitter. We get more Twitter
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:28.120]  impressions than BBC News. They have 27 million followers on Twitter. What does that mean?
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:32.360]  It means that people follow them just because they think they should follow them. They don't
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:36.920]  resonate. Their message doesn't resonate. That's right. They've got all the followers
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:39.720]  because of all their billions in advertising, but no one's looking at them.
[3:16:39.720 --> 3:16:45.400]  Exactly. That's the thing about info wars, which has always been the case, but now more than ever,
[3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:50.920]  we have an activist audience. We have an audience that will go out to bat for us,
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:57.240]  will push our news. Whereas the BBC, ABC News, whoever, people just let it wash over them.
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:01.000]  Their audience are basically at one end of the spectrum,
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:04.920]  geriatrics at the other end, just really, really dumb people.
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:09.800]  They've got unconscious zombies who aren't in the arena. We've got people with the light
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:13.960]  of God in their eyes. It's beautiful. I mean, I'm gonna tell you, in these crowds,
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:19.000]  whether they be black or white or Hispanic, our fans have such electric eyes and are so awake.
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:23.800]  It's like humbling. I start getting tears in my eyes and I'm like, oh my God, this is magic.
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:29.560]  Then I look at who they've got. I don't say this with pleasure. The women's march looked like undead.
[3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:36.840]  But what is going on here, Paul? I think you've seen a polarization, Alex,
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:43.160]  where at one end of the spectrum, the really engaged, active, well-read people are coming over
[3:17:43.160 --> 3:17:49.000]  to us and the dumbos who are just emotionally react to any news story whatsoever. That's why
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:54.600]  they're drawn to the likes of Rachel Maddow or MSNBC because their brains are literally not as well
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:18:00.040]  developed and they react more emotionally to news events. So they're always going to have those
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:06.040]  people. And yeah, they're always going to have reasonably sized numbers of viewers. Rachel Maddow
[3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:10.520]  probably gets what, a couple of million a night or whatever, but they're not active people.
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:15.880]  You see them on Twitter. In fact, I have arguments with them sometimes. With people who send me
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:21.560]  death threats, I like to engage with them, have a conversation with them. It always turns out
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:27.640]  that they're borderline insane mentally ill people on drugs who have basically just had a mental
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:32.280]  breakdown and they're just lashing out on... That's right. All they've got supporting them,
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:37.080]  I'm skipping the sprays here more time, is unfortunately people that succumb to the propaganda.
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:41.480]  These are fallen fellow humans. The problem is you try to help them. They bite your hand.
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:48.760]  What do we do? Just move on, Paul. Well, they're fundamentally unhappy people, which is why
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:53.480]  I've said recently, I think the media's legitimization of violence and we saw it
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:59.960]  escalate after the Richard Spencer incident where he got punched on all the leftist came out and said,
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:04.120]  yes, it's good to punch Nazis, which basically... How dare you ask the question if you should punch
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:10.520]  a Nazi or not? Yeah. The nation news week came out with these articles saying, oh, it was beautiful.
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:17.640]  We could have put it to the sound of music. Okay. Violence to advance a political cause.
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:23.080]  You Google that. It's called terrorism. Okay. First, it's Nazis. Then they started talking
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:27.320]  about, oh, Breitbart writers, let's go out and punch a Breitbart writer. All right. So it's
[3:19:27.320 --> 3:19:32.360]  basically anyone who you disagree with. And then here's what happens. You punch me,
[3:19:32.360 --> 3:19:36.280]  I bash your brains out, then I'm bad for defending myself because let me tell you something.
[3:19:36.280 --> 3:19:43.720]  You punch me, I'm going to attack you. Exactly. So all those people who advocated violence against
[3:19:43.720 --> 3:19:49.080]  those with whom they disagree politically, in other words, terrorism, all right, you've lost
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:54.520]  your right to have an opinion on an issue such as what happened up in Canada, where you had,
[3:19:54.520 --> 3:20:01.000]  supposedly, this right-wing extremist go to a mosque, shoot dead six Muslims. That's tragic.
[3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:06.120]  I'd condemned it as soon as I found out about it because all violence in pursuit of political
[3:20:06.120 --> 3:20:11.320]  objectives is terrorism and it's wrong. The problem is the left doesn't think that. They
[3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:15.800]  think that so long as they disagree with you, that they can strike out, they can punch you in
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:20.520]  the face, they can set Trump supporters' hair on fire, they can launch acid attacks at the
[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:27.800]  deplorable. Okay. So from now on, the people who made that argument, every time a far right
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:32.440]  not case does go out and kill people, you've lost your right to have an opinion on that.
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:38.280]  The other aspect of this, Alex, the right, it's fringe, crazy, violent extremists,
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:45.160]  the right always condemns them. The left encourages them. I mean, look at the narrative since Trump
[3:20:45.800 --> 3:20:51.080]  basically became the nominee before he became the nominee. Again, violence at his rallies
[3:20:51.080 --> 3:20:56.360]  was blamed on Trump, was blamed on Trump supporters, was legitimized by the mainstream media.
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:02.280]  They had the guy who tried to run up on stage and attack Trump. I think it was in Ohio back in
[3:21:02.280 --> 3:21:09.000]  March of last year. The next day he was on CNN. They were lionizing him. Look at Michael Sanford.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  I'm going to play a clip later. This is a 20-year-old British guy who went to a Trump rally,
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:20.200]  tried to grab a police officer's gun, and he planned all this out, tried to assassinate Trump.
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:26.120]  They're now producing sob story documentaries about him, saying that this guy who tried to
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:30.200]  assassinate Trump was just misunderstanding. Bottom line, the left fantasizes about violence
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:34.200]  all day, but if you defend yourself against them, they claim you're attacking. Paul,
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:37.640]  I wish you'd do the show more than once a week. Everybody loves you. You're doing a great job.
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:41.320]  Take over, my friend. I get to talk to you more here on air than I do in private,
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:45.480]  because we're both so busy, but thanks for doing a great job. Paul, just take over.
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:50.120]  Okay, thanks Alex. Yeah, let's get into this now because I mentioned it before.
[3:21:51.080 --> 3:21:56.440]  This is about the independent. Quebec Mosque shooting suspect was a fan of Donald Trump and
[3:21:56.440 --> 3:22:02.200]  Marine Le Pen. Now, of course, initially, the report said that this involved two suspects.
[3:22:02.200 --> 3:22:08.440]  Two suspects were arrested. One was a guy called Mohammed Khadir who had Moroccan origin, obviously
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:16.120]  a Muslim. That country is what, 98% Muslim. The other one was basically a white student from Quebec.
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:22.040]  It later turned out that the Mohammed Khadir individual was just an eyewitness,
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:28.440]  and in fact, this guy, Alexandra Bissonette, was the sole assassin who tragically killed
[3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:33.240]  six Muslims at a mosque there in Quebec. Now, of course, when this story first emerged,
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:37.880]  I think it was on the evening of Sunday or late night Sunday up there in Canada,
[3:22:38.760 --> 3:22:44.360]  it was at the top of the headlines. Leftists were outraged. They were screaming bloody murder,
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:51.000]  of course, an attack on a mosque. This has to be Alex Jones's fault. This has to be
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:55.560]  Donald Trump's fault. This has to be Marine Le Pen's fault. Now, what initially happened was
[3:22:55.560 --> 3:23:01.000]  you had, I think it was the Daily Beast, CNN and others, they came out and paced off of a fake
[3:23:01.560 --> 3:23:07.720]  Reuters Twitter account, a parody account, which was obviously a fake. They reported the names
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:13.480]  of the two shooters, the two terrorists with these two white supremacists, and then they gave the name
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:19.800]  falsely of these two individuals that they blamed for the attack. It was obvious to anyone with an
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:26.360]  ounce of common sense that this was a fake Twitter account, yet they reported that. And it went
[3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:31.240]  around for a couple of hours that this was a white supremacist attack. These two individuals were
[3:23:31.240 --> 3:23:36.120]  the culprits. Of course, that turned out to be complete BS. So then they had a problem.
[3:23:36.840 --> 3:23:41.160]  We slowly found out more about what was going on with this attack. And then it came out that
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:46.840]  one of the alleged suspects, one of the suspects that had been arrested was this guy called Mohammed
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:52.760]  Kedia from Morocco, or at least I have Moroccan origin, and the Al Aqbar was shouted during the
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:24:00.920]  attack. As soon as that came out, the left suddenly lost all their outrage about this incident.
[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:06.200]  And you could see it drop down in the headlines, despite the fact that it was still, you know,
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:11.480]  relatively fresh news within 12 hours of the attack. Every single mainstream media website,
[3:24:11.480 --> 3:24:17.720]  you could see it drop down the news. Then, of course, it was revealed that this Mohammed Kedia
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:22.440]  was just an eyewitness. He wasn't the culprit. The culprit was a white supremacist called
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:28.280]  Alexandra Bissonetti. And once they found out how it rose back up in the headlines because
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:35.000]  agenda. So again, they don't care about innocent Muslims being killed. They only care if they
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:42.280]  can blame it on their political adversaries. All violence in pursuit of political objectives
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:48.360]  is terrorism, whether the culprit is a Muslim, a black guy, a white supremacist, whoever. Okay.
[3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:53.720]  That's the definition of terrorism, violence in pursuit of a political objective. This should
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:25:03.400]  be condemned. This is terrible. But again, the right condemns extreme right wing extremists who
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:08.680]  commit violence, far right fringe extremists who commit violence. The right condemns those people.
[3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:14.760]  Only extreme fringe elements of the right, like the Westboro Baptist Church or whoever,
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:20.840]  don't condemn those individuals. You look what happens on the left. They not only don't condemn
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:26.120]  the individuals responsible for violence in pursuit of political objectives, i.e. terrorism,
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:31.400]  they embrace them, they legitimize them. In fact, let's go to that BBC clip now.
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:37.640]  This was a guy, Michael Sanford, 20 year old British citizen who tried to assassinate Donald
[3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:43.960]  Trump, tried to pull an officer's gun and shoot Donald Trump dead. Listen to the tone of how
[3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:50.680]  they're now treating him in this BBC sob story documentary. Let's go to that clip now.
[3:25:53.640 --> 3:25:59.800]  But how did a young British man from Surrey end up trying to assassinate the most controversial
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:06.440]  and high profile man in the world? Donald J. Trump. We've always just been a very,
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:10.760]  very close family unit. We thought Donald Trump was the worst thing for the world.
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:17.320]  This is not a hardened criminal. This is just a young kid who found himself in an awful situation.
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:24.120]  He tried to assassinate him. He was a wolf in sheep's clothing. Michael is due to be sentenced
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:30.840]  and could face decades in prison. Michael Sanford could have altered the course of American history.
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:34.840]  But were these the actions of a boy with a history of mental health problems?
[3:26:35.480 --> 3:26:39.000]  He seemed just a totally different personality from the boy I'd known.
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:44.440]  You know, he's going to spend his 21st birthday in prison, someone who really shouldn't be there.
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:48.600]  Or was it a premeditated attack?
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:50.840]  When Michael was shooting, he was doing this.
[3:26:50.840 --> 3:26:56.280]  Who's he working for? Maybe he got radicalized.
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:27:00.600]  There's nothing I can tell him that will make his situation any better.
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:04.120]  And I just want my son back.
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:11.640]  That's the BBC talking about a guy who planned to and tried to assassinate Donald Trump.
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:18.280]  Can you imagine the BBC coming out with a documentary about Dylan Roof portraying it in
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:24.280]  that manner, like it's a big sob story, like this poor, misunderstood, mentally ill individual.
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:30.280]  Of course, they always trot out the mentally ill explanation when it's a left-wing terrorist
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:35.480]  or when it's an Islamic terror attack. But you dare do that when it's anybody else and they come
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:41.640]  down on you real hard. But, you know, strictly speaking, liberalism is a mental disorder, so
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:45.960]  mental illness is involved. But again, just listen to the tone of that piece, which again,
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:53.720]  goes to my central point. The right condemns its fringe extremist violent element. The left doesn't.
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:28:01.480]  It embraces it. It encourages it. I mean, you saw the event at Portland Airport on Sunday afternoon,
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:07.080]  where they rushed in, they smashed this member of the Bible believer group over their head
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:12.200]  with a metal pole. They started kicking him in the head until some of his friends could get
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:18.280]  around him and protect him. And you could hear what they were yelling, yes. Hunt the Nazis.
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:23.000]  Hunt the Nazis. They were whooping and hollering while this was happening. The crowd then broke
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:29.720]  out into a chant, peaceful protest, after they just smacked this guy over the head with a metallic
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:36.600]  object, left him in and out of consciousness, vomiting, and they're there chanting peaceful
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:42.360]  protest. Again, they're not peaceful. These are violent individuals. Yeah, most of them who
[3:28:42.360 --> 3:28:47.960]  advocate violence are never going to partake in it. Look at this guy screaming at him. Like, yes,
[3:28:47.960 --> 3:28:55.160]  yes, that's what you get, Nazi. So now everyone's a Nazi who disagrees with far left anti-Trump
[3:28:55.160 --> 3:29:00.520]  rioters. And so it's perfectly fine to attack them, to physically assault them in the street.
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:08.040]  Again, that's called terrorism. It's the very textbook definition of terrorism. The left never
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:14.840]  condemns this behavior. The nation Newsweek after the attack on Richard Spencer came out
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:21.640]  and glorified it. They venerated it. You can go back to Ferguson Time magazine in defense of rioting.
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:29.720]  They glorify they venerate mob violence, mob attacks. So again, goes back to the central
[3:29:29.720 --> 3:29:35.480]  point. The left is now openly embracing terrorism. It's no surprise that their rhetoric is now
[3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:41.400]  mirroring and matching actual ISIS sympathizers, which we're going to get more into after the
[3:29:41.400 --> 3:29:45.960]  break. This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com. Don't
[3:29:45.960 --> 3:30:04.120]  go away. We've seen politicians from across the world like whining sniffling babies over Trump's
[3:30:04.120 --> 3:30:09.880]  immigration ban. We've seen city con declare actual war on President Trump because he has the nerve
[3:30:09.880 --> 3:30:13.880]  to point out that some people come from terrorist places and we should have a temporary travel ban.
[3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:18.840]  We've seen Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, actually cry stating that the Statue of Liberty
[3:30:18.840 --> 3:30:23.240]  is shedding tears because Liberty has taken such a hit this week because of Trump's ban. I've got
[3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:28.120]  news for you people. The countries that are on Trump's ban were actually identified by President
[3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:33.480]  Obama. At least 20 alleged terrorists since 2014 have come from countries affected by Trump's
[3:30:33.480 --> 3:30:38.600]  immigration ban. There's an article up today on the Daily Caller and identifies these 20 alleged
[3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:43.720]  terrorists in the past three years. They were actually immigrants or refugees from seven majority
[3:30:43.720 --> 3:30:49.160]  Muslim nations that President Trump has temporarily banned in his migration ban on Friday. These
[3:30:49.160 --> 3:30:54.680]  countries include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. They won't be allowed to
[3:30:54.680 --> 3:30:59.400]  emigrate to the US for the next three months. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for info wars dot com.

[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:25.160]  of how long i've been here now it's probably closer to 15 years at this point but again absolutely
[3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:32.760]  amazing support that has built this platform at no point during those 15 years did we ever
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:40.600]  ever have to sacrifice editorial integrity we never took money from anyone who told us
[3:35:40.600 --> 3:35:46.680]  what to say or who told us what not to say now that is extremely important just think about that
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:52.200]  you know we're not perfect we're going to make mistakes but you know it's coming from a pure
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:57.480]  position we're at least trying to tell the truth do we have an agenda yes we wear it on our sleeve
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:02.920]  we're not hiding it unlike the mainstream media which feigns neutrality and is the most
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:08.600]  bias operation out there we don't take money from anybody who tells us what to say or what not to
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:14.200]  say we have products if you want to buy them buy them if you don't and don't i mean most of the
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:18.840]  stuff is free available on the internet anyway basically everything is at this point but the
[3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:24.120]  fact that you have brought the pod the product is what has brought us to this point which is why
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:31.080]  we're attacked by the mainstream media because they know no matter how many bubbles we have no
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:36.920]  matter how many mistakes we make from time to time that it's all coming from a pure source and they
[3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:43.880]  can never compete with that because their very existence is dependent on taking money from
[3:36:43.880 --> 3:36:49.400]  people who tell them what to say and what not to say i mean look at cnn literally they take
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:57.160]  money from gulf arab state dictatorships and every time they have these propaganda pieces
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:01.960]  about how great Bahrain is as they're literally slaughtering their own citizens on the street
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:08.680]  yeah we don't have to make that sacrifice of our integrity they do and yet still they have the
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:15.400]  ability to call us fake news and they're literally taking cash from brutal dictatorships who kill
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:20.680]  their own people again to produce propaganda puff pieces about them we don't have to do that
[3:37:21.480 --> 3:37:29.320]  we exist we grow through your support again product info warsaw.com that's why we have
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:33.880]  an activist audience it's not just an activist audience in terms of you know getting out and

[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:45.080]  think there's any other media operation on the planet right now which has as loyal support

[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:04.680]  from you our viewers our readers and by you getting the products at info warsaw.com like
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:12.040]  alexa pure pro water filters 25 percent off and roger stone's new book heading back into the news
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:17.800]  now we were talking about before i just want to finish up on this how the right condemns
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:24.360]  its fringe violent extremists and how the left encourages them all the time another example
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:30.440]  of this this is that information liberation like lives matter seattle speaker we need to
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:43.560]  start killing people let's go to the clip
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:10.840]  life is now devoted to social change right we're all operating under white supremacy just so you
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:19.560]  know and we need to start killing people first off we need to start killing the white house the
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:37.240]  white house must die so there you see a blm protester saying quote we need to start killing
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:44.440]  people and all the leftist blm supporters in the audience cheer now bearing in mind as i've said
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:50.120]  on many occasions this is an organization black lives matter whose inspirational guru
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:56.360]  whose name they chant at all their protests is a convicted cop killer on the fbis most wanted
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:40:06.200]  to mess the terrorist assault to jacquard okay so why given that ideological foundation given
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:10.680]  the fact that they chant for dead cops we played that video before given the fact that their
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:16.440]  supporters their sympathizers have assassinated cops and after the fact said it was a black lives
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:21.400]  matter revenge attack in the case of ishmael brindley in new york because we had the dallas
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:27.640]  sniper incident motivated by the race hatred driven by black lives
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:34.760]  this is a domestic terrorist group they've called for violence their supporters have
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:40.440]  carried out violence that sounds like terrorism to me and yet what did we see barack obama
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:47.160]  literally having meetings with their leadership hillary clinton saying that she would change
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:54.200]  laws for black lives matter so again the right condemns its fringe violent extremists the left
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:41:01.000]  embraces and encourages them we've seen that narrative for two weeks now richard spencer got
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:06.440]  punched a bunch of lefties came out and said yes this is completely acceptable we need to go out
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:11.960]  and punch nazis problem is anyone who disagrees with you is a nazi so that's quite a broad
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:18.600]  spectrum of people at this point isn't it so again those people have forfeited their right
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:24.360]  to be outraged about something like what happened up in canada a couple of days ago where this far
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:31.320]  right individual shoot six muslims okay you can't have it both ways you can't have your
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:36.760]  cake and eat it you can't say oh violence in pursuit of a political agenda is acceptable
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:42.600]  but only against these people okay no you've made you've made that bed now you have to lie in it
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:47.880]  whereas we're going to continue to argue that no you can't just bash people over the head with
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:55.320]  metal poles because they support trump you can't set their hair on fire you can't try to assassinate
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:02.440]  donald trump and isn't it cute all these comedians all these uh leftists out on twitter still with
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:08.280]  the assassinate donald trump jokes in fact there was a writer for the sunday times here in london
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:15.400]  who said on twitter quote it's about time for the assassination while all this muslim ban his
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:21.320]  theory was taken place a couple of days ago she'd left the tweet up for over 24 hours this is
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:27.800]  a mainstream leftist columnist for a major british newspaper she works for other
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:34.760]  media organizations as well openly calling for the assassination of a head of state and she
[3:42:34.760 --> 3:42:41.800]  thinks she thinks it's cute she thinks there's not gonna be any punitive punishment for that
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:48.680]  in any way no backlash whatsoever it took her over a day to delete it but they're still coming out
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:54.120]  with this stuff i mean look at this headline out of the inquisitor donald trump assassination
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:43:01.960]  magnetone cee ted cornblum apologizes the founder and ceo of guitar amplifier magnetone
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:06.280]  has apologized for a facebook message about the potential assassination of donald trump
[3:43:06.280 --> 3:43:12.440]  he said quote this is what he said in his own facebook post yesterday rest easy people it'll
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:20.600]  take only 100 days till trump gets a bullet in the head he followed up the message by posting what
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:25.800]  appears to be an image of travis bickle the political assassin portrayed by robert deniro
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:32.600]  in the iconic movie taxi driver next to trump of course in the plot of taxi driver you have this
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:39.400]  unhinged leftist who plans to assassinate a political figure we saw that before with ross
[3:43:39.400 --> 3:43:44.680]  doubt at the uh new york times columnist who claims he's a conservative but is an anti-trump
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:50.920]  zealot this was around a year ago coming out and joking about trump being assassinated
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:59.320]  then tweeting a video of a scene from a christopher walken film where his character assassinates
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:07.800]  shoots a political figure can you imagine what would happen if this was people on the right
[3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:13.960]  people in imagine people working for bright bar people working for national review people working
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:21.560]  for fox news if they were out on twitter you know weeks after obama's inauguration back in 2008
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:26.680]  if they were out on facebook tweeting jokes about people assassinating obama tweeting
[3:44:26.680 --> 3:44:33.720]  plots from movies scenes where a president or a political figure is assassinated the left would
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:40.200]  be apoplectic they would be investigated at the drop of a hat they would be fired you would never
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:47.720]  hear of them again yet the left is still doing it every single day they think it's cute to threaten
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:55.320]  the assassination of a head a head of state they still think it's cute and they still seem shocked
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:01.800]  when there's a backlash like how could you not expect a backlash if you're openly calling for
[3:45:01.800 --> 3:45:10.280]  the assassination of a president absolutely insane but it's part of this leftist hysteria this meltdown
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:16.120]  that's been encouraged by the media because now if trump is literally hitler then why would it not
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:22.920]  be okay to make jokes about assassinating hitler right okay so they've created the ground for this
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:31.080]  kind of hysterical unhinged attitude that it's okay to joke out or even directly call for
[3:45:31.080 --> 3:45:36.680]  the assassination of trump and you're going to continue to see it all this woman lose her career
[3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:44.040]  will anything happen to this uh magnetone ceo probably not it's only the left who viciously
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:50.200]  go after people's careers who get them fired for making politically incorrect comments when they do
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:54.840]  it when they call for the assassination of a president well that's just cute isn't it again
[3:45:54.840 --> 3:46:01.640]  amazing double standard she's not been banned from twitter milo got banned from twitter for
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:08.120]  making fun of a ghostbusters actor this woman openly called for the assassination of a president
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:14.600]  she's still on twitter these are the double standards anyway let's move on to some more news
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:20.920]  here we've got a poll this is out of information liberation 47 percent say us heading in right
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:26.360]  direction highest level of optimism in over 12 years a new poll from rasmus and shows americans
[3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:32.360]  are the most optimistic they've been in 12 years president donald trump 47 percent of likely us
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:37.960]  voters think the country's heading in the right direction and then you look at the previous figures
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:44.200]  of people who think america is heading in the right direction or if it's on the
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:50.440]  amazing turnaround obviously obviously since the election it started to creep up again
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:57.800]  but i mean you can look at it for example back in august of last year only 28 percent of americans
[3:46:57.800 --> 3:47:03.960]  thought the country was heading in the right direction now 47 percent think that the country
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:10.040]  is heading in the right direction so again this portrayal of trump as a divisive figure
[3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:18.520]  who is hated and reviled not backed up by the actual facts and figures okay he had 58 percent
[3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:24.760]  then supporting the travel ban on these terralink on people from these terralink's nations
[3:47:24.760 --> 3:47:33.560]  only 33 percent opposed it see that reported by senate because they have to create this mirage
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:38.280]  that it's a big hysterical frothing fit and that everybody's on board when they're not the vast
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:44.200]  majority are not over in the uk we have the london mayor this is out of guido forks blog
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:50.600]  trump ban critic karn hosts israel ban bigwigs so basically you have a guy the mayor of london
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:57.720]  sadee karn who appeared on a stage with an icis supporter nine times before he was elected nobody
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:48:02.440]  seemed to care about that didn't affect the results you also had him a few months ago coming out and
[3:48:02.440 --> 3:48:07.560]  saying i think it was after after brussels or after niece one of the attacks there are so many we
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:12.040]  can't keep up with them at this point but he came out after a massive islamic terror attack and said
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:17.800]  that basically people who live in large cities in the west will quote have to live with terrorism
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:24.680]  so he came out and said basically get used to it this is going to happen over and over again
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:30.600]  there's nothing you can do to stop it this is the price of tolerance this is the price of diversity
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:36.360]  or some of us aren't prepared to pay that price the latest about karn is that just hours after
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:41.160]  demanding the government rescinds its invites president trump over his travel ban of course
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:46.200]  we've got uh one million plus frothing idiots signing a petition like that's going to have any
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:52.600]  effect on anything yeah try going out and voting instead of signing online petitions they tend to
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:59.800]  have more import okay just remember that the karn will tonight host a city hall reception with 11
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:07.000]  dignitaries kris bought israeli citizens from entering so you've got to love this hypocrisy
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  this is the guy who came out a couple of days ago and said well trump's muslim ban which isn't a
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:19.560]  muslim ban but trump's travel ban was quote cruel and shameful that's why he came out and said publicly
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:28.120]  now the same guy is hosting a party so let's just reflect on that trump is bad because he's banning
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:39.400]  individuals from america from the country because of their religion that's terrible he's going to
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:46.120]  host a party with dignitaries from 11 countries who ban people from entering their country because
[3:49:46.120 --> 3:49:55.320]  of their religion 16 in total islamic countries ban israelis from entering because of their religion
[3:49:55.320 --> 3:50:04.440]  no protests about that no protests about karn hosting a party with representatives from 11
[3:50:04.440 --> 3:50:11.720]  of these countries who ban people on the basis of their religion again when are we going to get
[3:50:11.720 --> 3:50:17.800]  past this double standard no protests about that whatsoever nobody knows about it nobody cares about
[3:50:17.800 --> 3:50:23.240]  it again because it's their team doing it they don't have principles they don't have consistent
[3:50:23.240 --> 3:50:31.400]  standards all they have is frothing hysteria every single time moving on we have marina

[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:15.400]  go back to the final segment of this hour i'm going to go to a video now which is rod little
[3:54:15.400 --> 3:54:21.720]  explaining why liberals have basically lost the argument their safe space has evaporated they're
[3:54:21.720 --> 3:54:26.680]  going to have to quickly change their paradigm if they're going to recover from this crushing
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:34.120]  defeat then we'll get back into a few final news stories but here's the clip it's 2017 and liberalism
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:47.400]  is dead thank the lord sooner or later the howling of the moon must die down the catawalling and
[3:54:47.400 --> 3:54:52.760]  shrieking from the affluent well-mannered but tragically gained said liberal middle classes here
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:58.360]  and across the atlantic they will surely realize that the democratic will cannot be subverted simply
[3:54:58.360 --> 3:55:03.480]  by screaming or indeed setting fire to their own training shoes and when the penny finally drops
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:10.360]  they will realize the true magnitude of 2016 the brexit and the election of donald trump and the
[3:55:10.360 --> 3:55:15.640]  huge growth of populist movements across europe isn't simply a case of the uneducated bigoted
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:22.360]  utterment sticking it to the liberal elite out of stupidity or spite now it precedes a huge
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:27.240]  paradigm shift away from the vapid liberalism which has kept the poorest of us poor and with
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:33.240]  less peasant lives and which has caused misery and mayhem in the middle east and beyond 2016
[3:55:33.240 --> 3:55:39.720]  was momentous it was kind of 1968 in reverse and yes sure it was in part a socially conservative
[3:55:39.720 --> 3:55:45.000]  reaction against the identity politics and the infantile leftism of the last three decades but
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:50.920]  it was also a reaction against the devil take the hindmost lay safe air economics the desire for
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:56.360]  change then does not simply come from the right it also comes from the left however if you're a
[3:55:56.360 --> 3:56:03.240]  liberal sorry your safe space has just evaporated so what might this revanchism mean it's certainly
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:08.600]  a great belief in the nation state and in patriotism and a concomitant disdain for meddling in the
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:14.360]  affairs of other independent countries more protectionism perhaps less immigration i suspect
[3:56:14.360 --> 3:56:21.640]  and therefore less exploitation of immigrant labor and a certain acerbity towards abuse of the welfare
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:27.560]  state in future maybe it'll be a case of if you don't give then you don't get but also within
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:32.760]  each country a refusal to accept the widening inequalities in our society and to make sure
[3:56:32.760 --> 3:56:39.480]  that the rich pay their fair share believe me this paradigm shift has been a long time coming
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:48.040]  they have rod little explaining why liberal safe space has evaporated let's hit a final
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:52.600]  few news stories here in the last couple of minutes obama moves to undermine trump presidency
[3:56:52.600 --> 3:56:58.840]  after only 10 days in fact it's probably closer to nine days wasn't it george w bush and we were
[3:56:58.840 --> 3:57:06.040]  no fans of george w bush kept his silence for eight years while obama was in office it took
[3:57:06.040 --> 3:57:13.720]  obama little more than eight days to try and sabotage trump because of course he's a community
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:21.160]  organizer he's the chief idol of the social justice warrior unhinged left-wing extremist
[3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:27.640]  lunatic so of course he couldn't keep his mouth shut by saying that trumps muslim ban was dreadful
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:33.800]  despite the fact that he came up with it in the first place okay crying chuck schumer in 2015
[3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:38.680]  refugee pause maybe necessary we're not gonna have time to play that basically he supported the
[3:57:38.680 --> 3:57:46.200]  very same program back in 2015 now he's crying about it you know chuck schumer supported the
[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:53.880]  attack on libya as well the war that led directly to the refugee crisis yeah we didn't say any
[3:57:53.880 --> 3:58:02.040]  crocodile tears from chuck schumer back in 2011 back in 2012 2013 when those migrants were drowning
[3:58:02.040 --> 3:58:08.200]  in the Mediterranean because of the war the overthrow that he supported in the first place to
[3:58:08.200 --> 3:58:16.120]  install jihadist thugs in libya the source of the migrant crisis in the first place no tears
[3:58:16.120 --> 3:58:23.400]  whatsoever over that leader of portland anti-trump protest charged with sexually abusing minor so
[3:58:23.400 --> 3:58:29.320]  the organizer for the women's march was a sharia law apologist this guy is basically a pedophile
[3:58:29.320 --> 3:58:36.040]  who abuses children these leftists are all class that's gonna wrap it up uh fourth hour coming up
