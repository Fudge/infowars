[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:33.560]  it is September 2nd 2010 on this live Thursday edition we've got James Dilling
[00:33.560 --> 00:38.240]  Cole writer for the London Telegraph joining us to discuss well the
[00:38.240 --> 00:41.480]  different psychological studies that have been conducted by major university
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.880]  showing that your average environmentalist is six times more likely to
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.280]  steal or be violent and that's because really there just want to be elitist
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.520]  control freaks who want to boss you around and parasite off of you and
[00:56.520 --> 01:00.840]  that's why they always call you a parasite and say they want you dead and
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.520]  called children and old people parasites because being wolves being
[01:05.520 --> 01:10.600]  parasites predators they have an instinctive hatred of the young and the
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.880]  old because being psychopathic predators they they they believe that's a
[01:15.880 --> 01:21.640]  weaker group and they scatter like roaches before someone who is bipedal
[01:21.640 --> 01:26.400]  and able to speak someone who can actually walk but if you're in a
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.400]  wheelchair or a baby they just endlessly write poetry literature about how your
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.860]  subhuman trash that must be killed immediately dr. Peter Singer Eric
[01:36.860 --> 01:43.040]  Piaka UT Ted Turner at the press club calling you useless feeders this latest
[01:43.040 --> 01:46.520]  psychopath that the police took out when he was threatening to blow somebody's
[01:46.520 --> 01:50.240]  head off who took over the Discovery Channel he was of course foaming at the
[01:50.240 --> 01:56.400]  mouth calling babies degenerate vile scum these are just some of the terms he
[01:56.400 --> 02:04.760]  used vile parasite humans well don't worry punk one less vile parasite human
[02:04.760 --> 02:11.480]  is dead those little innocent babies aren't vile parasites you are a vile
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.960]  parasite and the police put a couple of rounds into you so you could bleed out on
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.000]  the ground and I bet you're a lot happier now that the earth is safe from
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.960]  one more parasite but of course you're not a parasite you're a grand protector
[02:27.960 --> 02:37.920]  of everyone aren't you but we'll be we'll be discussing that a little bit more
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.920]  today remember what they always promote abortion as you get rid of that
[02:41.920 --> 02:48.720]  parasite woman that's a parasite inside your inside your uterus sucking your
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.840]  blood babies are parasites I was taught that in public school abortion was a
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.760]  wonderful right that massively increases women's cancer rates and breast and
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.080]  their cervix and of course other areas the body associated with reproduction
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.560]  like the uterus and the ovaries of course they didn't tell you that they said
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.440]  get rid of that little parasite and what did Margaret Sanger call black people
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.600]  when she talked about posing as a liberal and hiring black leaders to make
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.400]  the blacks trust them so they could exterminate the the the weeds the
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.360]  parasite she called them parasites and oh they do murder more than half of those
[03:28.360 --> 03:33.640]  so-called parasites they get more than half those black babies and then they
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.960]  have their little their little parasite rulers like slimeball Chris Matthews
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.880]  up there talking about race all day and hyping blacks up to be so full of
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.480]  vitriolic hatred of the average dumb-down drooling white person that they go out
[03:49.480 --> 03:55.840]  and have you know beat up whitey night but oh you bet those black kids I bet
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.520]  they love Planned Parenthood I bet when they see a whitey liberal up on TV they
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.240]  get all warm and fuzzy feelings inside because they've been taught to love the
[04:06.240 --> 04:13.240]  murdering eugenicists Nazis and they've been taught to hate the guilt complex
[04:13.240 --> 04:19.560]  dumb-down who euthanized though they're being soft killed as well little pathetic
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.560]  whitey who when the blacks are beating him up roll around on the ground begging
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.960]  oh I hate myself I'm a whitey don't worry I'm a liberal I've got Barack Obama
[04:30.960 --> 04:38.960]  stickers on my car I support Margaret Sanger I'm a good person all right it's

[04:46.120 --> 04:51.920]  we're gonna go in through and beyond but first I've got a rant on multiple

[05:02.240 --> 05:06.680]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.720]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.640]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.640]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.640 --> 05:23.200]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.240]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[08:11.000 --> 08:20.960]  thank you for joining us it is Thursday already the second day of September
[08:20.960 --> 08:27.280]  2010 I'm Alex Jones your host we're gonna be looking at eugenicis gunman who
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.600]  exposes the dark side of the environmentalist cult for what it is it
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.960]  has nothing to do with the environment in fact the people running the main
[08:38.960 --> 08:46.200]  environmental groups are openly transhumanist and trans planet supporters
[08:46.200 --> 08:53.800]  who openly want to re-engineer society at every level so that is coming up also
[08:53.800 --> 08:59.640]  Paul Hogan vows to fight Australian tax office this is the New World Order he
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.520]  paid taxes in the US and their record show and they just want more and he went
[09:04.520 --> 09:08.400]  to his 101 year old mother's funeral who just died and they're gonna hold him
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.120]  there as a hostage till he gives them all his all their money meanwhile he was a
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.040]  Goldman Sachs swindler he'd be released also we'll get into auto sales worse
[09:17.040 --> 09:25.240]  since August 1983 Rodriguez plans at least two more race war machete films
[09:25.240 --> 09:32.240]  that's set to be released tomorrow we've also got india Holt's HPV vaccine trial
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.280]  after six girls die US does nothing in response to at least 67 deaths and
[09:38.280 --> 09:42.400]  accounting they're just setting the precedent that we die in mass and that
[09:42.400 --> 09:45.960]  that's a good and wholesome and that's just the way it is all part of the
[09:45.960 --> 09:53.040]  eugenics so that is just some of what is coming up today
[09:53.040 --> 10:15.480]  now I want to just go over a smattering of ideas that I basically been
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.960]  brainstorming about in this segment and the next why we've come to this
[10:20.960 --> 10:30.320]  position that we're in now as a society and the biggest point is that we have
[10:30.320 --> 10:37.240]  become decadent empires are never conquered from without they implode
[10:37.240 --> 10:44.640]  and fall apart from within because the populations become decadent they become
[10:44.640 --> 10:54.360]  slovenly they become self-absorbed they become nihilistic and they basically
[10:54.360 --> 11:04.280]  stop having their impulse to be caring and compassionate and people stop
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.200]  sticking together they start thinking that you get ahead by screwing each other
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.720]  and then that creates an atmosphere where everybody is basically screwing
[11:12.720 --> 11:18.840]  each other for a percentage and then society implodes because confidence is
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.320]  lost we've seen this the last six seven years in Mexico where the corruption of
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.720]  the culture and of the government has become so systemic and so system-wide
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.880]  that it is now collapsed into a road warrior type scenario and we saw this in
[11:35.880 --> 11:41.680]  Rome ancient Rome we've seen this in places like North Korea and we're now
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.000]  beginning to see it happen in the United States all over the country major
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.680]  cities and counties and towns are laying off many of their police officers
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.760]  their fire departments in some cases more than half the officers and they're
[11:56.760 --> 12:06.520]  announcing we are not going to respond to regular crimes grand theft auto home
[12:06.520 --> 12:12.560]  invasion armed robbery the officers we've got left are going to be used for
[12:12.560 --> 12:18.840]  fines and fees and revenue generation basically sucking off of you and this
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.560]  really shows we're going into a third world system where the taxes go up but
[12:23.560 --> 12:31.760]  the benefits and the basic services go down and the police more and more become
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.080]  defenders of the ultra rich and the big corporations and the government and go
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.600]  out and fully convert from aiding the public and defending the law and helping
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.920]  the population to being revenue generators who were there to feed off the
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.560]  population so we are now going into the final phase of societal degeneration and
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.960]  collapse and it's not going to take a hundred plus years for the West to collapse
[13:01.960 --> 13:08.280]  like it did Rome 2,000 years ago we are going to see the West accelerate its
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.920]  collapse and the third world nations bordering the West are already in full
[13:13.920 --> 13:19.200]  collapse and this has been engineered and designed by the global social
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.760]  architects that want an end to the industrialized society so that they can
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.080]  fully bankrupt society and on its ashes build their planetary corporate
[13:30.080 --> 13:37.800]  dictatorship which will reduce everyone down to the level of feudal slaves less
[13:37.800 --> 13:42.840]  than one out of a thousand will be part of the superclass you will have a large
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.000]  percentage of the population a large minority that will be law enforcement
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.760]  and bureaucrats and private contractors that will enforce and suppress the
[13:51.760 --> 13:56.080]  population and along with that you see torture being promoted the end of habeas
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.440]  corpus the end of due process secret arrest you see the whole homeland
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.440]  security apparatus of the past presidents and the current president that we
[14:05.440 --> 14:11.400]  were sold that it was designed to be used against foreigners and supposed you
[14:11.400 --> 14:18.040]  know cave dwelling you know al-qaeda and now they admit no it's for anti-war
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.880]  activists it's for conservatives it's for libertarians it's for anti-gmo
[14:23.880 --> 14:31.680]  protesters it's for returning vets it's for anyone on the left or the right that
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.120]  gets outside of the box and realizes that we have an unelected global corporate
[14:37.120 --> 14:44.560]  dictatorship taking over our planet and this entire system of secret police and
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.040]  the whole top secret USA system and the homeland security spy blimps and the
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.360]  naked body scanners at the airports and the face scanning technology and the
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.120]  license plate reading technology and our cell phones being tracked in real time
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.040]  this was all designed from its foundation by the Pentagon funded by big
[15:06.040 --> 15:13.000]  corporations on record to usher in a cashless society control grid so the
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.840]  elite could take over society and then protect their ill-gotten gains by
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.640]  converting the military and police into literal East German type stasi to
[15:23.640 --> 15:29.840]  suppress the population 38 years ago a global program began to take the blood
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.080]  of all children at birth and put it in secret databases that's now
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.760]  declassified and admitted a decade after I exposed it they came out a few years
[15:39.760 --> 15:43.200]  ago and said don't worry we're not saving the naked body scanner images at
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.120]  the airport now they admit they lied to you they were saving them the whole time
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.400]  now the federal courthouses the state courthouses they're all rolling these
[15:52.400 --> 15:58.560]  systems out against the population and admitting hey you know what we are
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.560]  saving these images hey you know what we did lie to you we are taking your
[16:03.560 --> 16:07.480]  babies blood at birth it's not for a blood test it's for a secret global
[16:07.480 --> 16:13.080]  eugenics bio weapons database we want your genetic number we want to patent
[16:13.080 --> 16:18.920]  your blood and say that we own it you are a product that we own that we
[16:18.920 --> 16:24.400]  brainwash that we condition that's what this global psychological warfare system
[16:24.400 --> 16:30.720]  is pushing against the population of this planet and who's at the top of this
[16:30.720 --> 16:36.400]  the mega private banks there's only six of them and they are waging war against
[16:36.400 --> 16:40.360]  your local credit union they are waging war against your local or regional bank
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.000]  that's actually giving you credit they want to consolidate power and out of
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.720]  their Federal Reserve Act of 1913 they have engineered crises and created
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.400]  thousands of trillions of dollars that they controlled that allowed them
[16:54.400 --> 17:00.400]  through unfair trade advantage to take over society now in the last few years
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.880]  they've passed legislation in the name of reforming banking and what has it done
[17:05.880 --> 17:13.200]  it's given this small inner coterie or click of crony capitalists they're not
[17:13.200 --> 17:16.840]  free market they're monopoly men they're creating oligopolies and building
[17:16.840 --> 17:22.880]  towards monopolies this inner click has gotten legislation passed so they can't
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.720]  be investigated by Congress and so the SEC can't be investigated by Congress and
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.800]  so that people like Ken lay and Bernie Madoff can get away with their swindles
[17:33.800 --> 17:40.960]  in the future this is what's going on so the very global banks that are setting
[17:40.960 --> 17:44.880]  up world government and trying to pass their global carbon taxes to fund their
[17:44.880 --> 17:51.600]  system they have now used the crises of the derivatives bubble to sell Congress
[17:51.600 --> 17:58.760]  on giving them more power to take over the entire economy this is a fiat
[17:58.760 --> 18:06.200]  counterfeiting system that is waging war against the real economy and that
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.520]  wants to bankrupt society just like in the old days the banks wanted the
[18:10.520 --> 18:14.440]  farmers not to pay their note so they would go bankrupt so they would get the
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.520]  family farm we've seen this in hundreds of cases in third world nations in the
[18:19.520 --> 18:25.280]  last century and now it's happening again but the same IMF and World Bank
[18:25.280 --> 18:32.120]  system is taking over the United States and Europe and bankrupting our society
[18:32.120 --> 18:43.800]  by design and just as with the decline of Rome and so many other civilizations and
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.560]  empires as things get worse and worse the general public gets more nihilistic
[18:48.560 --> 18:56.120]  more blasé eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die they don't appreciate any
[18:56.120 --> 19:00.240]  of the good things that we have they won't defend the good things that we
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.880]  have and was the French philosopher Victor Hugo that said adversity makes

[24:00.400 --> 24:18.760]  we are back live how many times do you have to be lied to by global
[24:18.760 --> 24:23.240]  corporations by governments before you start realizing that they don't have
[24:23.240 --> 24:28.600]  your best interest at heart if the people that control our nation the
[24:28.600 --> 24:32.200]  military industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about in his
[24:32.200 --> 24:36.720]  farewell address in 1961 if the people that run the military industrial
[24:36.720 --> 24:44.200]  complex don't care about a million plus dead Iraqis in the last decade close to
[24:44.200 --> 24:49.920]  a decade of occupation if they don't care about their lives and the media can
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.760]  sell you that that's okay or if our media can ignore the fact that China
[24:54.760 --> 25:03.160]  arrests Falun Gong peaceful people and holds them and butchers them for their
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.840]  organs do you think the elite running our society care about you no the CIA that's
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.560]  hijacked this nation openly chooses dictators and authoritarian systems of
[25:15.560 --> 25:22.000]  governments worldwide every time they have a choice every time they have a
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.600]  chance to choose what type of government they want to put in place they want an
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.480]  oppressive dictatorship because they represent the big multinational
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.600]  corporations that want to exploit people and are cold-blooded and then the
[25:36.600 --> 25:40.920]  poor liberals come in and vote for bigger government thinking that the big
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.880]  government will counter the corrupt out of control mega corporations and they
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.000]  don't understand the big mega corporations love big government they
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.320]  just buy off the politicians and use big government to extract your middle
[25:54.320 --> 25:59.160]  class or working class wealth and transfer it to them we've got to
[25:59.160 --> 26:04.000]  shatter the left right paradigm and realize the true paradigm is big
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.440]  government versus freedom command and control tyranny versus liberty and no
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.640]  matter how the intentions start out no matter how good people that want big
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.640]  governments reasons for it are no matter how loving their intentions are it
[26:20.640 --> 26:28.280]  always ends up going bad it ends up destroying and enslaving the population
[26:28.280 --> 26:35.160]  and destroying freedom because anytime you create a big system that can quote
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.920]  give people anything they want it can also take anything that it wants and in
[26:39.920 --> 26:46.240]  history it does do that over and over again and it's happening again today in
[26:46.240 --> 26:54.480]  our society so you have a population that's so self-centered and has been
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.360]  caught that it's some type of attribute to not care about their fellow humans
[27:00.360 --> 27:05.680]  and to not be involved and to only want to individually get ahead but when you
[27:05.680 --> 27:09.920]  have that attitude then no one cares about anybody around them and that's vice
[27:09.920 --> 27:16.080]  versa so society begins to accelerate its degeneration and so as people become
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.920]  more and more cutthroat fewer people are willing to trust others fewer people
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.680]  are willing to go into business together fewer people are willing to get
[27:25.680 --> 27:29.840]  involved for a cause because then they believe that nobody else cares so why
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.520]  should they stand up for the right thing why shouldn't they just be corrupt and
[27:33.520 --> 27:40.960]  then society becomes toxic and stagnant and the floor falls out from beneath us
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.240]  and we get a Nazi Germany we get a Stalinist Russia we get a Maoist China
[27:46.240 --> 27:52.440]  we get a Mexico look at what's happened in Mexico in the last decade it is
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.440]  completely fallen apart there are thousands of murders every month now
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.360]  there is bedlam and carnage and death in the streets immigrants from Latin
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.200]  America coming into Mexico trying to get to the United States are grabbed by the
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.640]  Los Zetas and Mexican military and others and taken and extorted and robbed
[28:11.640 --> 28:19.000]  and raped and in many cases they are murdered but do you hear the US media
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.120]  talking about this no you hear them demonizing the Minutemen who've never
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.480]  killed anybody whether you love the Minutemen or hate them the point is
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.120]  they're not extorting the immigrants they're not murdering them in mass
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.680]  they're not killing them so so so why is our big corporate media covering this
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.760]  up because they are helping to launder the money that these Mexican gangs and
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.240]  Mexican police and others are involved in the big mega banks are part of this
[28:44.240 --> 28:51.120]  mafia all of these ill-gotten gains get fed into their system and so we have a
[28:51.120 --> 28:57.280]  choice to make either we get involved we decide humanity's worth saving and we
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.520]  start standing up against corruption and we start supporting people that are
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.920]  telling the truth and they're trying to rally humanity to have some faith in our
[29:05.920 --> 29:12.360]  species and to start trying to clean up our society or you just give into pure
[29:12.360 --> 29:20.120]  evil you just give into corruption and just basically prepare to live in a
[29:20.120 --> 29:26.080]  nightmarish society but the choice is up to you we're gonna come back get into a
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.480]  bunch of news and then I'm gonna continue breaking all this information

[32:14.760 --> 32:18.400]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[32:18.400 --> 32:22.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:22.960 --> 32:27.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:08.680 --> 33:14.200]  we've got the telegraph writer James Dillingpole joining us 30 minutes into
[33:14.200 --> 33:18.880]  the next hour to discuss eugenesis gunman exposes dark side of the
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.560]  environmentalist cult and I've got a special video that I shot and produced
[33:23.560 --> 33:27.960]  just last night that we're going to premiere here on the radio coming up
[33:27.960 --> 33:31.840]  in about 10 minutes that breaks all of that down and then we'll come back from
[33:31.840 --> 33:38.560]  break and I'll give you the latest intel on that front to give you a window in the
[33:38.560 --> 33:47.440]  mindset of these people see he went in with a gun to preach about how we need
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.480]  to get rid of the majority of the population and children are parasites
[33:51.480 --> 33:56.080]  that need to be exterminated that's direct quotes of Peter Singer big big
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.360]  eugenicist at Princeton who the media puts on and says is great see the
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.760]  globalists are smart they come with covert vaccines and drugs that you're
[34:05.760 --> 34:10.440]  told her for your own good and in the video I break down the actual Rockefeller
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.720]  Foundation documents and show them and tell you where you can get them where
[34:14.720 --> 34:18.000]  they admit they made these vaccines they're adding it to the vaccines and
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.240]  they're doing all of this Bill Gates thinks you're so dumb now that he is
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.480]  you know on national television saying we need to develop vaccines to reduce
[34:27.480 --> 34:32.320]  world population and then the audience laughs because it was an audience of
[34:32.320 --> 34:38.400]  globalists it's a it's a power tripping control freak mindset that these
[34:38.400 --> 34:42.960]  scum are into and more and more I realize that of course we're going to be
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.640]  under mainstream media and co-intel pro attack who else is hammering the drum
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.600]  to deal with the big issue of all the soft-kill weapons around us the bis
[34:53.600 --> 35:00.960]  phenol a the sodium fluoride the mercury in the shots the chemicals in the food
[35:00.960 --> 35:07.840]  and water the the the lead in the corn syrup all over the news they're
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.480]  reporting that people are refusing to buy bis phenol a line products and so
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.080]  plastic makers are rushing to produce plastic that doesn't have it in it
[35:16.080 --> 35:23.760]  saying look we're best phenol a you know clean we don't have any the globalist
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.040]  are scared ladies and gentlemen I went to target two weeks ago and I've told
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.600]  this story and almost all of the Tupperware areas are not plastic now
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.920]  they're glass and they advertise hey we're glass we're safe and I've been
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.040]  talking to friends and family who've been in Walmart and other grocery stores
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.400]  and they say it's the same thing glass everywhere or it's plastic and they say
[35:45.400 --> 35:51.840]  we're bis phenol a free remember the last six seven years Monsanto and others
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.080]  tried to sue a milk producers who would put we don't have growth hormone in our
[35:57.080 --> 36:01.620]  milk saying you're not allowed to tell people you don't have it and folks won
[36:01.620 --> 36:06.400]  their lawsuits to say no we're allowed in America to say our cows aren't
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.440]  injected with growth hormone and guess what there's almost no growth hormone
[36:11.440 --> 36:18.040]  milk even available now because people will not buy it and it's the same thing
[36:18.040 --> 36:26.080]  with the vaccines it's the exact same thing people are now waking up to that
[36:26.080 --> 36:33.680]  and it's the same issue with all of these different products the system is
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.200]  scared because they'll sit there and stonewall and push it and tell you
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.160]  there's no problem and tell you it's a conspiracy theory hoping you just go
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.400]  away until suddenly they look strong they look invincible they implode they
[36:46.400 --> 36:51.680]  fall apart just like climate gates come out and expose the carbon taxes as a
[36:51.680 --> 36:58.160]  fraud just like it's come out that the entire carbon tax is a fraud and they
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.360]  are panicking and so they've got families you know shooting themselves
[37:02.360 --> 37:05.960]  killing their kids trying to kill their kids saying they're doing it for Al Gore
[37:05.960 --> 37:09.440]  they've got people taking over buildings with guns threatening to kill people
[37:09.440 --> 37:15.120]  calling you know babies filthy parasites because they hate humanity so much
[37:15.120 --> 37:26.000]  because they've been taught to turn off their will to live their instinct for
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.800]  survival they've been taught that the instinct for survival is bad and that
[37:30.800 --> 37:35.360]  hating themselves and their fellow man is good meanwhile if you really care
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.600]  about the earth and the environment and I agree we take care of this planet you
[37:38.600 --> 37:43.120]  need to understand the globalists say they can pollute anything they want use
[37:43.120 --> 37:47.360]  do you anywhere they want have as many nuclear reactors as they want genetically
[37:47.360 --> 37:51.240]  engineer the entire biosphere release salmon in the ocean that are guaranteed
[37:51.240 --> 37:55.720]  to instinct all natural salmon that's already been done they just don't care
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.760]  because they claim they're about to be godlike in all their writings with all
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.600]  these advanced technologies and that they can just repair it or remake it or
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.800]  make it better than it was more human than human more salmon than salmon more
[38:08.800 --> 38:15.520]  cow than cow more goat than goat more spider than spider they're releasing
[38:15.520 --> 38:21.600]  cross species Chimera spiders cross species Chimera goats cross species Chimera
[38:21.600 --> 38:28.920]  cows cross species Chimera plants by the hundreds everything salmon that have got
[38:28.920 --> 38:35.440]  eight different insect genes in them are now in the ocean they're twice as big
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.320]  more aggressive than the regular salmon they're not even salmon in fact let's
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.520]  just go ahead now and and play this video where I break down this eugenicist
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.400]  who ought to be proud he's dead one more parasite gone and you know I'm
[38:50.400 --> 38:54.720]  actually sad he's dead because he could have been deprogrammed but remember if
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.560]  you are a eugenicist and you hate your fellow man and you think there's too many
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.840]  people don't go take hostages don't kill your children like some of these people
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.600]  are doing or try to kill your children think of all these cases coming out in
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.400]  the news don't go out and kill your kids if you want to kill yourself that's your
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.720]  issue but don't say that you're gonna try to make me only have one child one
[39:16.720 --> 39:21.240]  child policy don't support the spiking of the food and water this is the big
[39:21.240 --> 39:27.720]  issue this is what's going on in the backdrop of society this is why they've
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.240]  got us divided and conquered on so many other issues on race religion all of it
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.000]  meanwhile the scientific dictatorship is targeting everyone with the soft kill
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.960]  weapons and again it's a hundred percent out in the open this is not my
[39:45.960 --> 39:51.160]  opinion think of the magnitude of that but also think of the magnitude of the
[39:51.160 --> 40:00.440]  fact that we have now been able to reach out to people without any mainstream
[40:00.440 --> 40:06.960]  media support and expose vaccines expose this phenol a expose fluoride and
[40:06.960 --> 40:13.640]  mercury and lead and GMO in every major GMO case you study it it's been designed
[40:13.640 --> 40:19.200]  to not just be pesticide resistant to not just be drought resistant it's got
[40:19.200 --> 40:23.920]  the added changes to create a pharmacological crop whether it's
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.520]  soybeans corn it doesn't matter to sterilize you you have a right to say
[40:29.520 --> 40:35.200]  no to this and the eugenicist and their control freak human haters don't have a
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.800]  right to force it on us just like the UN supports forced abortion in China they
[40:39.800 --> 40:44.360]  want forced abortion here they want forced inoculation here but think of how
[40:44.360 --> 40:48.760]  far we've come they ignored us for a decade on this phenol a suddenly it's
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.800]  collapsing the same thing is starting with fluoridation of water with the
[40:52.800 --> 40:58.400]  majority of EPA scientist going public over and over again in public letters
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.920]  saying this causes brain cancer bone cancer it's deadly it reduces IQ here's
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.120]  all the mainline studies it's about to collapse that's why the globalists are
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.320]  moving so fast with starting wars and depression to make you so bankrupt and
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.320]  so barely on the edge of financial survival that you can't even pay
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.800]  attention to what's going on the globalists almost have their scientific
[41:21.800 --> 41:28.080]  dictatorship but on so many fronts they are now failing on so many fronts they
[41:28.080 --> 41:36.680]  are now in deep trouble on so many fronts their system is stalling and now is
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.880]  the time for humanity to come together against this tyranny now is the time to
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.080]  realize that the globalist believe they're gonna inherit the earth and the
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.560]  life extension technologies and all of it by soft killing us and brain damaging
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.400]  us and giving us vaccines that will rewire our brains to quote stop stress
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.480]  or our capacity to get angry and resist well in the words of Howard Beale all I
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.680]  know is first you've got to get mad you've got to say I'm a human being that
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.560]  controls my own destiny here is the video exposing the eugenicist with the
[42:08.560 --> 42:15.760]  gun because this is key information ladies and gentlemen here it is hello
[42:15.760 --> 42:22.760]  friends Alex Jones here with a special report it is September 1st 2010 and a
[42:22.760 --> 42:29.360]  lone nut Malthusian eugenicist environmentalist named James J. Lee of
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.600]  course has taken over with a firearm and reportedly may have explosives the
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.280]  Maryland based offices of the Discovery Channel he's been protesting them on
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.640]  and off according to his own website for more than two years he said that after
[42:43.640 --> 42:48.760]  he saw an inconvenient truth by Al Gore that he felt that he had to do this when
[42:48.760 --> 42:54.400]  Al Gore is openly invested in carbon credits that were developed by Enron and
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.320]  Ken Lay and people like Bernie Madoff on record with Al Gore they know exactly
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.760]  what they're doing there are real environmental problems that are serious
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.360]  and the establishment can care less about that they're using fear mongering
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.040]  about human overpopulation and some of the real problems that are out there
[43:14.040 --> 43:19.160]  from pollution and toxic waste as a pretext to bring in neo feudalism
[43:19.160 --> 43:24.800]  serfdom modern slavery to cut off the resources of the general public all the
[43:24.800 --> 43:28.760]  establishment is doing is taking normal human concern about their environment
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.000]  and training us to turn off our survival mechanism so the establishment can
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.520]  teach us that we're bad and evil as the club of Rome said back in 1991 as the
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.880]  CFR said just last year they're teaching us to hate ourselves so the
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.840]  establishment has a pretext in their war economy to now make us the enemy and
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.080]  selectively shut down industries and businesses that aren't part of the
[43:52.080 --> 43:57.480]  global mafia cabal remember a few months ago we saw the case in Argentina
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.720]  where the father and mother killed themselves but first fired a high
[44:02.720 --> 44:08.560]  caliber bullets into the chest of their little baby but thank God survived but
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.920]  but I just want to say this don't kill yourself for the elite okay all these
[44:13.920 --> 44:18.120]  people that are training you with mind control to want to kill yourself or kill
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.520]  your fellow man or that you have no value they just greedily want the earth
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.800]  and its resources for themselves we literally have hundreds of Rockefeller
[44:26.800 --> 44:30.880]  and Carnegie endowment and you in documents like this one the Rockefeller
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.680]  Foundation 1988 annual report breaks down creating tetanus shots that have a
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.840]  female hormone added to it to sterilize women it also causes a lot of female
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.240]  problems and results in death many times what the UN get caught doing seven
[44:46.240 --> 44:49.760]  years later in Africa Latin America and Asia giving them these shots to
[44:49.760 --> 44:53.200]  sterilize them they first called for vaccines to have
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.400]  sterilants hidden in them in their 1968 report where's this from
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.720]  Rockefeller Foundation we have detailed reports at info wars calm
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.320]  conclusive global distribution of Rockefeller funded anti-fertility vaccine
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.800]  coordinated by the World Health Organization we have all this we're
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.480]  swimming in it there's so many red-handed admissions that I can't even
[45:16.480 --> 45:21.000]  cover at all do you understand that they are putting chemicals in the printer
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.800]  rank that sterilizes men and gives women cancer accelerates breast cancer do you
[45:26.800 --> 45:29.840]  understand they're putting aspartame in hundreds and hundreds of different
[45:29.840 --> 45:33.680]  drinks and thousands of foods that they know causes brain damage and macular
[45:33.680 --> 45:38.960]  degeneration do you understand that they admittedly with the H1N1 shot are
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.360]  increasing children having convulsions tenfold and brain damage and
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.320]  sterilizing them do you realize this is all admitted by these people and they've
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.520]  got mind-numbed cult robots taking hostages trying to kill their children
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.600]  killing themselves the public schools are training kids to go home and tell
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.600]  their parents they can't take hot baths or showers that it's bad for the earth
[46:00.600 --> 46:04.120]  Prince Charles is saying you shouldn't be allowed to take a shower shouldn't be
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.240]  allowed to wash your clothes this is all happening they're training you to be
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.480]  completely robbed and have your standard of living lowered and then basically be
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.120]  sterilized China signed deals for the one-child policy with the IMF and World
[46:17.120 --> 46:22.560]  Bank in 1975 this is gonna happen here these people mean business and they've
[46:22.560 --> 46:26.960]  got a cult of people coming for your property coming for your kids coming
[46:26.960 --> 46:30.840]  for your ovaries coming for your testicles and this isn't a joke and
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.280]  instead of just taking hostages or shooting their kid in the chest like
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.880]  Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Al Gore's minions do they come with the
[46:38.880 --> 46:42.760]  loving doctors who are compartmentalized and mean well not knowing what's in the
[46:42.760 --> 46:47.280]  vaccines not knowing the GMO crops have been designed to sterilize you and every
[46:47.280 --> 46:52.280]  study to reduce fertility we should have a public debate about this do you want
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.080]  to be forcibly sterilized or have your fertility reduced I mean do you know
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.160]  that this phenol A is added to the plastics because they know it's causing
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.640]  infertility do you know that that was planned by the UN more than 40 years ago
[47:03.640 --> 47:07.560]  are you aware that the White House science are John P. Holdren is an
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.360]  admitted eugenicist talking about forcibly drugging and sterilizing the
[47:11.360 --> 47:17.240]  population I'm gonna say it again don't kill yourselves for the elite because
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.080]  they're a bunch of greedy bastards whether the world's overpopulated or not
[47:21.080 --> 47:25.640]  the issue is no one has a right to be covertly poisoning the food and water
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.120]  supply and to be promoting that humans are inherently evil and parasites but
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.040]  this is what Dr. Eric Bianca and Peter Singer and countless others promote and
[47:35.040 --> 47:42.880]  now the hostage suspect James J. Lee has been killed by police because they
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.360]  thought he was a danger and he obviously probably was and then he may have
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.480]  had bomb-making materials and was holding these people hostage so I guess at
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.480]  the end of the day he got what he wanted humanities the enemy and he's dead one
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.680]  less evil parasite on the planet it's so sad because if I could have sat down and
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.640]  deprogram this guy and explain to him from the globalist own documents that
[48:05.640 --> 48:08.920]  they could care less about the environment and are just teaching him to
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.600]  hate humanity so they can play us off against each other and that we can have
[48:13.600 --> 48:19.520]  a real movement for a healthier planet he wouldn't have probably done this this
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.920]  guy is a product of the people he was a fan of Ted Turner finance books Al Gore
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.400]  and you're gonna see more and more families kill their kids and kill
[48:28.400 --> 48:31.840]  themselves and do things like this because this is the new globalist
[48:31.840 --> 48:37.040]  religion your children are being taught to commit societal but also physical
[48:37.040 --> 48:43.520]  suicide this is pure sickness the globalist had care less about the
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.960]  environment they're training you to love genocide and death you have been warned
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.000]  ladies and gentlemen people killing themselves and shooting their children
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.480]  and people taking over buildings with guns because the earth you must get rid
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.920]  of the parasite babies is a load of garbage and my film in-game blueprint
[49:00.920 --> 49:05.200]  for global enslavement covers it please warn everyone you know this is vital
[49:05.200 --> 49:09.800]  information this is life and death and you better get angry about it you better
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.200]  get upset about it it is a fact that you're being poisoned and soft killed
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.720]  it's not my opinion go read their own admissions for God's sakes don't be a
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.160]  yuppie and say well there are too many of us even if you believe that even if
[49:23.160 --> 49:28.120]  that was true do you yourself like your kids being poisoned cancer off the
[49:28.120 --> 49:33.000]  charts brain damage off the charts people 25 getting Alzheimer's people
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.800]  getting early on set of Parkinson's you think this is cute you think losing your
[49:37.800 --> 49:44.560]  eyesight from all these chemicals and biologicals is fun this isn't a game the
[49:44.560 --> 49:49.120]  entire world is now controlled by eugenicist learn what a eugenicist is
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.320]  this guy calls himself a Malthusian that's what founded the eugenicist you
[49:53.320 --> 49:58.240]  better learn this is the big secret this is what it's all about I'm Alex Jones
[49:58.240 --> 50:03.280]  defending humanity against the global parasites you have been warned that's
[50:03.280 --> 50:08.160]  right folks and that's the bottom line here is that they say we're parasites
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.360]  but look at who they are they are the global banking cartel they're the
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.960]  parasites that want big government that want your property that want your
[50:15.960 --> 50:21.120]  resources nine times out of ten they're the ones destroying the environment and
[50:21.120 --> 50:28.680]  hurting the planet and then offering their solution our extermination and the
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.600]  average person is good so they have trouble understanding this but this is
[50:33.600 --> 50:39.240]  the unifying issue the globalists are unified and their hate and greed and
[50:39.240 --> 50:45.040]  their bloodlust against us we must be unified in resisting them and realizing
[50:45.040 --> 50:53.960]  this is the unifying global system and religion that we face the religion of
[50:53.960 --> 50:58.760]  death and destruction of control freakism all of us are under attack by
[50:58.760 --> 51:04.240]  these people hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now
[51:04.240 --> 51:07.880]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[51:07.880 --> 51:11.360]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[51:11.360 --> 51:15.000]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing even gold and
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.840]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.400]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[51:22.400 --> 51:27.880]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[51:27.880 --> 51:31.920]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[51:31.920 --> 51:35.920]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[51:35.920 --> 51:40.000]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.200]  survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[51:45.200 --> 51:56.400]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are
[51:56.400 --> 52:01.200]  the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com the
[52:01.200 --> 52:06.000]  question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.040]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[52:11.040 --> 52:15.520]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[52:15.520 --> 52:18.600]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.160]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define
[52:24.160 --> 52:29.160]  who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[52:29.160 --> 52:34.440]  during the Patriot uprising we have the facts we have the Constitution we have
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.240]  the Bill of Rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen

[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:26.800]  Alex Jones I didn't say anything about Beat Whitey Night at the Iowa State
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:30.880]  Fair last week that broke we didn't link to it yet at FullWars.com
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:34.760]  Prismana.com because I wanted to research it further but it's been confirmed by
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:40.040]  witnesses the police reports and others that large gangs of up to 40 to 50 black
[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:48.880]  youth were beat up Whitey Night and they beat up young women men anybody and the
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:52.080]  mainstream media is playing this down can you imagine of a group of white
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:57.280]  people said beat up Mexican night or beat up black night or beat up Asian night
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:04.480]  or if I mean this is a can you imagine if Muslims had a beat up non-Muslim night
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:07.840]  I mean it would be the end of the world they'd be talking about banning free
[1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:12.760]  speech in America that's coming up after I take some phone calls because it
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:19.440]  integrates in with movies like Machete and again this is all Ford Foundation
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:26.320]  Rockefeller Foundation Fox News funded so I want to illustrate that they fund
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:31.880]  the build the mosque kill the Whitey kill the gringo movement and then they have
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:36.720]  the opposition of Glenn Beck to all of it so it's full spectrum dominance and I
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:41.280]  want to explain this and by the media promoting that's okay to talk about
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:46.160]  beating Whitey killing Whitey we got the black panthers saying that that is a
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:50.560]  self-fulfilling prophecy and you may not like white people but let's just beat
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:54.000]  the New World Order and then you can we can all kill each other I guess you may
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.120]  not like black people but let's just defeat the globalists that are
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:01.360]  poisoning the water and putting in the tracking grids and face scanning and
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.560]  in total enslavement I mean the globalists have us working for their
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.800]  system paying into our own destruction they've got high-tech reservations with
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.880]  30 years at least advanced technology 30 years ahead of what we know of they're
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:18.400]  on a total control freak mode they develop bio weapons that could wipe
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:21.800]  everybody out they've got underground bunkers they're strongly considering
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:27.200]  using it we can wake up a year from now or 20 years from now they've got it
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:33.200]  they're talking about it and they could release a moon raker type scenario but
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:35.600]  they're not going to go off world they're going to go underground they are
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:40.600]  debating it you think this lunatic going in with his gun saying we got to get
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:43.960]  rid of the parasite children and we got to kill people and we got to have world
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:49.000]  government to do it and I love Ted Turner and I love Al Gore I mean people
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.800]  killing their kids killing themselves wounding their children for Al Gore
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:58.360]  they've got their armies of self-hating self-loathing unhappy people that think
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:02.160]  it's fashionable to be nihilistic and hate humanity and civilization and
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:06.880]  Beethoven and architecture and beauty we're an incredible species I love
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:11.760]  dolphins I love elephants we blow them away the human brains incredible I'm I

[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:45.040]  of predictions accurately but i've gotten quite a few calls and emails and i
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:49.840]  didn't really search it out i i happened to cross video this morning of him on
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:55.000]  his television program saying that basically you're a bunch of idiots if
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.120]  you don't believe in manmade global warming we're having record temperatures
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:02.560]  that industrializations the problem that the oil companies aren't paying any
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:08.040]  taxes for their pollution and that carbon taxes are great the big banks that
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:12.760]  openly are scamming everybody and in ron the big energy company came up with it
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:18.160]  this is well known the UN has had to come out admit okay we lied about the
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:21.560]  Himalayas melting we lied about temperature increase for 10 years
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:26.720]  there's been a decline max though says we've had nine areas with record temps
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:31.840]  in the last hundred years depending on which map you use there's three thousand
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:37.040]  to more than ten thousand climate zones and micro climate zones every year i
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:40.400]  can show you hundreds of places that have record cold does that mean we're
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:44.440]  getting colder no i could show you hundreds of places with record hot does
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:50.120]  that mean we're getting hotter no you've got to globally average the numbers i
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:54.640]  mean al gore literally bought was it some seven million dollar more mansion
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.960]  that's at sea level in california but he says that it's all gonna rise and we're
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:04.640]  all dead i just happened to search engine major port records for sea levels
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:10.480]  and we pulled up san francisco sea levels here on air from the coast guard
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:13.680]  and from the port there they've got private groups that have been
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:18.120]  measuring it and if you go back about a hundred and fifty years ago the water
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.480]  was a lot higher then it got a lot lower about a hundred years ago then it went
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:26.240]  back up about fifty years ago about a few inches and now it's gone back down
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:30.440]  again but overall it's lower than it was a hundred and fifty years ago when they
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.920]  started measuring stuff in san francisco that's just i randomly remember last
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  year on air we googled the norm numbers and we're showing them and just just
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:46.560]  pulled up sea level numbers that's what ports do they it's the navies and the
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:52.280]  fishermen and the sailors that first you know discovered that there were moons
[1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:57.880]  around jupiter and discovered a sextet and learned how to navigate and took
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:04.800]  measurements and and created maps of how deep channels were meticulously we
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:11.400]  know that sea levels are not rising the media constantly will point their news
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:16.760]  cameras at some sand shoal there's hundreds of miles of them off the coast
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:20.640]  of texas and they'll intercoastal waterways intercoastal islands and
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:26.720]  they'll say look this old area here at crystal beach is being eroded it's
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:31.440]  global warming it's water level rising they don't tell you 30 miles away
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:35.240]  there's giant islands forming and that overall the intercoastal islands are
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:39.360]  getting bigger remember all those channel islands and others out in the
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:42.960]  pacific that they would have these stunts where they show people in diver
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:49.200]  outfits signing treaties with the UN underwater as stunts saying their
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:52.800]  islands will be underwater well now the major studies have come out they admit
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:56.520]  that the islands actually have gotten bigger and that the water is dropping in
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:04.200]  those areas I mean these are facts these are facts some islands build up
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:08.280]  because of the way channels and water movements change other islands get
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:15.840]  eroded now if you want to worry about the earth genetic engineering
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:23.280]  chimera open air release of animals fish insects plants you name it that's a big
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:29.960]  deal du being used all over the world put a uranium things like that toxic
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.200]  waste a big issue getting dumped in the waterways because we end up bio
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:38.800]  accumulating it animals bio accumulated we eat them look I'm all first not
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.040]  having pollution I'm all for catalytic converters but they take all these good
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:47.160]  ideas that have been sensible and they tack on to that once they get you to
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:50.320]  say okay you have this type of toilet this type of washer this type of light
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:56.480]  bulb you can't take showers every day oh you there's federal zoning on your
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:01.720]  house oh you've got to pay a tax to the IMF and World Bank no no but I'm done
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.240]  talk a Dante maker point go ahead I'm sorry I was you work for an oil company
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:10.360]  according to Max but anyway hold on just a minute hold on just a minute I
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:13.960]  didn't hear that because I didn't have time to watch the whole clip he said I
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:17.640]  work for an oil company he didn't specifically say that but that's he
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:22.120]  touts that line every time I try to you know post the email or link on his
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:26.920]  website all you guys just work for the oil companies but I he had an article
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:30.720]  about how Lord Monkton is a clown I mean you type that into the search engine on
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:35.240]  his website and it board Monkton clown they'll pull up all these articles about
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:40.120]  how he's crazy because he you know said some things in the 80s about gay but
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:45.040]  anyway my other point I wanted to I wanted to make a request could you
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:49.840]  please have Webster Tarpley and Ron Paul do like a great economic debate on your
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:55.560]  show once I would just like you know you know when I get Ron Paul on it's for
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:01.920]  20 30 minutes and he's got his issues and that would be interesting radio but
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:06.520]  I could probably get Ron Paul to do it it's just that I don't agree with
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:11.040]  Tarpley's economic solutions I agree with his economic breakdown and I do
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:16.080]  agree with Ron Paul's breakdown and his economic solutions and so I just don't
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:21.920]  even want to muddy what Ron Paul saying when he graciously joins us but I
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:27.520]  appreciate your call let's go ahead and go to Kyle and Pennsylvania you're on
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:33.400]  the air Kyle yeah what's going on well my broadcast it's lunatic in Maryland
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.880]  you know this is you watch the mainstream news I was watching it today
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:45.160]  show today the lady actually said he had the right idea but went about it in the
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:51.880]  wrong way well you notice when Joe Stack reportedly flew his plane into that
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:15:00.360]  building last year you will notice that the FBI pulled his website under orders
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:05.360]  they have not his website crashed from traffic but it's back up this guy's
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:11.480]  website is back up calling babies parasites scum filth Mexican immigrants
[1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:17.000]  trash filth I mean and of course here's this guy who's Asian and for those that
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:22.360]  don't know Hispanics are are Spanish and Asian that that's that was Asians came
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:26.760]  across the Bering Strait that's their genome and and so here's an Asian
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:32.440]  calling Asians trash and you know anchor babies trash no anchor babies are a
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:36.560]  political weapon and bankrupting our country but I still care about them and
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:40.840]  I want Mexico to be a free country and so yes he had the right idea look Margaret
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:46.240]  Sanger said I want to kill these black parasites their weeds these are quotes
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:49.880]  we're gonna pose as liberals we're gonna kill these people that are in a
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  hammer and they do and the blacks love it and thank them and worship them and
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:58.600]  appreciate 51% of blacks ever being born I mean they do it's a sacrament Jesse
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:02.280]  Jackson all of them you look if you're against killing half the blacks you're
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:07.080]  a racist but if you want to you know go out and beat some whiteies up that's
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:13.480]  loving and good so again the real eugenicist pose as liberals so yes I've
[1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:18.240]  seen the reports of he was a heavenly man he sees the fellow humans as
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:24.840]  parasites he's more like it yeah he's just a screwed up homeless nutcase who
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:29.240]  saw Al Gore's movie and got scared to death and thought he was gonna save us
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:33.160]  by holding people hostage like these parents in Argentina that shot their
[1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:36.280]  baby in the chest and then killed themselves and the media was like oh
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:41.080]  hell loving well good all of you people instead of trying to steal my property
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:45.080]  and tell me I can't produce and tell me I can't have a life but you love the
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:50.480]  nuclear reactors and the DU and the GMO and all the real problems hey there's
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:57.120]  firearm shops nearby do not go and kill anybody do not kill your children I
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:00.400]  don't want you to commit suicide but if you're planning on killing kids or
[1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:04.920]  killing yourself there's nearby cliffs everywhere I mean there's a lot of big
[1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:09.320]  mountains outside Austin there's the scenic overlook on 360 and and if you're
[1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:12.920]  really into this and and and you're thinking about killing people please
[1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:17.120]  don't kill people please I know you think it's loving and wonderful and I'm not
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:20.720]  telling you to kill yourself but before you hurt somebody else seek medical
[1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:25.000]  attention the problem is the strengths will probably say that's beautiful and
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.160]  then if that's what you agree with you can go to the cliff and just I love you
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:32.760]  Al Gore oh well he's in a big mansion you know just hundreds of thousands of
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:37.280]  square feet total with his 14 homes just swelling liquor and raping women and
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:41.360]  dancing around with a giant carbon footprint laughing at you you can just
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:45.960]  scream the thing I worship you Al Gore until you hit the bottom of the cliff
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  how's that sound I'm sorry caller go ahead no I was just gonna say and just a
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:55.280]  harken back to the Max Kaiser thing last time you had him on it really sounded
[1:17:55.280 --> 1:18:00.200]  like he had thrown his hands up and was pretty much you know when he was saying
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:03.640]  um you know talking about people being idiots and stuff like that and you
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:08.080]  actually stood up and defended the people I think guys just got off the
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:11.640]  reservation now that they're for himself make some money on the carbon
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:19.480]  taxes or whatever well let's just get him on with his monthly visit and we'll

[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:07.440]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:11.600]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:15.640]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:19.520]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:27.960]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:32.280]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:36.000]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.200]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:43.200]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by
[1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:47.200]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:02.800]  you've got it
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:15.880]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[1:33:15.880 --> 1:33:22.960]  lines of the info war yeah we're not left or right ladies and gentlemen I just
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:27.600]  look at the facts and cover them as I see them in a historical context and do
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.320]  the research kind of like last week I wouldn't comment on the Des Moines
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:38.240]  register story with police saying that 50 blacks were running around beating up
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:43.040]  white people beating up whites calling it beat up whitey day but now we've
[1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:47.080]  confirmed that's going on so now I can comment on it I'm gonna give you my take
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:50.520]  on that if James Dillingpole leaves us here in about 27 minutes from now I
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:56.800]  will also get to Michael and Damon and Darrell and Chris and Lex that are
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:34:00.960]  holding I'll get to your calls as soon as James Dillingpole leaves us we're
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:04.640]  gonna be going to him in a moment dealing with this psychopath with the
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:09.840]  reported bomb and gun the SWAT team was able to take him out and I'm pleased by
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:13.560]  that before he could kill any of the parasites as he called him he sees
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:17.680]  babies particularly as a parasite like Peter Singer and others have called them
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:22.480]  he calls himself a eugenicist and a Malthusian but he should be pleased
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:26.360]  that another parasite is dead of course I'm actually sad he was a mentally ill
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:30.960]  person manipulated by Al Gore kind of like the family that tried to murder
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:33.760]  their baby by shooting at the chaff and then killed themselves in Argentina
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:37.680]  there's more and more of these people and of course we have the statistics
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:41.880]  they're six times more likely to steal because if humans are all scum you know
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:46.920]  why not just give up on society so and they're also statistically commit more
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:50.640]  crimes so we'll talk about so-called environmentalist these aren't
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:56.640]  environmentalist okay this is a control freak guild of mentally ill low IQ
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:00.840]  control freaks run by wicked Ken lay types but I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:05.760]  digressing we'll get James Dillingpole's take on that and this big IPCC report
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:09.240]  now coming out the UN and other groups having to admit okay we lied about
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:14.240]  everything so we're gonna be talking about the the Death Star blew up with
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:19.320]  Climategate but now the Imperial Fleet is in ashes I mean I mean we we may
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:23.200]  completely route them and so they're going crazy taking over places with
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:25.960]  firearms we're going to James Dillingpole in a minute though I wanted to first

[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:51.040]  the public's too dumb to accept carbon feudalism we need to start using you
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:54.880]  know a green tyranny for at least the next 30 years to get it in place the
[1:37:54.880 --> 1:37:59.520]  father of the Gaia movement and now we've got their acolytes their their
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:04.480]  cult members taking over buildings with weapons calling babies degenerate
[1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:11.400]  filthy parasites we've got parents firing bullets into babies chest
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:16.680]  murdering themselves all for Al Gore saying I'm doing it for you Al while
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:20.520]  he's running around reportedly with his proboscis swinging between his legs
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.160]  humping on women in hotel rooms worldwide and buying giant houses and
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:29.720]  eating giant T-bone carbon-filled steaks so you've got the floor these people
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.720]  are panicking they're starting to get violent yeah but Alex you know what I
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.040]  wish I could share your optimism about having destroyed the Death Star and
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:43.800]  being about to turn the Imperial fleet into toast I think this war is only just
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.280]  beginning and the reason it's only just beginning is because of the scale of the
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:52.200]  opposition we're up against we're up against the United Nations we're up
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:56.040]  against the Rockefeller Foundation we're up against Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:01.080]  we're up against George Soros we're up against the European Union we're up
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:05.800]  against the governments of the most of the Western world led by the
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:09.280]  Obama administration and you've got the Environmental Protection Agency and so
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:15.960]  on it is going to be a very tough struggle to to make our case that what
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.440]  these people are trying to do is create a new world order under the auspices of
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.200]  environmentalism but this is what's happening it's what's been happening for
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:32.880]  a very long time now I've just written a piece about the James Lee atrocity or
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:36.240]  attempted atrocity rather than God it wasn't I think you know thank God only
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:41.360]  the bad guy got shot in the end and what I've said I gave it the headline
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:49.240]  James Lee is Al Gore is Prince Charles is the unibomber whether it takes the
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:53.680]  form of violent terrorists like James Lee and the unibomber or whether it takes
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:57.480]  the form of people like Al Gore talking about you know the must be limits to
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:02.800]  growth it's all a manifestation of the same problem these people essentially
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.200]  hate the human species they think that population should be reduced they think
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:13.520]  that experts unelected experts over who we have no control should be put in
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:18.520]  charge of the world and be allowed to allocate what they call scarce resources
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:23.600]  this is a very scary problem it's not going to go away another problem which I
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:27.680]  think is not discussed often enough is the fact that the rubbish that our
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:32.860]  children are taught in schools your kids my kids are taught the same oh it's 24
[1:40:32.860 --> 1:40:36.960]  seven brainwashing in the New York Times they say it's good that the seven
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:42.120]  year old comes home and writes fictitious school-issued tickets to mommy
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:47.160]  about taking a hot bath and now Prince Charles is out saying make it illegal to
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:52.320]  take a hot bath and make people wear clothes that have detergents in them so
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:56.000]  that you're not allowed to wash your clothes I mean while he's flying around
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:09.800]  on jets and owns his own private train one called when will we learn that it
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:14.480]  was all about how we humans we destroy the environment and when will we learn
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:19.640]  to care more for the world this is eco propaganda it's not a sweet song which
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:23.480]  kid is the thing this is teaching children that humans are bad that
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:29.240]  economic growth is bad that we are evil notice this sort of stuff is going to
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:33.880]  create exactly the kind of mindset that we saw in James Lee I reckon that we
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:38.880]  are creating hundreds if not thousands of future James Lee's by teaching them
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:44.960]  this nonsense well James I've seen the graph since the eco education in the
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:49.280]  90s and the death education they say don't commit suicide it's quite easy
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:53.440]  you take your shoelaces tied around your neck and hanging on anything and the
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:56.440]  little girls go and commit suicide they teach them you're killing the earth
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:01.360]  you're bad and in many cases it comes out the little girls especially as they
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:05.280]  show them images of baby animals with their heads cut off they actually do
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:08.840]  this folks especially in Australia and a little 12 year olds go and kill
[1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:13.120]  themselves and we wonder why children committing suicide is off the charts
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:19.560]  they're telling them your scum your bad you know one child policies humans are
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:24.200]  parasites we must you know be eradicated and James when I was in college
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:28.080]  it didn't matter what class I was in that's all they would I mean it could be
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:32.040]  a math class and they would stop once a week and say you know there's too many
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:36.440]  people you know we've got to reduce them I mean this is their cult and I agree
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:40.880]  with you that they're well entrenched it's their entire agenda of the
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:44.360]  collectivists they're not going away they cold-bloodedly know it's about
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:49.560]  neo-servatism and feudalism not about the earth but the issue is when I say we
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:54.640]  blown up their death star the tide has turned people now know what this is and
[1:42:54.640 --> 1:43:00.240]  it is a long war but they they're they're looking and acting scared is my
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:04.480]  point I agree with that I agree with that totally the problem is that they are a
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:09.400]  very shifty cunning opposition and you notice how as the the whole global
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:15.400]  warming thing is dying now that you know the IPCC has been exposed as a bunch
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:20.880]  of charlatans lying distorting the data and so on what's happening now is that
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:23.760]  they're shifting their ground so that now they're talking about this thing
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:28.000]  called biodiversity you know hey forget all that stuff we're telling you about
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.400]  global warming you know forget we said that now we've got to have the UN
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:35.560]  stepping in and businesses being controlled and fishermen not being allowed
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:40.760]  to fish and so on because of biodiversity you know we in England we the other day
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:46.760]  we have this extraordinary story about about something like $250,000 being
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:54.880]  spent to build this bridge over a road so that dormice could climb over from one
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:44:01.000]  side of the road to the other $250,000 spent you know spent on on dormice
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.680]  to probably I'm gonna even gonna use this bridge this is the the new green movement
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:09.480]  in action and they are never going to they are never going to give up they
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:15.120]  will always gonna find new ways of imposing their their taxation their
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:19.600]  control on on us free people I mean ultimately as you know and I know I
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:23.680]  think this is a this this comes down to liberty it's a question of who should
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:29.960]  decide our lives should it be unelected bureaucrats or should it be us well
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:33.800]  that's what this is really about is social engineering and they are the
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:38.400]  saviors of the earth and you see the entire economy in Europe England the
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:44.240]  United States the entire Western world where you can only get scholarships to
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.640]  be one of these environmental engineers or assessors so they're changing the
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:55.960]  entire infrastructure where only when the new priesthood gives the nod can you
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:02.200]  build a shed or a house what type of architecture you can have Germany saying
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:10.520]  no single family dwellings because the family's bad by 2020 it is a total
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:17.120]  surveillance tyranny where the new environmental cult rules everything but
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.440]  then separately whenever this select global corporations that are globalist
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:31.240]  are involved they're given waivers for everything what agenda 21 was most of
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.200]  them would not know what you were talking about and yet agenda 21 of the
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:40.440]  United Nations is probably the single most dangerous piece of legislation in
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:45.680]  the world today because what it does is it gives the United Nations always
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:50.840]  bureaucrats over here we have no control it gives them the right to decide how we
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:56.080]  live our lives how we heat our homes how much tax we pay how much we pay for our
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.320]  energy energy bills and of course one of the horrors about agenda 21 is it has
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:06.320]  been able to filter down through even to sort of local town councils you know
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:11.320]  that they're all signing up to this deal where yes we too will commit our local
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:15.920]  population whether they like it or not to reducing their carbon emissions and
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:21.840]  and you know the way that the way that they say with the car they drive how
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:24.800]  much we tax their cars you know the parking and things well that's what
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:28.960]  Swartz and Eggers said at the end of the Copenhagen meeting as you know he
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:33.400]  said we're going to go back and get the governors and the cities and we're going
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:41.520]  to do it and Austin just two months ago passed a 2.6 billion dollar tax over
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.200]  the next three years on gas and electricity and so again it never has
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:49.720]  anything to do with even the environmental crisis it's you will give
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:54.560]  our local environmental mafia contractor a million dollars to build a thing for
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:01.280]  mice or for turtles or you will you know give $200,000 to them or you will now
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:05.240]  pay more to some multinational corporation that's why the big mega
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:09.760]  corporations have financed this and that's their Achilles heel if we attack
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:14.080]  these fraudsters through you're a bunch of idiot environmental cultists they'll
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:18.680]  they'll win but if we point out they're bankrolled by the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:24.480]  by the ultra rich to create a global monopoly then we can defeat them yes
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:30.720]  well I mean it's good that the market has helped to destroy their their their
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:36.520]  carbon fraud I mean it's fantastic that the price of CO2 on the Chicago carbon
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:43.880]  exchange fell from $7 a tonne to 10 cents a tonne and the Chicago climate
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:47.560]  exchange which of course was founded by Al Gore and Goldman Sachs among others
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:52.080]  has essentially collapsed that's the good news the bad news of course is that
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:56.840]  by the time it did collapse Al Gore had made his money and sold out to somebody
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:02.360]  else this is the problem you know Al Gore and his cronies are parasites they
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:08.320]  are leaching off the backs of ordinary people and pretending to be caring
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:12.160]  holier than thou you know but the people that we should look up to you're
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:16.480]  absolutely right I mean the slobbering sex poodle as I think he was called in
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:21.440]  those that are in the police reports by that poor woman he ate the massers that
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:25.640]  he tried to get it well now there's a bunch of women reportedly this is what
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:31.120]  he does oh really so he's the Tiger Woods of the environmental movement yeah
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:33.920]  but at least Tiger he was paying them and they were willing they were actually
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:39.120]  whores with Gore it appears like a lot of psychopaths he likes to get some
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:44.320]  older woman in there and then freak them out so here we go again James Lee equals
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:50.480]  Al Gore equal equal to you the bomber there is not a cigarette papers I think
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:56.640]  it's an interesting fact that so many of the people you parade their green
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:49:03.520]  virtuousness are in their private lives slightly despicable a cruddy people you
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:08.920]  know I mean this the famous experiment I don't really remember conducted by some
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:14.760]  conduct Canadian academics where they tested these students and some of them
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:18.320]  had bought green products and some of them haven't bought green products in a
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:25.080]  supermarket and the ones that had bought green products behaved were more likely
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:29.360]  to lie and cheat and steal than the ones who who haven't bought the green
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:33.440]  products because the green products gave them a sense of virtuousness they
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:37.480]  were six times more likely to steal and and if I remember it was all over the
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.840]  Canadian papers a few months ago that that these were actually greenies that
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:45.880]  did the study they thought it was going to show the opposite to morally make
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:50.120]  everyone look bad and say see greenies are more moral but the truth is they're
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:59.760]  a bunch of knuckle dragon control freaks the facts are on our side you know the
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:06.000]  world you know Malthus was proved wrong Paul Ehrlich was proved wrong you know
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:11.560]  the green revolution in the 1970s meant that Paul Ehrlich's predictions that
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:16.880]  mankind was doomed due to overpopulation it didn't come true he said by 2000 he
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.880]  said from an ice age so did John P. Holdren but but but but they don't care
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:26.960]  how many times they're wrong they just reinvent some new crisis which they're
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.800]  going to save us from if we just give them trillions in money yep that's
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:36.600]  absolutely it's sort of a sort of global elite who are trying to keep the
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:40.840]  money for themselves and trying even to decide you know population levels it's
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:45.280]  it's deeply sinister and it's amazing how few people are aware of the
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:48.560]  connections you know all these people are in it together well I mean you talk
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:53.680]  about Malthus he was just proven when he said in 1750 something that Britain
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:57.880]  would totally collapse within 50 years total opposite he said the earth can
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:02.760]  only sustain a few more million people stay with us attention to all US drivers
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:07.000]  who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.720]  about to expire or no warranty coverage at all due to our country's economic
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:17.200]  crisis and auto repair costs on the rise if your vehicle has less than 130,000
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:21.000]  miles as of today you could be one of the millions of drivers that now may
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.400]  qualify to have your vehicle covered under United repair plans and have 100
[1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:29.880]  percent of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you this low cost
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:33.600]  vehicle service contract has been established under United repair plans
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:37.840]  and is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:42.000]  of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession if you own a vehicle
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:47.160]  with less than 130,000 miles you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies
[1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:56.040]  and for a free five-minute quote number to call is 800 809 4491 800 809 4491
[1:51:56.040 --> 1:52:03.480]  again that's 800 809 4491 hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:07.040]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:10.800]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:14.480]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:17.760]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:52:17.760 --> 1:52:21.880]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:27.280]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:31.520]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:35.280]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:39.360]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them

[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:09.440]  ladies and gentlemen I always start hyperventilating I can almost hear James
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:12.360]  Dillingpole a very intelligent a researcher in his own right doing the
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:18.680]  same thing because it's so brazen you've got these slimy con artists who when you
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:22.360]  really read the Club of Rome documents and others they admit this is just a
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:25.720]  way to take over property and control people you find out the Rockefellers
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:31.400]  110 years ago that the founder John D called the public scum he wanted
[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:37.360]  quote great wide expanses he didn't like people and literally this robber
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:41.240]  Barron's vision joining with Royals in Europe and others that have this
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:45.920]  disdain for the public that supply them with all their wealth they want us out
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.560]  of here and and yeah that's why the media in the US is like this poor man he
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:56.080]  had some good ideas just went the wrong way about it it's desperate the and
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:59.640]  James Dillingpole hit the key here he talked about how they've got our
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:04.520]  children we've got to demand that they stop teaching these frauds to our
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:08.480]  children James how do we defeat these people because you say the Death Star
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:13.040]  has not been exploded the Imperial fleet is still marauding I agree the Empire
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.560]  still there but something how would you assess their damage because I believe
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:20.600]  go ahead sorry I mean I mean you say how do we stop them indoctrinating our
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:24.560]  children you know I mean there was a guy in England I don't with you read this
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:30.800]  you have to fight a court go to court to stop his children being shown an
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:34.560]  inconvenient truth and they found it was just full of baloney the court did yeah
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:38.880]  yeah exactly they found lots of things wrong with the film and but you know
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:44.280]  the government was trying to insist that every child in Britain as you know
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:50.080]  compulsorily have to watch the you know Al Gore's propaganda and lies movie it's
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:54.280]  the absolute extraordinary it's the problem is that the things we are we
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:59.000]  are saying now on this show go very much against people's instincts of what is
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.960]  true if you ask most people is population a problem in the world they
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:06.640]  will say yes because instinctively it feels right that the more people there
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:10.840]  are you know the worst things get actually the history of the human
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:14.920]  species has been that the more people there are the better things get and you
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.160]  know we were talking about Thomas Malthus early on Thomas Malthus in 1798
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:23.800]  wrote this book where he said that the population was soon going to outgrow
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:28.040]  the the world's ability to supply it with food in the next century what
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:34.040]  happened the population in Britain increased by four times the economy
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:37.680]  grew 16 times bigger so the fact is that you know
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:43.400]  economic growth is good for us human ingenuity will always find a way to eat
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:47.680]  to feed the the increasing number of people on our planet you know the
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:51.400]  richer people are the less they have to breathe you know and the reason people
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  breathe in Africa is that they have no money they need they need children
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:00.000]  because they know some of them now you hit the key the West is dying 1.3
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.680]  replacement rate for every mommy and daddy they're having 1.3 children that's
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:09.800]  the global average from Japan to the United States the West is dying we need
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.680]  more children not less but instead they're convincing women to have no
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:19.600]  children for the earth it's insane exactly you've got the you've got the
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:24.280]  rich rich greenies like the Prince of Wales and the guy called Jonathan
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:28.520]  Porridge and so on forming these organizations like the optimum population
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:33.160]  trust and you know the optimum population trust believes that people should
[1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:37.920]  have no more than two children and preferably one you know the idea that in
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:44.560]  the West we need to stop breeding is madness you know our cultures are not
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:49.800]  replacing the population at a sufficient level to to guarantee a decent
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:54.520]  economic well they've done the analysis the West is probably already deader than
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:58.560]  Dornell yeah and which which makes the Rockefellers even more happy these
[1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:04.000]  people are out of their minds yeah I know I know I know as you say we have a
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  big big struggle ahead of us if we are to because what we are saying does not
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:12.800]  seem obvious to most people we have the facts on our side but people you know
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:17.400]  we're living it we're living in a world also where the education system where
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:20.240]  we've seen it in the way our children were indoctrinated by greenie teachers
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:25.120]  but the education system is not really interested in teaching kids hard facts
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:29.680]  anymore they prefer teaching them touchy feely stuff about caring about polar
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:33.080]  bears and stuff stay there James do five more minutes I want you to finish this
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:37.480]  key point because yeah the schools are nothing but giant reeducation camps
[1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:41.040]  giant indoctrination centers
[1:58:43.640 --> 1:58:51.560]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network listen up friends this is

[2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:25.560]  Alex Jones all right doing five more minutes with James Dillingpole that I
[2:00:25.560 --> 2:00:29.160]  promise I'm getting your phone calls and a bunch of other news you know there's
[2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:34.960]  been another oil well explosion but thank God they're only reporting one
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.840]  injury no deaths and it doesn't look like it's leaking so continue to watch
[2:00:38.840 --> 2:00:43.520]  that situation but let's go back to James Dillingpole you were finishing up
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:47.920]  your point about schools now are all about touchy-feely worship the government
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:53.640]  worship socialism yeah be guilty of your a westerner which and then at Copenhagen
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:57.080]  the third world showed up thinking they were get some freebies from the west and
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:01.080]  they said no we're gonna tax you to and all the money goes to the banks and so
[2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:04.560]  they pulled out but they're really teaching the children to hate themselves
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:09.920]  go ahead yeah I think the bigger point I'd like to make Alex is that the world
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:15.720]  the Western civilization right now is at a crossroads and if we go the way the
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:21.560]  greenies want to take us we are going to go over a precipice and I think you know
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:25.360]  it's up to America really to leave the way on this one I mean I personally
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:29.600]  believe that Obama is toast to the next election but I you know the president
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:35.080]  election but I also believe that there is a danger that unless you know we can
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:39.680]  find a replacement for Obama we don't just want another kind of you know
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:45.120]  Republic of me to Republican we need somebody who genuinely understands that
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:49.880]  the government has taken far too great a control of our lives and that there are
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:53.400]  these these organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation like George
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:58.160]  Soros who are essentially controlling the lives of ordinary people we've got to
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.440]  claw back our liberties we've got to stop schools teaching this this this
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.640]  government propaganda and let schools teach children you know facts again we
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:13.680]  know stuff that's actually grounded in reality not eco propaganda and only then
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:18.040]  I think can we can we give ourselves a decent future otherwise we are in
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:24.160]  serious trouble you're right and and now I see stuff in England where they're
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.200]  saying of your parents were ever involved in crime or poor children are
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:34.240]  being put in databases for their bad genes and there's also this whole
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:38.920]  eugenics arm of the green movement where they're talking about screening you
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:44.200]  deciding if you can have children according to your behavior not just your
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:48.640]  genetics and when you really scratch the surface these people are admitted
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:55.880]  eugenics was absolutely enormous in the in the first part of 20th century in
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:03:00.160]  the late 19th century and the only reason eugenics got a bad name for itself
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:02.760]  was because of the Nazis otherwise I think they'd have carried on doing it now
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:07.440]  but if you look at some of the writings of the of the of the greens and the
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:10.560]  fifties and the sixties what do you realize is that it never really went
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:17.440]  away these people hate humanity these people deify nature for them Gaia is
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:21.200]  the new religion I mean you know the environment environmentalism is the
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:25.000]  new world religion it's replaced Christianity it's replaced even even
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:30.280]  Islam as the dominant faith of the world and and you and I and most of your
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:35.840]  listeners I imagine are considered heretics and this is a struggle we're
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:39.680]  going to have to face you know we are you know they would like to burn the
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:44.160]  stake if they could and we need to be careful but all we can do is you know
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:49.200]  speak the truth speak truth to power which is what what your show does well
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:54.320]  James I appreciate you joining us no thanks for having me no no you bet

[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:24.640]  watermelons green on the outside red on the inside but you know I found it's
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:28.320]  more than a watermelon it's green on the outside red on the inside and it's
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:34.440]  monopoly capitalist Rockefeller in the core I mean the seeds of this are
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:39.360]  ultra-rich they want to collectivize our wealth and use government to suck it

[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:50.120]  pretty good good I can't credit you and waking me up I got to give that credit
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:55.960]  to G Edward Griffin and his his terrific book but I can't credit you with
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:02.120]  slapping my hand every day when I try to hit the snooze button well we can hit the
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:06.720]  snooze button all of us have to be engaged or we're gonna be slaves right
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:12.000]  right well I kind of have a bone to pick with you I wish you would spend more
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.080]  time I understand why you don't because you have to kind of pick your battles
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:22.760]  but when it comes to the income tax you know I'd like to see you have more
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:30.400]  guests on more experts that you know are familiar with this point and can
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:37.080]  speak to it and kind of inform people as to the illegal income tax and what we
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:43.240]  can do I mean if you know last week you asked you if you know to call in and
[2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:47.360]  say what was the the biggest problem that we saw and I see the biggest problem
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:52.920]  being the Fed well if we take away the Fed's ammunition a lot of these other
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:57.760]  symptoms that the tumor of the Fed creates takes care of themselves now
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:03.280]  we got to understand that they only tax us to add value to their fiat fellow
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:07.000]  reserve system and I want to get rid of the Federal Reserve we go directly at
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.080]  the head I'm supporting Ron Paul's move to audit the Golden Fort Knox to expose
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.640]  how criminal these private banks are and that we know they've stolen it the
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:20.920]  evidence is clear but I've probably done hundreds of radio broadcast I made a
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:25.480]  film comprehensive annual financial reports exposed Joe Bannister the IRS
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:29.960]  agent is in it we have Joe on a few times a year I interviewed Aaron Russo
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:33.720]  about the IRS it's it's in the documentary reflections and warnings
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:38.160]  with Aaron Russo and we open the phones up and you're able to call in about it
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:43.520]  but the problem is this is a very sophisticated issue and the globalist
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:47.880]  are allowing a lot of neocons to bash the income tax because they're gonna get
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:52.600]  rid of it they're gonna call it a social security tax and they're gonna say it's
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:58.080]  frozen at 10% and give you a VAT and probably sales tax on top of it that
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:02.760]  will be even more enforcement and local control over everything and so there's a
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:06.080]  big move to get rid of the income tax right now because they're gonna bring in
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:10.040]  a bunch of other stuff on top of it and they're just gonna change the name of it
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:15.560]  but people are like why aren't you for the reform of Wall Street Alex that
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:20.520]  Obama's supporting well it actually gave the top crooks on Wall Street more of a
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:24.680]  monopoly of power so a lot of times what something is named is not what it
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:29.400]  actually is I'm always for tax cuts I'm for tax incentives I'm for cutting the
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:34.360]  IRS I'm forgetting rid of the income tax we didn't have it till 1913 16th
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:39.000]  amendment it didn't become widespread to the early 1950s I mean I know all of
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:43.120]  that and most Americans were exempt and they take it out of people's checks so
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:48.160]  they don't really notice it and it kills business and it's all designed so the
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:52.720]  globalist can move things offshore but you know I don't think it's fair to say
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:57.200]  a bone to pick I mean because you must not listen very often if you don't hear
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:01.720]  us talk about the IRS but they're coming in with all these new fines and fees and
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:05.440]  I'm so busy trying to beat the carbon tax which is on everything basically a
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:10.800]  global VAT like that's what the World Bank called it last year I'm so busy
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:14.960]  trying to fight the local carbon taxes doubling my energy prices in the next
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:19.520]  three years where I live that I mean hell there's 50-something million people
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:24.680]  not filing now a lot of Americans are already rebelling the amount of taxes
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:27.840]  we pay doesn't go anywhere near the budget or the deficit or what they're
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:37.960]  spending so I mean I'll just say I'm bad I apologize I'm I guess I'm evil no
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:42.580]  I'm not saying at all I appreciate you do everything you do on a daily basis I
[2:12:42.580 --> 2:12:47.720]  just think it gives people a direct benefit to dissent and it's going to
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:52.640]  directly help our economy by having people having that money back and
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:57.080]  consumers yes we built the nation without the income tax if we want 10% growth
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:02.120]  rates again we should get rid of it yes yes yes I agree with you and we talk
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:04.200]  about it all the time that's why I'm saying I don't know what show you're
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:09.640]  listening to my only issue is there's all this patriot mythology about how you
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.360]  get out of paying them legally by doing all this stuff and I'm telling you
[2:13:13.360 --> 2:13:17.680]  they're criminals yes it's an illegitimate tax yes it wasn't ratified
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:25.000]  yes I've had you know the the fathers of exposing this on Benson and Beckman and
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.880]  we've gone over it and we've covered it over and over and over and over again
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:34.800]  the problem is there's all these patriot quacks that lie to people and say
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:38.920]  there's a way for you to not pay and have them not come after you and I'm
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:42.880]  telling you that's not true I appreciate your call Darren let's talk to Chris in
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:47.680]  Florida Chris you're on the air yeah I'm not sure if you've addressed this I
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:54.560]  don't listen your show pretty much and the Arizona SB 1070 bill that seems to
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:14:00.400]  be a mood issue now but I think it's an overreaction to the stage prices of the
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:04.800]  illegal alien oh yeah the feds have now filed another lawsuit and they've sick
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:10.040]  the United Nations officially on Arizona another act of treason to go ahead
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:14.680]  yes that is another aspect that that could be brought up but I wanted to
[2:14:14.680 --> 2:14:18.680]  clarify because I'm not you know I just showed that how old Obama wants to give
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:22.880]  more of the authority to the UN and Ziggy B just said that a UN isn't really
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:27.000]  that strong of a vehicle just a few months ago speaking of the CFR saying
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.960]  that the port towards world government the UN isn't as strong as other
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:34.760]  vehicles but of course it's still one of the cards they have to play but what I
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:41.000]  called about the SB 1070 concerns that are were raised by an article by a
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  campaign for liberty coordinator in Arizona Jeff Greenspan article from
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:51.920]  last March entitled oppose the revised SB 1070 on national ID concerns and I
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:56.240]  like I said I think it's an overreaction to the stage crisis and the solution
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:02.360]  that is spelled out in the bill is that they want to bio metric international
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:07.000]  ID of course the biometrics would only work at keeping track of the citizens
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:12.720]  only you know it also include the verify for instance employment eligibility
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:19.640]  verification so it includes federal executives deciding which person gets
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:23.520]  a birth certificate whether they're illegal or not it's it's determined
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:29.160]  whether the parents have a national ID themselves I press press I appreciate
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:34.120]  your call let's just talk turkey here I appreciate the call we had a national
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:40.640]  ID card under executive order in 1993 okay you've had one 17 years my first
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:45.600]  film America destroyed by design I cover it the state drivers license were
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:49.680]  standardized at that time they've now told the slaves in the last ten years
[2:15:49.680 --> 2:15:57.080]  about federal standardization with just further federalization and new systems
[2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:01.560]  on the cards they already have a hemispheric North American travel ID
[2:16:01.560 --> 2:16:07.120]  that the illegals are given every bank every insurance company every apartment
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:11.160]  company they all accept consul matriculas that you can literally get out of a
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:16.880]  crackerjack box it's all a lie that Arizona was gonna pull over anybody with
[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:22.160]  a dark hair or a suntan it said if you were pulled over after first contact for
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:25.920]  drunk driving violence whatever that they would ask your ID and if you were an
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:31.040]  illegal alien they take it to jail but don't worry Mexico's got thousands of
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:34.720]  deaths a month masses of women and children having their heads cut off if
[2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:39.000]  they're being raped macho la raza all hanging out with the old half-faves the
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.840]  big rich Hispanic groups laundering the money in Texas Arizona to Mexico
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:48.520]  California they love the mafia the New World Order the Mexican mafia loves the
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:54.040]  banks knows criminal culture it's a match made in heaven America's going
[2:16:54.040 --> 2:16:59.560]  down the states are all going bankrupt everything's over and you're all gonna
[2:16:59.560 --> 2:17:03.520]  have ID cards to buy and sell and the illegals are still gonna be up above
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:08.320]  the law running around like God because just like the CIA ships the drugs in and
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:12.400]  only arrest cartel people are killed them that don't pay the cut the illegals
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:17.800]  are there to be part of the black market which the CIA banks tax so they
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.320]  belong to them and they're there to vote to take your guns they're there to vote
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:27.360]  for Raza and more division and they're there to do what all the New World Order
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:31.320]  needs and so the standard of living will fall and we're gonna be just like
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:38.040]  Mexico City within 10 to 15 years and all the trendy campaign for Liberty
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:42.320]  people that are you know kind of liberal or whatever you want to call it
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:47.200]  they're gonna get what they want to of course Ron Paul has been supportive of
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:54.400]  the Arizona bill because he actually read it but hey what's reality you know
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:59.360]  you know don't let reality get in the middle of things yeah again if you're
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:03.840]  Margaret Sanger and running Planned Parenthood aborting 51% of babies the
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:07.120]  liberals and black leaders call you a wonderful person helping black people
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:10.760]  you're cuz you cuz you hate black people and want to kill them and call them
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:19.040]  scum and filth and weeds and parasites that's their favorite word but if you
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:22.840]  actually want blacks to get off the welfare and get out of the government
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:26.240]  control you want to point out how they're being controlled and being
[2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:31.560]  destroyed so societally along with everybody else but that's the beta test
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:39.280]  group then you're a racist and if I see Fox News Corp funding machete which is
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:42.560]  a race war film I don't know if he's changed it but I've got the script if
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:48.000]  he puts out tomorrow what's in that script it's a race war film and the Fox
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  News owner is funding the emom running the mosque along with the Rockefeller
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:57.360]  Foundation on record and they're funded machete and they're funding it all and
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:19:01.680]  Jessica Albook and go on TV shows and make jokes about white people and be as
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:05.920]  racist as she wants and it's cute and funny and she's told you do that you do
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:10.600]  that you run white people into the ground but that's only the cover so the
[2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:15.160]  Hispanics and the blacks everybody else can be orderly given their shots given
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:19.480]  their abortions it all part of the liberal fun bandwagon and so all the
[2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:23.160]  Mexican mafia can take the women and rape them and chop their heads off and
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:27.760]  have sex slaves and use them and keep the Mexican people down it's like oh
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:35.120]  yeah be with the L hefe you know look this movie according to the script is
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:43.520]  basically like the film in glorious bastards but in glorious bastards the
[2:19:43.520 --> 2:19:50.200]  the Germans are all evil Nazis who deserve to die now in this case white
[2:19:50.200 --> 2:19:54.680]  people are the Nazis and deserve to die and it's even produced by Quentin

[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:20.240]  you've got 500 to 600 million people or even more in Latin America wanting to
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:26.360]  get in here most of Latin America is in abject poverty with warlords
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:32.880]  rootling them in crushing poverty you've got narcotics pouring into the
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:37.880]  United States the government openly is trafficking them only going after car
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:42.640]  tells that don't want to their money to the big central banks Mexico is the most
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:50.160]  dangerous collapsed nation on earth it is now worse than North Korea you're
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:56.080]  not gonna hear a word out of Metsha or La Raza or any of those groups because
[2:24:56.080 --> 2:25:00.560]  they're all hooked up I mean how our former mayor Gus Garcia said he might
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:05.000]  retire in Mexico it doesn't really seem self as an American and then I've got
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:09.480]  video of him in a city council meeting saying Hispanics are the master race the
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:15.240]  God race descended from aliens by the way you think I'm joking he had an Aztec
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:20.120]  group up to agree with them and then they have the other city council guy all
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:23.480]  white guy I forget his name this was about three or four councils ago this
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:27.520]  like ten years ago he was a big environmental land grabber knowing yes
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:32.840]  my wife is Hispanic my child is of God and they're going yes we are the
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:36.680]  supreme race I mean every group runs around saying they're the supreme race
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:44.440]  the difference here is you've got the corporate media Fox television Fox movie
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:49.080]  productions putting this out and I'm sit I'm supposed to sit here with a trailer
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:53.200]  saying we didn't cross the border the border crossed us then hacking gringos
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:59.880]  up and I get the script and it's it's literally gringos of the devil and must
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:06.720]  die and then the media won't report on this or acts like I'm the bad guy
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:12.200]  meanwhile the liberal eugenics groups are talking about how they want to
[2:26:12.200 --> 2:26:16.080]  domesticate Hispanics from Latin America so they can abort their children
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:20.760]  and how they want to kill the subhuman blacks and I'm like I don't want to kill
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:24.080]  Hispanics I don't want to kill black people I want them to live I want them
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:27.360]  to do well I want to be friends with everybody I believe in everybody doing
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:34.200]  good and the liberal Hispanics are like it is Oslon and there's no such thing as
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:42.440]  a eugenics program we like Margaret singer and I'm just like when does it
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:47.760]  end and these liberal black groups I said I take your calls and I got a bunch of
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:53.920]  news I want to get to and it's just so frustrating I mean I've got the script
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:27:02.400]  from a shedding you can go watch birth of a nation what 1915 1916 I forget the
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:14.640]  year and in it the Ku Klux Klan are the good guys because the black people are
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:21.360]  running around engaging in rapes and mass murder against whites and so the
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:26.920]  clan hunts them all down and kills them now you read the script from a shetty or
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:32.920]  watch the trailer white people are killing Hispanics and crucifying Catholic
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:40.920]  priests and murdering little Hispanic children and Moschetti and his army of
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:46.480]  Latinos killed them it is the exact same thing as birth of a nation
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:51.320]  meanwhile this birth of a nation by minorities the exact same stuff the
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:56.040]  white the Ku Klux Klan put out very famous movie the clan went from a few
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:00.720]  thousand members to millions after that movie came out I mean you know they're
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:03.840]  saying Alex you shouldn't be concerned about race war you shouldn't be
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:14.360]  concerned about violence from this well we just had beat up cracker night beat
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:20.200]  up whitey night up in Iowa and that's now been confirmed to cover that we come
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:28.240]  back and go to your calls so we've got that going on because those black kids
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:33.640]  40 to 50 think whites are inherently evil because Chris Matthews tells them so
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:40.240]  every night and Chris Matthews only does that to create racial identity so that
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:44.720]  blacks will fight with whites and vice versa so Chris Matthews and the Rockefeller
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:49.120]  Foundation this is on record can sit up there and steer and control you that's
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:55.840]  why it's race every night on those shows to the point of black kids go to the fair
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:29:03.040]  and say we're gonna beat up white people and feel good about it because when
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:06.560]  you're beating up a white person or killing a white person they're a devil
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:10.960]  and they deserve it well what do you think the Klan thinks when it drags
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:14.480]  some black man to death down the highway they think they're getting rid of
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:18.640]  somebody who's evil that they're self-righteous you think the Klan is
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:24.600]  like we're good and you know we're gonna go out and be friends with the black
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:31.400]  people no they say we're good because we think black people are evil and we're
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:36.000]  gonna go out and get them and what do you think met General Raza I mean
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:40.160]  whenever Jessica Alba gets up on these TV shows and talks trash about white
[2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:44.880]  people even though she's Spanish on the Mexican side and which is European and
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:51.800]  and her dad's wider it's all insane they're idiots they're idiots we're on

[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:38.600]  if a group is a majority or tends to be wealthy and powerful they will paint
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:45.360]  them as the bad guys as a pretext to get them to be guilty to give in to the
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:50.680]  corruption it's like you're killing the earth pay all gore trillions and carbon

[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:38.600]  federalization but then their raiding sheriff Arpaio saying that if they pulled
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:43.520]  somebody over for drunk driving and they were illegal he was taken drunk driving
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:48.960]  illegals to jail and it's like the news is like in a hardcore police state move
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:54.200]  Arpaio and they're like look at that Arpaio one time he was in a rally with
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:58.240]  10,000 people and there was one guy in the background who might be a white
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:04.200]  supremacist it's total proof and and yeah and Alex Jones is too and so is Ron
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:11.320]  Paul and I'm like oh they're aborting half the black people I'm against that
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:15.720]  shut up racist you're against killing black people you're a racist you're a
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:20.160]  racist no no see I'm sick of being called a racist I was brought up bleeding
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:27.160]  heart guilty liberal I'm better white people are evil you know that was the
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:31.360]  culture in the media and and my parents weren't totally like that but they were
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:36.280]  like you know totally anti-racist and along with that comes all of the tour
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:42.240]  you know I'm just like oh you know it's I'm so evil now I've done nothing to
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:46.640]  anybody and a bunch of criminal banks are bringing this country down and they

[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:18.800]  not happening I'm done and now I am really doing research and discovering
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:23.840]  that it's all of the rich white people black people Hispanic it doesn't matter
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:29.000]  but predominantly Hispanics on the Southwest who are running the coyotes
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:34.640]  running the drugs working with the CIA running all this corruption and they are
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:39.800]  helping take the Hispanic children into dungeons and blow their heads off after
[2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:43.040]  they're raped if they didn't pay two thousand or four thousand dollars to the
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:47.720]  coyotes from Latin America I mean Mexico just slaughters immigrants and
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:53.680]  that's loving Laraza and Metro are like yeah you know they never say a word
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:59.160]  about all that and that's what Robert Rodriguez is doing he's exporting
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:04.040]  mexophobia against the Republic against the United States teamed up with the
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:07.800]  globalist to all of Latin America and that's why Hispanic folks all over
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:11.400]  Central and South America and Puerto Rico are sending me photos of the local
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.440]  movie theater posters saying get with machete with a bloody machete it's
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:20.520]  being sold to try to take Mexican phobia of the United States I'm not talking
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  about Mexicans themselves but you know mexophobia that goes on Mexico of the
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:31.880]  United States to all of Latin America and Rodriguez thinks I'm just gonna sit
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:36.600]  here and be a good little gringo and lick his boots and say I'm sorry I'm a
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:41.280]  racist white puto well will you please kick me in the teeth and I'm just gonna
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:46.200]  roll over and grovel to you it ain't happening I'm done and I'm gonna say it
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:50.880]  I've read the script and Rodriguez reportedly wrote it he's a racist okay
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:54.560]  he's a racist he wants to make a movie about white racist that are murdering
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:58.440]  Hispanics when there's no such thing going on in reality with the Minutemen I
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:03.800]  mean that is something the Ku Klux Klan would write for white people I'm done
[2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:09.920]  you're just like David Duke Rodriguez and so is Alba and all of it and I'm
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.880]  not gonna mince words anymore I'm done I'm done now I'm going off into a rant
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:20.200]  because this entire country is going into hell in a handbasket and the big
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:24.800]  foundations and Fox News and the Fox News owner are funding the imam with the
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:29.040]  mosque they're funding machete they want us all of each other's throats here is
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:33.440]  the clip of the newscast with the beat whitey night and it's been confirmed that
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:37.360]  it's so politically correct I guess those white teenagers they should go to
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:41.040]  jail because they're racist they should have taken clubs and beating
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:46.880]  themselves in the head and said thank you black man I am a white devil and and
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:51.240]  I'm bad I should go to prison because I'm white again that's the message you're
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:56.520]  white you're a Nazi and this is going to be used to pass the carbon taxes the
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:39:01.200]  health care already has been unless white people stop being guilty okay I'm
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:06.000]  done and I'm telling you Mexico's collapse the Southwest is collapsing if
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:09.480]  we move the free market to the North Pole you'd have the illegal aliens trying
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:14.400]  to bust down the door to the North Pole let's go ahead and go to this clip here
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:19.440]  it is well Rachel two officers were injured in five people were arrested
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.520]  last night marking the third time since each side or night that a large group of
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:27.960]  young black people were involved in assaults in or around the white vaults
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:32.800]  we have reports that these juveniles were attempting to assault white
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:36.400]  citizens well the whites deserve it you know that's all under investigation at
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:41.960]  this time whether this has racial overtones or not we are looking into
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:47.440]  the police imagine it 4550 white people were running around beat black people
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:51.840]  night beating black people up I mean it would be the end of the world but when
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:57.840]  it's admitted with blacks doing it it's like we're still looking into it because
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:04.640]  see she's a racist white cop if she says it's wrong see this is all just about
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:09.960]  guilt it has nothing to do with Hispanics and blacks it's about getting
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:13.680]  us all to fight with each other I think I've said that enough let's go back to
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:17.480]  the clip according to one of the police reports from Sunday's assaults there was
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:22.040]  a large fight along East 30th Street with quote black male and female juveniles
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:26.080]  assaulting white citizens as Des Moines police stepped in to try and break up
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:32.040]  the 40-person crowd officers were met what is the Ford Foundation fund they
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:35.560]  funded all the black liberation groups who teach them those weren't white
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:40.360]  people they were attacking those were white devils those were vampires out
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:45.960]  at night they had to do this I can't believe how racist the state fair whites
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:50.200]  are I can't believe the media is so racist to criticize these wonderful
[2:40:50.200 --> 2:40:55.400]  black youth attacking vampires let's go back to it with heavy resistance we
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:59.360]  continue to try to move them along and disperse and they were fighting
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:03.360]  vampires lady but at that point two officers were hitting the head from
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.400]  behind while trying to make arrests forcing one of them to use a stun gun
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:12.080]  to get control of the situation chemical sprays were also used on the crowd to get
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:16.520]  things under control there were several groups juveniles together what I was
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:20.600]  told from some officers that it was like a swarm of bees this was the third time
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:24.840]  large groups of young black people were seen assaulting people in and around the
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:29.720]  fair the first being at the end of the fair's east side there's many a lot second was on Friday
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:33.720]  police say that on Friday a white man was severely assaulted by a group of
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:37.680]  black males and female deserves actually fracturing his skull and attacked the
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:41.480]  place devil may have been race-related in the police report it states that a
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:46.160]  group of black males and females were out at the fair yelling out that it's the
[2:41:46.160 --> 2:41:49.880]  whitey night and with yet another incident happening on Sunday under
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:53.960]  similar circumstances on the last day of the fair it's hard for police not to
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:57.400]  think that all of these incidents are related these assaults which occurred
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:04.400]  from last Friday night to last night we do believe they are related somehow oh
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:14.560]  look she felt so guilty she's a good whitey she hates herself how dare those
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:19.160]  white people not liking having their heads split open racist racist racist
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:26.120]  I mean this is incredible how racist those whites are they should be jailed
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:30.160]  because when those clubs cracked their skull that was an assault on the black
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:34.480]  man now let's show a good man who understands the white devil let's
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:38.920]  show another government funded stooge I'm sorry genius who understands that
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:44.120]  even white babies have to be killed these are white vampires do you let vampire
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:52.760]  babies live here it is all of them every last iota of a cracker I hated we
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:57.000]  didn't come out here to play today it's too much serious business going on in the
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:01.040]  black community to be out here and slide through South Street with white dirty
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:06.400]  cracker whore on our arm and we call ourselves black men with African garbom
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:10.760]  what the hell is wrong with you black man you had a dune day with a white girl
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:17.280]  on your damn arm you are freedom you have to kill some crackers you have to
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:24.120]  kill some of their babies well there you have it but again because I played this
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:28.480]  I'm a devil but listen the way you fix it is you give all your money to Rockefeller
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:34.040]  and all the carbon taxes and you open the borders up and you come in Mexico for
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:38.000]  slaughtering all the Latin Americans that come in because that's not racist or
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:42.200]  evil or or bad to humans because it's Hispanics killing Hispanics of course I'm
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:46.280]  being sarcastic for the media says that I'm actually condoning it no no it's a
[2:43:46.280 --> 2:43:51.320]  nightmare and the world is full of despotism and savagery and the Republic
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:57.440]  is now falling ladies and gentlemen that's what's happening and tribalism
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:02.480]  whether it's white racism black racism Hispanic racism it's tribalism it's all
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:07.600]  on the rise and the globalists have stirred all of this up so that we will be
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:13.360]  at each other's throats it's senseless can you imagine if a white person a
[2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:18.400]  white director made a movie where Hispanics go out and commit crimes of
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:25.440]  murder against whites and then whites get together and kill Hispanics that's a
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:32.400]  race war movie but see people are so guilty of their white and then so filled
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:37.200]  with the fact that whites are the devil that Robert Rodriguez even though the
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:40.440]  gringos are the biggest fans of his movies he can make a movie how the
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:45.080]  devil and it's good it's like oh thank you mr. Rodriguez and the black folks
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:48.120]  can go out and start beating up whitey and it's it's all cute and funny and the
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:51.160]  media won't even call it a racial attack because hey they're whites they deserve
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:57.040]  it now don't you see what's happening they're getting whites angry and tribal
[2:44:57.040 --> 2:45:03.040]  and they're gonna use whites to command and run the police state that is gonna
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:09.280]  crack down on whites blacks Hispanics and Asians this is the globalist are
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:14.880]  geniuses folks and I hope you understand that and we better see this for what it
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:19.440]  is and remember that you haven't heard a word on a Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:23.800]  about machete they did it first until it came out that Fox owned it and then
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.320]  they took the story off their website they don't want you to know that Fox is
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:33.120]  funding through their owner the emom and the mosque that they're funding Metcha
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:37.120]  and Laraza no Fox gives money they don't want you to know that they're
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:43.520]  funding the movie because then see they can pose and and and keep whitey safe
[2:45:43.520 --> 2:45:48.680]  with whitey Fox news this is divide and conquer ladies and gentlemen and this
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:51.960]  is you're not gonna get this on Republican shows you're not gonna get this
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:56.280]  on Democratic shows you're gonna get this here the truth channel the truth
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:46:01.720]  channel okay I'm gonna go to Lex Tyler Jason Paul and David an earlier
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:06.760]  caller got me off on a rampage there but I briefly wanted to go to Ted Anderson
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:12.800]  because gold is way up again today and I wanted to encourage listeners to not
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:18.960]  procrastinate I wanted to encourage listeners to not sit on the fence it's
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:24.320]  very simple equation the last month when gold was down by now 80 something
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:28.360]  dollars Ted bought a bunch of gold and silver now it's run up 80 something
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:33.720]  bucks Bloomberg says it's set to go to 1500 by Christmas I don't know if that's
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:38.080]  true all I know is it's a lot better investment and has intrinsic value than
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:43.280]  dollars and stocks and bonds and derivatives that Goldman Sachs defecates
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:48.000]  out on our country and I'm sorry for that term but that's what they're doing and
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.400]  all their carbon taxes and Ted's got a great deal for you and the paltry even
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.480]  when the market was down there's like a 2% markup or something on these there's
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:00.800]  tiny margins and gold and silver so you can't get a better deal on this kind of
[2:47:00.800 --> 2:47:06.640]  like how you can get five of my films for 995 you know much money I'm losing
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:11.680]  on that shrink wrapped hardcover original DVDs Aaron Russo weed won the
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:18.160]  West road to tyranny fabled enemies 995 info wars.com yeah we sit here and try
[2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:20.840]  to make money on this show to fund everything we're doing we're not funded
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:24.440]  by Fox News or the Ford Foundation or Rockefeller we're funded by you
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:29.640]  supporting our sponsors and I love you and I want to thank you but regardless
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:34.320]  this is also a win-win-win-win-win these are great deals and Ted I haven't asked
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:38.160]  you can you still hold that deal or did it already end at the gold go up no
[2:47:38.160 --> 2:47:42.360]  yeah the gold went up but I didn't I'm not increasing the prices quite yet gold
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:48.320]  is up again today we've seen a high today so far at 1250 450 currently gold is
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:58.240]  up $7 and 20 cents current spot is 1250 260 Alex that Frank coin at $270 when
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:03.400]  you take off the $159 year subscription for the International Forecaster that
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:10.840]  leaves $111 for Frank if you multiply that by five that's $555 for an ounce
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:15.320]  of gold you know I there isn't a single dealer out there in the United States
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:19.520]  anywhere bar none I don't care where you go across the entire globe even that's
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:25.200]  offering gold for $555 an ounce like Midas is right now and I got to tell
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:29.320]  people they've need to move into the gold market you're sitting there in the
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:35.240]  stocks bonds you know you name it you annuities bank certificates I mean
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:39.320]  there just really isn't a better safe haven than gold and now is the time to
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:42.600]  be moving and we also have the British sovereigns and they're currently at
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:48.480]  $340 we have the walking liberties at 975 another great buy just the whole
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:51.920]  thing I mean we're waiting for the unemployment figures to come out they're
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:55.480]  broad they're forecasting that the unemployment's going up again which
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:59.120]  means more fiat money when the government tries to bail out the next
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.960]  problem I mean the the bank closure list the bank the bank problem
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:09.840]  bank list jumped to 829 now that's never been seen before you know when the when
[2:49:09.840 --> 2:49:15.040]  the FDIC has to turn to the US Treasury for more money because they're 15.2
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:19.360]  billion dollars behind in order to cover all that that that bad debt that's
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:23.200]  going to be coming to them on these bank closures they're going to go to the
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:26.560]  Federal Reserve system and the printing press is going to be turned on full
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:32.280]  speed and that's when you're going to see a disaster in your your your stock
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:37.040]  portfolios your bet money at the bank is going to you know fade away you'll still
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:39.920]  have the same amount of money you just won't be able to buy as much with it
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:44.480]  that's why it's so important to own gold and silver both you know you just
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:49.480]  simply cannot replace the fact that gold and silver has been money for over 6,000
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:55.280]  years and the US dollar was associated to money up through 1971 and since its
[2:49:55.280 --> 2:49:59.840]  disassociation gold has gone up through the the moon and the dollar has done
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:03.640]  nothing but fall fall fall and what do you think is going to happen when we have
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:07.840]  more financial problems Barack Obama is going to stand up he's going to start
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:12.040]  talking start talking about the next bailout plan that he has or you know
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:17.840]  Congress doing the same I mean that Washington has no clue and unfortunately
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:23.160]  it's us we the people the United States are there that are getting you know we're
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:26.400]  the ones that are losing in this whole process and that's why I think it's so
[2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:31.040]  important that people get involved right now that CBO document I feel like I'm
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:35.040]  shouting from the hills but nobody's listening the congressional budgeting
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:38.680]  office said we're having problems are coming up you can call for that
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:42.880]  document eight hundred six eight six two three seven eight hundred six eight

[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:41.280]  that I cut to show that we are getting some deception out of the Hispanic
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:46.600]  Ku Klux Klan filmmakers camp I mean why not just come right out and say it I
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:50.240]  mean I'm supposed to sit here and grovel and go was it a racial attack at the
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:56.040]  fair what is it a race war movie that makes green goes look bad he just thinks
[2:54:56.040 --> 2:55:00.400]  it's okay for him to act like this and I'm supposed to sit here and and grovel
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:07.120]  to him I'm not doing it I'm done okay now I'm ranting on this subject and
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:10.800]  there's so much other news and we're almost out of time a couple days next
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:14.280]  week Paul Watson's gonna be sitting in I'll just give you a heads up now I'm
[2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:17.640]  gonna be on the road with Jesse Ventura working with him I'm just gonna leave it
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:29.920]  that on the road again you know I said I'd take your phone calls and maybe I am
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:38.320]  just inherently evil because I'm white maybe I am bad I don't know why
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:43.520]  everybody wants to come to this country then but I don't know how can it how
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:54.040]  can the Hispanic racist put down white people when they are European I guess
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:59.640]  they're evil too I guess we all are tribal and evil in a way I think at the
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:03.360]  end of the day that's really the issue and I guess I was brought up to be a
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:11.440]  bleeding heart I'm an evil whitey and so I guess you choose maybe I should fly
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:14.800]  to Iowa and go to the state fair and ask the black folks to beat me to death and
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:19.040]  then maybe I'd be good like if I like as they were beating me with clubs I'd say
[2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:24.520]  yes kill me kill me I'm an evil whitey I deserve it I'm bad maybe maybe maybe I am
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:30.760]  wrong maybe it's true maybe maybe I am evil maybe Robert Rodriguez is right
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:34.160]  maybe maybe it's good that he makes a movie about gringos being hacked up a
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:39.200]  machetes maybe that black guy we played saying kill white babies maybe white
[2:56:39.200 --> 2:56:45.800]  babies are evil maybe all babies are evil like this nutcase said no I'm gonna
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:56.760]  stop being sarcastic you know what we go into overdrive couldn't we hmm oh man

[3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:29.880]  transmission and I'm gonna get to get to the news a lot about it and cover today
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:35.040]  I'm kind of out of control lately I'm gonna be honest with people I've never
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:41.000]  had a problem with illegal drugs but I've had a problem with one thing well
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:49.080]  to caffeine and nicotine that those are two things and I still drink one cup of
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:52.080]  coffee every day but lately I've been going back to two because I'll get really
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:56.360]  tired I got up at like 5 30 a.m. and I'm actually starting to feel the caffeine
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:00:59.840]  is gone can I have a cup of coffee guys I'm down I just make sure something brutal
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:03.680]  I'll just get it during the break thanks they drink coffee around here like it's
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:07.720]  water I mean it just disappears so quickly that's why I always got to say
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:10.920]  is there a pot brewing in there that's why I can run out there during the break
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:15.640]  in a moment and get some speaking of the devil but when I quit smoking cigarettes
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:21.940]  and I'll go two years off cigarettes six months off cigarettes and then the
[3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:26.760]  devils out there always try to create a non-controversy you know non-issue much
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:30.360]  to do about nothing thing where they'll say here's video of Jones saying
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:35.080]  cigarettes are bad and kids don't smoke and then it can give you lung cancer as
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:40.680]  I've said before and then here's a video of him smoking a cigarette well yeah
[3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:46.080]  that's taken out of context I admit my weaknesses I'll go six months a month two
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:52.080]  months one time I went four years but I was smoking cigarettes since I was 12 12
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:56.360]  years old I started getting them off my neighbor's older brother and let me tell
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:02:01.080]  you I like chewing tobacco I like cigars I like snuff I like snorting
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:08.160]  snuff I like cigarettes they're in the tobacco product that I don't like very
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:16.800]  addictive but when I quit smoking for about a week I have got crazy energy and
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:21.760]  am like super obnoxious and and people that have worked here a few years they've
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:26.000]  experienced it four or five times I've quit in the last two years I've got to
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:31.800]  do it forever this time I mean the first two days it's not even hard for me to
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:38.400]  quit smoking I will do it on a weekend I'll tend to take off the Sunday show
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:41.160]  when I'm doing it because I want cigarettes and coffee it's work related
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:47.720]  and it's okay I don't even really want it but when I get around work and I got
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:50.200]  a few smokers that work here and I walk in in the morning they're smoking
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:56.920]  cigarettes and then I get on air I literally start I can taste it and I
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:02.120]  start getting tingles in my brain and I probably if I ever start smoking again
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:05.920]  and stop again I should probably just take off a week because I am a craved
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:11.880]  maniac I mean it I don't even want cigarettes right now it's just I'm
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:15.200]  literally going through withdrawals though but everybody knows I mean how
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:20.640]  hardcore cigarettes are never use cigarettes young people never never
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:29.560]  ever it is so addicting alcohol is not a problem you know I could drink a few
[3:03:29.560 --> 3:03:34.560]  beers here and there and then you know not drink them for a year but there I've
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:40.760]  babbled mindlessly for another three minutes let's go ahead and go to Lex I
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:47.680]  already talked to Lex let's talk to Tyler in California go ahead Alex glad
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:50.160]  you extended the broadcast because I really wanted to bring something up to
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:54.160]  me and see what you thought about it I've been listening to you for a long time
[3:03:54.160 --> 3:03:58.520]  you know and I I get this impression I get this weird dichotomy actually is the
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:03.120]  word of where in one breath you blame everything on the globalist and then
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.240]  turn around and praise the free market when it's the free market that leads
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:12.560]  free market capitalism leads to global monopoly I mean that is the basis of how
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:20.440]  they have how they've worked their empire and the wedding free market and government
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:26.600]  bailouts the government gives the power to the bankers to force their banking
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:31.400]  system and their model it is not a free market it is a rigged market it's a
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:36.640]  it's like a casino sir but imagine if you took off all I'm not the poor
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:39.920]  government involvement in the market but I'm seeing if you took off all the
[3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:43.400]  government restraints that are on there right now imagine what would stay there
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:46.400]  stay there I'm gonna come back to you on the other side this is a very important
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:51.360]  point Tyler we're gonna let you flesh out your point and I'm gonna get to
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:58.120]  Jason Paul David Frank and others will be right back and then I am going to get

[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:34.960]  you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk
[3:07:34.960 --> 3:07:39.400]  about gold IRAs they've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:43.160]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed
[3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:47.120]  paper investments yet no word about IRAs if you would like to have gold for
[3:07:47.120 --> 3:07:52.680]  your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation in
[3:07:52.680 --> 3:08:02.120]  low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:15.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[3:08:15.320 --> 3:08:24.880]  the GCN radio network. We are back live well into hour number four on this
[3:08:24.880 --> 3:08:30.520]  Thursday September 2nd 2010 edition okay Tyler is on hold I'm going back to him
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:34.120]  but let me just be clear about this you're gonna have corruption whether
[3:08:34.120 --> 3:08:39.040]  it's government run corporate run any way you slice it corruption is always a
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.920]  problem because some people will cut corners they will cheat even really good
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:50.160]  people over time tend to become corrupted especially if it's done through
[3:08:50.160 --> 3:08:55.600]  peer pressure or if someone isn't there to you know try to educate them on
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:09:02.400]  morals and so we don't have a free market up until about 1913 we did and
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:07.080]  the banks would run scams and money manipulation operations and junk bonds
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:13.000]  but people learned to not keep their money in banks or they learned what
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:17.320]  banks were trustworthy over time or they learned to have gold and silver and
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:22.820]  we had on average 10% growth rates from the founding of the country until
[3:09:22.820 --> 3:09:26.920]  1913 now you don't even really have any growth if you look at it overall the
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:34.440]  population and taxes are very high and so what you've got is big powerful
[3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:39.960]  mega banks that got government to authorize them to create derivatives
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:44.720]  but the SEC goes after little companies that try to run scams see just like the
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:49.960]  CIA and and other big operations go after cartels that don't launder their
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:54.760]  money through them that that's all the drug war is to keep prices up it's the
[3:09:54.760 --> 3:09:59.320]  same thing with this new financial reform act the big six banks they get
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:03.400]  regulatory power over everybody else and Bernanke's in the news today saying
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:07.800]  we'll shut down any banks that could cause a problem well what banks cause the
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:11.480]  problem all the big five will deserve shareholders but instead they're going
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:18.120]  after little guys and so Ron Paul has written on this and explained it and I
[3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:27.120]  agree with his analysis so you let banks and groups issue bonds that are
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:32.760]  speculative or dangerous and if it comes out it was a complete fraud you have the
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:38.800]  state grand juries indict their butts and put them in prison and that problem is
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:44.200]  going to end very very quickly and questionable investments well people
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:51.440]  will know those are just dangerous high risk high return and so this stuff's
[3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:59.360]  always going on but but but but no it's a marriage of big government with big
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:03.320]  corporations that has brought what we have so we always hear the free markets
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:11.280]  dead boy we saw that capitalism failed in 2008 can't have things like this
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:17.600]  happen anymore we better just get rid of capitalism well I mean what is
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:23.720]  capitalism it's big mega banks running things what we need is freedom and local
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:29.760]  control and a small government and then if people want to go invest in a big
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:34.760]  mega corporation that sheets them that's their problem buyer beware or if
[3:11:34.760 --> 3:11:39.080]  Pinkerton security men want to pull in on the Rockefeller train to steal your
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:43.520]  gold claim some property you've staked the chairs you got a local sheriff's it
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:48.200]  calls out the posse and line up in the street with the Pinkerton boys and ready
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:53.680]  to go draw but Pinkerton won't go to a town that's got a good sheriff
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:58.680]  they'll go to a town where the railroad owns the sheriff see the railroad the
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:04.640]  robber barons the bankers they need a corrupt government to give them legal
[3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:11.440]  cover you didn't see Pinkerton and others coming into towns to rape and kill
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:15.600]  women just like what's going on in Mexico right now but this was a hundred
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:19.400]  percent gringo operation you didn't see that type of stuff without a corrupt
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:23.960]  police force allowing it what goes on in Mexico what goes on in corrupt Eastern
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:31.640]  Europe same animal different region same political system though now Tyler does
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:35.920]  that answer your question well actually no I had a couple points I wanted to make
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:39.720]  to kind of count of that I think whether you believe that this is a rigged
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:44.640]  economy or free market either way in a true free market the natural progression
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:49.200]  is to global monopoly I mean just think about it I mean if you have the best
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:52.920]  business in your city then it turns into the best business in your county state
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:57.160]  country hemisphere global I mean it's the natural progression of the way that
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:00.800]  the system is set up and the way the reason you say that there always is
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:04.600]  going to be corruption is because that's what's rewarded in the system being
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:10.120]  fair and honest and and ethical that is not reward don't worry the bankers are
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:14.520]  going to use their system to destroy everything and then they agree they're
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:17.400]  not going to really allow a market anymore it's all going to be a government
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:22.560]  credit carbon tax system and you'll be given your collectivist job and then
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.720]  you'll be you know deployed to it and the globalist will sit above that so
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:29.680]  don't worry they're gonna I mean if they have their way you're gonna get what
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:33.480]  you want I mean I'm not saying that that's not what I said that I want I'm
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:36.160]  just saying I'm just trying to get you that in that okay well what do you
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:40.440]  recommend because since we took the issuance of currency and credit away
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:44.120]  from Congress things have gone downhill I mean can't we just go back to what
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:49.040]  worked instead of inventing something new when did that ever work really I mean
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.400]  you think you trust Congress more than I mean I see them on the same level of
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:57.000]  corruption as the Federal Reserve I mean you talk all day about the corrupt
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  things that Congress doesn't here's the deal Congress has been taken over and
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.240]  that's our fault we need to take it back and when the Federal Reserve the
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:10.480]  private holding company when their little corporate frontman that their
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:16.120]  spokesman little Ben Bernanke little helicopter bin who's gonna save us when
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:22.960]  he gets up there before the Congress with his jowls hanging down they say
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:26.000]  where did this trillion go where did this 500 billion go and he says I'm not
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.880]  gonna tell you see that's lack of transparency and so Ron Paul is trying
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:36.120]  to find out where the gold is at Fort Knox God love him and we're trying to
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:39.560]  get rid of the Federal Reserve then we can debate what type of money system we
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:44.440]  want that's in the hands of the Congress the people and it's never gonna be
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:48.440]  perfect but but believe me the globalist want to get rid of the Congress and
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:52.200]  its authority because we've got a chance to elect good people to that and take
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:55.400]  our country back that's why they're racing ahead with globalism with all
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:01.680]  these treaties Taylor or Tyler to get rid of our checks and balances
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:07.760]  completely I would say I mean I just have to disagree because I just I don't
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:11.280]  think Congress it would be any better off with that okay what's your solution
[3:15:11.280 --> 3:15:16.800]  Taylor my Tyler but my my solution would be what the zeitgeist movement
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:23.000]  offers in a resource-based economy you know it's funny it's funny tie now I'm
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:25.960]  getting into caddy shack type jokes where I keep calling you different names
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:32.440]  Billy Bobby been Tyler let me tell you do you know how the socialists sold all
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:35.880]  their plans a hundred years ago with images of spaceships and moon rockets
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:41.600]  and high-tech science and a computer that fairly divides up all the all the
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:46.960]  resources I mean do you know what type of living hell that would be with the
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:52.040]  New York Times endorsing the zeitgeist movement and and the guy that heads it
[3:15:52.040 --> 3:15:57.000]  up you know with his fake name Peter Joseph or whatever walking around like
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:00.760]  he's about to levitate up off the ground I was about to bring up the zeitgeist
[3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:05.680]  movement that's what this sounds like whenever you said that Taylor tie I wish
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:09.880]  you would have him back on he's about to make another film but I he's going to
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:14.920]  save us I didn't say you but that's the whole thing I mean I think that it's a
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:18.160]  near empirical train of thought that have you seen the interviews where he goes
[3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:27.080]  I was born to a mother in a town like he was born in a manger I've watched
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:30.760]  pretty much all the work that he has you've seen that video where he goes I was born
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:37.640]  until a woman in a standard home that was before z-day when our time came when
[3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:43.200]  the leader showed again when the time of the and then we follow this leader who
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:51.800]  the Rockefellers believe was the Christ the 9th Buddha Chammukhi I mean you
[3:16:51.800 --> 3:16:56.400]  haven't seen in that video that guy that the loosest trash followed well what was
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:04.760]  his name the end in guy they thought was God by boopy or whatever this is pure
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:10.560]  fruit cake stuff I appreciate your call okay look I should have been nice to
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:13.560]  the zeitgeist okay I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna apologize right now that was
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:21.200]  wrong we're gonna skip this break by the way that was wrong when I just did I
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:25.080]  think they have a lot of good ideas but a lot of bad ideas I think his first film
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:31.680]  was pretty good I think the second film anything we're a master computer runs
[3:17:31.680 --> 3:17:36.720]  everything and I wear sackcloth and I'm directed by hippies with submachine guns
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:41.160]  I'm sorry of course there he admitted on my show that I will have to be sent to a
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:45.680]  reeducation center so maybe I shouldn't apologize I'm actually pulling that file
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:52.240]  back up in my mind I was born into a mother from a standard home before z-day
[3:17:52.240 --> 3:17:58.440]  began Alex you will have to be reeducated because the plan is too
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:07.120]  perfect and you're ill you don't see the master plan oh it's so genius what are
[3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:13.840]  we gonna do today pinky same thing we do every day take over the world let's go

[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:04.680]  those other crazy little sure I was being sarcastic and I was saying the
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:10.320]  media sells that image so strong that some people actually think it's good to
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:13.640]  make movies where white people are the devil or it's okay for black folks to
[3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:17.960]  go beat up white people but then that's only a cover story by the media act in
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:22.920]  liberal they're behind the scenes and the apple of their eye who they really
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:27.680]  want to kill is black people go ahead yeah I just want to let you know that
[3:19:27.680 --> 3:19:31.240]  you're an inspiration to me also because I actually I'm thinking about

[3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:53.800]  sarcastic just because I'm so sick of it I mean I grew up in Dallas with white
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:57.720]  friends black friends Hispanic friends and and we didn't hear all this race
[3:19:57.720 --> 3:20:02.200]  stuff and it wasn't always on the news and everybody got along really good I
[3:20:02.200 --> 3:20:07.040]  saw a few things but now does it seem to you Jason that now the media just
[3:20:07.040 --> 3:20:12.600]  hypes it 24-7 and trying to make everybody uncomfortable oh yeah I mean
[3:20:12.600 --> 3:20:17.680]  the media is propaganda the whole whole bunch of me a whole slew of lies you
[3:20:17.680 --> 3:20:23.280]  know especially televising it you know and and the internet they twist and you
[3:20:23.280 --> 3:20:28.680]  know convert things and you know but did you see my point about Fox how their
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:32.960]  owner is funding the guy running the mosque they're funding machete the rock
[3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:36.640]  of fellers are funding all the liberation you know groups I mean it's so
[3:20:36.640 --> 3:20:41.480]  clear what they're doing yeah I got a video I got a YouTube channel and I
[3:20:41.480 --> 3:20:46.160]  posted a couple of videos on on those topics of I mean of course to lift him
[3:20:46.160 --> 3:20:52.880]  in the water and also the the doc the aid that they denied the 9-11 workers you
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:20:59.720]  know I got several other topics posted on my my YouTube channel Jason yeah it's
[3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:11.160]  a missing throat an action was sped it out for you my s a n t h r o p double i what
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:15.680]  is a missing throat I've seen that word before yeah I guess is well based on
[3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:22.360]  distrust of you know in it of humans but I mean I'm using it using it that
[3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:26.560]  term for you know for the establishment I hear you hey man awesome good to hear
[3:21:26.560 --> 3:21:29.680]  from him in a cram and a few more before the transmission and I could
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:32.920]  do the whole hour I guess I got all this news here but I do have a lot of work to
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:42.680]  get done it's very simple they want our activism to be white activism or black
[3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:49.120]  activism or Hispanic activism so that it's all about what color we are instead
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:53.400]  of I'm for the Bill of Rights and Constitution and that's why these big
[3:21:53.400 --> 3:21:57.520]  foundations want to make sure that all the activism is about liberation
[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:01.280]  theology because it feels good at a tribal level and there's some truth to
[3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:04.920]  it you know that that you know that's what we're it's the family and then the
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:09.200]  group and then everything else but if we see each other as the human species
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:14.160]  and we have aberrant psychopaths who can be black white German Jewish Chinese
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:18.760]  and that it's a good people against bad people and that we need to get involved
[3:22:18.760 --> 3:22:23.400]  to stop the bad people who come in all colors then we can defeat corruption
[3:22:23.400 --> 3:22:30.840]  let's go ahead and go to Paul in Ohio Paul you're on the air yeah thanks Alex
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:35.240]  I have to apologize I was on Tuesday for just a minute and I was pretty short
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:22:41.160]  with you but what I wanted to get out was I lived in a fluoride town for 35
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:47.760]  years now I'm 55 so I've been out of the fluoride for 20 years and I've only
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:52.280]  been awake for a couple but when I come out of the fluoride I had a bad
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:56.780]  reaction I never give it a thought until I listened to you talking about
[3:22:56.780 --> 3:23:04.840]  fluoride last year my nephew moved out of the fluoride in city and a year later
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:10.840]  he had a bad experience and it's it's a withdrawal symptom from the floor I well
[3:23:10.840 --> 3:23:14.480]  I do know that there are withdrawals from poisons and that your entire metabolic
[3:23:14.480 --> 3:23:19.400]  dopamine levels other things change and medical doctors have said on this show
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:23.540]  repeatedly different of a whole bunch of them that if you go off Prozac you
[3:23:23.540 --> 3:23:28.280]  better go off slow because it'll make you completely go psychotic if you go
[3:23:28.280 --> 3:23:34.040]  off Ritalin you got to go off slow and if you go off Aspartame it is a violent
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:40.880]  violent I mean it's like going off heroin so yes I would have to ask
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:46.480]  medical doctors about fluoride withdrawal but I do know that it does
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:50.800]  manipulate dopamine serotonin and other things so I would imagine that's the
[3:23:50.800 --> 3:23:56.200]  same thing but so what was it like when you move out of the fluoride area it's
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:24:01.200]  like you come out of a fog Alex and and all the emotions and stuff that's been
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:06.960]  suppressed for all that long open up you start feeling again you start feeling
[3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:12.760]  sad you start feeling angry and when you first have that it's something you
[3:24:12.760 --> 3:24:16.960]  never had before and you don't know how to deal with it you start feeling evil
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:20.880]  well don't worry don't worry the government's got new vaccines it'll
[3:24:20.880 --> 3:24:26.400]  never make you feel again well that's what they'd like to do to you do you
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:30.080]  know it you know damn well that's what all great points I appreciate your call
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:32.920]  I'll have to look into that though I would imagine that that's fact fact
[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:40.200]  based David and Georgia you're on the air hello Alex hello my friend in the
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:46.440]  70s I was given a copy of the little yellow book none dare call it
[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:56.240]  conspiracy yes and that led me to other books one of which was born in blood the
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:04.080]  lost secrets of free masonry among many other books which I have been awake
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:12.120]  since the middle 70s I drove a truck for a number of years and in truck stops
[3:25:12.120 --> 3:25:19.960]  many times on layovers I would end up in the truck stop with a group of drivers
[3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:26.240]  around me attempting to enlighten them and I'd like to give you a couple of
[3:25:26.240 --> 3:25:31.200]  things that I came to the conclusion of and see if you agree with me yeah tell
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:40.280]  me communism is nothing more than the open visible side of the secret
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:48.680]  society of the Illuminati yeah I mean I agree with that okay and it was created
[3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:57.160]  by Engels and Larks with the help of the Illuminati so that the West could
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:04.840]  spend itself into oblivion defending itself against a perceived enemy yeah
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:08.560]  while they're fighting the outside enemy they build up the very same system
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:15.360]  to counter that enemy within that's correct and that in their writings they
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:23.840]  said we would have two world wars and a third if necessary to bring about one
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:30.040]  world government they would bring it about peacefully as if possible or by
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:37.880]  force if necessary no that I mean that's all on record that that's the plan
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:44.800]  Albert Pike wrote about that in 1877 that's right Mr. Weiss out as well yep
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:50.880]  when they founded the order and it goes back to the nights of the round table
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:56.920]  before that well yes you had systems of commerce and secret societies which
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:00.920]  really just a private intelligence agencies who learned how people operate
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:05.520]  and know the tricks to manipulate and the public's been taught there's no
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:10.360]  manipulation there's no propaganda there's no corruption as the corruption
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:15.280]  grows all around them and it's time for folks to wake up really good to hear
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:20.520]  from you sir I appreciate the call who's up next year John trying to move
[3:27:20.520 --> 3:27:22.680]  quick here Frank and Nevada you're on the air
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:26.360]  I don't know it's nice to talk to you thanks for holding buddy you're on the
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:32.400]  air welcome okay and listen a couple quick things first of all keep not
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:36.760]  smoking I gave it up in January it's a great thing you'll love it as time goes
[3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:41.240]  on now but I mean did you feel kind of crazy for like a week well you know I
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:46.440]  like you have tried many times in the past and this time I just made a mental
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:51.880]  you know resiliency to not smoke and because I did that every time I started
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:55.680]  to feel that craving I would just tell myself I'm doing this for myself this
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:28:00.000]  is for me no I know but I mean I mean I mean the withdrawals it's not even a
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:04.120]  withdrawal of even really craving or more of it's just like you kind of feel
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:09.560]  nuts for about a week how I help myself with that about two months before I
[3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:14.520]  decided to actually quit what I started doing was just smoking like sigurillos
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:19.240]  in other words I'd have a cigar once every one or two hours which would I'd
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:24.400]  started to wean myself off that the nicotine lots of times with cigars or
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:28.040]  chewing tobacco you know just where you have like one chew at night when you
[3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:33.640]  got to have it and smoke of you know one cigar a day but I never stay quit that
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:37.560]  way I've just got a cold turkey it yeah you got it and you got to tell yourself
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:41.960]  you got to just keep reminding yourself and keep a mental image of how nasty
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:46.520]  your lungs feel and how nasty your breath feels and how you know how you
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:49.760]  ain't you're always short of breath and stuff if you keep that mental image
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:54.200]  going it helps you it really helps it helped me at least well if you keep the
[3:28:54.200 --> 3:28:57.840]  mental image going of you're gonna get lung cancer and not get to see your
[3:28:57.840 --> 3:29:02.920]  grandkids that'll get you off of it I mean I don't know what my problem is you
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:08.840]  know I just off and on I've quit smoking for four or five six years one time I
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:17.600]  mean I've I've been smoking since I was 12 to 36 and I'd have to say half that
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:25.560]  time I haven't smoked off and on I'm just an idiot that's why I can't go to a
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:29.880]  parties where there's drinking so I'm not a big drinker but if I go to a party
