[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:31.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.120 --> 00:38.120]  Sunday the 8th day of November 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next two hours and we're
[00:38.120 --> 00:45.560]  going to open the phones up for everyone to be able to respond to the democratic controlled
[00:45.560 --> 00:54.520]  house passing the government takeover of health care legislation and now speeds on to the Senate
[00:54.520 --> 00:59.560]  remember earlier in the week they were playing possum telling the world there's no way it'll
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.560]  pass the house this weekend everybody go to sleep everything's fine and there was no way three
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.400]  months ago they were gonna pass the cap and trade legislation to tax all carbon dioxide and other
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.480]  greenhouse gases and to regulate your life under you and control and they pass that it's now in
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.280]  the Senate and they're now saying don't worry the Senate's not gonna pass either one everything's fine
[01:23.280 --> 01:30.720]  if you hold your breath ladies and gentlemen you're gonna drown they're going to pass both of
[01:30.720 --> 01:39.200]  these pieces of legislation unless we have a maximum political effort to define and to deal
[01:39.200 --> 01:44.640]  with this situation we have to go out and educate the public about what's really in this legislation
[01:44.640 --> 01:51.480]  and I thought I'd go over some of the 1900 page piece of legislation then of course you have the
[01:51.480 --> 01:57.360]  greenhouse gas tax and last week we went over this the framework convention on climate change
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.880]  there's over a hundred pages just that talk about world government another close to a hundred
[02:03.880 --> 02:11.400]  pages to talk about global taxes and it really is unspeakable it is so anti-american the complete
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.400]  opposite of what this nation was founded on and is so we'll be going over that after we come back
[02:18.400 --> 02:26.280]  from this first short break the toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2344 I'm just gonna tell
[02:26.280 --> 02:32.120]  callers right now we're not screening your calls it's self-screening but you can talk about the
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.800]  fordhood shooting and gun grabbing and all the stuff coming out with that we can talk about
[02:38.800 --> 02:46.000]  government takeover of health care government global carbon tax takeover or how basically open
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.680]  world governments being announced and pushed but I don't want to discuss chubacabras or flying
[02:51.680 --> 03:01.400]  saucers or you know side diversion distraction issues like that we're gonna talk about real
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.480]  issues here today and I know that most of you want to talk about that to begin with but 888-201-2244
[03:08.480 --> 03:21.400]  888-201-2244 and we will get you up and on the air on this live 8th day of November 2009 Sunday
[03:21.400 --> 03:28.720]  edition I also have some other examples in my stack of what happens once you live under a
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.040]  socialist government and how the state takes total control of your life I thought we'd look at what
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.320]  they're doing through government health care and control in England and in Canada and in
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.840]  Germany and France and Australia you think the control freaks have got their snout in your life
[03:44.840 --> 03:53.680]  today you ain't seen nothing yet so that is coming up as well a lot of suspicious information
[03:53.680 --> 04:00.600]  has come out in the last few days dealing with the fordhood alleged shooter I say alleged shooter
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.160]  he probably is the shooter we just don't know if he's a prozac head crazy psychiatrist they are
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.080]  the craziest profession out there statistically highest level of suicide and mass killing and
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.200]  raping their patients and every other form of crime and torturing patients in their little
[04:16.200 --> 04:24.360]  ghoulish mental health facilities or he could be a whacked out Muslim extremist or he could be good
[04:24.360 --> 04:28.760]  old-fashioned MK ultra I mean that is a real government program and there's a lot of evidence
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.600]  leaning towards that so later we're going to get into that today but again the toll free
[04:33.600 --> 04:42.280]  number to join us 888-201-2244 my friends will be taking your phone calls on the health care

[05:42.720 --> 05:51.280]  Jones I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[05:51.280 --> 06:03.040]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633 from his central Texas command
[06:03.040 --> 06:10.520]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[06:10.520 --> 06:35.640]  network okay ladies and gentlemen we are live and it is of course Sunday the 8th day of November
[06:35.640 --> 06:49.600]  2009 an absolutely horrible occurrence happened late last night the Democrats passed their
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.880]  government takeover of health care and it has everything they promised it wouldn't the public
[06:54.880 --> 07:04.040]  option the giant fines on people that don't want to go out and buy health insurance this will
[07:04.040 --> 07:11.200]  begin taking over what's left of the free market in health care it will dump trillions more dollars
[07:11.200 --> 07:16.400]  of federal money into health care expanding the bureaucracy and driving up the price the more
[07:16.400 --> 07:21.560]  money they put into it and the less competition the higher the price will go which is exactly what
[07:21.560 --> 07:27.360]  they want in five six seven years when it's completely wrecked like this nation already is
[07:27.360 --> 07:34.840]  economically they will come in with even more government and more control as the solution
[07:34.840 --> 07:42.920]  because control is the name of the game what we have seen past the House of Representatives is
[07:42.920 --> 07:50.680]  180 degrees the opposite of what our constitutional republic was founded on the reason we didn't
[07:50.680 --> 07:56.960]  have socialist health care was because it's an American and because when you build a big
[07:56.960 --> 08:03.720]  giant bureaucracy the corruption is only going to intensify it's like if you go sink a battleship
[08:03.720 --> 08:10.920]  off the floor to keys you're going to get in a few decades a huge reef system that's a good thing
[08:10.920 --> 08:19.080]  you go sink a bunch of old cars it'll turn into it artificial reef you go create giant
[08:19.080 --> 08:26.120]  government programs it creates huge ecosystems of corruption and bid rigging and scams and
[08:26.120 --> 08:34.400]  stealing and that's what happens and so we will end up like the Soviet Union or Communist China it
[08:34.400 --> 08:42.800]  is an absolute guarantee also another big issue here is the media the whole time has falsely cast
[08:42.800 --> 08:51.160]  the debate as if insurance companies were against this and rich guys were against this no the
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.880]  spokesman for the health care insurance companies of the United States has been in the Wall Street
[08:56.880 --> 09:03.880]  Journal and everywhere else admitting that they wrote this plan but then when Nancy Pelosi gets
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.880]  called a Nazi at a press conference by somebody that snuck a bullhorn in she goes oh thank you
[09:08.880 --> 09:16.240]  insurance companies thank you health care companies no the big official lobbyist of the
[09:16.240 --> 09:22.360]  health care industry are on record and we've read their quotes here bragging that they wrote
[09:22.360 --> 09:29.800]  this bill now they threatened a month ago and again two weeks ago that if the five thousand
[09:29.800 --> 09:39.400]  dollar fines and prison time for not buying their insurance policies was taken out of the bill
[09:39.400 --> 09:45.680]  they were going to throw their weight against it and so the Congress said okay well we'll put
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.760]  you in prison we'll uh we'll we'll and and the bills even worse the old bill had a five thousand
[09:52.760 --> 09:57.000]  dollar policy you had to buy or get a five thousand dollar fine this new one says fifteen
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.320]  thousand ladies and gentlemen fifteen thousand is what more than sixty million people in this
[10:05.320 --> 10:14.680]  country make a year I mean it's over folks NAFTA GATT was meant to bankrupt our industry I have
[10:14.680 --> 10:18.400]  the government documents we read a bunch of them last week about how they plan to destroy our
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.880]  industry then big banks the globalist the big select corporations are the only ones that own
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.560]  and control the factories in China and Mexico and India they have sweetheart deals with the
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.200]  elites there they then can produce the items cheaper than anybody can in the western world so
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.240]  you lose your industrial base then they keep jacking up the taxes on the middle class and
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.560]  working class to bankrupt everybody and drive everybody into government control I mean I mean
[10:42.560 --> 10:48.760]  that's what all of this is about this is a sophisticated takeover and they've got all
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.480]  these slick republicans up there with their talking points playing along with the game and
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.120]  you've got all the slick democrats out there with their talking points repeating the same
[10:58.120 --> 11:05.600]  stuff just in different ways that is on the surface opposed to each other but then you pull
[11:05.600 --> 11:13.520]  back and realize it's all smoke and mirrors I mean Bush triple the size of government Bush
[11:13.520 --> 11:23.840]  signed on to man-made global warming theory Bush tried to reauthorize the assault weapons
[11:23.840 --> 11:29.840]  ban and Obama's continued the wars and continued the Patriot Act and continued everything Bush
[11:29.840 --> 11:37.480]  did because there's no difference between these people certainly you can get republicans
[11:37.480 --> 11:43.840]  elected coming up on about a year from now in the 2010 congressional election and all
[11:43.840 --> 11:48.120]  the polls show the democrats are going to lose control of the house but you watch those
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.160]  republicans aren't going to be able to repeal the health care bill oh they just won't be
[11:52.160 --> 11:59.240]  able to repeal the greenhouse gas tax bill oh they just won't be able to repeal any of
[11:59.240 --> 12:04.560]  it just like Obama couldn't stop the wars oops he had to make them even bigger because
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.560]  there's an elite agenda and the republicans and the democrats are there to carry it out
[12:09.560 --> 12:17.360]  together but I thought I'd go over some of the subsections of the bill Pelosi by a $15,000
[12:17.360 --> 12:23.920]  policy or go to jail this is from the Wayne's and means committee ways and means committee
[12:23.920 --> 12:29.240]  ranking member Dave camp today ranking member of the house ways and means committee Dave
[12:29.240 --> 12:33.680]  camp released a letter from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation confirming that
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.440]  the failure to comply with the individual mandate to buy health insurance contained in Pelosi's
[12:38.440 --> 12:46.200]  health care bill HR 3962 as amended could land people in jail the JCT letter makes clear
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.120]  that Americans who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage and who choose not
[12:51.120 --> 12:59.320]  to pay the bill's new individual mandate tax generally 2.5% of income above 250,000 it's
[12:59.320 --> 13:07.160]  a 5% are subject to numerous civil and criminal penalties including criminal fines and up to
[13:07.160 --> 13:13.360]  250,000 and imprisonment for up to five years now now that is in the bill I didn't just believe
[13:13.360 --> 13:20.880]  the ways and means committee and I didn't believe the ways and means committee on taxation
[13:20.880 --> 13:30.120]  I actually went to the bill and it does say that and it says in page two of HR 3962 they
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.040]  didn't hide this that if the government determines that a taxpayer is unpaid tax liability results
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.320]  from a willful behavior the following penalties could apply due to nonpayment of deductible
[13:41.320 --> 13:48.720]  insurance and look last week I showed you that in Illinois they're already issuing
[13:48.720 --> 13:55.080]  a federally written taxpayer handbook that says by federal law this money has to be withheld
[13:55.080 --> 14:04.640]  out of your check for the government controlled insurance rule now you look at Australia England
[14:04.640 --> 14:12.160]  Germany other places this is actually in the news today if you're only making say in England
[14:12.160 --> 14:24.560]  10,000 pounds a year your blue collar that's around $18,000 and you can't pay the 20% tax
[14:24.560 --> 14:29.880]  they've got there I mean 20% of your money there goes towards your insurance oh you've
[14:29.880 --> 14:35.600]  got free government health care 20% of your paycheck don't worry though here they're
[14:35.600 --> 14:39.800]  just going to start out with 10% of your paycheck and then the bureaucracy you'll use most of
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.880]  it and give some to the insurance companies and to the big mega you know they they have
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.880]  big pharma a big agribusiness for farming well it's the same thing here big mega health
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.040]  care and big mega health care is lobbied for all this because they've got the lawyers
[14:57.040 --> 15:01.960]  and the computer systems and the secretaries and the big high rise of buildings the bureaucrats
[15:01.960 --> 15:05.680]  they want all of this this is going to shut down your small hospitals shut down your
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.040]  small dental offices I mean they're already all shut down you want big box Walmart health
[15:10.040 --> 15:14.000]  care you're going to get it and you're going to get crappy health care too you're going
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.920]  to get a aspirin for a heart attack I mean it's admitted in Europe and in England I've
[15:18.920 --> 15:22.840]  watched the House of Commons during Prime Minister's questions back when Tony Blair
[15:22.840 --> 15:29.760]  was in and they'd say my constituents we had to wait 18 months for a brain surgery
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.120]  and died it was operable within six months and Tony Blair goes yes I'm aware of these
[15:34.120 --> 15:38.760]  cases and it's unfortunate but that's the way the rationing works due to the system
[15:38.760 --> 15:45.440]  I mean they don't even deny it over there but here the control left goes oh no there's
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.400]  no rationing in Canada or Germany or England that's all lies and the truth is here in the
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.800]  US nobody gets turned away for health care you go to the emergency room you get taken
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.360]  care of you had free health care now you're going to lose it the illusion created by the
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.400]  power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue

[20:20.400 --> 20:25.440]  we are back live your phone calls are coming up the start of the next segment dan in pennsylvania
[20:25.440 --> 20:33.080]  michael in origan nathan in st louis anita in texas ronaldo new york city david ohio
[20:33.080 --> 20:42.840]  all your phone calls are coming up at 8882012244 look people aren't stupid that's why the vast
[20:42.840 --> 20:49.960]  majority of americans turned against the health care reform as it was billed as they learned
[20:49.960 --> 20:55.360]  details the last three months to where most polls show upwards of 70 percent being against
[20:55.360 --> 21:01.640]  the democratic plan that's why obama and others came out and said it's essential that this
[21:01.640 --> 21:07.320]  passes during this congress because obama himself his approval rating has gone from
[21:07.320 --> 21:14.440]  the mid eighties to the low forties the lowest of any president in u.s history ten months
[21:14.440 --> 21:23.920]  into their first administration he is dropping like a stone the people are finding out see
[21:23.920 --> 21:29.440]  the american people rebuke george bush he was horrible lied about wars lied about wmd's
[21:29.440 --> 21:34.720]  triple the size of government set up a police state but he was just carrying out the globalist
[21:34.720 --> 21:41.280]  operation and then obama gets in and everybody wonders why everything expands everything
[21:41.280 --> 21:46.560]  accelerates that bush was already doing just different window dressing different rhetoric
[21:46.560 --> 21:51.560]  and they still got the little left right fight going back and forth for everybody but that
[21:51.560 --> 21:59.200]  goes on like a screen for the public but behind the movie screen behind the curtain the real
[21:59.200 --> 22:03.960]  technicians of the world government are setting up their planetary dictatorship and they've
[22:03.960 --> 22:09.400]  bragged for decades how much they love socialist health care they socialize your money give
[22:09.400 --> 22:15.440]  most of it to the banks financing huge deficits and then government gets to control health
[22:15.440 --> 22:19.720]  care and gets to control your life and gets to tell you what you can eat and what you
[22:19.720 --> 22:26.800]  can do and gets to micromanage you and basically sell forced inoculations and one child policies
[22:26.800 --> 22:32.680]  and taking people's kids of their overweight this is the nanny state and it's all in the
[22:32.680 --> 22:39.400]  bill and we've seen what they've done with the similar systems developed in europe it's
[22:39.400 --> 22:49.440]  pure death it's pure new world order people aren't stupid in october of last year we had
[22:49.440 --> 22:55.000]  multiple members of congress on this radio show to document it senator in hoff and many
[22:55.000 --> 23:02.280]  others henry paulson with geithner head of the new york fed and bernacky head of the
[23:02.280 --> 23:08.800]  private fed chairman of the federal reserve they went before a closed committee of congress
[23:08.800 --> 23:15.200]  and said marshal law will be declared we must have this 700 billion open line of credit
[23:15.200 --> 23:21.120]  was really unlimited they've stolen 23.7 trillion last numbers we got from the federal government
[23:21.120 --> 23:25.520]  that's three months old god knows what it is now if you follow the graph it's over 28
[23:25.520 --> 23:32.080]  trillion but whatever trillion here trillion there pretty soon you got real money 23.7
[23:32.080 --> 23:38.880]  trillion dollars and they passed it on october 3rd that friday on saturday paulson said oh
[23:38.880 --> 23:43.720]  we don't need it anymore to unfreeze the mortgage market sorry we're not going to tell you where
[23:43.720 --> 23:50.680]  the money's going there is no free lunch the bigger the government you grow the bigger
[23:50.680 --> 23:57.000]  a lever foreign offshore banks the crime syndicate the new world order the bigger a lever they
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.200]  have to rob you to steal from you government works for the corporate criminals corporate
[24:05.200 --> 24:12.560]  welfare is 90% of the real budget they take your money and they steal it and you better
[24:12.560 --> 24:17.840]  believe this health care plan just like nafta just like that just like the global greenhouse
[24:17.840 --> 24:24.400]  carbon tax law that we now have the house version that's passed it's in the senate we now have
[24:24.400 --> 24:30.560]  the coping hanging in mark treaty ban chi moon two weeks ago two sundays ago wrote an editorial
[24:30.560 --> 24:36.840]  for the new york times called we can do it and he said this will fund the world government
[24:36.840 --> 24:43.480]  this will cut back on wasteful industrial societies then you read the internal u n documents they
[24:43.480 --> 24:48.000]  say they're going to wreck the society so bad that you're not going to be able to even
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.960]  pay to have children and when you can't pay to feed your kids because there's no jobs
[24:52.960 --> 24:57.600]  the government's going to come and raise them in dormitories that is in eco science
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.800]  written by white house science are old run and the reason they're getting away with this
[25:01.800 --> 25:09.280]  is because the public by and large are a bunch of cowards a bunch of fat unhealthy stupid
[25:09.280 --> 25:14.920]  sports fans who think america is disney world who think there's nothing evil on the planet
[25:14.920 --> 25:21.080]  who think everything's fine who think it's a social disease to care that it's a social
[25:21.080 --> 25:28.280]  disease to get upset that it's a social disease to be involved that it's weird and scary and
[25:28.280 --> 25:35.640]  ooh that alex jones reads bills he's a freak he read what ban chi moon said at the u n yeah
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.560]  did you hear him he said ban chi moons calling for a world government alex is bad it isn't
[25:41.560 --> 25:47.880]  bad that some foreign corporate holding company called the u n is openly taken over our country
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.840]  and we're going to be paying taxes directly to private banks on breathing and our cars
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.400]  and everything else we do and that they're going to have taxes on children to begin
[25:57.400 --> 26:04.440]  with does it matter of the u s and british governments paid china tens of billions of
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.480]  dollars and allowed them to be the new industrial center because they agreed to kill children
[26:09.480 --> 26:13.560]  when somebody has more than one child yeah you don't want to know that all came from
[26:13.560 --> 26:18.440]  the u s you don't want to know that once they bankrupt us and bring in communism they're
[26:18.440 --> 26:24.440]  going to do that here because communism isn't some freak with a beard in a with a red star
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.880]  those are just hired thugs by the bankers who come and kill the middle class and then enslave
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.640]  everybody else and reengineer society when the bankers shock troops show up they don't
[26:35.640 --> 26:40.280]  tell you that they're coming from the bankers they tell you we're here from the people now

[33:39.320 --> 33:45.240]  judge napolitano one of the few true conservatives out there normally a conservative means somebody
[33:45.240 --> 33:50.840]  that triples the size of government attacks a bunch of third world countries help stage terror attacks
[33:50.840 --> 33:57.400]  uh and knows full well that homeland security is really spying on real conservatives these rhinos
[33:57.400 --> 34:04.760]  but uh i like napolitano it says kiss your freedoms goodbye if health care passes congress
[34:04.760 --> 34:09.560]  recognizes no limits on its power it doesn't care about the constitution doesn't care about your
[34:09.560 --> 34:16.360]  inalible rights if this health care bill becomes law and it's passed the house now america an american
[34:16.360 --> 34:22.040]  life as you have known it freedom as you have exercised it in privacy as you have enjoyed it
[34:22.040 --> 34:30.280]  will cease to be and that's not an overstatement my friends the house of representatives will vote
[34:30.280 --> 34:35.160]  on a 2000 page bill to give the federal government the power to micromanage the health care of every
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.160]  single american the bill will no doubt pass it will raise your taxes steal your freedom invade
[34:41.160 --> 34:47.160]  your privacy and ration your health care even the republicans have introduced their version of obama
[34:47.160 --> 34:52.920]  care like it too if pass will compel employers to provide coverage bribe the states to change their
[34:52.920 --> 35:00.440]  court rules and tell insurance companies whom to ensure and ladies and gentlemen that's the thing
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.560]  the republicans are involved in this as well and napolitano is one of the only mainline people
[35:07.560 --> 35:11.640]  that's why i like him who will actually tell the truth you're not going to hear that out of glenn
[35:11.640 --> 35:14.760]  beck you're not going to hear that out of russia limbaugh you're not going to hear that out of
[35:14.760 --> 35:21.480]  these people did they say a word when bush tripled the size of government i've got beck on video
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.440]  saying we've got to pass the maker bailout bill or the subprime mortgages everything will fall
[35:26.440 --> 35:32.840]  apart we've got to do this right now and the point is when the republicans get back into the house in
[35:32.840 --> 35:40.440]  a year we need to make them repeal this government health care but no they'll just blame it on the
[35:40.440 --> 35:45.720]  democrats and hope you forget about it you watch these little bastards these little creatures excuse
[35:45.720 --> 35:53.240]  me they are going to try to keep this and that's what makes me so sick about them they're just as
[35:53.240 --> 36:03.080]  bad as the democrats we do have one political party in this country we don't have two we do
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.960]  not have two political parties in this country america we have one party called big government
[36:07.960 --> 36:14.680]  party the republican wing likes deficits war and assaults on civil liberties the democratic wing
[36:14.680 --> 36:22.360]  likes wealth transfer taxes and assaults on commercial liberties both parties like power
[36:22.360 --> 36:28.280]  and neither is interested in your freedoms think about it government is the negation of freedom
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.960]  freedom is the power and ability to follow your own free will and your own conscience the government
[36:33.960 --> 36:41.400]  wants you to follow the will of some faceless bureaucrant and in europe and they're admitting
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.720]  they're going to do that under this plan dashel who originally wrote the bill wrote a book about it
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.880]  saying yes if you're above 60 you don't get eye surgery you don't get ear surgery you don't get
[36:49.880 --> 36:57.320]  cancer surgery they love to socialize wealth of the general public because then elites get the
[36:57.320 --> 37:02.920]  profits off that system but more importantly they get to come in and now you don't get to choose you
[37:02.920 --> 37:09.000]  don't get to run your own life control freaks revel in bossing you around running your life
[37:10.920 --> 37:15.080]  and the police love to act like they're all conservative and they're good old boys and
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.880]  they're going to help you they're a bunch of control freaks as well it's just a big sickening
[37:19.880 --> 37:26.440]  government and the public's degenerating as well i mean not just the government this is a decadent
[37:26.440 --> 37:33.960]  society i just can't believe they passed this but i knew they were when i saw all these headlines
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.720]  last week in fact i have several of them here where they were saying top dims obama won't get
[37:39.720 --> 37:47.000]  healthcare bill in 2009 this is from abc news november 3rd and and oh it's not going to pass the
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.720]  house oh it won't pass the senate oh don't worry they're not going to get the global climate change
[37:53.720 --> 38:03.320]  piece of legislation through don't worry everything is just fine i knew when i saw that it's like a
[38:03.320 --> 38:07.720]  month ago swartz and egger said i'm not going to sign the bill making you digitally thumbprint
[38:07.720 --> 38:13.080]  and be registered to buy ammo in california and i said that's it he's going to sign it next week
[38:13.080 --> 38:18.840]  and he signed it because they understand that most people are halfway reading the newspaper
[38:19.960 --> 38:25.640]  and so they'll think that arnold didn't sign it and they'll go i like him he's a republican he's
[38:25.640 --> 38:32.520]  anti-gun pro open border pro big government pro global carbon tax but he did kick out that gray
[38:32.520 --> 38:41.960]  davis coming haha yeah boy it's like when i walked in mc brides a few years ago when bush was still
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.680]  in office and i was talking to one of the managers yeah bush is trying to reauthorize the assault
[38:46.680 --> 38:52.040]  weapons ban this guy walked over behind the counter and went alex i'm tired of your lies
[38:52.040 --> 38:57.400]  bush is against the assault weapons ban and i just smiled and said okay believe whatever you want
[38:57.400 --> 39:03.240]  and then the one of the owners says no it's true he's supporting the assault weapons ban the guy
[39:03.240 --> 39:09.240]  was like what what it's the same thing swartz and egger he didn't he ain't signing that i
[39:09.240 --> 39:15.240]  tied gun bill oh really see these are tricks they play on you so so they're out oh don't worry
[39:16.760 --> 39:20.600]  it's not gonna pass the house and then now there's already articles out today about
[39:20.600 --> 39:31.400]  uh don't worry it's never going to pass the senate oh sure just like they said two weeks ago
[39:31.400 --> 39:37.160]  that it would never pass out a committee for the climate bill oh senate panel approves democratic
[39:37.160 --> 39:46.680]  climate bill that climate bill has already passed the house this is even worse than government run
[39:46.680 --> 39:51.880]  health care i mean the government's grabbed the auto companies it's already uh grabbed our industry
[39:52.680 --> 39:58.520]  by paying incentives to move to mexico china and india under the climate bill china india
[39:58.520 --> 40:04.040]  mexico and hundreds of other third world countries over 160 other countries have to make zero cuts
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.800]  but the us and europe have to make 20 cuts within the first five years in in in carbon
[40:10.600 --> 40:15.480]  in in carbon dioxide that comes out of every factory in every one of our mouths and that plants
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.400]  breathe now the little bit of industry we got left where do you think it's going to go when there's
[40:21.400 --> 40:30.280]  at least a 20 percent tax that's what it is on all industry hmm it'll go to china and india and
[40:30.280 --> 40:37.640]  mexico were a handful of fat cat industrial barons financed by the private banks who you pay the
[40:37.640 --> 40:44.440]  carbon taxes to gotta love it the big central banks own the slave labor camps it's the equivalent
[40:44.440 --> 40:50.440]  the maquiladoras and places in mexico and china of slavery many places it is slavery in china
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.520]  in india they have a caste system where you're you know a untouchable and that's their little
[40:56.520 --> 41:04.040]  slaves over there as well uh and and and so the big banks they own the factories and what industries
[41:04.040 --> 41:10.760]  left in the west you pay taxes to the same banks that have incentivized moving the factories of
[41:10.760 --> 41:19.000]  third world where there's zero carbon taxes and that baby is now out of committee boys and girls
[41:19.000 --> 41:29.720]  they could vote on the stinking climate bill next week the senate could vote next week on healthcare

[48:23.880 --> 48:28.680]  every major government on earth is just robbing and stealing from their people
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.280]  that's what the founding fathers warned us about they said you better keep government small

[48:54.360 --> 49:03.640]  and then i have all these other articles here in my stack from associated press roiders daily tech
[49:03.640 --> 49:10.920]  tech see i actually read that the the technical journals i know exxon and mobile and dutch roll
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.600]  shell and bp funded the entire phony environmental movement to put taxes on carbon
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.920]  but when you hear the news they say oil companies don't want it these people are geniuses that's
[49:26.920 --> 49:31.640]  why they're in control because they know how to scam people here's one out of daily tech
[49:31.640 --> 49:38.840]  auto execs urge government to tax fuel up to eight dollars a gallon to increase fuel efficiency
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.120]  and it talks about the heads of the major oil companies the heads of the major car companies
[49:44.120 --> 49:50.360]  meeting with government regulators saying we want eight dollars a gallon on the fuel
[49:50.360 --> 50:02.040]  fuel i mean it's incredible the oil companies want the global carbon tax one reason is most
[50:02.040 --> 50:07.800]  the taxes on coal coal produces 51 of the power in the us even more in areas of europe
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.040]  that's another sector another elite that's a system it's not completely controlled by one group
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.840]  there's a lot of rich people own coal but it's not monolithic it's not monopolistic
[50:18.840 --> 50:26.360]  it's over they're talking about a 50 plus percent tax obama has been quoted saying we're
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.080]  gonna bankrupt coal i mean i could pull that clip up in fact just youtube obama says we're
[50:31.080 --> 50:37.560]  gonna bankrupt coal i mean they're gonna bank because he works for the oil companies you gotta
[50:37.560 --> 50:41.240]  love it and all these idiot environmentalists running around they don't care about real
[50:41.240 --> 50:46.600]  environmental problems genetic engineering toxic waste dumping all these other serious issues
[50:46.600 --> 50:52.440]  they want to tax what plants breathe because the oil company says so and the oil companies
[50:52.440 --> 50:57.160]  have loopholes written where they're not going to pay anything you're going to pay more oh it's
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.600]  a sick joke okay i'm done ranting i'm going to go to your calls now and then into the next hour

[51:14.520 --> 51:22.120]  federally takeover the entire society unspeakably bad they are are trying to pass the healthcare
[51:22.120 --> 51:28.840]  takeover it the government is nothing but the mechanism of offshore banks to engage in a ruthless
[51:28.840 --> 51:35.560]  corporate takeover and strip mining and sell off of the nation foreign banks and corporations and
[51:35.560 --> 51:40.920]  countries are buying up everything right now they're plunging the dollar right now so they can come in
[51:40.920 --> 51:45.800]  with their foreign currencies and buy us up and the public's running around drooling slobbering
[51:45.800 --> 51:50.920]  mindlessly doing nothing but washing football and you deserve what you get your children have no
[51:50.920 --> 51:58.280]  future you're completely enslaved if you would wake up and say no we could stop it but you won't

[52:43.160 --> 52:48.040]  so all these foreign groups came in all these foreign interests came in and bought us off

[54:45.400 --> 54:49.720]  been following this and just kind of listening well mostly is following the bird flu or swine flu but
[54:51.080 --> 54:56.440]  this whole health care thing i'm self employed i mean this would are you saying it would take
[54:56.440 --> 55:05.720]  i'd have to have a $15,000 a year policy that's what the bill said it's even worse it's even worse
[55:05.720 --> 55:12.280]  than the previous five versions what they ended up i want to know is there any way because i've
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.920]  done this for years as my kids i opted out of all the vaccinations no they're saying they're
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.440]  going to give you a $250,000 fine and uh five years in prison in fact let me pull the actual bill
[55:22.440 --> 55:29.400]  out keep going well is there any way you can opt out of this i wouldn't take medical care if you
[55:29.400 --> 55:36.920]  paid me i would rather go to a natural path anybody anybody but these guys okay okay i got that wrong
[55:36.920 --> 55:48.600]  that's why i i had a feeling i'd gotten that wrong uh hr 3962 page two uh it says uh 250,000
[55:49.720 --> 55:56.680]  dollar fine and one year in prison i don't know where i got five but so it's only one year in
[55:56.680 --> 56:01.720]  prison oh no i'm sorry i'm no i'm sorry i was wrong one of the other clauses is one year in
[56:01.720 --> 56:08.280]  prison i was correct i'm sorry they take 2.5 to five percent out of your check to begin with
[56:08.280 --> 56:14.120]  but that's for the totally uninsurable and then non-working so you get a new 2.5 to five percent
[56:14.120 --> 56:21.880]  tax on you don't worry if you make under 50,000 it's only 2.5 above that five percent and uh

[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:32.200]  texas alex jones the reason government is exploding in size is because the criminals that
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:36.920]  own and run it are getting greedy but also because they know people are starting to resist them so
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:41.800]  they're trying to come in with even more force and just take everything over at once the banks
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:47.400]  the auto industry everything that's what the carbon tax is about that's what health care is
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:55.320]  about they're taking everything over right now we're gonna dave wane david brigton steve and
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:01.080]  others the toll free number to join us is 888-201-2244 david and pennsylvania thanks for holding
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:06.920]  welcome hey alex you rock man i got two quick questions for you and nothing to do with health
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:12.440]  care um number one when when when the economy collapses and this all hits rock bottom do you
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:20.680]  think that we will be safe in our homes well i mean you're not safe in your car it's the number one
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:27.320]  cause of death but we still get in our cars will you be less safe in your home absolutely uh crime
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:36.440]  is going to go up uh crackheads and heroin heads will continue to try to rob stereos and computers
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:42.360]  so they can buy opium and cocaine shipped in by the government uh and and and then you'll also get
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:47.560]  robbed by having to pay taxes for police to fight the drug addicts using the government products
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:52.680]  that's how the globalists make money on both sides of the fence and uh no i mean i think a society
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:57.320]  is going to get worse and worse and worse and then they're going to have the public begging
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:02.520]  for regular army troops to be put on the streets through north com go ahead do you think though
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:07.160]  that they'll be my point is that when when this all collapses and the economy hits the fan and
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:12.920]  we're pretty much subjected to at their mercy per se then and i mean for if if you know if we
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:17.080]  have our stockpile of food in our homes and things like that where we don't have to go out for anything
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:22.440]  do you think that will because i mean you know i i see the way things are going and and and
[1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:25.720]  listening to you and other people and you know they're going to be having checkpoints everywhere
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.440]  i mean they're going to be on top of us like flies on crap and my my concern and i appreciate your
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:37.960]  call sir um that's not how it works they need to incrementally roll things out the average cop is
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:44.040]  in thinking i'm evil i'm part of a big master plan they're being put into scenarios incrementally
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:51.560]  that slowly twist them to believe that secret arrest and torture and databases and no fly list
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:58.680]  and no travel list and no gun ownership lists are legitimate when they're not those are extra
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:05.720]  judicial it's total tyranny and it's going to be a process of bankrupting the economy and a process
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:11.880]  of the military quelling riots in detroit or la and then well a lot of you idiots were against
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:18.040]  troops on the streets but look what they did after that riot they went into a good job and the troops
[1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:25.560]  will do a good job and then it sets the precedent and now you're sold on it so a lot of people think
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:31.480]  we're going to see instant martial law and checkpoints and alex jones being arrested no it'll
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:39.880]  just be continual collapse of society incrementally and then maybe suddenly alex can't fly anymore you
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:48.200]  can't fly anymore uh i'm bankrupt i've got to try to go get on the government teat uh if i try to
[1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:56.040]  go out and live on a farm or a ranch the economy the economy will be so imploded and there'll be so
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:04.120]  many rules and animal id and premises id that i won't be able to even be self-sufficient
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:09.800]  and then the bureaucrats will come and say all right we're taking over your land we run it now
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.880]  but you're allowed to stay on part of your land as long as you work for us this is what it is to
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:21.080]  be a slave so all these good old boys are like waiting in bunkers for the war to start the war
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:25.160]  is going on in the city councils and the county commissioners and the state houses and the federal
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:30.760]  government everybody needs to get out go public speak out get involved point out the criminals
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:37.960]  in government point out the private fellow reserve so that as the tyranny comes down people know who
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:43.560]  the enemy is instead most patriots are just buying ammo and guns getting ready to go out and have
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:50.200]  shoot you know shoot shoot them up for the police that'll do nothing to the bankers they actually
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:58.120]  hope that happens we need to take our government back i'll talk more about this before the show ends
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:03.880]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:08.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:13.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:18.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:23.960]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:29.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:33.880]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:39.240]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:43.720]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:49.560]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's
[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:55.720]  mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:06.680]  1-877-327-0365 from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:11.320]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:29.720]  know this government run health care is illegal it's unamerican it's anti constitution but so
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:35.800]  is warrantless wiretapping by the nsa against the american people so is face scanning and license
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:43.000]  plate scanning cameras on street corners the tsa and federal government putting in 214 body
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:50.200]  scanners at 214 airports more than 214 but at 214 airports putting in these systems that record
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:57.080]  your your your your bare naked body on hard drives you put your children through it it's all part of
[1:06:57.080 --> 1:07:03.800]  humiliation all part of training you to submit that's all unconstitutional what some of you fake
[1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:09.480]  law and order conservatives that think nazi germany's conservative and good that think preemptive
[1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:13.320]  war is good you don't like the chickens coming home to roast you don't want to live in the
[1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:18.600]  soviet union you don't want to live in a fascist communist system it's all the same command and
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:25.320]  control cops in black uniforms cameras everywhere we know what tyranny is you think the death of

[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:12.360]  know that things are desperately wrong but five years in prison and two hundred fifty thousand
[1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:20.280]  dollar fine if you don't go out and buy insurance on top of a two point five to five percent tax
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:25.720]  so they take money out of your check and make you go get insurance i mean you gotta love this

[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:58.920]  for the american people they'll go along with it thinking it's for foreigners then we're going to
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:04.120]  use phony environmentalism to come in and take all their paycheck and then when they rebel
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.840]  we're going to call them terrorist we're going to ban free speech only have free speech zones
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:13.400]  we're going to have police dogs attack peaceful people at protest and we're going to make these
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:17.480]  people our slaves and you know what they've done it and the american people have bowed down and

[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:28.360]  that i need to go over here i thought i would just recap this for everyone
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:38.680]  Pelosi buy a $15,000 policy or go to jail this was written on friday afternoon
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:44.840]  but up on the ways and means committee ranking member of the house ways and means committee
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:52.680]  dav camp released a letter from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation confirming that the
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:58.280]  failure to comply with the individual mandate to buy health insurance contained in the Pelosi
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:06.600]  healthcare bill hr 3962 as amended could land people in jail the jct letter makes clear that
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:15.000]  americans who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage and who choose not to pay
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:22.600]  the bills new individual mandate tax generate 2.5 of the income are subject to numerous civil
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:28.280]  and criminal penalties including criminal fines above the $250,000 and imprisonment
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:36.040]  of up to five years in response to the jct letter camp says this is the ultimate example of the
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:43.480]  democrats contained and controlled command and control system of governing by what we tell you
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:49.400]  or go to jail again in response to the jct letter camp said this is the ultimate example of the
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:55.720]  democrats command and control style of governing by what we tell you to or go to jail it is outrageous
[1:38:55.720 --> 1:39:02.600]  and it should be stopped immediately key excerpts from the jct letter appeared below
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:09.160]  hr 3962 provides an individual or husband and wife in the case of a joint return
[1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:13.640]  who does not at any time during the taxable year maintain acceptable health insurance coverage
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:20.680]  for himself or the of each of his or hers qualifying children is subject to an additional tax
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:26.680]  if the government determines that the taxpayers unpaid tax liability results from willful behavior
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:32.680]  the following penalties could apply page two criminal penalties process this is from the bill
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:37.880]  prosecution is authorized under the code for a variety of offenses depending on the level
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:45.000]  of the non-compliance the following penalties could apply to the individual section 7203
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:52.680]  misdemeanor willful failure to pay is punishable by fine of up to 25 000 and or imprisonment of
[1:39:52.680 --> 1:40:01.320]  up to one year section 7201 felony willful invasion is punishable by fine of up to 250 000
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:09.000]  dollars and or imprisonment of up to five years when confronted with the same issue during this
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:14.760]  consideration of similar individual mandated tax the senate finance committee worked on the
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:20.360]  bipartisan basis to include languages in the bill that shielded americans from civil liberties
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:28.280]  or criminal penalties however polosi strips that out and now it includes a $250 000 fine in five years
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:36.600]  in jail but that's only the tip of the iceberg it does have the rationing boards just like europe
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:45.560]  england and canada dude it has it all and you know there's a whole another question here
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:53.560]  here if you make a blue collar or lower middle class wage they only take 2.5 out of your check
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:41:02.520]  and then make you go out and pay for insurance but they just take money for the uninsurable
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:09.320]  so a new tax on top of social security and federal withholding and all the other taxes
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:19.320]  and state taxes and property taxes and school taxes and all these taxes and the carbon taxes
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.920]  they've passed from the house now going to the senate it's out of the senate committee could pass
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:40.040]  any day we have all of this going on we have all of this happening we have all of this developing
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:50.600]  and on top of it they'll put you in jail if you don't do it this is government forcing you to do
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:55.400]  what they say this is government as soon as it gets control of health care and as soon as they
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:42:01.560]  have control of taking money out of your paycheck which which all these companies do now they can
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:08.760]  do whatever they want social control oh you got bad credit you can't fly oh government doesn't
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:13.160]  like you you can't buy a gun now we don't have to convict you we don't have to prove you've
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:19.640]  done something wrong we're just going to uh say you can't fly or you can't have a job because the
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:25.240]  government says you're not in good standing with them no judge no jury this is the essence
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:29.000]  of the new tyranny we're under in fact do we have that obama clip that i mentioned earlier
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:35.800]  there's clip after clip where he says we're going to run the oil companies
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:41.880]  well he works for the oil companies that the oil companies through him are going to run the coal
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:47.320]  companies out of business because i want to point out the oil companies have financed the global
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:52.840]  carbon tax legislation and even Dennis Kucinich admitted last week of biggest liberal in congress
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:57.720]  that the health care bill was a bailout for the insurance companies they wrote it

[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:25.960]  broadcasting network network so here is president obama being asked about the greenhouse gas tax
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:32.120]  to run the coal companies out of business all that's coming out of the top of a coal stack
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:37.960]  under federal law they have sensors on them wired to the federal government they have scrubbers all
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:45.640]  that comes out as water vapor but the the media always goes out and aims their cameras at stacks
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:52.760]  in the winter because then the hot air coming out looks like smoke there's a bunch of buildings around
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:57.560]  me a bunch of government buildings and industrial buildings where i'm in in austin texas and you
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:03.240]  walk out on a cold night i mean they're just smoking everywhere and you can aim a camera at
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:08.040]  that show it to adults and they'll call for banning it doesn't matter that it's water vapor
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:16.120]  and the oil companies really stand again by putting some of the coal companies out of business
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:21.240]  and that's why the big oil companies on record are the number one financers of the greenhouse
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:28.600]  gas tax initiative just like health care in fact people won't believe me google denise kasinich
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:37.240]  health care bill bailout for insurance companies you can even find his video clip of that raw story
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:42.040]  others reported it kasinich will tell the truth i don't agree with a lot of his policies but at
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:47.560]  least he had them for scamming people that all these idiots think they're beating the rich guys
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:53.240]  and beating the insurance companies the insurance companies are going to get liability protection
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:49:01.000]  now for not giving you service nobody got turned away with health care now you will be turned away
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  but you know what you got to experience it first you got to be told 16 18 20 months for brain
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.440]  surgery you you got to learn for yourselves look the government puts fluoride in the water that
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:17.640]  causes bone cancer and brain damage they don't want you to be healthy they don't want you to
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:23.080]  have good health care they're taking your health care away stupid for those of you out there that
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:29.160]  bought into this i know but you know most americans are actually smart and awake and don't want this
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:35.880]  but we can't stop them because they own both parties and when you put republicans in a year
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:41.000]  in the off-year elections it won't matter they'll continue until you really get angry
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.960]  and say no more of your new world order here here's obama being asked about this woman's like all
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:53.960]  the science shows she states that lie that the carbon dioxide's deadly yes carbon dioxide's
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:59.080]  deadly poison man you're right we're gonna shut down the the evil coal plants that give us 51
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:05.160]  percent of our power oh wonderful that'll bankrupt any family that wasn't already bankrupt oh goody
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:12.200]  because i'm a reckless control freak liberal vandal because i'm a hateful degenerate chicken
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:21.560]  neck wearing patchouli listen to it i've already done it um back it up i want to hear the question
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:37.800]  i voted against the i want i want folks to hear the question here go ahead and play it
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:44.280]  now all the scientific evidence points to cold being dirtier than pretty much anything else
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:48.440]  so how are you going to square your support for coal within the global world
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:55.800]  well i've already i've already done it um you know i voted against the clear skies bill
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:51:02.440]  in fact i was the deciding vote despite the fact that i'm a coal state and that half of my state
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:07.800]  thought i'd thoroughly betrayed them because i think clean air is critical and global warming
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:17.480]  is critical but this notion of no coal i think is an illusion because the the fact of the matter is
[1:51:17.480 --> 1:51:23.640]  is that right now we are getting a lot of our energy from coal and china is building this
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:29.960]  coal powered plant once a week so what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:39.080]  use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon and you know how can we sequester that
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:48.280]  carbon and capture it if we can't then you know we're going to still be working on alternatives but
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:59.080]  let me sort of describe my can't stand listening to him he's such a liar keep keep playing and
[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:03.560]  i'll be able to hear the part cap and trade system in place that is more that is as aggressive
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:07.560]  if not more aggressive than anybody else's out there i was the first call for a hundred percent
[1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:14.760]  auction on the cap and trade system which means that every unit of carbon or greenhouse gases
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:21.720]  was emitted would be charged to the polluter you hear that will create a market in which
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:28.760]  hit pause whatever technology think of the ultimate level of this scam the average human puts off
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:34.920]  five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide a day plants breathe it and they they've now listed
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:42.760]  it as a toxic waste this is a tax on you carbon dioxide is good polar bears can swim the arctic
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:47.960]  isn't melting but they show you a satellite shot of the arctic in the summer yes it gets smaller in
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:53.480]  the summer they just talk to you like your morons folks and you buy it and so these criminals go
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:58.680]  well why not here play more of him play more of him these are out there to be presented whatever
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:04.760]  power plants that are being built that they would have to meet those the rigors of that market and
[1:53:04.760 --> 1:53:11.800]  the ratcheted down caps that are placed imposed every year so if somebody wants to build a coal
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:17.720]  fire plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:24.040]  sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted okay that will also generate billions of
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:29.000]  dollars that we can invest in solar okay thank you yeah you can give it to you thank you criminal
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:35.640]  again it allows this select group to decide who can have a business who can't and they list carbon
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:40.120]  dioxide is poison now i had four of these clips i wanted to play today i'm only gonna play one
[1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:46.120]  because of time i gotta get more hours on the sunday show but then my wife's like i need to
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:54.840]  work less which is true but then i get in here and it's like there's so much to cover
[1:53:54.840 --> 1:54:03.160]  every day or two on cnbc and cbs and abc they just admit oh yes a global government is now here
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:07.080]  and world government is now here and we're going to pay our carbon taxes to private banks
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:12.360]  and it's a global government and ban kai moon the head of the un rights editorials and al gore
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:16.680]  calls for world government and the pope calls for world government and everybody's calling for
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:21.400]  world government unelected unaccountable i have the treaty right here in front of me framework
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:29.400]  convention on climate change then separately there's articles attacking alex jones every day
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:33.960]  saying i'm insane none of this exists that's how dumb they think you are they're admitting
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:38.280]  they're setting it up and saying it's good but then when i say uh i don't want to be a slave
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:46.280]  shut up it doesn't exist crazy man and then yuppies only care about what's cool oh well you
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:51.720]  say it's not cool to admit there's a world government well then there's not one oh and
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:56.680]  there's no carbon tax here let me give you the carbon tax check oh i have to pay that tax but
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:01.880]  it doesn't exist oh okay i mean it's like mass mental illness it's like nazis that live next door
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:07.800]  to death camps after the war we're denying they live next to death camps you know it's just total
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:13.160]  la la land with you people it's like people 20 years ago saying cigarettes didn't give you a lung
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:18.920]  cancer yes it does mercury and shots brain damages kids and yes it's still in the shots
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:24.520]  i can't believe the media lies and says it's not in there you can go to the incertainry it's in there
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:31.240]  they lie about everything play the cnbc clip from yesterday with them talking about world
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:38.040]  government here it is capital partners saying well this live out of the seattle of washington
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:42.600]  uh didn't you guys are uh a hedge fund in which you guys basically do is uh you try and catch
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:47.960]  breaks either the up or downside uh apparently with oil also with gold you've done the timing
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:54.120]  for you right god and just as it started to uh oil up past 75 gold past a thousand are you
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:56:02.280]  going to sit on those positions next yeah for sure yeah there's this is this is you know this is
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:07.720]  i mean you can think a lot about it and you can you know you know you know one day and and you
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:13.000]  know have all these vacillations psychologically but you know this is the time to you know to
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  play ping-pong to you know pick up on you know get involved in model making or or uh or something
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:26.120]  ridiculous i mean it this is the time where you make money where the trend develops and so
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:31.240]  there's really not a lot to do with it i mean oil looks higher gold looks higher currencies
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:35.640]  look weaker all for the reasons that we talked about before i mean that you've got huge wage
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:41.480]  disparities i don't know how that inevitably resolves itself um it may resolve itself in
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:47.560]  some type of a of a global currency crisis and then if the global currency crisis unfolds then
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:55.880]  inevitably you get uh i guess an alignment under a global world government uh a new global currency
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:57:03.320]  um and a new world order uh so we may be moving towards that talk to us a little bit more about
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:11.080]  this uh currency crisis you see uh erupting about what's gonna happen to the i have four clips of
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:21.480]  the news announcing one world government see when we had a chance to stop it when we had a chance to
[1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:29.720]  stop all of this they denied it when you could have gotten up and stopped them now they got the
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:35.400]  voting machines rigged the north coms in place they've already killed the dollar they're already
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:40.360]  spiking your water with brain damage chemicals so your a lot of you are just zombies you can't even
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:46.120]  understand me right now and you know they think they've got us they think it's a big sick joke
