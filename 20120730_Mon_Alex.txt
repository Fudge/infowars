[00:30.120 --> 00:36.360]  halfway into the year this incredible final hours of july here in the next two days we're
[00:36.360 --> 00:41.240]  going to be here for the next three hours larry pratt was on the nightly news last friday
[00:41.240 --> 00:48.400]  and said yeah a lot of evidence that the shooting in colorado was an inside job and you noticed
[00:48.400 --> 00:53.800]  that the mainstream corporate media the dying dinosaur decepticon media hasn't even attacked
[00:53.800 --> 01:00.040]  him for that because they don't want people looking at that like it was admitted a week
[01:00.040 --> 01:07.120]  ago that the supposed shooter mr the ronald mcdonald patsey the as he's known by our
[01:07.120 --> 01:16.120]  listeners who's obviously drugged out of his gourd when he's in court it came out that
[01:16.120 --> 01:23.520]  well basically we're going to be breaking it all down here today with larry pratt all
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.960]  the different inconsistencies the issues with it but that's not going to be the main reason
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.020]  larry pratt joins us coming up today we're going to be getting into something that's
[01:34.020 --> 01:40.600]  getting zero coverage basically i mean it's in a few newspapers but it it should be getting
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.440]  massive coverage democratic senators offer gun control amendment for cyber security bill
[01:46.440 --> 01:55.000]  that's the hill newspaper and i've got a copy of the bill here with me s 32 the cyber security
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.120]  bill that's very close to passing and the usual suspect chuckie schumer who wants us
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.400]  all to live in the type of hell that he's in control of with his armed guards with everybody
[02:05.400 --> 02:12.640]  else disarmed there in the nanny state of new york well now chuckie schumer has introduced
[02:12.640 --> 02:19.240]  this and well it says it will ban all clips ten rounds and above and i don't mean for
[02:19.240 --> 02:25.880]  manufacturer sale it says from possession and it describes banning devices that can
[02:25.880 --> 02:31.600]  take the clips so that's most guns and we saw the atf last year come out with a rule
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.200]  making without law and said we think we'll ban most shotguns over 60% if they can take
[02:37.200 --> 02:43.240]  a clip or barrel and of course you know scalia has said well it's reasonable yeah you got
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.880]  a second amendment basically a right to turn those guns in that's what they said four years
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.880]  ago i warned everybody about the supreme court ruling i said hey it says right here you got
[02:51.880 --> 02:56.600]  a right but to take and restrict it you know that there can be reasonable restrictions
[02:56.600 --> 03:01.520]  as the government arms and the teeth against us and we got bill crystal we've got rupert
[03:01.520 --> 03:07.560]  murdoch the list goes on and on saying yeah it's reasonable you don't need semi auto
[03:07.560 --> 03:10.920]  you don't need that and then michael moors like it ban everything down the flint locks
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.360]  and bloomberg goes further he says no just have the police stand down so we're going
[03:15.360 --> 03:22.200]  to spend a lot of time on this today and we're going to have larry pratt popping in at the
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.640]  start of the third hour today and then we have a fellow who's done reporting force in
[03:27.640 --> 03:35.840]  the past who was in chicago and showed tsa on the streets and you know they're at the
[03:35.840 --> 03:41.200]  bus terminal and the train stations they're all over the country now and it went on the
[03:41.200 --> 03:47.040]  web it got quite a bit of attention and so the next time he was there they came to him
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.280]  when he was at a snack shop a little little restaurant there at the subway I guess and
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.320]  threatened him with terrorism they said it's terrorism to film us they said I've got the
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.520]  first amendment and they kind of scurry off after a while after threatening him but this
[04:01.520 --> 04:08.680]  is the new America and we are in the hands of just lawless out of control miscreants
[04:08.680 --> 04:14.280]  who lust after power because they're nobodies they have no success no one wants to associate
[04:14.280 --> 04:21.600]  with them this is the government class this is a bunch of failures telling us to salute

[09:11.960 --> 09:16.840]  in your underwear they are doing it for your safety when they put cancer viruses in your
[09:16.840 --> 09:22.000]  vaccines it's for your safety when they nerve gas our own troops and thousands of tests

[10:03.080 --> 10:14.360]  features it's in the features so this isn't it it's it's it's the un treaty would use
[10:14.360 --> 10:18.320]  foreign troops inside america we covered it friday but i want to cover it more today it's
[10:18.320 --> 10:28.640]  red linked in the tiles that's the article that's it all right continuing here ladies
[10:28.640 --> 10:34.760]  and gentlemen with the news you know i'm going to get into the whole gun situation because
[10:34.760 --> 10:40.080]  it's dire straits they've come out and announced that how guns want on the cover of time i
[10:40.080 --> 10:45.880]  talked a lot about this yesterday on the sunday show this signals a major counter offensive
[10:45.880 --> 10:51.360]  against us so get ready and they will try to march the police out to confiscate the guns
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.680]  and i think they can get away with it and basically start a civil war in this country
[10:57.680 --> 11:06.720]  now i want to go over the other news before i get into all of this incredibly important
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.080]  information you know i heard local talk radio this morning you're basically saying oh yeah
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.280]  i guess we're gonna have to have security in the theaters now because of the epidemic
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.000]  of shootings and i tried to call into the show to say you know the justice department
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.840]  says there's been a zero point one percent increase since nineteen ninety two in in twenty
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.400]  years a zero point one percent increase in shootings of more than five people at one
[11:30.400 --> 11:37.120]  time so basically it's flat they're actually gone down some in the mid two thousand i follow
[11:37.120 --> 11:43.960]  those numbers they said no no thanks we don't want to hear that they were also bumbling
[11:43.960 --> 11:51.520]  around talking about you know was this guy on socket tropics or not well the supposed
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.320]  shooter who everybody's already convicted mr ronald mcdonald it's come out that he was
[11:57.320 --> 12:04.400]  on a bunch of drugs that's been in the denver post it's been in the daily mail he had a
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.520]  former head air force psychiatrist the head of the entire san antonio operation before
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.600]  she went to work there at the facility where he was at there in denver at that college she
[12:15.600 --> 12:20.360]  had been reprimanded for over prescribing and improperly prescribing psychotropic and
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.160]  anti psychotics but you can never blame that even though it's the case in almost every
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.280]  case you know the guy that just shot a cop for no reason in a walmart here in austin i
[12:29.280 --> 12:36.680]  said he'll be on psychotropic and it came out he was a sergeant bales shooting all the
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.080]  people turned out he was under psychiatric care had part of his foot blown off didn't
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.200]  want to go back they hopped him up on a bunch of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and they
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.720]  sent him back into there not a good idea to give somebody a dream state hallucinogen
[12:48.720 --> 12:57.200]  psychotropic that's what they are they just more heavily induce you into the dream state
[12:57.200 --> 13:03.200]  that's what prozac basically feels like from people that have taken it is like you're been
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.680]  watching tv for four hours and you have that mind numbed you know feeling interface for
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.280]  the television that's what the system wants that's what they're after now here's the
[13:13.280 --> 13:20.080]  big red alert because i listened to talk radio national and local from early this morning
[13:20.080 --> 13:25.480]  and no one was talking about it it's nowhere in the news except the hill newspaper fox
[13:25.480 --> 13:32.480]  news and ap have little blurbs about it the drudge report drudge report dot com link to
[13:32.480 --> 13:39.560]  it info wars dot com link to it but it's basically getting no coverage despite that now remember
[13:39.560 --> 13:43.560]  we're conspiracy theorists to think that they might want to take our second amendment they
[13:43.560 --> 13:49.000]  have introduced legislation that bans semi auto and bans clips above 10 rounds and bans
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.680]  guns that can take clips it says devices and the clips okay i've read the bill you can
[13:55.680 --> 14:02.360]  go read the bill here is the hill newspaper democratic senators offer gun control amendment
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.560]  for cyber security bill now this has a chance of passion just like india a did and just
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.560]  like government health care did this is the season where they want to get stuff done that's
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.600]  why you've got all these top republicans coming out endorsing restricting the second amendment
[14:17.600 --> 14:20.480]  so i'm going to break all this down in about 20 minutes after i get to some of the other
[14:20.480 --> 14:26.480]  news but i've got to cover some of the other news for i get into this central issue but
[14:26.480 --> 14:32.560]  the criminal class knows that we're waking up and they're coming at us from every angle
[14:32.560 --> 14:39.520]  and that's the bottom line this again proves wherever they're in control chicago new york
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.560]  wherever this globalist mafia is in control there's a total gun ban for the citizens
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.880]  and the governing class all have semi auto full auto bodyguards paid for by taxpayers
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.680]  or there's waivers so donald trump can have guys with submachine guns but you and your
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.120]  mother your wife your daughter your son they get to get mugged raped and killed and then
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.640]  it's no big deal a lot of times it's by the police in new york the biggest street gang
[15:02.640 --> 15:09.000]  in the world who wants you to know they're a street gang and there's just constant movies
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.200]  batman spiderman you name it where we do nothing but worship the nypd well if that's the model
[15:14.200 --> 15:18.960]  of worship look out are there's some really professional good police forces in this country
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.560]  yes we haven't succumbed to total criminality yes but more and more they are totally becoming
[15:24.560 --> 15:34.120]  nothing but warlord uh systems and and and mafia jokes and america knows that yes we
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.800]  are winning the gun debate it's true what time magazine says with har we're winning
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.920]  the hearts and minds but the system doesn't care that's the bad news they're going ahead
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.600]  with all this so i'm going to i'm already starting to cover this the point is there is legislation
[15:46.600 --> 15:55.280]  introduced the cyber security bill that guts the internet free speech and the rest of it
[15:55.280 --> 16:02.240]  that says it wants reasonable gun control and it says s a 2575 would make it illegal
[16:02.240 --> 16:08.200]  to transfer possess possess large capacity feeding devices such as gun magazines belts
[16:08.200 --> 16:16.040]  feed straps and drums of more than 10 rounds of ammunition there you go and i've read the
[16:16.040 --> 16:21.160]  bill itself no one's even picking up on this the way i read it is that it bans just like
[16:21.160 --> 16:26.520]  the atf want to do last year guns that could take quote improvise if you could build something
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.720]  it's banned basically bottom loading side loading uh you know this is taking you to bolt action
[16:31.720 --> 16:40.480]  and single shot i'm going to say that again they're telling you don't worry it's a conspiracy
[16:40.480 --> 16:44.400]  theory we don't want your guns you see that all the time don't run we are your friends
[16:44.400 --> 16:51.080]  no this is not an assault ten offensively it's the chinese new year uh you know everybody's
[16:51.080 --> 16:55.080]  fine boom they launched the attack and they broadcast this is not an attack a lot of people
[16:55.080 --> 16:58.240]  just stood there while they were being you know bad edited point blank range because it was
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.280]  a holiday couldn't be an attack and again this really works on people they announce everywhere
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.120]  oh it's ridiculous i mean i saw dozens of articles last week washington post you name
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.880]  it there's no we don't want your guns obama isn't going to call for it meanwhile all his
[17:11.880 --> 17:16.520]  surrogates were and he came out and said i'm not calling to control your guns see it's
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.880]  all mind games you got a second amendment you got a right to anything that didn't send
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.480]  me out of what michael more say he said ban it down to flintlocks what does bloomberg
[17:26.480 --> 17:32.560]  say ban them all what is bill crystal say on fox ban everything semi auto what does
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.960]  river murdoch say hey you don't need semi auto was meant romney said in the past folks
[17:36.960 --> 17:44.880]  it's a talking point they mean business business business business and you're like well america
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.320]  won't turn them in you know people are going to fight back that's the plan they're looking
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.800]  at it and they're gazing the police within essay technology spying on them tracking them
[17:54.800 --> 17:59.840]  they've got their agents everywhere they're gauging the the the public sample rate they
[17:59.840 --> 18:04.280]  admit they're doing this spying on everything this is about those aggregates to not just
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.640]  spying on one person they want to be able to look at whole movements and ideas and graphs
[18:08.640 --> 18:15.880]  they can drill down into this is all admitted makes you know google analytics look like a
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.080]  toy because it is this the nsa toy they've given the public they have profiles on each

[24:27.040 --> 24:31.040]  the new world order
[24:31.040 --> 24:41.240]  they are completely ruthless and they see all of us as animals as mindless prey who
[24:41.240 --> 24:49.760]  are here to be lied to sucked off of run over and finally killed they've hardened their
[24:49.760 --> 24:57.840]  heart against us and it's time to admit how much trouble this country and the world is
[24:57.840 --> 25:03.160]  if we have any hope of defeating these people now they are losing the moral authority rapidly
[25:03.160 --> 25:07.160]  and that's what makes them so dangerous they realize they've reached the tipping point
[25:07.160 --> 25:13.240]  where the entire public is not becoming conservative because that's a catch all name but are becoming
[25:13.240 --> 25:20.040]  constitutionalist and street smart and wise the public knows you can't trust the government
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.400]  they know the government can't won't protect you that's why gun sales were in all time
[25:24.400 --> 25:32.760]  high last month before this month's staged event and now the gun sales have doubled
[25:32.760 --> 25:40.760]  in the week after the polls I covered this yesterday got even more pro gun nationwide
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.240]  after the shooting look it doesn't matter how much stuff you stage don't you get it
[25:45.240 --> 25:53.760]  criminals we know who you are we see you we see you we've caught you the con games don't
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.520]  work anymore and you can point at 30 40% of people that don't know their name or which
[25:58.520 --> 26:05.320]  end is up that are TV heads we're not talking about the drooling group okay a large portion
[26:05.320 --> 26:12.360]  of the American people becoming a majority is somewhat awake the numbers show it across
[26:12.360 --> 26:15.320]  the board that's why you're on the cover I just got chills that's why you're on the
[26:15.320 --> 26:22.600]  cover of Time Magazine saying we've won how guns won why Americans have turned against
[26:22.600 --> 26:28.000]  gun control by Jill Klein but Joe has got a plan to get our guns let me tell you just
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.360]  because hey the Bolsheviks weren't popular when they took over in 1917 they might have
[26:33.360 --> 26:40.520]  maybe 10% support they didn't care they were willing to take over they were willing okay
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.880]  but now these type of folks are in control of the government and so what can they do
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.360]  they can rob and destroy the economy they can shut down our power plants nationwide
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.360]  they can attack families everywhere they can raise all these taxes they can pass laws with
[26:54.360 --> 26:58.560]  tax incentives to move stuff offshore they can pay 22 billion dollars to ship General
[26:58.560 --> 27:07.360]  Motors to China they're doing everything they can to wreck this country that's the bad news
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.640]  we're awake to them and they're like oh you're awake and gonna kick us out we're gonna burn
[27:13.640 --> 27:17.160]  your country down and here's the deal they were already busy burning it down but now
[27:17.160 --> 27:21.360]  they've just started throwing gasoline on it because they want to make you totally dependent
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.440]  on them they're in a race that's why in Oregon they've announced you can't have your own garden
[27:25.440 --> 27:31.040]  and use rainwater that belongs to the government they're announcing horticulture is illegal
[27:31.040 --> 27:36.640]  you're like really yeah look it up it's mainstream news I'm telling you folks it's gonna the
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.640]  tyrants as they know that they're about to be overthrown are gonna get crazier and more
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.480]  in your face like a pimp punching us in the nose going you're gonna get out there and
[27:46.480 --> 27:52.640]  do what I say do you understand and we're like no we don't go ahead and call us terrorists
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.920]  we know who the real terrorists are it's you when the TSA marches up on the streets of
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.280]  Chicago or LA and says turn your cameras off or you're a terrorist and then have the nerve
[28:04.280 --> 28:08.480]  to find out who the reporter is once it goes on the web and come find them we've got the
[28:08.480 --> 28:14.640]  reporter on the last 30 minutes in Chicago he got it on tape coming up threatening him
[28:14.640 --> 28:20.240]  what happened to Luke Radowski so many years ago one of our great you know reporters at
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.600]  the time what happened to him he's out in front of building seven protesting the fact
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.200]  that it was clearly controlled demolition and these security guards come over across the
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.400]  street and Luke even jumped through hoops to get his little permit and they go you need
[28:33.400 --> 28:38.360]  to get you out of here it's not bad gonna happen to you you're gonna say you're terrorist
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.720]  literally like the godfather and you're gonna be 30 days in the hole I know you're not a
[28:42.720 --> 28:49.160]  terrorist but I'm gonna say you're camera and stuff so bomb actually laugh like that
[28:49.160 --> 28:56.800]  while smoking a pipe about 30 cops show up the the Larry Silverstein security detail
[28:56.800 --> 29:02.640]  that look like central casting literally out of Sopranos because I think the cameras
[29:02.640 --> 29:08.320]  a bomb and they you know I mean like a Bugs Bunny cartoon with gangsters you know those
[29:08.320 --> 29:11.920]  if the Bugs Bunny characters where he's fighting the gangsters literally talking like that
[29:11.920 --> 29:19.040]  it's in my film truth rising and the police grab Luke's camera now they didn't get the
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.280]  other camera across the street and they and they gave a camera back after he agreed to
[29:23.280 --> 29:29.880]  leave and the cops said we're gonna put you in jail for terrorism means like but I'm not
[29:29.880 --> 29:36.240]  terrorist they go we know but it's our city now you understand see they did 911 folks

[33:32.240 --> 33:38.320]  and then after i go through some of the headlines we're gonna open the phones up but i specifically
[33:38.320 --> 33:43.080]  want to hear from you are you hearing other talk radio or national news talk about they're
[33:43.080 --> 33:47.520]  very close to passing the cyber security act they've been trying to pass for several years
[33:47.520 --> 33:53.080]  and it's got a band of all high capacity magazines the possession of them and the way i read
[33:53.080 --> 34:00.480]  the bill it could be interpreted in the rulemaking of the atf the guns that take the mags i mean
[34:00.480 --> 34:07.680]  this is in the hill newspaper ap a few others but that's it and i listen to talk radio
[34:07.680 --> 34:14.080]  and it's it's really bizarre how these people get their talking points i guess from rupert
[34:14.080 --> 34:18.640]  murdoch and bill crystal and uh scalia because they're suddenly because it's not democrats
[34:18.640 --> 34:24.240]  calling for gun control on the news it's the republicans going well yeah you could restrict
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.000]  guns come on let's bet you don't need semi auto for duck hunting ban it it's time to turn them in
[34:31.280 --> 34:35.120]  and the talk show hosts go oh well that's a change in the weather vein i better just go
[34:35.120 --> 34:42.000]  ahead and see it's that wild card of suddenly having the people they love oh bill crystals
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.040]  my friend oh rupert murdoch's my friend oh mit romney yeah he wanted to ban all semi autos
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.520]  as governor massachusetts but it's okay i'm gonna be getting into that after we get to your calls
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.960]  i'm gonna get into the the details of it because i want to just give a hardcore focus like 10 minute
[34:56.960 --> 35:05.440]  report i'll do it and say 10 10 after so uh next hour because there's a bunch of it i want to go
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.360]  over i want to play this galea clip oh there's a whole bunch of them i got to get it all together
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.120]  for the nightly news too all the clips of them calling to turn our guns in and how great it is
[35:13.120 --> 35:20.640]  and cutting in bill crystals comments and uh the comments by rupert murdoch with
[35:20.640 --> 35:26.560]  michael moore and bloomberg on pierce morgan
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.800]  i mean it's exactly the same thread and it really shows us how much trouble we're in
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.720]  it's because america's waking up it's because we're becoming a total gun culture that they're
[35:40.720 --> 35:47.520]  hyping the end of the world statistically and kurt did a story um yesterday titled establishment
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.960]  circles the wagons on gun control and ended he found the justice department numbers since 1992
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.520]  guess how much of an increase there's been in mass shootings in five or more people involved
[35:57.520 --> 36:06.080]  guess how much zero point one zero point one so there has been an increase zero point one
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.080]  and that's with advertising it and all the shoot them up games and of course this guy was on a
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.840]  bunch of drugs and he was going to some weird top air force scientist and he was in a brain program
[36:15.840 --> 36:19.360]  i mean i've seen this over and over again that's why even larry pratt's like yeah it's probably
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.720]  staged of course it is the guy's so drugged up he can't even talk and i said i get to the other
[36:24.720 --> 36:33.520]  news it's just incredible here's the toll free number 800 2599231 is anybody concerned that
[36:34.480 --> 36:40.960]  they've introduced legislation to ban most guns and magazines and that the un zone official treaty
[36:40.960 --> 36:47.520]  said in article 15 we will we will aid other states in their internal gun confiscation i mean
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.920]  this is big that they're admitting they're going to do internal gun confiscation they're admitting
[36:53.920 --> 36:58.880]  that they want to ban our guns in this bill they're out there saying ban everything down to flint
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.040]  locks and they're and the conservatives the so-called concern now we're just going to ban
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.640]  semi-auto not flint not down to flint locks and and this article talks about how the gun
[37:08.640 --> 37:13.440]  powders really explosives and we need to get rid of regular you know smokeless gunpowder i mean
[37:13.440 --> 37:21.280]  it is just an all-out hysteria while here's the key while the power structure arms to the teeth
[37:22.000 --> 37:33.360]  against us we have the power structure arming to the teeth against us with high-tech weapons
[37:33.360 --> 37:38.400]  i mean i saw an article two weeks ago with the armies deploying on the streets with a plasma
[37:38.400 --> 37:44.320]  laser beam that fires a laser beam at you that can burn you but then through the laser beam
[37:44.320 --> 37:51.040]  it's a particle weapon they conduct a lightning bolt and just blow you to pieces literally don't

[44:34.320 --> 44:38.720]  i remember when he brought this up about boys talent later it came out it was true and
[44:38.720 --> 44:42.800]  and penn state and the football program i was like let's stop right there because that hadn't
[44:42.800 --> 44:48.160]  been in court yet but and everybody pointed out and found those interviews folks this has been
[44:48.160 --> 44:53.040]  going on of course local news reports that's the word is that sandusky was supplying little kids
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.520]  really i mean he's raping them at high noon on you know monday tuesday wednesday friday mornings
[44:59.520 --> 45:06.480]  and he's he's raping little kids in the showers with people milling around i mean this is a giant
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.960]  nest of scum uh i told you paterno knew and of course it came out he knew of course he knew i
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.360]  mean i could take one a look at that guy and it makes my skin crawl don't you people have any
[45:17.360 --> 45:24.400]  discernment i mean you know you don't just judge a book off its cover it's the it's the
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.920]  it's a spiritual thing you can literally just see them i mean look at sandusky he looks like
[45:29.920 --> 45:38.640]  like a demonic ferret or a chipmunk or something and and and and you know oh but i was wrong to
[45:38.640 --> 45:44.000]  say jopar whatever stupid name was the stupid nickname they took down the statue didn't they
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.720]  i was right you were wrong i was right you were wrong okay and it didn't about me being right
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.560]  here okay but i mean you know outside bohemian grove repeatedly little kids get kidnapped and
[45:54.560 --> 46:02.000]  killed and dumped out there holly claus you name it all all the time i i you see little kids getting
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.120]  grabbed and picked up and i mean folks they're getting taken nine times out of ten for these people
[46:07.120 --> 46:12.400]  to literally rape the living daylights out of them and torture them for quite a period of time okay
[46:13.200 --> 46:17.040]  doesn't just stop with them raping little kids they like to torture the living daylights out of
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.120]  them okay that's who runs your government just get that straight and get that through your head
[46:21.120 --> 46:24.160]  and understand that real good and let that burn in and as soon as they get their guns they're
[46:24.160 --> 46:29.120]  going to turn hell loose on us texas rangers tried to stop the public rape rooms at the texas youth
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.840]  commission where they were at selling the kids the judges and elitists would come down and pick
[46:33.840 --> 46:40.240]  which kid they wanted out of the different deals they had gladiatorial fights paying tickets texas
[46:40.240 --> 46:45.760]  rangers tried to stop it they got shut down and you know what the commission got taken over
[46:46.320 --> 46:51.040]  by the very same crew and it's business as usual nothing's going to stop you're not going to stop
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.600]  these people now that they're empowering and control from having their way with your children
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.680]  until they're fully removed do you know about cps you know what a bunch of pedophiles they are
[47:02.320 --> 47:08.800]  again our so-called guardians are a bunch of scum and until we come right out with it and
[47:08.800 --> 47:16.960]  admit how much trouble we're in it's over no future okay i've now covered one one little one
[47:16.960 --> 47:28.000]  little area of news here where should i start i mean i mean there's just so much here that it
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.920]  makes my head spin oh looky here this is out of the new american uh fluoride lowers iq and kids
[47:35.920 --> 47:40.480]  new study shows yeah i mean what are there hundreds of studies literally a review of
[47:40.480 --> 47:44.960]  some two dozen studies by harvard university researchers oh it's just harvard this month
[47:44.960 --> 47:49.600]  that appeared reviewed federally federal journals suggested fluoride added to water supplies
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.320]  significantly decreases the iq of children uh yeah that's why every store you go to they got
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.240]  bottle water it says extra fluoride for kids that's why the kids you know it's tastes like bubble
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.800]  gum the toothpaste is brand i mean there's a reason the public's mentally dumbed down i mean
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.920]  this was not they didn't put it in the water at the at the gulags under linen and stalin and then
[48:09.920 --> 48:21.920]  hitler because they wanted to you know take care of the inmates fluoride lowers iqs and kids new
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.960]  study shows but they're gonna keep doing it and if you go to your city council and say i want this
[48:26.960 --> 48:33.520]  out they're gonna laugh at you until you sue them you know they're assaulting you and they're your
[48:33.520 --> 48:38.800]  family just like they want to get your kid in a room and blow their head off just like they
[48:38.800 --> 48:42.400]  wanted these people even though these people like to torture a kid for a couple months
[48:42.400 --> 48:47.040]  and just and just use them up what they call it just savagely terrorizing them and then they just
[48:47.040 --> 48:50.480]  chop them up with a meat cleaver or blow their head off and you know what i know you're not
[48:50.480 --> 48:55.440]  going to protect the children it's too scary for mainline people your mainline which means
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.240]  you're into picking up whatever uh you know the establishment says is the end thing and then
[49:00.240 --> 49:08.640]  following it even though that establishment is a bunch of psycho killers fluoride seems to
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.520]  fit in with lead mercury and other poisons that causes chemical brain damage noted senior study
[49:13.520 --> 49:21.520]  author philippe regine a professor environmental health at harvard the effect of each toxicant
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.960]  may seem small but the combined damage on the population scale can be serious especially
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.480]  because the brain power of the next generation is crucial all of us no it's not buddy boy
[49:32.480 --> 49:39.840]  they're spraying aluminum dioxide on us to make sure we can't escape they've engineered all the
[49:39.840 --> 49:47.760]  gmo crops to attack our organs disorders of the gut are running rampant everywhere i was at a
[49:47.760 --> 49:54.000]  business meeting last night at a restaurant slash bar and overheard two different people one guy
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.120]  even talked to them he's like he's like yeah can we fix this plug is there's something we can do
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.040]  with this little plug doesn't just pop out just constantly out of the thing it's just driving me
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.720]  i mean it's it just totally breaks my train of thought i don't know what i'm gonna do but the
[50:06.720 --> 50:15.040]  point is that this guy's like yeah i gotta leave austin texas and go back to virginia wherever it
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.320]  was my dad's dying of crones and i heard somebody else talking about somebody in their family dying
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.920]  of it it was unknown 50 years ago it just oh we're just all gonna die let a bunch of perverts
[50:25.920 --> 50:32.480]  run everything and they're not even perverts they'll have a renfield type like uh sandusky who
[50:32.480 --> 50:37.200]  actually likes to rape kids the globalists like to pull their teeth out with pliers and torture
[50:37.200 --> 50:41.360]  the hell out of them i mean that's that's really what they're into by the way i have a dungeon keeper

[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.200]  michael savage has endorsed this uh basically all the so-called conservatives got desperate as they
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.160]  realized the whole game was up because america woke up and became pro-gun so they're now flipping
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.560]  over going well it's it's pro-gun to turn your guns in and now i'm a liberal because i don't
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.080]  want to turn my guns in it did you call in about that walter or something else uh yes i did uh
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.400]  alex first-time caller long-time listener and watcher uh i was at uh chan philly you signed
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.760]  my info wars flag on the last day down there and back in june um yes as far as the uh the
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:15.120]  cyber security bill is concerned are two illustrious senators lautenberg and menendez have uh signed
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.040]  on to this bill and i sent them emails and i'm i'm totally frustrated with this whole thing
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.320]  but what i'd also like to know is what happens if they knock on my door at 3 a.m in the morning
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.840]  well they won't knock no no they'll come in and uh i mean their favorite thing is it was c s and
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.400]  shut your house on fire and they'll make some examples and you know uraw team america wins for
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.840]  the bankers i mean this is they're getting them all geared up for it they're a lot of these guys
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.880]  are looking forward to this yeah well i'm all geared up too i buy pretty to people they come in
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.960]  well here's the deal this or this is what's gonna happen if they start going into people's
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.640]  houses and shooting them up and you know going after those that don't turn them in when the order
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.280]  comes people aren't gonna wait in their houses for the police to meet you understand that right
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.320]  i do understand that i don't want to wait in my house but if they if they start this it's going
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.200]  to be really hard to get away in the car and if they have roadblocks and all kinds of contingencies
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.520]  set up to get the people so i mean you understand a roadblock would be a death trap for those trying
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.320]  to take the guns even if they've ordered the armored pillboxes oh i think so it's trying to
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.520]  be like the wild west out here or anywhere else well i mean look i don't know how many people
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.000]  study guerrilla tactics but i mean it's 101 that that if you know they try to put people in
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.760]  reeducation camps and arrest everybody folks aren't gonna just sit in their houses um they're gonna
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:42.720]  go out and the police are getting ready for this that's why they're all going to unmarks that aren't
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.160]  even marked and this is all a covert takeover by foreign banks america is being conquered right
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.520]  now this is the fall of the republic we were taken over from within and i'm reaching out to
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.920]  military and police to understand that but i mean a lot of them are just going to salute
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.280]  because the bankers use the american flag you understand that i mean a lot of them are on
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.200]  floor i just like the general public and can hardly tie their shoelaces but i'm sorry uh

[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.520]  that the green movement is just an authoritarian movement that could care less about the environment
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:34.800]  and public safety big sis is announcing drones to be used for public safety dhs spy on the sky to
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:41.920]  provide situational awareness and they've got other bizarre quotes in here about you know total
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:48.080]  awareness and all this other bizarre garbage so we're going to be breaking all of that down
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:55.040]  but paul watson just put a new article up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that really
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.880]  freaked me out we were talking early this morning he said hey what article is you want me to look
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.320]  at today and i said well what are you working on because you know most of the time he basically
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.680]  comes up with his you know his own direction but he'll ask me you know which direction we should go in
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:14.080]  and i said well i don't see any coverage other than the drudge report and info wars drudge
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.440]  report dot com info wars dot com i don't hear it on talk radio not last week not over the weekend
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:27.360]  not today where they're talking about all these top republicans saying ban semi auto weapons
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:34.960]  turn them in and we've got legislation introduced now racing through the house and senate to ban
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.120]  all clips above 10 rounds possession of them and to restrict devices guns that can take them i mean
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.440]  this is one of the biggest gun bans i've ever even heard of this is what michael more is calling for
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.840]  and i've played the clips here last week of bill crystal and and and all the rest of them saying
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.480]  you don't need semi auto let's ban them and say come on democrats we're going to support you don't
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:01.440]  back off this because the whole power structure is now showing their cards that they really fight
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.200]  with each other over power but not over the direction they want to go in i mean charlton
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.120]  heston god bless him great actor been on my show a couple times uh he supported the 67 gun control
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:19.280]  act when i first heard that i didn't believe it and somewhere years ago i found the tv ad
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.560]  i've got it somewhere here in the office we've got like huge storage rooms of tapes and stuff
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:35.920]  uh him on tv promoting the 60 the 68 gun control act not 67 and that's an example of how they use
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.040]  the people we trust most and i don't think charlton heston was a bad guy he was just
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.440]  you know being sold the idea that it was reasonable to do this no ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.640]  they want semi autos because they are what can resist a military and foreign takeover
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.240]  it's not the quote assault rifles that are being used in the crimes they've picked those because
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:03.040]  most guns are semi auto and they're calling all of those assault rifles now i was reading paul's
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.720]  article when it went up about 10 minutes ago during the last couple breaks and i was going
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.200]  through the clips i didn't know michael savage had called for banning all semi autos there's a video
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:20.560]  link an audio link do it technically it's audio put to youtube uh i mean i mean it's a lot worse
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:28.560]  than i even knew there it is michael savage calls for gun control folks i mean he was a
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.640]  beatnik in the 60s and i'm gonna get into michael savage bashing fest here but i remember him
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.560]  saying we disagreed with the government we're a 9-11 traitor you should be putting a force labor camp
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:47.200]  five years ago i remember him saying put question i certainly yeah we'll uh we'll uh play that uh
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.800]  coming up here in a little while but we've got a whole bunch of these a whole bunch of these clips
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.920]  and and see now we're going to be called the liberals and the communists because we don't
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.240]  want to turn our guns in and i'm not joking by the way about that you tell can mainline
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.080]  conservatives on fox news turn their guns in half of them will do it and again they wouldn't have
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:17.840]  come out like this on a major talking point if the system wasn't desperate and knowing they're
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.240]  getting ready to collapse everything and michael savage and all of them are showing the system
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.200]  that they go to marshal law in october launch an iran war stage a bunch of stuff that they're
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.600]  gonna tell the line when they get ready to drop the hammer folks is when you start seeing behavior
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.760]  like this now if you want to see all the video and hear all the audio and all its horror go to
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:44.320]  info wars.com why are republicans calling to disarm the american people while the federal
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.680]  government is arming itself the teeth against conservatives paul joseph watson and saying
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.480]  that we're their number one enemy real constitutionalist the recent deluge of attacks is the second
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.600]  amendment were completely predictable in the aftermath of colorado massacre but what perhaps
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.320]  wasn't so expected was the fact that a lot of them have come from so-called republicans yeah i heard
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.200]  so-called conservative talk show host this morning going yeah we may have to restrict yeah we may have
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:15.360]  to have security in the movies folks mass shootings are flat in the last 20 years they're incredibly
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.560]  rare but again they're creating this fear the tsa is now saying well we'll be in the shopping malls now
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.640]  i told you that rollout was happening they were getting ready months ago for the rollout this
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.280]  is all time just like the underwear bomber was put on the plane by the u.s. government a week
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:35.520]  before the scanners were set to roll out january 1st and actually settle the news oh they're putting
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:40.080]  them in now because of this when they started manufacturing them and put the order in 14 months
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:47.360]  before it's all scripted and but this is a big victory when they say how guns won and they
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.440]  panic at the cover of time magazine and say what are we going to do they you know they don't want
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.960]  to turn their guns in they're crazy no it's because we know you're authoritarians but now
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.360]  now the weekly standards calling for it turning your guns ban all semi-autos bill crystal
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:12.000]  michael savage bill o'reilly uh rupert murdoch scalia is like well hey you can restrict stuff if
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:21.040]  if it's scary and he lists some colony ruling about going around with a special axe for chopping
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.240]  heads off and menacing people with it you can't manage somebody with a firearm scalia you're
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.160]  a lawyer your supreme court justice you know you're lying to people you sack of trash you know full
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.000]  well those colony laws were about menacing we have the same laws today i go out in the street
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.920]  with a battle axe and and menace people and threaten them with it that's disorderly conduct
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.000]  and that's i looked it up that's what they're talking about but he's like you can't have something
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:56.720]  that's scary we have the clip we'll play it in a moment but you can read it
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.040]  although normally a line with the right to keep bare arms of the last week numerous
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.240]  self-proclaimed conservatives have proven themselves to be wolves in sheep's clothing
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.200]  well yeah george w bush tried to get the assault of its ban reauthorized and i was in
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.920]  Mcbride's gun shop talking to one of the guys who was a listener and i said yeah i can't believe
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.360]  bush is supporting it but what do you expect and the guy's like hey buddy don't you say that about
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.160]  bush and the owner comes over and goes no actually he is supporting it they're like really but still
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.880]  the guy was mad at me i i get it you don't really want the second amendment you don't really want
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.400]  freedom you want to feel like the republican party's going to save you mint romney who supports an
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.480]  assault weapons ban which means all semi-auto notice how they manipulate the language
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:52.320]  so they're all calling for it i mean i mean this this has got just page after page after page
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:59.200]  after page of republican leaders calling and any bill crystals like hey we support you obama
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.600]  we'll get behind you let's let's ban it now because they're so upset they know that a bunch
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.280]  of freshman republicans are going to come in in the house may even take the senate
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.120]  and they're freaked out bad real conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists if they
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.640]  don't have total election fraud which they're going to pull are taken over the states the
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:25.440]  counties the cities and even congress and they're scared bainer whose anti gun is in trouble there's
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:34.480]  revolts against bainer they are upset right now they see the whole momentum teeter tottering against
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:40.640]  them a real counter revolution against their global estate cover and let me tell you these guys
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:48.080]  have either got mistresses or boyfriends or they have been inside or trading and it is blackmail
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.760]  it is blackmail except for people like crystal his dad was the head of the trotskyites i mean do
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:00.080]  you know about the neocons they were kicked out by Stalin trotsky was their leader and mr
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.920]  crystals father was the head when trotsky was killed and they said we can't take over uh
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.640]  as a communist america doesn't like that we will take over the conservatives these are
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.960]  communists okay i'm not gonna explain that to you here i mean if people are oh yeah no
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.880]  crystals a good guy cuz he bashes democrats all day let me tell you folks they have an
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:29.200]  old scam where they'll have a beautiful woman act like a man is um slapping her around in a parking
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.440]  lot in front of another man who's their mark you know they'll wait by your nice car and then
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.480]  she'll be like stop it no and then you'll say hey stop that and they gotta run off and then she
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.720]  gets in the car and then puts a gun to your head and takes you to your house where you know he's
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.480]  following to totally steal everything you got and and that's all this is you got uh you know

[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:04.720]  out of me get your hands out of me and you finally woke up to this and so she's basically
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:12.560]  mrs crystal is basically running defense for him and he's like it's reasonable to ban the

[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:30.640]  the issuance of currency and credit have shined us on to their 1.5 quadrillion globally they say
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.760]  in the washington post our share of 644 trill even though we don't owe it we owe 15 trill through
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.960]  fraud to these people they should all go to jail but instead they know you're waking up they know
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.400]  that everybody's angry we have it these people are not invincible i notice the churches are all 24
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.960]  seven saying the rapture is about to happen on all my articles and videos talking about this
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.960]  hits the rapture is tomorrow the rapture is tomorrow guaranteed that's a government bot

[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.680]  ridiculous how obvious this is now come out to the point of again where larry pratt has to say
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:35.760]  it looks like an inside job and he's joining us and so now you have from scalia and and he did
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:42.240]  the lightest i mean i mean some of these people like crystal and savage said just banned semi auto
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:46.960]  which is what michael more in them are saying so you see the power structure circling the wagons
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.880]  curts term for is right because they get it they're like whoa everybody wants a gun black white

[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:17.680]  over the mind of man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.760]  so they're saying hey so the american people be able to have anything the military has
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:35.760]  and uh this is about keeping and bearing arms it means firearms knives things you can carry
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:40.960]  but the military is coming out with all these incredibly high-tech weapons that our tax money
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.880]  paid for and now deploying this stuff against us so the discussion should be why do we have
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:52.080]  the military deploying against us why is department defense satellites being used to spy on farmers
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:58.320]  why are you taking our tax money to militarize us as your new growth market in no bid contracts
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:06.320]  that's the big issue here not oh my gosh the american people are getting 100 round barrels
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.520]  and trying to scare people by the way i've used a lot of these barrels and if you load them just
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:19.120]  right they still end up jamming at around round 70 or so okay i mean it is it is it is
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:32.240]  it is legendary it is it is completely legendary but that isn't even what this is about there were
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.520]  mass shootings in the 1870s and stuff where 34 people got killed where the person was using
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:44.160]  uh you know single shot that isn't what this is about you could sit there with clips 10 round
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.440]  mags jamming them in over and over again killing people it's about saying let's ban everything
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:55.120]  with 10 mags and over and things that can take uh you know magazines the apf so they want to ban
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.160]  stuff that can take magazines and they're saying they want them banned there's now a bill introduced
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:06.720]  in the cyber security act getting a bunch of sponsorship to ban your semi-autos and clips
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.760]  and again no one's talking about it and so it's not get folks riled off because i guess the words
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.880]  coming down they're going to try it they got michael savage out going no it's time to ban
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.720]  semi-autos michael savage i've got the clip up at info wars dot com right now why are republicans
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.920]  calling you disarm the american people all the federal government is arming itself the teeth
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.680]  against conservatives this is such an important issue because let me tell you i want the nightmare
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.640]  to be over i want obama to leave and i wish mit romney was a good guy but folks the same people
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:46.000]  are financing mit romney the same people are financing him because they've got an agenda
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.960]  and people like scalia and others i mean you notice they had one of the republicans vote for
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.040]  the health care when it comes down to it they're going to do what they're told and they're being
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.640]  told go after those guns news court on their non-new stuff promotes anti-family carbon taxes all this
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:13.200]  stuff rupert murdoch's always been anti-gun folks they want to control the conservative market
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:22.800]  that's all this has ever been and we're in a lot of trouble okay i'm let's go to scalia just
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.640]  listen to him now now he's not like crystal and all others saying just outright ban him
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:31.840]  he but he's the supreme court justice on a news show say now get ready folks because
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.560]  you know we're allowed to restrict it can't have a rocket launcher there's already laws on that and
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.120]  you know it they're having straw man debates and then he lies and says you can't have something
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.400]  that's scary and what he talked about is a famous case about a guy threatened people with a battle
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:54.000]  axe you can't go out with a sword a machete with a knife with a gun and brandish it on the street
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:01.440]  you can have it on your side but you cannot brandish it at people just like cops aren't supposed to
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.560]  pull their gun out for no reason or sign the ticket and put their hand on their gun police
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.160]  have gotten in trouble for that and courts have rolled against them because that's that in the
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:15.280]  threat continuum that's a preparation to use deadly force you're not supposed to do that ladies and
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.040]  gentlemen by the way if you point a gun at somebody you better be ready to kill them
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.160]  in in my world if i point a gun at you i'm going to shoot you
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.120]  if i look at somebody breaking into my garage i'm gonna have a gun at my side i'm gonna say
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.040]  you know get out of my garage because i don't want to kill somebody to deal with the trouble
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.880]  but if they were to start moving towards me not going to say a word i'm going to shoot them right
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.200]  in the chest repeatedly now you come in my house you know i'm not going to say anything to you
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.400]  the first thing you're going to hear is white flashes and your eardrums ringing as you hit
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:56.320]  the ground as i pump rounds directly into your chest people like oh that's radical no it's not
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.280]  my ancestors were mean my ancestors didn't put up with people's garbage and you know what i got
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:10.640]  freedom my family's got land because they fought for it i am successful because my genetics and
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.280]  my background are from aggressive people that aren't going to get pushed around but also moral
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.560]  people who know how to shake hands on a deal and do what you say you're going to do and deliver
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.200]  it's called americana it's called what made this country great and you know what regardless of what
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.760]  background you come from you've got ancestors like that so how about we uphold our family names
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.520]  and live up to something good instead of letting a bunch of globalists run over us
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.120]  let's go to this clip and then i'll uh go to your phone calls and then i'm gonna give you
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.720]  financial news uh let's go ahead and uh hear us glia saying well you can't have something that's
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.320]  scary wow what i mean folks do you know that the supreme court justice is saying you can't have something
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:59.440]  that's scary well i mean a butcher knife isn't scary when my wife's cutting carrots with it but
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.320]  let me tell you i pull it out and threaten to jab it in your in your heart or slit your throat with
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.440]  it it's super scary well see that's the difference you can't menace somebody for no reason with
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:17.280]  something that's what's illegal not the battle act scalia and you know that well scalia and boy he
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.200]  looks like he was at the end of a plank or something like somebody had a gun to his back when he's
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.040]  saying this i mean he knows he's committing suicide with his supporters politically
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.480]  political suicide and why are they walking the plank because because let me tell you they're
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:35.440]  bought and paid for folks and the bankers are circling the wagons they're imploding the world
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.880]  they're bringing in world government they're engineering and collapse and they're not going
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.600]  to have anybody stand in the way of that let's go to scalia here it is let's turn to an issue
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:50.480]  that is in the news right now with the massacre in colorado and that is gun control uh you wrote
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:57.440]  in 2008 the the opinion in district of columbia v heller uh the majority opinion that said the
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:05.280]  second amendment means what it says people have a right to bear arms question how far does that
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:12.560]  constitutional right go can a legislature ban semi-automatic weapons or can it ban magazines
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.880]  that carry a hundred rounds without violating an individual's constitutional right to bear arms
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:26.560]  what the opinion in heller said is that it will have to be decided in future cases
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.360]  what limitations upon the right to keep and bear arms are permissible some undoubtedly are because
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:40.480]  there were some that were acknowledged at the time for example there was a tort called a fighting
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.400]  which if you carried around a really horrible weapon just to scare people like a a head axe
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:54.240]  or something that that was uh i believe a misdemeanor so uh yes there are some limitations that can be
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.520]  imposed what they are will depend on what the what the society understood were reasonable
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.320]  limitations at the time there were certain location limitations uh where where what about
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.720]  these technological limitations obviously we're not now talking about a handgun or a musket
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:16.320]  we're talking about a a weapon that can fire a hundred shots in a minute uh we'll we'll we'll
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:27.040]  see i mean uh obviously the uh the amendment does not apply to uh arms that cannot be hand
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:32.560]  carried it's to keep and bear so it doesn't apply to cannons but i suppose there are handheld
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.720]  rocket launchers that can bring down airplanes that will will have to be uh uh it'll have to be
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:45.920]  decided decide that if you're a textual very carefully my starting point and probably my
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:52.800]  ending point will be uh what limitations are within the understood limitations that the
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:59.440]  society had at the time they had some limitations on the nature of arms that could be born so it

[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:44.480]  from that 600 figure all the way up to 15 all the way up to 1900 dollars an ounce and and then we
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.600]  had to see some kind of a correction uh the banks were trying to pull things back together again
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:55.520]  but you know alex we have the patriot act we have tarp with that bailouts for banks that were too
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:02.400]  big to fail real id uh most of the politicians have a little clue about the fed and what hard money
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:08.080]  means and now we're looking at the printing press again yeah indeed they're calling for qe3 banks
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:15.440]  like goldman sacks hsb sees in trouble i mean it's just everything is kind of falling apart here at
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:21.040]  the end of the year and it's not surprising july this is the last day of july or this is the second
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:27.600]  of last day of july we're coming into august things move in the fall in gold with the exception of
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:34.080]  when george bush was leaving office in 2008 and telling everybody that there's going to be martial
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:41.440]  law if we don't have tarp passed and that that force has to know what i would call qe1 and then
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:47.200]  it just kept on building up from that i agree yeah well prices in gold and silver and everything
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:54.240]  shoot up in price right now silver's at 28 17 of 28 cents here today it's been down as low as 26
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:02.960]  cents 15 50 gold now we're at 16 21 90 the the the economy is falling apart and the politicians
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:08.960]  still think no i hear you the best answer for economic problems is to resort back to the printing
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:14.480]  press this is why we need hard currency because the politicians they wouldn't even have that option
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:20.560]  but we don't have it and the fed is talking about qe3 they're doing everything they can to say that
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.360]  it's not going to happen but they know it has to happen we have way too much debt in this country
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:31.360]  we're loaded up to the gills the economy can't afford to support it and the only answer to them
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.080]  is to you're right kid uh and push more money out into the system and

[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:27.840]  all right larry pratt is coming up to break down what i see is the biggest concerted assault
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.680]  in the second amendment ever bipartisan by a globalist frontman posing as democrats and
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.000]  republicans ted anderson i wanted to get him on earlier in the article but i got behind
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:45.200]  it earlier in the broadcast but continuing with these articles i was mentioning you know maryl
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:50.960]  lynch is saying $2,000 gold by the end of the year i don't know if that's going to be the case
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:57.920]  but ted my point is i believe for myself personally now is a good time to get into
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:02.880]  gold and silver and in my experience in working with you for almost 15 years you were sponsor
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.920]  15 years ago you started genesis what 14 years ago or more you've got the best deals on gold
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.720]  bullion silver you know but you also have the the numismatics and collectibles really good deals on
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.880]  that you have a special offer you're still running but it ends in just a couple weeks because we're
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  going to be out of the book big brother and the american dream you get two silver dollars and a
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:33.200]  great book and a powerful film about the banksters for 63 dollars and i can tell you right now ted's
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:39.280]  losing money on that deal but it's a promotional offer what do they call that a lost leader so
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.920]  you can click on the banner at the top of info wars dot com the right hand side or give might as
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:56.480]  resources a call at 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 but ted what are some of the other specials that
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.920]  might as resources is running because i mean the smart money at least in my mind is on that it's
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.240]  going to go up quite a bit in the fall now is a great time it looks like this is well it's it's
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.200]  hit its bottom gone up a little bit and i think now is a good time to get into golden silver it
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:16.480]  sure is i mean one of the great buys that i have right now are the walking liberty halves at 1683
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:22.240]  those are at 16 dollars a piece here just six months ago that book and silver dollar offer
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:28.240]  63 bucks for two silver dollars i mean you got to remember silver's at 28 dollars and 17 cents
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:34.400]  there's nobody in the planet that is offering two silver dollars and that and a $10 book and a $10
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:41.680]  video for 63 bucks he got that book retails for 19 a little bit of silver at a low flat price
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:45.280]  and that way you can get educated and involved in the gold and silver market
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.160]  20 Liberties you uh you had Lindsay uh Lindsay Williams on uh and he's talking about gold
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:56.640]  confiscation if you want to stay away from that the 20 Liberties makes sense right now
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:03.920]  they're at 1989 uh there's just a long bunch of gold and silver bullion and a pneumosomatic or
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:10.480]  semi pneumosomatic that you can be getting into at this time and the prices are our summer prices
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:16.160]  rather than waiting till october when everything is hitting the fan do it now because now is the
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:22.640]  time to get in while the prices are low you're at 16 21 90 gold has already gone up 60 to 70
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.160]  dollars an ounce just within the last two or three weeks you know that's the that's the QE
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:33.840]  two the QE three thing that's coming up that all the market is nervous about and it's reality

[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.000]  economically uh bob Chapman convinced people to get out of the real estate market i don't think
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.360]  there was anybody else calling for that and that market just took a huge tank uh getting out of the
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.360]  stock market and so on and so forth putting people into gold and silver at three to six hundred
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:21.440]  dollars an ounce uh and uh just a good straightforward honest man it's just a shame to have lost him
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.080]  that's for sure but he is out of the reach of the globalist now with his heavenly father

[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:20.800]  talk alex jones on the gcn radio network all right ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:26.720]  larry pratt who came on the info wars nightly news last friday and agreed that if the criminal
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:31.280]  elements of the government would stage fast and furious that killed hundreds conservatively
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:37.360]  thousands probably that they would stage the theater event and boy that story just gets crazier
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:46.720]  and crazier but i wanted to get larry pratt on to discuss this latest news article that has come out
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:55.680]  uh time magazine how guns won why americans have turned against gun control and yes the polls show
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.800]  that we are politically winning and we do have larry pratt he's on with us via skype we're just
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:06.480]  trying to get uh audio right now and in about two minutes just go to telephone like i said just
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.760]  we'll end it here and just go to phone i i'd rather just get larry on than just have a you
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.160]  know 20 people work on it and then not have never happened uh so this is a big issue here
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:25.440]  because now you've got the major republican leadership uh coming out
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:33.280]  bill crystal michael savage uh rooper murdoch you name it and say and look you shouldn't be able
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.320]  to have a semi-automatic weapon now now why are they doing that right as the polls completely
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:44.080]  start shifting and every time there's a mass shooting people want more guns because they get it the
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.480]  government can't and won't protect you they can come confiscate your gun like katrina and so the
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:55.280]  system is really showing us that they're in a very very serious panic mode right now
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:02.960]  and this is a big deal because they're very dangerous uh also uh it's not getting any attention
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:12.960]  at any level that they have introduced a writer on a bill that i checked the progress of it's
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.200]  getting cosponsors they tried to pass it off quite a few times the last couple years they're
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:22.160]  close to passing it now democrats senators offer gun control amendment for cyber security bill
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:30.160]  the headline should be democrats propose banning the possession of a of high capacity mags which
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:35.200]  is over 10 and the way i read the bill they could even
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:46.880]  do something like say well guns that can accept the magazines uh can't have this
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:53.200]  so we'll uh get larry larry pretz take on that uh as soon as we get him on the regular telephone
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:11:01.360]  because that is my wish is to to not just go with this skype problem and and stick with
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.360]  that i might i want to switch when three minutes of skype not working i want to go to alternate
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.240]  phone number back up in these interviews and then this won't happen because skype skype is a great
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.840]  thing to just message him on the thing i'm not trying to direct people live on air but if i
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:20.960]  directed it'll you know kind of just happen because we have a tendency and we all do this
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:26.400]  to have to face a problem and kind of stick with that problem and then just just keep going with
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.120]  that problem instead of going around it and that that's always my model just go around something
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:35.600]  hithers an issue because i'm chomping at the bit here to find out what larry pratt thinks about
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:40.160]  since he was on friday all these incredible developments uh that have been unfolding
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:49.200]  all righty then uh also uh this is a if you cut to the wide shot for people watching on

[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:52.880]  let's go back now to larry pratt here broadcasting worldwide ladies and gentlemen uh larry pratt
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:59.920]  head of gun owners of america uh good to have you here with us today uh i know you're a man who is
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:04.960]  reserved and you you know you run the only no compromise second amendment group out there that's
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:10.640]  in washington the nra is kind of being drug kicking and screaming by you and others into being more
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.440]  proactive for the second amendment as you point out uh they they were set up the nra at the end
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:19.120]  of civil war to teach northerners how to shoot as an auxiliary of the federal government so that's
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.840]  why they've always had such a cozy relationship now with those that occupy the federal government
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:30.960]  but uh we have uh joe clines saying how guns won why americans have turned against gun controlled
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:36.320]  and then they go on to basically say how horrible it is but suddenly mr crystal
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:41.920]  mr michael savage uh scalia has come out and said oh we could restrict you if something scary
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:49.040]  which isn't actually true uh we've seen um uh the the head of news corp or murdoch say you
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:55.920]  don't need semi-automatic since when did fox news turn into the michael more chucky schumer uh mayor
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:04.800]  bloomberg channel uh since when did this happen mr pratt well actually all along the fox news has
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:11.360]  been i would say they're closer to what they claim to be fair and balanced than a conservative network
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:18.720]  there are some conservatives on there the one that's most constitutional is judge napolitano and
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:24.960]  he doesn't have his own show any longer they bring him in as a contributing legal analyst
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:32.960]  which is great because he's really super at that but um they're conservative without necessarily
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:38.480]  checking out the constitution and that's where a lot of folks run into trouble they're not at liberty
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.000]  to want the government to do more than the we the people have allowed the government to do
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:51.280]  and we i think even on the conservative side fall into the mindset that brock obama clearly has
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:57.600]  when he was talking to a republican delegation at the white house he reminded him that well i won
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.560]  as if that means he can do anything he wants and that's not exactly right
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:11.760]  but all of these people have to know that their entire base hates their guts now
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:18.560]  when mr crystal comes out and says we can ban all the semi autos i mean there's clearly a
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:24.080]  concerted effort here when the republican leadership is begging the democrats to bring forward
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:31.280]  restrictions i think they're going to pay for that at the ballot box there are still primaries
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:37.040]  left this year and some republican heads could roll if they're willing to put themselves on
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:42.960]  that block and the voters have already shown that they're willing to take out republicans
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:51.840]  incumbents have lost and in open primaries people that might have had an easy time getting elected
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:59.120]  because of their prominence and other positions have lost in these primaries the with maybe a
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:04.560]  couple of exceptions at the federal level the victories have been going to tea party type
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:10.320]  candidates and and that certainly includes pro second amendment candidates so they can talk
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:17.840]  like that at their own peril and it shows me that they don't yet understand that guns is the
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:26.000]  third rail of american politics you touch it at your own peril be advised because you may come
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.920]  back in a political body bag larry pratt head of gun owners of america is our guest larry
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:39.440]  we've talked about the poll numbers showing that in the 60s and 70s it was maybe 55 pro gun the
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:45.040]  other 45 buying into the trendiness of the nanny state i see numbers of over 70 now being pro
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:50.880]  second amendment people get it now that the government can't won't protect you right and so
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.520]  there's a major shift happening what do you make of the anti gunners now admitting this but saying
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:03.760]  they're going to circle the wagons and come after us that much harder well it's kind of what you
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:10.240]  expect from a fanatic a fanatic is defined as someone who tries something and fails and
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:17.200]  redoubles their effort doing the same thing time and again the the fact is that they they really
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:24.720]  don't get it i i would i did a debate in spanish on cnn espanyol and this thing went on for an
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:32.560]  hour and when i would lay out some of the simple facts like from 1991 until the present the us
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:44.720]  murder rate has fallen by 50 percent from around eight to around four and per 100 000 and that
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:53.040]  doesn't bode well for them because some 40 million guns were transacted in that period of time
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.040]  america is armed to the teeth and yet the murder rate is substantially declining and
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.720]  because there's 12 people that tragically lost their lives as much as anything because they
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:10.000]  didn't have a gun and nobody else did in the theater we're supposed to rush into the gun control
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.720]  bag and say you got us i don't think well did you notice gun sales doubled the week after that
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:20.800]  happened already record numbers that doubled that and then i saw polls where there was people were
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:26.400]  even more pro gun after the shooting that's what's freaking them out is they stage fast and furious
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:32.320]  i believe they stage this all the signs are there and people really get that now and go no i want
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:37.840]  a gun because there's a crazy ronald mcdonald murr you know out there you know if that's even true
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:43.680]  that is the message to take away and that's what i was telling these left-wing media types
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:49.280]  in the frenzy following the the shooting i said what what you're doing is predictable but let me
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:55.920]  tell you i will predict that this has actually shifted opinion more in the favor of gun owners
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.520]  of america and gun owners generally this is something where the american people realize
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:07.200]  as you said alex the police can't be there to protect us it's not their job they don't have
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:14.400]  the numbers it's just not going to happen and the the murderer in aurora uh didn't choose
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:20.720]  the police station to start gunning people down he went in through a door well he he entered the
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.920]  front door first bought a ticket and then went outside to get his guns during the showing of
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:32.400]  the film um he uh he walked right by a no-gun sign exactly they're talking about putting
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:37.680]  metal detectors in and having tsa style everywhere all that means is that when a shooter shows up at
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:43.600]  the mall or the theater they know they've got disarmed people that they can feed on absolutely
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:48.880]  because he could go uh and do exactly what he did in the theater in aurora having gone through a
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.680]  metal detector wouldn't have made a hill beans a difference and i'll tell you what would happen
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:21:00.880]  if they put up metal directors at uh movie theaters netflix would say yeah do it do it well you're
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:06.160]  right but i mean what do you expect them to do now i mean they're certainly circling the wagons
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:14.240]  when suddenly all these republicans come out and sound like bill clinton or or people like uh michael
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:20.800]  more i mean they are certainly desperate what do you expect them to do now that they finally
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:27.040]  realize that everyone does the opposite of what they say that everyone hates them america's waking
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.160]  up i mean i'm not just hyping that no are you seeing the same thing absolutely i was telling
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:38.960]  them that they were losing the propaganda battle uh it is and and actually when i was on the cnn
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:46.000]  espanyol and i was telling them nothing is going to happen because the american people are so
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:52.880]  against your gun grabbing that if you do anything you're going to pay a price this november and they
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:59.600]  said yeah that's right we acknowledge that but it's just really so bad well i mean look you've
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:04.800]  got this domesticated america who grew up with parents that didn't teach them about guns who
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:09.760]  literally you know men lay down while their wife gets raped it's it's that minority of weirdos who
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:16.320]  want to be cowards in week who look at us who are upstanding armed successful i mean we're not
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.360]  socialists they are i mean it's just on every front these are screwed up dumb people and and
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:28.800]  look we're tired of being lectured by them it's over they are losing momentum a men brother that is
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:36.880]  exactly what's happening and it does freak them out i i have not enjoyed anything more than dealing
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:43.520]  with the bbc or cnn or public broadcasting or this is an occasional commercial liberal doesn't
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:49.680]  have much of an audience i was probably talking to myself but they just don't know what to say
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:57.680]  or do other than can't we just give peace a chance meanwhile though meanwhile they the federal
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:05.440]  government is arming 450 million hollow points armored pill boxes checkpoints drones armed drones
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.080]  hey why can the government be arming to the teeth but we're not supposed to be armed you know it
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:16.480]  almost strikes me that they're trying to preempt the market if they buy that many then the domestic
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:26.000]  manufacturers may really be very strapped and in fact ammunition is quite pricey now expanding on
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.640]  this uh you were on the show friday can you elaborate on uh the fact that you're saying we
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:38.640]  have to look at this as possibly being a false flag i mean even at the level of there's the
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:43.920]  air force psychiatrist reprimanded for dangerous drugs to people uh there is this dossier he
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:48.640]  supposedly sent him what he was going to do nothing was done i mean all the telltale signs
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:54.080]  we've seen weird photo shops now of his gas mask at the scene i mean this whole thing looks shut up
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:24:02.800]  yeah uh after fast and furious and you know me i'm i'm not one inclined to uh go with a conspiracy
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:09.440]  theory but there really was a conspiracy in fast and furious and the government not only conspired
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:16.960]  they conspired to commit mass murder well if they would do that then indeed how can we say that it's
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:23.840]  impossible that this guy wasn't prompted goaded some way led into cooperated with some kind of a
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:29.840]  government agent that was there to encourage him maybe open the theater door for who knows
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:36.080]  the fact of the matter is if the government is investigating this we're probably never going
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:42.320]  to find out once the fbi took this thing over which just outrageous me they have no law enforcement
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:48.480]  authority constitutionally and we're letting them conduct the investigation the the the folks from
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:55.120]  waco the folks from ruby ridge the folks from other disasters we're letting them investigate this
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:03.200]  very frightening uh what do you make why do you think because they're always so deceptive
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:07.920]  why would they come out in time magazine and announce they've lost i mean what what is the
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:12.080]  point of that because then you read the article and they say hey don't worry we'll still get their
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:17.040]  guns but i mean i mean is this like a mayday emergency that you know the the slaves have
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.440]  woken up what are we going to do i think it means they're desperate to get the president
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:30.240]  reelected because even he is somewhat restrained somewhat right now because of the election contest
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:35.680]  and as far as i can tell right now he's going to lose and lose big but if he were to get reelected
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:41.440]  oh buddy it would be go for the gold that would be just the end of the country certainly the end
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:47.760]  of the second amendment and i think what may have them so desperate is they can see that we hate them
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.960]  as you were saying they not only on the second amendment issue but on so many other issues
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.720]  the president has been the educator in chief i don't think most people had a clue that there was
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:05.120]  a chance that we were going socialist in this country but once we elected a socialist as president
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:14.960]  and and he is so tone deaf and actually rather incompetent as the author of the amateur argues
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:23.680]  in his book ed Klein this guy really isn't that bright he makes the same mistake twice he doesn't
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:32.080]  seem to pay attention even to his own polling the fact that start with with obama care the polls
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:37.760]  have said from the get go that it was enormously unpopular and people were really concerned about
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:43.520]  jobs so what did he do well if it had been bill clinton he probably would have worked both tracks
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:48.800]  but certainly he would have at least faked it like he was doing something about jobs but this guy
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:53.440]  couldn't be bothered that's because they want to destroy this country absolutely yeah i mean
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.280]  that they admit it they want to post industrial countries the un and morey strong have said
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:02.560]  they want to wreck it so they can make us go on welfare under their control in closing larry
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.400]  pratt of gun owners dot org uh you know the watchdog up there on capitol hill with your great
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:12.240]  organization and all your members and the news alerts that are invaluable people should visit
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:17.520]  it and sign up for the free news alerts right now thank you that's so we appreciate that i see a
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.440]  false flag in the making because i know they're telling police and military to get ready for
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.200]  gun confiscation i've gotten army manuals where they're training for it they're telling them
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:28.800]  something's coming in october i'm not saying that's gonna happen the point is they're telling
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:36.000]  them it's coming right and if they try gun confiscation or if they tried to restrict
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.360]  you will get resistance and that could start a civil war uh they might do it while they start a new
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.920]  war or something thinking that we would patriotically get in line are you worried about them setting
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:52.640]  off a new war to get us in line for gun confiscation uh or i'm trying to march the cops off to take
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:59.440]  the guns and then a war will start i i can see them doing something that they think might bring them
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:07.840]  our favor our support uh so oh yes save us from ourselves sort of thing but honestly i i well i
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:13.360]  have been concerned about that and we still should be looking out in case they actually do try something
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:20.960]  i think now there is such a revulsion against this regime that if they tried something like that
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:26.880]  it would just make us angrier and we would spit in their face with a loaded gun by the way i agree
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:33.200]  with you there is true revulsion now for big government across the board and it's only intensifying
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.440]  see we've been taught by these modern churches and stuff that we're all going to lose the devil's
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.000]  going to take over folks we don't know where we are in god's plan we just have to do justice
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:47.840]  may the heavens fall and i'm telling you i think we can beat these people and take america back
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:52.800]  that's why the old line republicans are panicking saying wait gun control is good because they
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:58.720]  understand we're getting ready to sweep them all away that's right they they will have done it to

[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:47.840]  well i've told you this for about six years because they have these big globalist consortium
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:52.240]  meetings and it's all public that the new software the operating systems they've all
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:34:00.720]  got internet ids embedded in them not just your ip address and the whole goal of this is when they
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:04.640]  say in the future you're not a good globalist you're just going to be banned from the internet
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:07.920]  they're going to be banned from travel they're going to be banned from buying and shelling
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:12.160]  and then you'll be hunted down and killed taken to a reeducation center and killed
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:17.200]  and by the way that's in all the army documents that's public i mean i know that sounds crazy
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.000]  reality's crazy you ever studied other countries what's happening here has happened everywhere
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.200]  over and over again over and over again even the supposed freest countries like england and france
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:33.840]  in the past not free now and it's here uh this is new at info wars dot com we've got to send this
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:41.360]  to drudge this is big news in assay wants easy pass control for the internet now imagine the
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:46.880]  national security agency is here telling us what what what we will do as americans openly spying on
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:53.680]  us just it's it's incredible because they've learned they just get on a stage and announce the crimes
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:58.000]  it's like it's okay maybe they should have sand dusky to the meeting and you know they can have him
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.600]  rape a child on stage or something and it'll be okay because they did on stage you know
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:05.920]  by the way they've hired to have a pen state to work for homeland security now in a secret position
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:12.640]  of course joining the club general keith alexander the nsa boss who wants the government to centralize
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:20.000]  the internet and force users to use a system analogous to easy pass a transponder and he says
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.480]  when you go down the highway and you go down the easy pass lane what you're doing is sending a code
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:28.480]  that system is not looking in your car reading your email or intercepting anything it's just
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:33.040]  getting that code oh yeah really so you can set people up with it and track where you went
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:36.720]  and then ban you from getting on the web that's the whole point you liar but you're dealing with
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.680]  your enemy the american people your work for the bankers you're you're in occupation general a
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:49.440]  collaborator in other words the government should vet all uses with a checkpoint all you need to pass
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:54.880]  is the fact of a signature an ip address in real time and we can take it from there yeah we know
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:01.040]  you're already taking it from there bud nsa whistleblowers that moron came out just last month
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:08.160]  everything's tracked in real time so i'll say it right now proprietary software
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:16.800]  microprocessor breakthrough works 20 times faster than the new programs that i mean i just
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.480]  start putting a bunch of gibberish about patents and stuff out on there that's what they really
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:25.280]  care about they're stealing everything and shipping it offshore their jobs make sure america falls
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:31.440]  literally this government is a pack of scum a pack of new world order trying to drown this nation
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:37.040]  trying to break us trying to bring us down i mean i'll just say it i mean people think you

[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:50.240]  we're going to go to julio roceo here in just a moment but that article is just off the charts
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:54.000]  because they're now announcing it on the julio roceo here in a moment there's another one more
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.880]  law enforcement agencies turning to pre-crime policing yeah run by uh the you know farmer

[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:38.720]  it's just all and imagine that mobster bloomberg who says you can't have sugar can't have cigarettes
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:43.840]  can't have water now he wants to make mothers have breastfeed because there's been a pr backlash
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.880]  against him yeah you should be breastfeeding yeah formula is abusive to children the mainline
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:55.520]  stuff is over 70 corn syrup i've broken it down on air it'll be part sugar part corn it's over 70
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:01.760]  i mean it's just frying children but but now bloomberg comes out and says that it isn't your place
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:09.360]  okay the nanny state kills us and then comes in and tries to save us it's unbelievable
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.440]  all right i'm ranting here ladies and gentlemen uh what they're going to do is the model is going
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:20.000]  to be the google nsa model where if you have a youtube channel now and they claim you've been
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.600]  copyrighted a few times they're they're tagging it to your cell phone your email and your database
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:30.400]  and people now that are getting banned from youtube can never get back on no matter how many ip
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:35.120]  addresses how many phone numbers how many logins unless they get somebody else to do it but in
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.600]  the future somebody else won't set up an account for you because they'll lose it it's like the irs
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.720]  says you won't travel outside the country if you haven't paid the federal reserve all your money
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:50.800]  no judge no jury we are unleashing hell on ourselves and it's time to turn back here it's
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:56.400]  time to get nasty about this and by nasty i mean look at how nasty this is and disgusting
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:01.760]  really get angry at ourselves for letting it get this far okay i'm not strutting around here at
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:08.000]  the office feeling like i'm mr mr tough guy i feel pathetic i feel weak i know how weak i am
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.760]  compared to my ancestors i don't feel like i'm doing enough i know how desperate the situation is
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:18.400]  okay this is not i'm not up here just yelling and screaming everybody we're in a lot of trouble
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:25.920]  here okay a lot of trouble a lot of trouble a lot there are two edges from going around and starting
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:30.000]  to just snatch and grab people they put that stuff on the books because they plan to use it
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:36.080]  and they do plan on trying to start a civil war in this country but because our forebears were smart
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:41.600]  smartest the world ever saw they put liberty bombs in there that have been kicking and waiting
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:46.880]  till they were needed it's like guardians or something to use a for analogy and they're guarding the
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:52.240]  you know guarding the on the throne room all the weapon systems when you step in there it turns on
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:59.840]  and that's what it is that sleeping giant is awakening the guardian is awakening you are that
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:04.880]  guardian your whole life your whole future your life isn't about just partying and all that that's
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:10.160]  why you're not fulfilled because if you just party all day long and you're not balanced
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:17.120]  you're not fulfilled because hedonism will not fulfill you when we when we make a special
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:21.760]  production video that's 10 minutes long it has all the facts and i know it just totally proves
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.160]  everything we're saying and i know is going to reach millions of people there is an intense
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:32.160]  feeling of total satisfaction that we are helping people and we are unlocking minds and we are
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.840]  helping put more energy into the collective hand pulling a knife across the carotid orderies of the
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:43.920]  new world order and just collectively the globalists can feel the spirit of liberty
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:48.800]  with that knife and they're going oh they're going and they're like you can't win you have no power
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:53.360]  we're not listening to that anymore we're collectively pulling and we're going to pull
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:58.320]  right through to that whole head comes off medusa you understand that your lives are going to be
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:08.320]  decapitated the edfo war is here and the collective force is just yeah yeah you understand that just
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:17.200]  we are not your slaves you murdering maggots i understand their weaponized system how their
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.960]  brain damaging kids okay i'm in a walgreens or a cvs i was in one last night when they were
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.800]  about a pad of paper and i saw on every corner little bottles of water fluoridated for kids with
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:33.040]  way above what's in the tap water to brain damage them and i almost just grabbed one and busted it
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:38.320]  on the floor that's a normal response to weaponized chemicals to hurt little kids when the even the
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.560]  american medical association was forced to say people under five shouldn't ingest any fluoride
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.880]  they've had to cut it back and say don't put it in the water and i've got a harvard study with over
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:51.840]  a dozen studies that it's brain damaging kids and they say it threatens our whole humanity
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:57.280]  yeah no kidding that's the plan and if you're not outraged by that something's wrong with you
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:02.800]  if you walked in your house one night at two a.m to get a glass of orange juice and you caught
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.880]  somebody in there putting something in the in the orange juice of the milk and you tackled them
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:11.680]  and you had your gun or whatever and got the thing away from them and it had skull and
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:19.920]  crossbones on it mark cyanide you'd be madly angry wouldn't you see this is a normal response
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:26.240]  folks if you don't feel like this about tyranny you've had that switch turned off in you this is
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:32.160]  normal this is normal for our species this is why we're top of the food chain folks because we're
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.880]  not putting up with anything you understand that instead we're the opposite putting up with anything
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:42.880]  by a bunch of scum the lowest of our species i will not put up with it anymore i will not
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:50.240]  my one time with consciousness on this plane of existence sit here and go along with this and that
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.920]  ain't special folks you got to stop thinking of what i do is special you have got to realize it's
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:02.480]  normal this is normal this is normal i'm going to shut up now and go to julia who is a reporter
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:06.720]  he's done reporting for info wars dot com he's done it for we are changed we have video of this
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.640]  if you're a radio listener i'm going to have a repost at info wars dot com right now is one of
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:17.600]  the top tiles and julio tell folks your story because we have the video you shot that got national
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:24.000]  attention of the tsa at the bus terminals and train stations searching people setting up check

[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.560]  happening everywhere right on time they're rolling out and then they came and found you days later
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:45.520]  and you have tape of that and you stood your ground saying you could be a terrorist for taping them

[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:34.560]  in their full uniform and you know being an independent reporter it was just instinctive
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:38.880]  to take out my cell phone and to start filming and just to see what they were doing i was kind of
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:44.320]  in a hurry but it was you know by the grace of god perfect timing i got my camera out and here comes
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:50.000]  tsa getting sent to do the checkpoint and as you saw in that first video tsa in bay chicago's union
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:57.200]  station i mean literally perfect timing me filming and the tsa setting their checkpoints now last
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:03.600]  wednesday july 18th i go back to union station uh to meet with mike murphy of why in the world
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:11.040]  are they spraying and i see tsa agents again and i just thought from two weeks ago that oh you know
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:16.240]  tsa's just here uh you know maybe just for the independence day weekend and and they're going
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:22.080]  to be gone looks like they're they're permanently staying at union station and for folks that don't
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:27.120]  know no no no no they got billions of funding they sent the kits out nationwide they're rolling
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:32.400]  out nationwide and then next year they're rolling out into every town they're going to be everywhere
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:37.200]  they're going to grow up your wife they're criminals they love it chicago's the third largest media
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:43.600]  market in the country followed by new york and la one and two and if it wasn't for my video people
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:48.480]  around the chicagoland area or your listeners or anyone throughout the world wouldn't have known
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:53.920]  that tsa is in chicago's union and they keep saying oh it's terrorism if you don't tell us you're
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:58.560]  coming as if you're not media so so tell people what happened you shot video then they then they
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:04.320]  find you weeks later right they find i went i went to the metro i thought about a bar
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.360]  bar and grill type thing at union station and that's where tsa agents were eating lunch
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:14.800]  so i wanted to do a film our taxpayer dollars is giving tsa lunch at union station and then while
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:20.400]  i'm sitting i'm trying to be discreet an amtrak police officer comes up to me and he says hey i
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:25.840]  you know as you saw in the video you know you're the one that filmed us last week you put it on
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:30.400]  youtube and i tried to act dumb at first like what are you talking about i didn't film anything
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.840]  but then i said so what's the problem what if i film tsa and in the video goes on he goes on to
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:41.840]  say you know we don't have a right to film tsa it could be you know took on my video on july 5th i
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:47.600]  gave the day the time where i was at where you were tsa was being well yeah you're the enemy
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.560]  you're the american people you're not allowed to film gods while they violate people's fourth
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:59.040]  amendment takeover criminally and because i did that i gave terrorists an opportunity to to know
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.880]  where they were and remember alex before nato i was with lucred outskine downtown chicago
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:09.760]  and undercover officer said if you put this picture on youtube i could get shot by a terrorist
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:13.520]  yeah oh you mean the terrorists they're putting in libya and syria and the underwear bomber they
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:19.120]  got on the plane that's why we've got to overturn their fake terror their bosses staged the terror

[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:59.120]  the midwest julio roceo of illinois now two weeks ago julio released a great video showing how tsa
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:05.600]  agents were setting up a checkpoint at the union train station in chicago we have tsa agents you
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:09.920]  know these aren't police officers they don't have a right to grope us they don't have a right to wear
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:16.720]  any badges they're not authorized law enforcement agents yet they have the audacity to do what they
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:22.640]  do at the airport they have the audacity to come to our train stations now the video was a big hit
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:30.160]  even with amtrak police who worked within union station and they actually targeted and found julio
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:35.120]  a week later when he was having dinner at union station came up to him and tried to intimidate
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:39.840]  and harass him but as a good journalist though he says he took out the video camera and recorded
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:44.640]  everything that happened what's the law are you gonna listen but you don't be kicked out of here

[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:09.440]  you're going to jail sir because it could be used for terrorist activity right now we're in violation
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:16.880]  because of what what kind of terror because people know our time the date you gave an explanation

[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.440]  even strip children so there's nothing that's enough for them to keep us safe from the terrorists

[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:59.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:04.800]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:10.400]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
