[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  Your phone calls and to guest we had him on about three weeks ago and I want to have him back on to take your questions
[00:55.000 --> 01:14.000]  He was a Hitler youth his brother died in the war he was a Hitler youth from the early 1930s when Hitler came to power he served in the German Army during World War 2
[01:14.000 --> 01:30.000]  And we will break down the similarities the parallels between the United States and the western world for that matter and the police state the surveillance the worship of government the worship of the military the worship of police and the parallels that we're facing as a society
[01:30.000 --> 01:43.000]  This attitude of you've got to do with the government says the government is the authority it knows best it's doing it for your own interest versus what the founder said government is deadly dangerous and anytime it gets big it is going to become very corrupt
[01:43.000 --> 01:59.000]  And it's going to abuse you very very badly Darrell rundus will be joining us in studio to talk about a host of issues and different news items and issues and throughout the radio broadcast just like yesterday we're going to be taking your phone calls
[01:59.000 --> 02:19.000]  In fact I am going to go even further we're going to do a blitz of phone calls on the other side of this quick break I am going to take 12 phone calls in the 12 minute segment this is more than a 12 minute segment I guess it's a
[02:19.000 --> 02:37.000]  No it's a 12 minute segment in the 12 minute segment coming up I will take 12 phone calls and then in the next five minute segment I will take five phone calls and in the segment after that I will I will take a phone call every minute or will average out to every
[02:37.000 --> 02:55.000]  minute of live transmission time that we have because I love the different perspectives the ideas the angles the wild card news articles and items or personal observations that listeners raise here on this radio broadcast
[02:55.000 --> 03:11.000]  So we're going to be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 that's 1-800-259-9231 first time callers will go to the head of the line today

[07:09.000 --> 07:20.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[07:20.000 --> 07:29.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[07:36.000 --> 07:45.000]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[08:00.000 --> 08:09.000]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:09.000 --> 08:21.000]  thank you for joining us on this Wednesday the 28th day of October 2009 wide open phones to out the transmission today
[08:21.000 --> 08:39.000]  in my stack of news Barack Obama is going to sign the hate crimes bill that they sell as a compassionate piece of legislation to stop
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.000]  haters going out and rolling people as it's called beating them up and taking their money a common practice and it is abhorrent
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  oh it's okay if we go out and mug people who we don't like but there are laws against assault and if you really hurt somebody it can be billed as
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  assault with a deadly weapon or attempted murder we have laws we have 50 states
[09:09.000 --> 09:22.000]  they tried to pass the hate crime legislation previously by saying they drug a black man to death in jasper texas year after year for the last
[09:22.000 --> 09:32.000]  what happened about six years ago seven years ago they tried to pass it saying he needs to be punished and the national media would never mention
[09:32.000 --> 09:43.000]  the thousands of news reports over the years it had to be in the thousands it I mean you all saw it every day sometimes for months whenever they were
[09:43.000 --> 09:58.000]  trying to pass hate crimes legislation of course the white trash individual that did this was a ex con who had been beaten up and raped
[09:58.000 --> 10:22.000]  by the black gangs in the prisons fellow trash and so he got together with some other ex cons and they drug a old drunk black hobo man to death
[10:22.000 --> 10:33.000]  and his head came off now none of the media mentioned that this individual was given the death penalty by the state of texas the death penalty
[10:33.000 --> 10:43.000]  what more can you do the death penalty and he certainly did deserve it in fact the individuals are multiple individuals did it they were all given the death penalty
[10:43.000 --> 10:55.000]  what else should have been done but the media lied and put it out there like they hadn't been punished nothing had happened this is all about the federal government
[10:55.000 --> 11:06.000]  getting involved in crimes and taking over the states and now if this expands the federal offices that have been opened in every city in every major town
[11:06.000 --> 11:21.000]  and even in rural areas they have federal offices over multi counties to begin to have police charge people for their political views and if you hurt someone's feelings they want to charge you
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  some of the more egregious sections of the bill were stripped because they were exposed here on this radio show and many others
[11:29.000 --> 11:39.000]  but the problem is they have added to the debate don't worry Democrats go ahead and vote for it we can just add that in later
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  the Democrats right now are under a lot of pressure on a similar piece of legislation the health care plan
[11:47.000 --> 12:00.000]  there are more than 40 Democrats who consider themselves conservative or the blue dog Democrats not the yellow dog who are saying we don't want state sponsored paid for abortion
[12:00.000 --> 12:10.000]  and Nancy Pelosi has said this is essential to reduce world population and unwanted babies a eugenics statement that's who she is it's what she stands for
[12:10.000 --> 12:21.000]  and so right now the health care plan is in trouble because 40 plus they're wavering between 45 and 41 40 plus Democrats are saying they may not vote for it
[12:21.000 --> 12:31.000]  because it will take taxpayer money and pay for abortions and whether you support abortion or not I mean should you make someone pay for something they don't want to pay for
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  morally certainly not and the Democrats are saying don't worry we'll go ahead and pass it and then we can just add it in later or have the bureaucracy change its rules later
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  and they're involved in a bunch of chicanery and manipulation of the fine wording of that right now so that's happening
[12:48.000 --> 12:58.000]  and they've said that with a hate crime legislation they've said look we're going to go ahead and federalize your local police and then we can add in more free speech destroying provisions later
[12:58.000 --> 13:14.000]  so this is the death by increments situation that we're facing we'll go over that as well but a very sad day for the first amendment in this country and a very sad day for the 10th and 9th amendment dealing with state sovereignty
[13:14.000 --> 13:24.000]  but already many states have hate crime legislation they've passed but it's been ruled unconstitutional because it's not equal protection under the law
[13:24.000 --> 13:37.000]  now something else happened four years ago several years after the poor black convict was drugged to death by other convicts
[13:37.000 --> 13:55.000]  three drunk black men in Jasper grabbed an old white man and drug him to death thinking oh well you know they killed a black guy we'll randomly kill a white guy
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  and that was in the associated press and in the local Jasper paper but nowhere else it was never in the news
[14:04.000 --> 14:23.000]  now that is political correctness that is hate speech that is how all of this is selectively enforced and the federal government is stating they want laws like Canada has where you can't even read many Bible passages
[14:23.000 --> 14:44.000]  saying that they're hateful or you can't criticize the European Union or you can't criticize global carbon taxes
[14:44.000 --> 15:00.000]  so this is just some of the issues that we're dealing with today and all of this multiculturalism it is all meant to divide everyone and to point out our differences and to get everyone at each other's throats
[15:00.000 --> 15:11.000]  and then the federal government will arbitrate all of this and stir up the pot and all the infighting so that we never talk about the ruling elite, we never talk about the banks, we never talk about the true power structure
[15:11.000 --> 15:20.000]  we all just fight over resources, first the government communalizes resources then it doles them out to select groups and plays everyone off against each other
[15:20.000 --> 15:31.000]  very similar to the program that was used over several hundred years in defeating the Native Americans who outnumbered the Europeans many times to one
[15:31.000 --> 15:42.000]  they use a divide and conquer strategy to carry this out and do it and the same thing is happening, okay I said I was going to take a lot of calls and we haven't gone to them and said I have all this news
[15:42.000 --> 15:59.000]  it's also in the New York Times of all places that oh guess what a top opium producer in Afghanistan the top opium producer brother of Mohammed Karzai is on the CIA payroll oh my gosh is the CIA involved in opium
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  I don't know do birds fly, the ducks quack, I mean this is just asinine
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  so we'll be breaking that down in a bunch of other news more world government announcements taking place
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  Josh in Illinois you're on the air welcome
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  hey Alex
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  welcome
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  how you doing
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  I love you bro
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  I love all you guys
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  you guys are an inspiration to humanity keep up the excellent work
[16:25.000 --> 16:39.000]  I just wanted to call have a couple pig flu stories for you but your follow republic was just like totally jam packed with information
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  there was a caller who was pulling sound off and copying it to the internet
[16:44.000 --> 16:51.000]  I think that's a great way for everyone to get more of this information out
[16:51.000 --> 17:08.000]  and I'm a little nervous but I think that you know and you've mentioned this before if we can take everything that this global elite structure is pinning against us
[17:08.000 --> 17:16.000]  and you know do a switcheroo and use everything that they're trying to pin up down with against them
[17:16.000 --> 17:27.000]  you know I mean if they want a global world currency and power structure or government
[17:27.000 --> 17:38.000]  then why don't we take the framework of the Constitution, the United States, the Bill of Rights and turn that into the global model
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  and run with all of their programs into pushing the real freedom
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  the problem is and I hear you Josh and I appreciate your call the establishment, the controllers, the social engineers they built the structure
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  the world governments already in place they're just announcing it now to everyone while they were building it they denied it existed
[17:57.000 --> 18:05.000]  now they've unveiled it and it's exactly what we said it was down to the finest detail because we were only reading their public blueprints
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  their operations are public they just weren't publicized
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  let's talk to John in New Jersey, John you're on the air
[18:14.000 --> 18:26.000]  yeah greetings Alex, yeah a follower of the republic is certainly arming me and giving me power and knowledge and I salute you
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  well I salute you what's on your mind
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  well you know I lost my job two months ago and I'm currently unemployed
[18:34.000 --> 18:42.000]  but I want to pay off all my bills my wife and I we have an obligation and we want to pay off all our bills
[18:42.000 --> 18:55.000]  it turns out and I spoke to my accountant that aside from the huge penalty I have to get hit with by early retirement which are all of my funds
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  I think I said that right you know the withdrawal of my funds
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  yes getting it out of your 401k the penalty
[19:00.000 --> 19:08.000]  well aside from that and perhaps maybe even working out a settlement with the credit card people
[19:08.000 --> 19:18.000]  that gets counted as income by the way if the credit card companies say look we'll settle for this amount of money
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  but we're going to have to report the rest of the balance to the IRS and you'll have to deal with them
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  yes everything is designed to keep you in the market and to keep you from spending your own money
[19:30.000 --> 19:38.000]  and to penalize you if you try to get out of debt and on top of all this Barack Obama's reform of the credit card industry
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  is to let them have 30% interest rates on people that have paid their bills
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  and so they've got you between a rock and a hard place and that is their plan
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  anything else said John
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  just keep it up Alex because the information you're arming me with just makes me a better person each and every day
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  and God bless America
[19:58.000 --> 20:22.000]  take care John

[24:04.000 --> 24:18.000]  continuing with wide open telephones big news blitz coming up in the middle of the next segment at 40 after cover all the top stories in detail let's go ahead and talk to Mike and Colorado Mike you're on the air thanks for holding
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Mr. Jones good to talk to you sir you're a warrior
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  good to talk to you what's on your mind
[24:24.000 --> 24:37.000]  okay I just got recently exposed to a couple guys they're called the yes men the yes men are a really hip
[24:37.000 --> 24:48.000]  very diverse diversively hit and just
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  their filmmakers who go around pulling stunts showing how corrupt society is
[24:53.000 --> 25:09.000]  that's right and I was I consider myself a fairly awake individual and I was very taken in by these guys but they're they subversively support national health care and permanent missions of legislation and the Copenhagen treaty
[25:09.000 --> 25:27.000]  yes the control left is putting out all sorts of activists that try to mimic what we do and try to counterfeit so is the controlled right with people like Glenn Beck because they know they've got a revolution on their hands so they need to be able to cover the field and cover all the bases
[25:27.000 --> 25:49.000]  that's what they're attempting to do right now but I was a little bit familiar with the yes men and they certainly do have a establishment bent to them while posing as anti-establishment yeah I was totally taken in by that I was putting up their videos on YouTube and Facebook and then I really looked into it a little bit
[25:49.000 --> 26:04.000]  and I was like wow these guys are not who I thought they were well that's just like George Soros is leading the fight against the bankers when he's one of the king pins and they have a MSNBC show on in the morning that talks about the bankers looting and robbing us but then they go on to support the
[26:04.000 --> 26:20.000]  carbon treaty and national health care and sell it as if the banks are against it when the banks are the ones that have written up the entire plan to take over our lives so yes you've got to really investigate the full spectrum of what an organization or media outlet is pushing
[26:20.000 --> 26:35.000]  thank you so much Mike Caroline in Louisiana you're on the air yes good morning Mr. Alex I pray to God for you every day you are my hero you woke me up and I thank you so much for everything you've done thank you
[26:35.000 --> 26:57.000]  I wanted to just make a comment especially about vaccines and I have a reason for this my brother just my brother died at the end of June and it was a real all of a sudden thing he started getting sinus problems and he started having some physical
[26:57.000 --> 27:16.000]  problems and they finally got him to the hospital I could not figure out what was going on until the very end when he when he got diagnosed with T cell lymphoma we have no idea where it came from there was a lot of it comes from the vaccines that's why cancers many types are up over
[27:16.000 --> 27:32.000]  two thousand percent Dale Dudley the local ninety three point seven host took a flu vaccine and within months he his hands were becoming paralyzed he couldn't hold a pen he was having trouble
[27:32.000 --> 27:50.000]  walking his whole body was numb and now his toe he his words are my toe is dead and he finally went to all these specialist medical doctors and they said you had the onset of Gillian beret syndrome and the only thing that could have done it was the vaccine
[27:50.000 --> 28:07.000]  but he's now recovered except for his toe his big toe is just completely numb and in paralyzed and this happens to people that take the shots and they get cancer and they get brain damage and they get eczema and they get autoimmune disorders and they
[28:07.000 --> 28:22.000]  get allergies and all the medical research shows it the medical inserts say it can do it to you and it is eugenics and so people are getting maimed and debilitated and handicapped and killed all around us
[28:22.000 --> 28:42.000]  that's right and the thing is the one question the first question I asked my dad right after he gave me the news was dad did you and and my my brother gray did you both get flu shots and he says yes we did we did at the beginning of the year we always do that
[28:42.000 --> 29:00.000]  and I'm just I'm my heart just saying because also my mom had breast cancer and she wasn't she was avid flu shot taker an avid vaccine taker along with my father who was
[29:00.000 --> 29:18.000]  a man let me let me let me tell you what's going on don't believe me go to the German news build their spiegel on the last month top virologist top geneticist top medical doctors with multiple medical degrees at major top
[29:18.000 --> 29:34.000]  institutes are saying the vaccines all have cancer viruses in them and they know the polio vaccine killed tens of millions alone in the U.S. with the
[29:34.000 --> 29:50.000]  virus Simeon virus 40 they know it and I'm so sad for you Caroline there's a good chance they did kill your brother and just like Reuters came out and said oh a lot of people are going to be dying after the shot but it's not the shot

[31:13.000 --> 31:29.000]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off
[31:29.000 --> 31:44.000]  short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[33:13.000 --> 33:33.000]  The whole point of government run health care is eugenics it is to restrict care to the old to the infirm to handicaps this is all stated it's done in England it's done in Canada
[33:33.000 --> 33:47.000]  The individual who is going to be the head of health and human services former senator John Daschle wrote in his own bestselling book quotes where they talked about rationing care and how people above 60 don't deserve to have eye surgery
[33:47.000 --> 34:07.000]  They wait years in many cases in England for treatable cancer surgeries it is a fact that they communalize your wealth they tax you at a higher rate the money is laundered through the banks and they basically give you a aspirin for a heart attack
[34:07.000 --> 34:26.000]  But now a Michigan Democrat is saying Pelosi not happy with him representative Bart Stupak said speaker Pelosi is not pleased with his efforts to change abortion related provisions in the health care bill crafted by the house and now more than 40 house Democrats are saying they're not going to vote for it
[34:26.000 --> 34:44.000]  If they don't put a provision in there that there's no government funding for abortion forcing the pop the the public the population who is against abortion to pay for it and they do this at the county city and state level all over the nation
[34:44.000 --> 35:02.000]  And it's just absolutely immoral to force people to pay for other people to kill their children. It's just absolutely abhorrent and I wanted to go back to a couple months ago when Nancy Pelosi was honest about how we don't need these unwanted babies
[35:02.000 --> 35:20.000]  We're going to save money with less people on earth we're going to have lower health care cost and that's the mindset the establishment the control freaks the eugenicist want to freeze society and society's development and then start dismantling our industries
[35:20.000 --> 35:38.000]  This is UN statements by the head of the biological diversity assessment team for the UN morey strong 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit and he stated it is our job at the United Nations destroy industrialized society and reduce world population
[35:38.000 --> 35:48.000]  You can go read his quotes you can watch morey strong on television on YouTube and TV interview after TV interview saying get rid of babies
[35:48.000 --> 36:03.000]  Euthanize people reduce the world population and so the idea they have is socialize the wealth get everybody on the government dole and then say oh you'll get better health care and pit groups against each other
[36:03.000 --> 36:12.000]  You'll get more health care if we can just have less people as if less people means better services a better life
[36:12.000 --> 36:30.000]  It's all about divide and conquer dividing different groups against each other and the establishment is the referee is the arbiter over it all it's all about divide and conquer Nancy Pelosi says birth control will help the US economy less babies
[36:30.000 --> 36:45.000]  Means a better economy which is a lie on its face more babies means a younger population to pay for the aging population we are the oldest society in human history and it's only going to accelerate over the next 30 years
[36:45.000 --> 37:03.000]  The oldest society we have a lopsided society because our grandparents and parents up until the 1960s had an average of four children in some regions more we now have an average of 1.3 children in the United States
[37:03.000 --> 37:18.000]  If you pull out the influx of immigrant populations or at 1.9 even if you count the 3 million illegal aliens and 1 million legals that come into replace our dying population worldwide from Japan to Germany to England
[37:18.000 --> 37:30.000]  There is a 1.3 population increase which is a reduction for every two people born they are only replacing themselves at 1.3
[37:30.000 --> 37:47.000]  So how is aborting more babies going to replace the population did you know that the indigenous black population by indigenous Africans brought here in the last 400 years in the transatlantic slave trade
[37:47.000 --> 38:04.000]  There are more black babies in the last decade running look up the national statistics more black babies are aborted than are born so how have blacks gone from 11% of the population to 12 in the last decade
[38:04.000 --> 38:20.000]  Massive African influx from Nigeria from Somalia from South Africa the list goes on and on as Africa implodes so blacks blacks who've lived here for hundreds of years are dying as well
[38:20.000 --> 38:35.000]  And they're only being replaced with true Africans originally not you know their ancestors the last 300 for years weren't from the US they are immigrants directly from the continent of Africa
[38:35.000 --> 38:50.000]  So we're not even replacing our numbers and Nancy Pelosi is running around saying that we need to have less babies and more abortion is good for the economy
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  I mean even if you're for abortion and think it's a wonderful right you have and a great thing and you know don't use birth control just go have a risky procedure
[38:58.000 --> 39:06.000]  Go in there and somebody can just use a vacuum cleaner and some knives or pump some salt sand and burn the baby to death as it struggles and fights for its life
[39:06.000 --> 39:22.000]  And they have tens of thousands every year partial birth abortions in the ninth month and then hundreds and hundreds of people have been saved and dug out of trash cans by pro-lifers and are now famous speakers speaking out against it
[39:22.000 --> 39:33.000]  I mean they could even adopt the baby even though there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are abortions that's why we again import from South Korea
[39:33.000 --> 39:44.000]  And the Middle East and Asia and Europe babies many of them kidnapped from their parents by CPS that's the big dirty secret in Europe and Russia
[39:44.000 --> 39:54.000]  Because people want babies but they can't get them from the abortion worries because they need to be used so their retinas can be ripped out and I'm sorry to have to talk like this ladies and gentlemen
[39:54.000 --> 40:03.000]  But this is what's going on even if you're for abortion abortion you need to know see oh I don't want to hear about it
[40:03.000 --> 40:22.000]  It's one thing to use dog kidneys or monkey kidneys to breed the viruses for the vaccines but it's another thing to use insect cells because that gives you insect mutagens, insect bacteria,
[40:22.000 --> 40:35.000]  micro plasms and viruses and now in the last few years they discovered even smaller viruses and even smaller bacteria inside the viruses inside the bacteria that all gets bred up and injected into you
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.000]  If you don't care about your health you know that's your business I guess though it mutates in your own body and then you spread it
[40:41.000 --> 41:00.000]  But we have to add to that equation that they're taking baby retinas as their favorite cell line for cloning these viruses for some reason fetal retinas are the best system
[41:00.000 --> 41:14.000]  Fetal retinas human beings devalued down to the point where we're like produce we're like an eggplant or a squash or a piece of chicken you buy at the store or a gallon of milk
[41:14.000 --> 41:25.000]  We've been completely dehumanized and we're being trained that euthanasia is good government forced euthanasia killing people that don't even want to die going on all over the world
[41:25.000 --> 41:41.000]  The Chinese government with 24 mobile execution vans in every one of their major cities per city driving around killing political dissidents selling their organs keeping people in prisons blood typing them
[41:41.000 --> 42:00.000]  Fall on gong Buddhist Christians and our media doesn't do exposes on it our supposed media doesn't talk about it they don't discuss it they just say oh a young gay man was beaten up and then he committed suicide
[42:00.000 --> 42:18.000]  Pulling on heartstrings they don't tell you the government in the hepatitis shots and gay men it's been declassified gave them HIV oh no they just make everybody feel sorry and say oh we need to federalize local police and restrict the first amendment
[42:18.000 --> 42:44.000]  See it's all manipulation all lies but here is Nancy Pelosi with Stephanophilus on national television saying that abortion will save us money and help the US economy when every index and every economic data point you look at proves
[42:44.000 --> 42:59.000]  That we need a massive population explosion we need people to be having at least four children to pay for all the old people all you stupid baby boomers that are 5560 and are arrogant right now
[42:59.000 --> 43:19.000]  And you're running around as as trendies who are for euthanasia and socialist healthcare you have no idea you're destroying your own future and that you're going to be euthanized you have no idea you have no idea what you're part of and you're cheerleading and and and and putting down
[43:19.000 --> 43:33.000]  Anybody you're cheerleading for not having more than one child that they have a big carbon footprint and babies are bad for the earth literally thousands of news articles saying it constantly in every publication I see every major
[43:33.000 --> 43:48.000]  Newstand I walk up to the messages on the cover of magazines everywhere babies are bad people come up to women and grocery stores that have 345 kids and get in their face and say you're a breeder you're hurting the environment arrogant control freaks
[43:48.000 --> 44:05.000]  What do you think is going to pay the taxes for you slugs. Oh, you'll bring in the third world population. That's what you're going to do. Let's go ahead and play the Nancy Pelosi clip and go back to your calls hundreds of million dollars to expand family planning
[44:05.000 --> 44:27.000]  How is that stimulus well the family planning services reduced cost it reduced cost the states are in terrible fiscal budget crisis now and part of it what we do for children's health or education and some of those elements that are to help the states meet their financial needs
[44:27.000 --> 44:40.000]  One of those one of the initiatives you mentioned the contraception is well reduce cost to the state and to the federal no apologies for that no apologies no
[44:40.000 --> 44:59.000]  To the state everything is the state as if the federal government and that district of criminals up there on the Potomac as if they help us they give us the money it's free money they send it to us they take a dollar
[44:59.000 --> 45:17.000]  On average they send back 30 cents with strings attached to it on how to run our lives and I get to hear governors and legislature members of the different states constantly thanking the feds oh without you what would we do without you Nancy Pelosi
[45:17.000 --> 45:33.000]  With their own Air Force One size aircraft and now the entire leadership of the House and Senate are getting their own full size jets with their own private security details Praetorian Guard running around looting everyone oh thank you Pelosi
[45:33.000 --> 45:49.000]  You make the grass grow you make the birds sing you make the sun come out during the day and the moon come out at night you do everything oh Pelosi you the God like governor of the House of Representatives what would we do without you
[45:49.000 --> 46:08.000]  Oh please give us more vaccines filled with mercury and cancer viruses oh so we can have all the people having all these degenerative diseases so the system is even bankrupted more and then all the healthcare system will offer us more vaccines and more drugs to kill us
[46:08.000 --> 46:21.000]  Oh thank you Pelosi for all the federal funds to put school children on Ritalin and Prozac that shrinks their brains and swells their hearts and gives them heart palpitations and causes them to be obese and unhealthy
[46:21.000 --> 46:32.000]  Oh thank you Pelosi for all the blessings you give us you're so wonderful Pelosi black in Florida black you're on the air
[46:32.000 --> 46:45.000]  Yeah how are you doing I'll just have the all waking people up I was just like I go to school over here in what's it called over in Florida right and I talk to many different people from many different races and whatever and whatever
[46:45.000 --> 46:58.000]  and I found the best thing to wake them up is like what's it called like you have to kind of like educate them you have to tell them you can't only like tell them what's going on you have to tell them like like how how how everything could be better for example
[46:58.000 --> 47:09.000]  like you know like how the government just had this on class for conquer thing and had three billion dollars and it gave forty five hundred dollars to each person for a car right
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  Yes
[47:11.000 --> 47:19.000]  Yeah you know they get forty five hundred yes and you know about that solo panel thing you talk about and all these osmosis whatever that can help you
[47:19.000 --> 47:30.000]  You know I'm saying like how they can get like um like like to care for yourself just in case you know how that everybody knows something is happening something is going to come because I thought to my teachers and all different types of stuff
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.000]  they know something is going to happen but they don't know like what's going to happen they don't know like like what's really going on they just know that something is going to happen
[47:37.000 --> 47:48.000]  No that's a good point that's a great point I appreciate your call everyone knows something's wrong everyone's instincts the evidence everyone knows the government lies 99% of the time
[47:48.000 --> 48:01.000]  99% of the time and everyone knows we're in big trouble the problem is they don't know specifically what's happening that's why I made fall of the republic that's why I made the Obama deception
[48:01.000 --> 48:17.000]  these two films together are premier premier tools to explain who the elite are what their power structure is what their game plan is how they're hurting society

[49:26.000 --> 49:42.000]  hello yes go ahead hey I'm John from New York I don't listen to you for about two years now I actually have one person from New York I had the mandatory vaccination I worked in the
[49:42.000 --> 49:58.000]  IT department not even dear patients but they said you'll either get fired take the shot I refuse the shot and then luckily they put it on hold which I think was just a cover up and we know why that happened that's because enough people they made you feel like you were all along all alone
[49:58.000 --> 50:14.000]  but first 60% and over 70% of New York state doctors and nurses and medical workers said no and so that's been all over the news this week the headline New York suspends mandatory vaccine but they'll still try to lie and corner you
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  and tell you to take it though your supervisor probably hasn't even taken it.
[50:18.000 --> 50:32.000]  No actually the sad thing is everyone ran to take it for the exception of like two or three people that luckily over the year I've woken up but everyone just ran to get it and then they're like oh wait we don't have to take it now and then they're all shitting them so I'm sorry.

[54:30.000 --> 54:49.000]  Angel Rebel, we're going to be going to all your phone calls.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  And at eight after, I'm going to go through all the news.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  I got sidetracked with Pelosi and government paid for abortions.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  Look, if you want these control freaks micromanaging your life and telling you what you can and can't do
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  and rationing your health care, you need your head examined.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  But you talk to the general public who does support government-controlled health care
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  and it is a minority, but it's a large minority. It's over 40% of the population.
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  These are idiots. They really think they're going to get free health care from the government.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  They really think the same government that's done thousands of chemical and biological
[55:22.000 --> 55:29.000]  radiological secret tests on the people, including lethal tests, killing people,
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  should now run our health care and that all the banks and bureaucracies and groups that are involved
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  aren't going to screw us. Oh, NAFTA and GATT was going to be great for Detroit.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  Detroit and other major cities in the Rust Belt are imploding.
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.000]  California is a failed state, the seventh largest economy in the world.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  Everyone who's got any money is evacuating.
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.000]  Major newspapers in New York are reporting that they're having a flight of almost all of their middle class.
[55:58.000 --> 56:05.000]  They're raising hundreds of new taxes. Chicago, New York, they have snitch programs spying on your neighbors.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  Are they paying all their taxes? Does their car have all the stickers up to date?
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  Call the police. Get a bonus.
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  The biggest growth industry in the United States after prisons are people who are professional snitches
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  who just go around tattling and ratting on people.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Oh, my neighbor's three-year-old was in their backyard playing unattended.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  It didn't matter that mama was inside watching them out the window.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  It doesn't matter that the three-year-old is in a fenced-in playground.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  CPS comes and they take your child and then they go to the government trough
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  and they get tens of thousands of dollars a month for keeping your child.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  Then they put your kid on drugs and then they become a disabled child that get even more money.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  They put your child through the system, rape them, drug them, do whatever they want to them.
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.000]  And when they're 25 years old and their mind is totally blown from anti-psychotics,
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  they dump them out on the street mumbling and talking to themselves on the street corner.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  Go talk to one of those people.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  Nine times out of ten, they got grabbed by the CPS when they were a little kid.
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  The system sucked them dry, raped them, did everything else to them,
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.000]  and then dumped them out on the street, blown out, drugged out zombies.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  You talk to them, they go,
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  I was seven and the state took me.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  I was happy, child.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  My mother cried.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  They drugged me.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  Then they let me go when I was 24.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  Uh, uh, uh, uh.
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  I mean, it's just a giant wrecking machine.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  A giant wrecking machine, savaging everyone.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  And I'm so sick of this government.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  I'm so sick of these social engineers.
[58:00.000 --> 58:13.000]  Sick of them and the disease and pestilence that they breed by design on purpose.
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  We need to understand this is not just a corrupt system.
[58:17.000 --> 58:24.000]  It is a group of murderous psychopathic control freaks who enjoy hurting people
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  and who enjoy wrecking society
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  and who enjoy the fact that you're dumbed down and brain damage from fluoride.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  They enjoy the fact they've implanted you with cancer viruses.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  They enjoy the feeling of power.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  It's a self-satisfied look on their face, and I'd like to smash them.

[59:55.000 --> 59:59.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Big brother.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Mainstream media.

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  as he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:29.240]  We are back live into the second hour. Wide open telephones. I'm going to go through the
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:34.400]  three stats of important news on the other side of this break. But right now, let's go
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:42.880]  ahead and take a call. Let's talk to Virgil in Oklahoma, then Mark and others. Virgil, welcome.
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:49.080]  Hey, Alex. How's it going, man? Good. I wanted to plug an idea of mine that I've got. And this is
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:54.200]  assuming the establishment gives us time to do this. 2010 house representatives, the whole
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:59.760]  freaking thing is up for grabs. I'm going to be starting a website soon that will hopefully
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:07.040]  organize and motivate the population into finding real people, not career politicians, to put into
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:13.520]  these seats. Worst case scenario, we stop legislation, make them show their hand. Best case
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:18.640]  scenario, we replace the cancer that is our system and start fighting back against the
[1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:23.000]  banksters and all that worldwide. But anyway, I wanted to get your input on that. Thanks,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:31.680]  man, and keep up the good work. Thank you. Big ideas start small. They start with the
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:40.920]  idea and then they get rolling by someone putting that idea into action. And it doesn't
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:48.360]  always work, but more times than not, it does. The idea to have the states declare sovereignty
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:55.040]  started back in the mid nineties and it's really gaining steam today. The idea to audit
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:02.880]  the Fed and then abolish it has been pushed by Ron Paul for close to 30 years. Now we're
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:08.520]  getting down to the end of the line and it's an, it's inexorable. They can try to block
[1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:13.720]  it this year or even next year, but now people are identifying the true government, the true
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:19.560]  power structure. And so time is running off with the establishment. If you see a slick
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:28.040]  establishment politician up there and the media is pushing them, you know they're bad.
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:37.120]  Vote out any incumbent Democrats, any Republicans that side with them, people like Lindsey Graham,
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:44.320]  and vote for people that actually have a good platform. It's constitutional. Government
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:53.720]  is the cancer. No matter who you put in office, if we can't massively cut the size of government,
[1:02:53.720 --> 1:03:00.160]  the corrupt institution of government itself will continue to metastasize and grow. That's
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:06.080]  why government tripled under George Bush, government tripled in the eight years of George
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:15.720]  W. Bush. It more than doubled exponentially in the first 10 months of Barack Obama's
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:20.280]  administration. You can just search into that term, startpage.com or Google or whatever
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:26.320]  you like. You can pull it up. Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:31.880]  combined, but that isn't Barack Obama doing that. He's just the latest front man as the
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:39.160]  total banking takeover accelerates into its final phase. Everything accelerates. It's
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:44.920]  like a piece of paper you throw in the fire. The first second or two, it yellows, it browns,
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:52.600]  it blackens, it crinkles, and then suddenly it flashes into flame. The flashing into flame
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:58.280]  has now begun. The open announcements of world government, global taxes, total micromanagement
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:07.640]  and control of your life. It's all happening now, but the enemy is strong at this point,
[1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:14.080]  but also weak because now they are revealing themselves. First, they said there is no world
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:18.240]  government. There is no plan for global tax. There's no such thing. The federal reserve
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.360]  isn't private. Now they go, yeah, it's private and we're going to regulate every facet of
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:26.800]  society and every facet of business and we're setting up a bank of the world. You're going
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.400]  to pay your taxes too, but if you want the economy to come back, you better give in to
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:36.480]  us. We've got a gun to your collective heads. But all the yuppies and trendy, see, they
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:42.480]  were told for decades, no such thing as world government. So they get up on TV and apologize
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:46.160]  and go, I guess world government does exist. Should we be for it or against it? And they
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:50.600]  go, I guess I'm for it because I like to feel like I'm part of the establishment. So I'll
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:57.240]  go ahead and say I'm for world government. These are pathetic social climbing jellyfish
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:01.920]  and they are our enemies. They are the real problem. This is Alex Jones with five good
[1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:06.960]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:11.480]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:16.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:21.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:26.280]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:31.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:35.080]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:40.080]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:43.520]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:50.480]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.960]  We purify our air and we purify our water and yet we forget to purify our bodies. Funny,
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:23.600]  our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day. Isn't it

[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:44.320]  All right, I'm going to go through some of the news today and then we're going to take
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:50.080]  your phone calls. And I would hope that listeners would want to comment on some of the news
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:09:00.360]  items I have here in front of me today. The New York Times calmly reports as if they're
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:09.560]  just talking about the price of motor oil. They just calmly report that the brother
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:15.840]  of Afghan leader is said to be on CIA payroll. Gee, you think so? I mean, Mohammed Karzai
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:21.120]  is a former Unicol executive tied in with the State Department and the CIA. That entire
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:26.440]  government is a puppet government. It's admitted it's a puppet government and the people are
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:33.340]  tired of being occupied there. And there is always going to be civil war and death there
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:43.840]  because of the 500 plus billion dollars of raw opium that is shipped out of the nation
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:58.680]  each year. Over 80% of world opium is produced inside of Afghanistan. The US forces guard
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:04.360]  the opium and the excuse says, well, if we don't guard it and work with the warlords,
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:10.280]  they'll turn against us. That's how they sell our government, our media, our culture on
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:16.640]  pure evil. Oh yes, we're guarding it. But then if you're caught using it in Austin, Texas
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:26.400]  or in Chicago, Illinois, you're going to be put in prison. That's how this works. That's
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:33.080]  how this country works. It is the ultimate in hypocrisy. And they go on to admit that
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:40.880]  he is one of the biggest narcotics traffickers in the country. So I'm going to go over more
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:49.760]  of that later. There is a report here out of the Associated Press headline troops already
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:58.840]  outnumbered Taliban 12 to one. There are more than 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:05.840]  working with 200,000 Afghan security forces and police. It adds up to 12 to one numerical
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:12.920]  advantage over Taliban rebels, but it hasn't led to anything close to victory because you've
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:18.960]  got a bunch of different tribes killing each other. You've got a bunch of different drug
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:28.280]  dealing tribes, drug dealing warlords. Most of them are controlled by the mayor of Kabul,
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:33.200]  Muhammad Karzai, the puppet president. He's really the mayor. That's all they hold and
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:39.640]  a few other cities and they have aircraft that fly over and spray with pesticides, the
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.600]  poppy fields that don't launder their money and their drugs through the CIA and the Federal
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:49.880]  Reserve. They sell it to the Russians and they sell it to the Pakistanis and they sell
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:55.720]  it to the Chinese. All the governments and all the secret police are involved in becoming
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:02.760]  billionaires. It's very fun and they're not going to be billionaires if opium and all
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:09.280]  its derivatives like heroin were decriminalized and said you poor, pathetic, stupid junkie
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:18.200]  on opiates destroying your life. The minute you decriminalize it, the junkies stop robbing
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:27.880]  your house, your computer, your jewelry, your car to get the $300 a day habit because now
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:32.800]  it's as cheap as cigarettes. And if they want to go ruin their lives and kill themselves,
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:38.320]  that's the case. And Europe has decriminalized and guess what? People stopped using heroin
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:44.120]  by over 50%. You can go pull the statistics up because they, they understand it's dirty.
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:52.200]  It's stupid. It's big bloody bruises all over you and tracks in your arteries, in your veins.
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:13:00.480]  It's dirty and disgusting, but all the crime leaves. This is a tax to the CIA and the Federal
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:04.880]  Reserve and how do the young women pay for it? They go out and they hook their bodies.
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:09.720]  They go out and they lay down with five, 10 men a day. They get HIV. They get hepatitis.
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:15.280]  They live in dirty hotel rooms. So all the money can be pumped back to the bankers. And
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:20.200]  so cops can run around running checkpoints, feeling real authoritative, searching your
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:25.040]  car. I don't use your dirty, filthy smack. I don't use your marijuana. I don't use your
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.440]  methamphetamine. I don't use your cocaine. I don't use any of your crap. I don't use
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:35.640]  your Ritalin, your Prozac, your flu shots, any of it. You got me. You scum, you filth,
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:41.520]  you trash that shipped this stuff in and pushing on our society. All right, I meant
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:48.800]  to just mention the headline. It's just, I'll never forget. It was about six months ago.
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:54.400]  I'm driving in the car home. You're listening to XM slash serious. Actually, I'm serious
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:14:02.680]  in my car, but now it's XM serious. The point is I'm driving in my car and I listened to
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:09.400]  a BBC news report 10 minutes long and everything is archived now at bbc.com. I meant to write
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:13.720]  down the name of it. I did and then wrote it on a receipt and then forgot to pull it
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:19.800]  up. I'm so busy. There's so much news, but it was a report on opium production. Somebody
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:23.520]  should dig that out and put it on YouTube. I wanted to play clips of it here, but the
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:29.480]  point is here's the New York times where they just in a paragraph just lightly mentioned,
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:38.400]  oh, he's the biggest drug dealer in the country. And by the way, he works for the CIA, Muhammad
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:45.200]  Karzai's brother. Of course he does, but, but there's that headline. You can go read
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:54.400]  that brother of Afghan leader is said to be a CIA payroll, but I'm driving down the road
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:15:02.320]  and I'm listening to the BBC and they report massive news like it's no big deal. Just like
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.760]  mainstream media will go, yeah, a lot of people do get yelling and beret or have seizures
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:11.840]  or die from the vaccine, but it's, it's, it's a good cause to pay. It's, it's, you know,
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:17.280]  the benefits outweigh the dangers. It doesn't. There are a few newscasts that tell the truth
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:24.080]  like that or some of the truth that they admitted can hurt you. It's the same thing with the
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:28.840]  whole opium situation. They admitted it was a $500 billion and that's raw. That's coming
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:35.480]  out of the country, 500 billion, $500 billion industry a year. It's secret like gold or,
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:41.600]  or, or art or collectibles. That's a whole black market currency, but the elites traffic
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:46.640]  in. So they get to loan it out eight to 10 times through fractional reserve banking.
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:56.840]  So what's a, what's 10 times 500 billion? It's, it's, it's $5 trillion, $5 trillion just out
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:04.160]  of Afghanistan. Now you now understand why the troops are there, but they just calmly
[1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:13.240]  announced and calmly admitted like they were talking about the price of pork bellies on
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:19.240]  the Chicago mercantile that the United States is a delicate balancing act fighting the Taliban
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:26.800]  and El Qaeda. That's how they say it in England. El Qaeda. They have a delicate balancing act
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:31.280]  when fighting the Taliban and El Qaeda, working with local warlords and chiefs whose main
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:38.160]  source of income is opium. So the US and British forces, German forces and UN, I for forces
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:45.060]  as well as NATO are forced to protect the opium. They don't like it, but they do it.
[1:16:45.060 --> 1:16:49.720]  And they cut to somebody from the state department going in the US. Well, yes, so we do have
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:53.840]  to do this or that would give the Taliban and El Qaeda a foothold and then they would take
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:17:00.320]  over. We've got to work with people and we don't like it, but, but Jeepers creepers.
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:06.440]  That's why you see us troops on mountain tops over the opium valleys. And yes, we do eradicate
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:11.440]  some. Would you eradicate some? And then they go on to say the Taliban and El Qaeda is opium.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:18.640]  So they can't. Who do you think the warlords are? Who do you think these people are?
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:24.160]  The author of Jobbreaker, the CIA section chief who retired who we had on a few years ago.
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:31.600]  He admitted, he said, yes, the Taliban and El Qaeda did work for us previously, not anymore,
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:38.440]  of course. Doesn't matter if the FBI translator, civil Edmonds is now broken or gag ordering
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:50.440]  on public three months ago and stated on the record in court that the classified information
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:54.800]  that she told the 9 11 commission and that she was ordered to not tell the public was
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:01.200]  that she was listening to chatter of El Qaeda and Taliban taking orders from the CIA on
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:08.000]  the day of 9 11. She said they worked for them until the day of 9 11.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:13.760]  Of course they did. And she said it was child kidnapping, money laundering, weapons running.
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:22.360]  Of course. Why does the CIA love Arab extremist and Muslim extremists, especially Wahhabist?
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:28.080]  Because they are cult members, folks. They are nuts. You can have a high level CIA operative
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:33.960]  like bin Laden or his henchmen and they can give orders to real psychopathic Muslim extremists
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:39.480]  who really think they're kidnapping children and bombing buildings and running drugs to
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:46.640]  fight the Western infidels. They're they're organic mind control slaves from the Muslim
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:51.520]  nations. This is better than any Manchurian candidate.
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:56.240]  They have been raised to believe this. This is in some of their cultures and some of the
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:01.000]  minority groups of the cultures. And they don't know they're working for Israel in the
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:04.920]  United States. They don't know they're working for British Intel, though it's been declassified
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:11.660]  many times. It was a Muslim extremist used to overthrow Mohammed Mosaic in 1953 and Iran.
[1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:17.840]  Operation Ajax, that's declassified. The U.S. and England went in and funded the Mullahs
[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:25.960]  to overthrow the government because it was a secular mainline government. You see, that's
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:32.720]  what's so sick about this. Al Qaeda is Muslim terrorist. They are extremist and they've
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:39.000]  got people working for them who don't even know they're working for the U.S. government.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:45.440]  That is how sick this is. And the troops are out there guarding the opium going, gee, well,
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:51.120]  oh, I guess we do this on the Taliban and Al Qaeda don't get the money. And then they
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:55.320]  just admit it like it's no big deal in the New York Times. You're called straight ahead
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:20:00.920]  in a bunch of other news. Stay with us.
[1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:05.900]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity

[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:18.720]  for tarp, $122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie. The result? A deficit of over
[1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:24.840]  $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:30.560]  20%. Now the good news. Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:36.320]  and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival

[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:09.920]  Start your healthy lifestyle now. Come, you masters of war. Here to build the big guns.
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:25.560]  If you search the news term, county, city, state, feds to pay for tips on tax cheats,
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:31.240]  or environment cheats, or child abuse which means yelling at your child. It's not illegal
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:37.280]  to still take your child. You will see hundreds of new articles a day. They're just advertising
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:46.440]  everywhere to tattle and to spy. Here is the NBC headline out of Chicago Rats. City to
[1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:53.080]  pay for informing on tax cheats. Meanwhile, the feds in the last decade have reduced by
[1:24:53.080 --> 1:25:00.440]  over 90% the amount of FBI agents, secret service, Treasury Department investigators
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:09.320]  on supposed tax cheats for people worth more than a million dollars. They focus the few
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:13.800]  tax investigators, and I understand the income taxes of fraud the private Federal reserve.
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:19.080]  But if you're going to have it, the point is it's selectively enforced. More than half
[1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:24.600]  of Congress, the news is reported, is either behind on their taxes or don't pay taxes.
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:32.240]  Huge portions of the Treasury Department don't pay taxes. Geithner is a good example of that.
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.960]  Look at Rangel owning all these homes he wasn't paying for. These people do what they want,
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:43.800]  when they want, how they want. And then meanwhile, they're training the public to spy and tattle
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:51.280]  on each other. The reward would amount to some sort of percentage. Yes, that is the
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:58.680]  headline. You get a percentage of whatever comes in. So this is our new economy, everyone
[1:25:58.680 --> 1:26:04.360]  informing and spying and tattling. And it's not just about money. The government can monetize
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:08.360]  the debt, just issue itself whatever amount of money it wants. This is about dividing
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:14.640]  people further and not making the public trust each other so that everyone goes into a chilling
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:21.120]  effect paradigm, shuts up, keeps their mouth shut, doesn't stick their head up above the
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  grass for fear it'll get cut off and society spirals downwards into tyranny. Chicago and
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:35.400]  Cook County residents aren't the only ones about to get shocking tax news. The city is
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:40.400]  debuting the tax whistleblower plan that could turn neighbor against neighbor in Chicago's
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:45.040]  business community. The folks at City Hall will pay cash bounties to informants who
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:50.600]  turn in business tax cheats around the city. The reward would amount to some sort of percentage
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:58.720]  of the tax money that the city recovers. And that will be another divide and conquer strategy.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:02.240]  It's just another way to bring people into compliance. Revenue Department spokesman Ed
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:11.560]  Walsh told The Sun Times, one of the few things holding our economy up is that many businesses
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:16.520]  do cheat on their taxes and they'll tell you they couldn't operate. They couldn't keep
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:22.120]  their doors open if they didn't cheat on some taxes. I don't cheat on any of the taxes,
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:26.040]  though most of them are unconstitutional because we're obviously under an incredible
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:32.040]  magnifying glass here. And so I am able to raise the money through advertising and DVD
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:38.880]  and book sales and donations to operate. And your donations and purchases are not tax exempt.
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:49.520]  I pay the stinkers, you know, 35% tax brackets when I'm in. Though I do try to spend most
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:53.920]  the money that comes in on the business, on the operation. So a lot of it doesn't end
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:58.320]  up getting paid in taxes because we can write most of it off, but still my employees all
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:03.520]  pay taxes. And that's just the way it is. Because I have to choose my battles. I sit
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.600]  here and expose the private fellow reserve and their 1913 income tax that didn't become
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:13.120]  widespread till 1951. And I point out how our country was built without it and how all
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.840]  of its paid for interest on the debt to foreign banks. Ronald Reagan's own 1981 congressional
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.560]  commission found that. And so I sit here and point out it's criminal and wrong and bad,
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:26.520]  but I choose my battles because I can't end up going to prison or going to court and fighting
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:33.320]  some three, four year tax case. But I happen to know that the average business cheats on
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:39.840]  taxes. And I know a lot of people that have gone to prison for not paying taxes. And they're
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:44.480]  normally blue collar or lower middle class people. And they get the book thrown at them
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:50.680]  for 10, 20, $30,000 a year of taxes. They didn't pay. And you find out what their yearly
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:55.040]  income is. Some of the business people I know who've been indicted, who've plead bargained,
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:59.600]  who've gone to prison for six months a year, federally or to the state. These are people
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:05.160]  that were making $50, $60,000 a year at the end of the year. If they wouldn't have cheated
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:10.840]  on their taxes, they wouldn't even have made that you own a business. You got 10, 15 employees.
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:15.720]  They pay taxes. You cheat here and there. So you can have a little bit of money for yourself.
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:20.440]  They don't want that. They want you out of business. They want you bankrupt. And as they
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:28.680]  destroy the black market underground economy, more and more people will go on to welfare
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:32.840]  and go on to the roles and we will become an on the dole dependent society, which is
[1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:39.280]  the goal of the eugenicist. They want you under their control. Period. We'll come back with
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:43.160]  more of a news blitz. I'm going to hurry up a bit and go through a bunch of the headlines.
[1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:49.400]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231, Market, Alabama, Angel,
[1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:56.480]  Rebel, Jack and others. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[1:29:56.480 --> 1:30:05.920]  GCN radio network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:11.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll
[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:16.440]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:21.840]  president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:27.800]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies
[1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:33.360]  of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:38.000]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.120]  asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:47.960]  They seem like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[1:30:47.960 --> 1:30:54.240]  of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:31:02.360]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Hello, this is Alex Jones
[1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:06.680]  with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and
[1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:11.960]  a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get. In the battle
[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:16.840]  for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition. How much do
[1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:21.840]  you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:25.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:29.840]  children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:34.440]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:39.840]  food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will
[1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:44.960]  you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want
[1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:52.600]  all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on
[1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:59.960]  the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:04.080]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you all about a cola blue, the state of the art
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:08.700]  atmospheric waters generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity
[1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:13.800]  in the air you breathe. No, this isn't science fiction. It's very real. I know. I use one
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:18.780]  every day in my own home. And it's available right now to you. Clean, great tasting water
[1:32:18.780 --> 1:32:23.800]  without all the pollutants. Make the decision today to claim your own water independence
[1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:28.080]  by ordering your own a cola blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business.
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:32.720]  Just like I did. Their best seller, the a cola blue 28, produces up to seven gallons
[1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:37.560]  of water every day and is easy to use and economical. This system is free of chemicals
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:42.960]  and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.520]  and ultraviolet lights. Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the
[1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:56.040]  air by calling a cola blue at 1-800-691-6043. That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit a cola blue
[1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:17.840]  on the web at ECOLOBLUE.COM today. Think about the hypocrisy. Think about the corruption.
[1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:24.360]  Of foreign offshore banks that have purposely bankrupt hundreds of third world nations so
[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:29.480]  they could control them. It's in the IMF and World Bank policy reports. It's in documents
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:35.520]  leaked in 2002, covered by the BBC, how they do all of this by design. And they're now
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:43.560]  doing the same thing to the United States and Europe and Japan. And they want you bankrupt.
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:50.200]  They want you poor. They want to raise taxes to a point where you can't afford to work
[1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:55.400]  for yourself. You can only work for the big mega corporations who write all the tax loopholes
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:34:00.420]  and rules to where they don't have to basically pay any taxes. And then they're caught even
[1:34:00.420 --> 1:34:08.240]  cheating on those and not paying them. They have incentives to move their businesses offshore.
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:13.560]  They're based in offshore corporations. And the IMF and the World Bank and the OECD and
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:19.520]  all these international private consortiums were created and founded and run by the very
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:27.400]  same financial institutions that are now writing the tax rules where you can't hide two pennies
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:35.080]  to rub together. The banks have written the tax rules to rob you and then government gives
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:44.160]  them your money. And I know the listeners are aware of this, but it gives me a headache
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:54.640]  to think about it. It makes my head spin to realize that it's only going to intensify
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:35:02.600]  and the dumbed down public has no idea what's happening to them. And the corrupt so-called
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:13.840]  government publicly protects the poppy fields and helps ship the heroin out of the nation
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:20.560]  of Afghanistan. And that's why the troops are there. And that's why the Pentagon sends
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:27.800]  out predator drones and reapers to bomb and kill weddings and to kill villagers so that
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:33.880]  the tribal villagers who believe in an eye for an eye will strike back so the illusion
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:46.960]  of a war can continue so that U.S. forces and U.N. forces over 200,000 Afghan security
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:53.640]  forces, 100,000 international troops, 300,000 total can stay there in the country to sit
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:36:01.360]  on top those opium fields. And that's just one business of the New World Order. One
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:07.640]  of their businesses, their businesses are all death, heroin, cocaine, Ritalin, Prozac,
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:15.680]  cancer-laced, mercury-laced vaccines, CPS kidnapping everybody's children, environmental
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:21.000]  groups stealing people's private property, the feds harassing farms and ranches under
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:27.960]  animal ID and premises ID, always more money, always more funds for police and bureaucrats
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:37.880]  and control freaks as society goes to hell in a handbasket.
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:51.760]  New York Times, Afghan opium kingpin on CIA payroll, just so unbelievable. And then meanwhile,
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:57.360]  as many as 39,000 homeless people are checking into New York City shelters each night. I
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:05.840]  saw a news report last week that in Detroit, they have a government welfare program, a
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:12.160]  new government welfare program that had 3,200 slots offered and 55,000 people showed up
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:18.160]  wanting it. And I sent Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew to Detroit as well as Canada and D.C.
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.280]  for interviews for Fall of the Republic, too, we're working on. And I talked to him on
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:27.880]  the phone and they said it's worse than what the news has reported. You can drive for mile
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:34.640]  after mile and look at collapsing neighborhoods overgrown with vines, gangs of criminals running
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:42.240]  around, police everywhere, riding the few slaves' tickets as anyone who can leave exits
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:48.000]  and as the bureaucrats try to raise taxes on the dwindling tax base. That is the new
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:57.120]  world order. That is globalization. That is NAFTA again. And they love it. The bureaucrats
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:03.040]  love everything collapsing. They love just sitting on type of slag heap of a collapsing
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:19.720]  society as Michigan fades into some type of science fiction, dystopic mirage. D.C. is
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:27.080]  falling into rack and ruin. Los Angeles is falling into crime and cess. The country's
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:33.120]  overrun with hordes of desperate third world people driving down the wages, bankrupting
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:42.600]  state agencies. And the government is growing, growing, growing every minute, always expanding,
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:50.520]  always pushing its borders of control out, always setting new precedents of tyranny,
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:56.920]  warrantless checkpoints all over the country, federally funded. The federal government
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:02.120]  comes in and lobbies the state of Texas and other states to pass laws saying no more Fourth
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:07.800]  Amendment. We're going to take your blood at warrantless checkpoints and police are
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:15.960]  going to be taking it when a nurse of 20 years can still take five minutes to find a vein
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:29.600]  on somebody's arm. Warrantless DNA databases for 36 going on 37 years, a secret UN program
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:36.360]  in every industrialized nation, took blood from babies at birth and put it in a UN database.
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:42.560]  Over a decade ago, I got the classified documents. I had members of the U.S. Congress on about
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:49.920]  it. I had lawmakers from Australia on discussing it, how the police were using it for an illegal
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:56.400]  DNA database. People laughed at me. Now it's mainstream news. Ladies and gentlemen, the
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:03.480]  entire government needs to be abolished. It needs to be cut in size by 95%. Tens of thousands
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:10.680]  of corrupt bureaucrats and bankers must be arrested for the crimes they've committed.
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:15.600]  Ron Paul has told you the Treasury Department, the private fellow reserve, they can all be
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:20.400]  indicted for scores of felonies for what they've done with the banking system. Even though
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:24.840]  they wrote the laws where they could commit most of the crimes, they went further than
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:35.360]  even their own loopholes. We've got to come to grips with the fact that they're playing
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:42.880]  us off against each other, dividing and conquering, and that it is thoroughly and completely corrupt
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:51.840]  and out of control, and the bureaucrats are taking people's passive, lethargic, zombie-like
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:41:07.280]  attitude as a big, fat, flashing green light to press their foot on the accelerator. And
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:15.000]  so history is a roadmap for us. It proves that it's going to get worse and worse and
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  worse and worse, intensifying the insanity, forced inoculations, mass arrest, no First
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.920]  Amendment, shutting down and taking over the Internet. They're now announcing different
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:37.920]  ways they plan to do it, taxing everything, raising your children in government dormitories.
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:53.080]  It's all being announced and phased in right now. And those of you that still work and
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:58.360]  still pay your bills and still make it through this system, you are the targets. And once
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:03.080]  you're bankrupted, it'll be full government control. They control the means of production.
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:17.520]  The big corporations are teamed up with them, and that's when the real tyranny begins. And
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:25.760]  the entire Pentagon future purchasing structure is going completely to robotic ground armies,
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:33.840]  robotic ground tanks, combat droids, drones, artificially intelligent bombers, fighter
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:39.800]  bombers, hunter killers, bullets that can go around corners that have hunter-seeker missiles
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:48.080]  in them. The bullet itself is a hunter-seeker missile. Just massive buildup of high-tech
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:54.480]  weaponry against the average person. Meanwhile, the government wants your.357 pop gun. They
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:59.880]  want your deer rifle. They're scared to death of that. While they take your tax money and
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:05.480]  build up massive weapons systems against you. And every new computer and cell phone and
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:12.880]  system is designed under federal law to regulate, track, trace, tax, and control and illegally
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:23.800]  surveil everything you're doing. And Barack Obama is taking the entire agenda that Bush
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:30.760]  was continuing, and he is put into overdrive. No difference except in skin color and rhetoric.
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:39.480]  All right, let's go to your calls. The magnitude of this just continues to hit me every day.
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:46.200]  I know a lot of you are in denial. I know a lot of you say it can't be true or I exaggerate
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:51.440]  or I'm a fair monger. I don't blame you because it's hard for me to believe what's happening
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:57.760]  and I know it's real and I don't want to believe it. And to face this and to admit to yourself
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:05.600]  it's real and to admit to yourself that we are in a scientifically crafted dictatorship
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:10.880]  that brags that it studied all the dictatorships of the past and it's trying to hone and create
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:24.180]  the ultimate tyranny and that it's so organized and evil. We got our work cut out for us.
[1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:29.520]  The good news is people are waking up. Let me tell you, not fast enough. You are being
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:34.520]  poisoned in your water supply. You are being sprayed with chemtrails. You are being poisoned
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:40.920]  with the vaccines. We do have a group of psychopathic killers running the power structure and
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:46.040]  they think it's funny. They think it's funny. They can buy some slick young newscaster who
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:50.160]  will go up there and read off a teleprompter and lie to everybody for petty status. They
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.720]  love it. They can hire young people to be aggressive, brute police who will beat people
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:01.520]  half to death for protesting with pleasure. They love it. They can hire plenty of cops
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:07.360]  and military that will go out and stage provocateur attacks on themselves so they can attack
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:16.200]  the peaceful protesters. They love it. They love it. So you better study history, ladies
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:18.560]  and gentlemen, and find out what governments do.
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:25.240]  The last government to truly carry out the globalist plan was the Maoist China. The Chinese
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:31.280]  government says they killed 80 plus million people. Our government says 84. Depending
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:39.400]  on the number you look at, 60, 62, 65, 68, 64 is what Wikipedia says. Killing is their
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:53.920]  business and business is good as the Dave Mustaine line goes. And we need to step back
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:01.200]  and really soak in and really let it hit our bone. Just how big this is and just how real
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.200]  this is.
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:06.760]  And then ask yourselves, how in the world do you not care about these issues? Why are
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:13.120]  you driving in your car right now laughing about this? Some of you out there. Because
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:22.040]  I'll assure you it's not funny. Virgil, we already talked to Virgil. Mark, Mark and
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:27.320]  Alibama, you're on the air. Hey, Alice Jones, how are you doing? I got a headache. I mean,
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:31.880]  just coming in here and thinking about this gave me a headache. Take a deep breath, brother.
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:41.040]  Listen, in Gunnersville, Alabama, I'm helping to awaken the Eloi by getting your videos
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:47.600]  in the local libraries and believe it or not, on the shelf at the local blockbusters and
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:55.480]  they'll actually give you a $7 or $8 credit to your account if you donate a new, unopened
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:47:03.480]  Alex Jones documentary like Endgame or Terrorstorm. And I even got Freedom to Fascism on the shelf
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:08.320]  and they're all three still there. People rent them.
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:17.040]  And so, I mean, is this a big chain or just a local shop? Blockbuster? Yeah, a big chain.
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:21.880]  Is that the private franchise underdoing that or are the chains allowing that?
[1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:27.920]  The store manager makes the phone call and finds out if she can put it on the shelf. Apparently,
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:37.960]  she's calling her boss at the regional place. So, I assume that, yeah. Yeah, but it works.
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:42.360]  That is exciting. What do you think about the state of the world and all these announcements
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:47.640]  and big newspapers like the New York Times that, yes, the carbon tax is the key to world
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:52.240]  government and they're going to put taxes on our dogs because they eat meat. They're
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:48:00.880]  going to inspect our homes. It's just hellish. Alex, I got a two word answer to that question
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:08.440]  and that is boycott Babylon. Oh, that's a great term.
[1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:16.440]  You have a good one, Alex. Yes. Take care. Take care, my friend. Boycott Babylon. What
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:24.360]  a great term. Thank you, Mark. Angel. Minnesota, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:32.760]  Hi, Alex. God bless you. Really. God bless you. I am in my own fight here. I have been
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:39.840]  very passionate in telling people my story and I am a mother of three poisoned children.
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:50.440]  They have autism, allergies, asthma. They have been vaccinated. You know, I trusted
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:55.080]  the doctors and the nurses that told me, you know, that it wasn't going to hurt them. It
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:49:02.600]  wasn't going to give them autism. And I think I have been guided by God to find out what
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:13.400]  exactly happened because the hyperactivity, the repetition, one of my boys, he bounces
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:21.680]  on the balls of his feet and flaps his hands. Brain damage. What's that? Brain damage from
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:29.600]  the mercury and the adjuvants. You need to keep him off all MSG, lots of fish oil according
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  to medical doctors we've had on. I'm sure you already know all this off of all processed
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  sugar and off of television. But it goes farther than that to unravel. It's not just brain
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:46.800]  damage. It's something that can actually be reversed and most of it. No, I know it can
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:52.040]  be reversed because the brain, especially when they're young, can rewire itself. Well, it's
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:57.960]  yeast overgrowth. See, when they get the vaccines and the antibiotics, it kills the good bacteria
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:03.000]  and the intestines. And then toxins start secreting there. And then medical doctors
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:08.400]  have said that as well. Yes. Well, because it kills the good bacteria and the intestines,
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.440]  then there's room for the yeast that is in small quantities to overgrow. And then when
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:20.960]  that yeast overgrowth happens, it actually becomes to a point where it actually grows
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:26.680]  roots and then it perforates the walls of the intestines and then there's holes there
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:32.240]  and the intestines. And then you give them the wrong foods. You give them gluten, foods
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:38.200]  that have gluten and milk. And those proteins go through there, right? And then there's
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:43.440]  those holes in the intestines. They leak through those holes in the intestines and they attach
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:49.040]  to the opiate receptors in the brain, just like heroin, okay? So autistic children are
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:53.320]  essentially heroin addicts.
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:51:01.280]  And I've seen some similar information from some research studies, but not that precisely.

[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:07.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:12.840]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:17.640]  from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president
[1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:22.840]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:28.360]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:33.920]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:38.560]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:42.680]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:48.520]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:54.840]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're
[1:52:54.840 --> 1:53:02.520]  watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv. The once mighty U.S. dollar
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:06.840]  has been replaced as the world's reserve currency. Trillions and trillions of dollars
[1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:11.520]  outside the U.S. will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible. Foreigners
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:16.400]  will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar. The once great dollar
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:20.640]  has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.640]  soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior. Prepare now. Ready Reserve Foods
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.280]  is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods. Ready Reserve
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:35.320]  controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:15.440]  Mainline medical doctors just aren't trained. They're not specialists, and they won't tell
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:21.320]  autistic parents that there are ways to reverse a lot of the toxicity from diets and other
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:28.760]  things. But more and more, it's becoming common knowledge that there is a lot of that you
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:35.000]  can reverse. So thanks for the information, Angel. We're going to go to more calls coming
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:40.600]  up here in the next segment. You know, I let folks make up whatever name they want when
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:45.400]  they call in, but when they get too long, it does become a problem. Like, concerned
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:50.400]  but thankful for Michigan. We're going to take that call and rebel Jack and Nancy and
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:54.280]  others and a ton of financial news and things I haven't even gotten to yet today, and we
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:59.520]  have several guests coming up as well. But before I do that, I do want to encourage listeners
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:05.200]  to not procrastinate. I have made a film that is my best work yet, and it really does identify
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:10.480]  the problem and has the solutions. It exposes the globalist. The general public is awakening
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:15.080]  right now, but they're only awakening to the fact that they've been lied to. They are
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:22.080]  not awakening to specifically just how serious it is and who our adversary, who our enemy
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.480]  is and what their master plan is. So I have produced follow the Republic available at info
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:35.320]  wars.com or you can call toll free to get it 888-253-3139. Please put it on access TV

[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:54.600]  Please get this out to everyone. This is also an exercise in grassroots action. And I think
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:56:00.760]  this is the best tool out there bar none the best tool ever created to expose these people
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:08.920]  and the most up to date. Follow the republic.com to order online or info wars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:14.720]  I want to go out to break at the end of this hour as we start the third hour with the last
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:24.040]  few minutes from fall of the Republic. The Republic is hanging by a thread. The last
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:30.520]  vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away. You know, you got time
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:35.640]  to watch baseball. You got time to watch football. You got time to entertain yourself. But I
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:42.240]  think a knowledgeable public we're losing and we've got to get people back on track
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:47.240]  to paying attention because if you don't take pay attention to your government and what
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:53.120]  they're doing, you're going to pay some dire consequences for it. Unless we become active
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.480]  and become influential in the power centers of society, there's nothing we can do about
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:03.840]  it. Just knowing about it is not enough. And as long as we are given at election time an
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:09.680]  option between the Republican candidate or the Democrat candidate, both of whom have
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:13.760]  been selected by members of the council on foreign relations and both of whom have the
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:19.640]  same general policies, that's not going to change anything either. So the real issue
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:25.680]  is so what? And the answer is we've got to recapture control of the power centers of
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:26.800]  society.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:32.920]  The people have a decision to make. Our nation has been seized in the jaws of a global corporate
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:39.960]  takeover. The Republic is passing into history. We're losing our freedoms. And it's up to
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:44.560]  every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:50.040]  fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers or whether we're going to restore
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:51.540]  the Republic.
[1:57:51.540 --> 1:57:55.840]  The values expressed by our founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence and other
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:04.240]  documents are very important to these times and it's now our chance to manifest those
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:05.360]  documents.
[1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:10.440]  Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country because the country
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:16.680]  is being stolen from us in broad daylight. Not only stolen metaphorically, but financially
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:19.720]  as well. The numbers don't lie.
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:28.760]  The American people, having been educated as to the truth, then have to rise up and
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:37.600]  demand and get a government that starts serving them. We need a change and it isn't going
[1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:40.600]  to come from Democrats in the Republic.

[1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:55.320]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:59.400]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:04.440]  that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.

[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:31.880]  We're going live, with a live radio show at prisonplanet.tv and living color when this
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:39.600]  radio show transforms into a radio slash TV hybrid at prisonplanet.tv at the eight after.
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.480]  Darrell Rundus is going to be joining us. He was on with us for 30 minutes last week
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:49.520]  on a host of issues. We'll have open phones as well. In the last hour, Hilmer von Campy,
[2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:54.200]  he was a former Hitler Eugen and when Hitler came to power, he then served in the German
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:00.840]  Army. We'll talk about parallels between our society today and what he saw growing up
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:07.520]  in Nazi Germany. Let's talk to Concerned, but thankful, that's their name, from Michigan.
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:08.520]  You're on the air.
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:13.400]  Alex, this is, hey, I just really want to thank you for making it possible to listen
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:19.520]  by telephone. That's how I listen to you. And especially that you've got a backup number.
[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:24.800]  And you know, the last caller that said boycott Babylon, I, you know, what can we do as a
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:31.640]  small people? I say, don't participate in the government handouts, the welfare. I mean,
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:36.120]  how did they control the North American Indians? First, they give them everything they want
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:40.440]  so that they all they have time to do is sit around and be drunk. I mean, I'm not against
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:43.880]  North American Indians. They're great people, but they're controlled.
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:50.520]  No, there were manuals on how to give them smallpox blankets, how to give them whiskey,
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:54.360]  then have them sign contracts. Oh, then we've got a reservation for you and there's going
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:59.920]  to be a reservation agent and then he's going to control you and cheat you. And once they
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:04.760]  had the leaders bought off, they had them. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, we really need
[2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:09.680]  to be out there self supported and listen to Alex Jones on the phone. If that's the
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:14.480]  way you can do it. I mean, you're loaded with information and, you know, I get talked to
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:18.320]  people all the time. They put up their hands and say, well, shoot, it's just, you know,
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.400]  it's prophesied. We, you know, there ain't nothing we can do about it. I'm just going
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:25.720]  to live by faith. Well, yeah, live by faith. Don't take the government handouts. Don't
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:31.640]  take their shots. Grow your own garden. Raise your own. They know that more and more people
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:36.400]  are doing that. So they're rushing in to bankrupt everything by design and their own words to
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:41.520]  make us be dependent on them. They want to make us be dependent on them so they can control
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:48.080]  our lives. Exactly. And get active in your church and your local community. Be the people.
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.280]  People have to look too. So they don't have to look to the government. I see cars going
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:58.600]  by all day on my road here and it is unbelievable the amount of state cars that pull into my
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:03.400]  driveway. I just had a state car in here this morning asking for directions. I said, well,
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:07.320]  now that's pretty cool. Here we have a state employee that even can't even find her way
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:11.080]  down the road. It says, boy, ain't that just a typical example of what we got. And that's
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:15.960]  all that's left is government and they're just sucking and sucking and sucking. I appreciate
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:22.960]  your call. Let's talk to rebel in Canada. You're on the air, rebel. Hi, Alex. I love
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:27.600]  everything you do and I appreciate your passion. A lot of people think it's, you know, your
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:32.400]  anger, but I think it's your very passionate man. Anyway, we should be angry. I mean, we
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:38.440]  should be angry. Yes. Yes, I understand. The reason I'm calling is I just want to give
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:46.120]  you a heads up on one of the scenarios of how are they, government, are going to round
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:50.480]  up all the opposition. That includes people like you are and people like Ron Paul. And
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.440]  I believe they already been testing it. I myself am an immigrant and I'm calling from
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:59.960]  one of the post-Soviet Union republics, a country called Turkmenistan. Yes, folks. This
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:06.000]  country exists. Google it up. And the thing I'm going to talk about happened in, I think
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:13.560]  it was 2002 in November. The current president of that time, Turkmen Bashi, one of the world's
[2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:21.920]  dictatorships at that time, dictators, staged a coup on himself, basically an assassination
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:31.760]  attempt on himself. And the same day, a couple of hours later, sorry for my English, he announced
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:39.160]  all the names, broadcast on TV live, who were behind alleged assassination attempt. And those
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:42.240]  were the names. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you and then Darrell Rundus, because
[2:04:42.240 --> 2:04:48.080]  that is exactly what Saddam Hussein did. Hitler would stage coups to round up his enemies
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:53.040]  early on. This is done over and over again. And the media keeps saying there's going to
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:58.720]  be a military coup. They could stage one as their pretext for Northcom to take over.
[2:04:58.720 --> 2:05:05.040]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:08.840]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are
[2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:13.200]  now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup
[2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:18.000]  systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators,
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:23.120]  a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free. It's like
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:27.920]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:33.200]  radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms,
[2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:38.000]  brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:42.480]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions
[2:05:42.480 --> 2:05:50.520]  from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:50.520 --> 2:06:01.320]  or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:05.960]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:10.400]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[2:06:10.400 --> 2:06:15.560]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[2:06:15.560 --> 2:06:21.040]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts.
[2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:25.640]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:29.680]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:33.960]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:39.000]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:43.960]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:52.320]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:07:00.360]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:05.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:09.080]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:14.160]  that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:18.520]  There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have

[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:11.680]  American people, having been educated as to the truth, then have to rise up and demand
[2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:19.680]  and get a government that starts serving them. We need a change and it isn't going to come
[2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:24.960]  from Democrats and Republicans. It has to come from the American people.
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:50.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:57.840]  in the last century alone. America is a prize coveted by the despotic megacorporations that
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:03.960]  now dominate our planet. If their world government is truly to rise, freedom and the republic
[2:09:03.960 --> 2:09:10.200]  for which it stands must fall. Now is the time for all good men and women to come to
[2:09:10.200 --> 2:09:15.520]  the aid of their country. One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:23.160]  very eyes. For many generations into the future, our progeny will look back on this time as
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:27.680]  either replace where humanity rose to the challenge and made a stand against the forces
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:42.680]  of darkness or as a time when the planet fell into the grip of a merciless high-tech tyranny.
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:49.200]  In part two of fall of the republic, you will learn the elites master plan for humanity.
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:55.760]  But more importantly, you will learn how to stop that plan, reverse the criminal tide
[2:09:55.760 --> 2:10:09.600]  and reignite the flame of liberty on the long march to man's ultimate destiny.
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:16.720]  That is the last few minutes of fall of the republic, and it covers who the globalists
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:21.840]  are, what their master plan is, how the banks control the government, how the Federal Reserve
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:28.120]  is private, that we must audit the Fed and abolish it and bring this illegitimate shadow
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:34.000]  government to justice, or nothing we do with republicans or democrats or any other party
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.880]  for that matter is ever going to change anything. In 1913, there was a financial coup in America.
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:45.720]  They slowly took over the nation, used our wealth to take over the rest of the world.
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:51.400]  Now they are imploding our economy to fold us into the one world government. You can
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:55.960]  learn the master plan though right now with in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:01.440]  This is not fiction. They are poisoning their water. They are poisoning your vaccines. They
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:05.680]  are chemtrailing you. They admit they are trying to reduce our numbers and sterilize
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:16.360]  us. It's in their own publications like EcoScience. In-game explains what their final goal is,
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:20.960]  that world government is only the beginning. As the back says, for the new world order,
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.840]  a world government is just the beginning. Once in place, they can engage their plan
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:30.880]  to exterminate 80% of the world's population while enabling the elites to have access to
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:36.800]  the life extension technologies and other advanced technologies. This film is so important
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:41.560]  in-game, but a lot has happened in the last two and a half, three years since in-game
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:48.920]  came out. Fall of the Republic 2 is going to be on what the world is going to look like
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:54.640]  if they are able to succeed. Fall of the Republic 1 is who they are, what they are, what their
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:12:00.560]  plan is, what they are currently doing, information on how to stop them, to identify them. Identifying
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:06.280]  them is half the battle. Identifying that presidents are only puppets to these people,
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:09.720]  that presidents are meant to take all the heat, take all the blame, and then they're
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:15.520]  replaced with a new puppet. And a lot of my listeners, we've never gotten rave reviews
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:20.380]  like this. I mean, this is almost unanimous positive reviews. It's the slickest, the best
[2:12:20.380 --> 2:12:25.400]  done film we've made. But the few complaints I get, and we've posted some of these videos,
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:30.000]  we have some of the reviews up on infowars.com today, are, yeah, I think this is really a
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:35.520]  great film. It's slick. It's got, you know, 19 different people interviewed. It's got
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:41.160]  a lot of good information, but I already knew all this from listening to your show, or I
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:46.640]  already knew this from my own research. Yes, I know you know about this, but do you have
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:54.840]  something that's slickly put together, vetted, documented, researched? We have a bibliography
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:02.320]  at falltherappublic.com. It was just completed. I believe Kurt's already linked to it today.
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:12.520]  But the issue is you have a well done tool, something that's really effective and compelling
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:17.360]  that you can give people. Yes, I know you know all about the new world order. So do I.
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:24.880]  I learn more all the time, but I understand the basics. We understand the architecture,
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:29.440]  but play by play, new things happen. Yes, I know you know, I know you're aware of what's
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.640]  going on, but do your friends, your family, your neighbor, your community, are they aware?
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:40.400]  See, that's the whole point. If you're aware, people aren't going to learn about this just
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:46.120]  magically. You're going to send out brainwaves to them psychically and make them understand.
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:50.080]  You need to speak to them. You need to talk to them. You need to reach out to them. This
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:55.800]  is life and death. Now, until five minutes into the next hour, Dale Rundis is going to
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:00.120]  be joining us. He had a family medical emergency and so he's not in studio with us. I wanted
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:03.520]  to have him in studio with us, but he's going to be joining us for the balance of the hour
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:08.080]  here in just a moment and we'll have open phones while he's with us. Then Hilmer Von
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:13.600]  Campy, a Hitler-Yugan under Hitler. Obviously he's a Hitler-Yugan under Hitler. That's kind
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:22.720]  of overdoing it. A Hitler-Yugan under Hitler and he was also in the German military under
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:30.000]  Hitler. He's going to talk about parallels between our society today and what he saw
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.800]  as a Hitler youth and then as a soldier in Hitler's army. So that's coming up in the
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:45.200]  last 50 minutes of the last hour today. But please listeners, please get, follow the
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.880]  Republic on DVDs so you have it in the highest quality, make copies of it, give it to people.
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:54.600]  Or if you have basic internet savvy, you can go to prisonplanet.tv, takes one minute to
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:15:00.760]  sign up, one minute to sign up with your passcode. Go click on the DivEx version. There's five
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:05.800]  different versions up there, ultra super high quality, high quality, medium quality, and
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:14.400]  then just passable, but that's better than YouTube and Google. And you can burn DivEx
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:20.040]  copies to regular CDs and they play in almost all the new DVD players and a lot of the old
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:27.720]  ones because in the last three or four years, most players have DivEx on them. Or you can
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:31.080]  say, if this doesn't play on your DVD player, it'll play on your computer. So it's a computer
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:40.440]  copy and it's not as good as the original DVD, but it's close. So infowars.com or 888-253-3139,
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:50.560]  888-253-3139. You can also write to me, Alex Jones at P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:55.880]  Okay, we're going to do a run this in a moment. I appreciate him joining us today. I wanted
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:16:03.480]  to go back to Rebel in Canada. He is an immigrant in Canada from Central Asian nation. I'm familiar
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:09.720]  with the coup that took place a few years ago, but he wants to explain how he believes
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:15.880]  Obama or the future savior can declare martial law announced there was an attempted coup.
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:23.240]  Saddam Hussein did this, Hitler did this repeatedly. The czars loved having political purges in
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:29.960]  the name of stopping or fighting coups. And so we hear the media saying there's going to be a military
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:34.760]  coup. There's going to be a military coup. If there was a real military coup, nine times out of 10,
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.800]  those turn out being even worse than what you had. So we don't want that. And if there is one,
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:47.240]  it's probably going to be staged and be repulsed. And so there is a lot of hype. And this is one
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:53.080]  of the few ways a type of false flag where they could do this. So restart where you're from,
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:56.600]  what happened, what you witnessed. And then we're going to Darryl Rundis. Go ahead.
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:03.080]  Yes, Alex. I'm glad you pointed out correctly. These coups are taking place over and over again
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:10.200]  in history. But what I was pointing out is after this staged coup, literally several hours later,
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:18.840]  the dictator, the current dictator went broadcasting and saying naming the names of the
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:28.440]  alleged conspirators in quotes. And most of the names in the list were the current opposition
[2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:38.200]  at that time to the regime. And the head of the opposition was a former politician and ambassador
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:46.680]  of the same country who was organizing the day after of that coup, the day after of that coup,
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:52.440]  was supposed to be the major demonstration event that he was organizing from overseas,
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:59.720]  this former politician. His name is Boris Shev Moradov. And he was named as one of the main
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:07.240]  conspirators. And of course, they rounded him up and they rounded all his friends, family,
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:11.560]  not just his friends, you know, all of the people who thought the same way that he did.
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:17.480]  And God knows where they are. They just put them away, no phone call, no court, no jury,
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:23.960]  nothing. Seven years later, and there's nothing, no information about them. And what is codified
[2:18:23.960 --> 2:18:30.680]  into federal law now, just like Texas police take blood without warrants now, once they get
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:36.440]  rid of your checks and balances, it's over. We have secret arrest. We have indefinite detention.
[2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:41.000]  We have enemy combatant status for citizens. They're building these secret camps. They just
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:47.800]  came out new ghost sites found in Eastern Europe. And that's the big issue here is that those very
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:51.480]  forms of tyranny are being set up in the United States in Europe, Western Europe.
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:59.800]  And if I remember correctly, that dictator also admittedly tortures people to then get fake
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:05.160]  confessions. Again, tell folks where your former country is located. That was my next point. The
[2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:12.440]  day after the next morning, there was a broadcasted tape, the national TV, the next morning after
[2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:19.640]  this fake coup, there was a tape broadcasted on national TV on all the channels of this
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:24.200]  barricade Murado, allegedly the main conspirator terrorists in quotes,
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:31.240]  reading off the papers saying he's a terrorist. He's on the wrong path. He regrets everything
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:38.760]  he's done. Now he's recognized as it. And if any doctor, scientist, you know, psychologist just
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:44.040]  looked at the not even know what they do is they march your children in and they say, look, we're
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:49.480]  going to rape and kill your children with battery acid. If you don't say you did it and they go
[2:19:49.480 --> 2:20:01.800]  and do it, just like they do with the 911 conspirators, their old run is straight ahead.
[2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:07.480]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:12.760]  high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level
[2:20:12.760 --> 2:20:18.360]  of eight or higher. Halcavision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:24.360]  minerals. Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of
[2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:29.880]  acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH
[2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:35.160]  to a healthy level. Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:41.560]  the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:47.720]  in an alkaline high pH environment. Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:59.480]  directly to alcovision.com that's alkavision.com or call 269-409-1776. 269-409-1776 today.
[2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:05.560]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you? Spy on me? Yeah, don't you know Google,
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:09.560]  Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?

[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:05.960]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:10.920]  and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food,
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:15.720]  energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:19.560]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:24.600]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:29.000]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:34.120]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:38.360]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases

[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:06.920]  Remain in your houses. The President of the United States has declared martial law under
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:14.600]  executive order 11,004. Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray they
[2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:20.760]  stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day. Think it can't
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:28.920]  happen here? Executive order 10-9-90 blocks down all highways. Executive order 10-9-95
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:35.720]  seizes control of all media outlets. Executive order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:41.240]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:46.360]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions
[2:23:46.360 --> 2:23:53.320]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com. That's martiallawsurvival.com. Go to

[2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:21.560]  Darrell Rundis is our guest. Had him on last week for a short segment or two, but I wanted to
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:28.040]  have him back up today to talk about a host of issues. He launched youdonews.com and tenandwin.com.
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:36.280]  That's a contest. And he started a lot of national Christian organizations. He's a supporter of this
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:40.120]  show and I always enjoyed talking to Darrell Rundis. He wasn't going to be in studio, but he had a
[2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:45.000]  family emergency come up, so he joins us from outside Dallas. Darrell, so much is going on.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.400]  What did you just think of that story out of a Central Asian dictatorship?
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:55.000]  Well, I mean, isn't that part of the course? Isn't that what we've come to expect from the people
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:01.960]  who are above and beyond the law? And once somebody is above and beyond the law and can do whatever
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:07.960]  they want, the sky's the limit. Even if you have a dictator who isn't that bad, he will be overthrown
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:15.640]  and someone worse will come in and then someone worse. And instead, things just devolve and degenerate
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:21.800]  into absolute evil. Well, absolutely. In fact, when we have no accountability, no transparency,
[2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:27.880]  at least security, and history shows that over and over and over again. Darrell, so much is going
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:33.560]  on, but I wanted to bring this up to you. Abortion. Even if people out there are for abortion,
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:38.360]  Nancy Pelosi says it's for eugenics to, quote, help the economy to get rid of more people,
[2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:43.800]  so we'll have less taxpayers. I saw a statistic last week, a caller called and I pulled it up.
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:50.440]  It was accurate. More black people were aborted in 2008. That's the latest numbers we've got
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:58.440]  than were born in 2008. And I guess that's a big victory for Margaret Sanger and the other Nazis,
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:05.480]  the other liberals who run around masquerading as touchy-feely liberals, federalizing the
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:10.520]  country under hate speech laws now that are about control, not about protecting groups.
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:18.600]  Ending. Obama's now signed it. Ending equal protection under the law. Now they want us
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:23.320]  with government healthcare to pay for abortions. Do they have any idea the level of rebellion of
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:28.120]  people that aren't going to pay taxes if they know it's going for abortion? And I guess they're
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:32.920]  going to lock everybody up in prison now. Well, I wish that would happen in a roundabout way.
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:39.320]  I mean, while obviously Planned Parenthood is just another tool by the global elite to
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:46.200]  euthanize the poor, the downtrodden. In fact, I read an article recently where they're
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:51.880]  incentivizing that by giving people extra money, if they'll get not just an abortion,
[2:26:51.880 --> 2:26:57.720]  but they'll get sterilized. And sadly, people are dumbed down. They go for it. They think,
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:03.080]  wow, what, $1,000? Wow, I could get me that new platform TV that I've been wanting now to get
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:10.120]  sterilized. So, you know, it's sad that people don't see through the poise and the schemes of
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:17.080]  these global elite. Absolutely. Darrell, I want to take calls while you're on with us and talk
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:25.000]  about some issues that you want to get into. But what is it like to, for you to see the New York
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:30.520]  Times and all these publications admitting world government is here, admitting the global carbon
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:35.720]  tax is to fund the world government, admitting it's to destroy our industrial base, as if NAFTA
[2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:41.320]  and GATT haven't already done that, and then to still see people running around denying there's
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:47.000]  a world government and calling us kooks? Well, as a Christian, you know, all this was foretold in
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:52.200]  the Bible. So, for me, it's not too shocking. It is disappointing. It is a little disheartening,
[2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:58.200]  but at the same time, we know that there comes a time, and I think we're limited in that time,
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:03.000]  where people buy the lie. They're under mass delusion. They love the lie. They hate the truth.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:07.080]  They won't come into the light for fear that these will be exposed and so on and so on. So,
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:14.440]  it is repulsive to say the least. But at the same time, hey, we knew these days were coming.
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.480]  And that's why it's all the more important that guys like you and others that listen to your show,
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:25.160]  guys like me and other Christians in particular, stand up and say and do what's right and stand
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:30.760]  up for righteousness. I mean, hey, abortion is just one in many, many, many tools the global
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:37.480]  elite uses to oppress us and to track or control the way we live our lives. And that's not what
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:42.120]  our country was founded on. It's not the purpose of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution or the
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:49.160]  Declaration of Independence. Well, pro-abortion supporters should know that the historical
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:54.600]  mainline history is Planned Parenthood was set up by the Rockefeller Foundation. Margaret Sanger
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  said blacks are subhuman weeds. We've got to kill them and we'll pose as liberals to do it.
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:08.040]  And they got the lady from Roe v. Wade to go and take the court case. She's now repented
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:15.720]  and gone public against it, but they don't care. And that it was all done for eugenics and to kill
[2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:23.000]  minorities, but also whites. And so anyone who supports it needs to know that. Absolutely. It's
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:28.520]  the same thing with people who believe in evolution, deny creation. Ultimately, that road leads to
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:33.640]  eugenics and many, many other things because you use cheap as the value of someone's life
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:38.360]  when you start to believe that there is no purpose to life. There was no creator. There is no
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:43.400]  God that you'll be accountable to someday. And so, sadly, there's a lot of people fighting the
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:49.320]  New World Order who are, you know, falling into the same line of evolution. Daryl, stay there.
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:57.320]  We're going to come back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[2:29:57.320 --> 2:30:04.920]  radio network. This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you all about a color blue, the state of the art
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:09.560]  atmospheric waters generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity
[2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:14.840]  in the air you breathe. No, this isn't science fiction. It's very real. I know I use one every
[2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:20.040]  day in my own home and it's available right now to you. Clean, great tasting water without all
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:25.560]  the pollutants. Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering your own
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:30.680]  a cola blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did. Their best seller,
[2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:36.600]  the a cola blue 28, produces up to seven gallons of water every day and is easy to use in economical.
[2:30:36.600 --> 2:30:41.720]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse

[2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:07.880]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:12.840]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much
[2:31:12.840 --> 2:31:18.120]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:23.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:31:23.080 --> 2:31:28.600]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:33.800]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[2:31:33.800 --> 2:31:38.520]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:38.520 --> 2:31:43.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:47.160]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[2:32:37.640 --> 2:32:41.880]  is bad, but it's probably going to get worse. You must prepare and make sure you are able to
[2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:48.040]  financially take care of yourself and your loved ones. Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[2:32:54.840 --> 2:33:09.320]  you do.net. All right, let's go right back to Darrell Rundis joining us. We're all just going to
[2:33:09.320 --> 2:33:16.520]  be taking some of your phone calls and covering some more news. Darrell, the New York Times just
[2:33:16.520 --> 2:33:25.480]  calmly came out today and reported that Afghan opium kingpin, brother of the dictator, Mohammed
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:32.440]  Karzai, is on the CIA payroll. So the guy that runs the majority of the opium out of the country
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:37.960]  works for the CIA. And I know the government controls most of the narcotics and launders the
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:43.880]  money. They've been caught hundreds and hundreds of times all over the world. CIA aircraft crash
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:50.360]  with pure cocaine on board, meaning it's coming from the source. The congressional report in 1996,
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:57.640]  the CIA inspector general admitted it. But then the phony drug war just continues and people say,
[2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:03.720]  oh, you're for drugs. No, I'm against the government making them illegal. I want them decriminalized,
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:08.840]  not legalized. That means you just go out and buy them at the store so that it will kill the black
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:15.560]  market and get all the money out of drugs. So the market will break down. And all the foreign
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:20.520]  countries that have done this, it basically ends their drug problem by and large, really cuts way
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:25.960]  back on it. The last time I was down there, actually, I think it was the Tea Party. I was
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:31.480]  driving back up eight at a restaurant there in Austin, ran into a Texas Ranger of all people,
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:38.440]  and we started talking. It was common knowledge amongst the Texas Highway Patrol, the DPS,
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:43.560]  as well as the Texas Rangers. The CIA runs drugs through the border all the time. It was no
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:48.280]  news to him. When we got on that topic, he was like, well, yeah, sometimes they let us catch
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:54.200]  the bats just to make it look good. But yeah, we know they run it all the time. And so why
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:35:00.680]  no one does anything about it, why people fail to really dig deep and look at where the source
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:05.640]  of this is coming from, why they don't close down the border in spite of the terrorism after 9-11
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:11.080]  and so on. I mean, so many obvious conflicts and people would be good to open up their hearts,
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:13.560]  open up their eyes, and open up their minds, and seek the truth.
[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:21.880]  Absolutely. So you ran into a Texas Ranger and he just said, oh, yeah, we all know they bring
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:26.440]  the drugs in. Yeah. I mean, it was just like common knowledge to him. He didn't even plan that and
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:30.920]  I said, so what do you think about, you know, these reports about the CIA smuggling drugs across
[2:35:30.920 --> 2:35:35.560]  Georgetown? That's been going on for years. We know that, but you know, they don't, they don't
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:39.320]  want to catch them except for once in a blue moon, just to make the front page, make it look like
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:47.000]  we're doing our job. But how does a police officer then catch a teenager with marijuana or ecstasy
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:52.120]  or something like that? And I'm not saying those things are good. How do they catch him with that
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:56.920]  and then throw the book at him and feel good about it? Because that's another form of tax.
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:36:04.120]  They bring the drugs in to get us dependent and to literally legalize slavery. They bring something
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:08.920]  in that's highly addictive. They make it cool in Hollywood and the movies and the culture.
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:14.840]  The, the, the, the gangster rap and all of it, the young people use it. It's certainly bad.
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:22.200]  And especially the hard drugs. And then they put you in a private prison that every time I look into
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:28.280]  it is owned by a bank that's laundering drug money. I mean, this is so sick. Yeah. Absolutely.
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:33.480]  And that's once again, I think I would hope and pray that they will come when the American people
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:37.960]  would just get so fed up. They'll quit playing the man's game and they'll just lay down and
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:42.840]  quit paying their tax. Isn't that the irony of this? I mean, if that's the sickest thing of it all,
[2:36:42.840 --> 2:36:48.600]  we fund our own enslaved. It's our tax dollars that gives them the power to do these things.
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:52.920]  Yeah. Well, that's what I'm telling the young people. If you're at that party when you're 16,
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:58.360]  do not use the methamphetamine, the cocaine, the heroin, do not take the ecstasy. Do not take
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:05.720]  the LSD. You are using the government's products and parents don't put your children on Ritalin
[2:37:05.720 --> 2:37:12.440]  and Prozac. All the studies show it's the dyes in the food and the MSG and the aspartame
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:19.400]  that's making your kids bounce off the walls. Don't put them on drugs whose molecules
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:25.400]  are even more dangerous than illegal drugs. I mean, how obvious is it? This system is nothing
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:30.520]  but a bunch of drug pushers. Well, I think it's obvious to those in the know, but those of us
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:35.240]  that have taken the time to pursue the fact and let the fact lead us wherever they lead us,
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:40.200]  whether we agree with them or not. In fact, one of the reasons I became a Christian wasn't because
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:44.920]  I was at the end of my road looking for hope and had nowhere to go but to God. In fact, the last
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:50.200]  thing I was looking for was Jesus, but through the evidence. You know, when I scrutinized all the
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:55.000]  other religions and I scrutinized the Bible and every other book ever written by religious people,
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:59.400]  the Bible was only one that stood up to the scrutiny. So in the same way, I think if people
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:04.840]  would just look at the fact, quit, believe in the lie, quit, just accepting. In fact, I ran into a
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:10.920]  lady who had an Obama jacket that she had made the other night and I asked her, why do you like
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:15.400]  Obama so much? Well, he's an honorable man. He has integrity. He doesn't lie. He doesn't do.
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:19.640]  And so of course, I started to kind of press her on a few of the issues that were obvious,
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.240]  things that were, you know, pretty much mainstream media had covered. And of course,
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:27.560]  she didn't want to hear any of that. They loved the lie. They don't have the fact
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:31.400]  to defend what they believe. And when you confront them on it, boy, they just get irate,
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:38.040]  they shut down. They don't want to have that conversation. I've talked to a lot of Obama
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:44.040]  supporters on the ground and they say, well, he's not corrupt and he tells the truth and he cares
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:50.840]  about the people and he brought change. He intensified the wars. He expanded the secret
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:55.720]  arrest. He hired nothing but lobbyist. He made government more secret, surrounded himself with
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:01.560]  a banking elite, you know, continue to pour billions and trillions, run up a debt bigger
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:06.920]  than all the other presidents combined before him. And I talked about transparency, yet not one of
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:11.400]  the bills that they posted online for people to read before they pass it. But that's the issue,
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.720]  Darrell. I'm going to ask you this because then the Obama supporter says, well, so what? You know,
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:23.480]  at least he's better than Bush, as if we're saying Bush was good. No, the whole system's corrupt, but
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:31.160]  when you try to reach out to people, when you try to wake them up, it's taken me years to learn all
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:36.520]  their tricks. How do you explain that to somebody when it's a matrix of lies? I mean, here's a quick
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:48.520]  example. Obama took 50,000 US troops out of Iraq and put 50,000 more contractors in. Obama put 18,000
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:55.400]  more US troops in when he first got elected, when he first got into office, and then another 22,000.
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:40:02.200]  So that's 40,000. But they never talk about that. It was a footnote. And then the whole debate was,
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:10.120]  should he escalate 48,000 more to make it look like he's anti-war? Oh, he's getting pressured to put
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:16.440]  48,000 more in and he won't make a decision. Oh, look, he's a peacenik by making it a political
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:23.080]  football between left and right. Oh, Obama's against the war. Conservatives now become pro-war again.
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:28.920]  Democrats are like, well, he's not putting more troops in when he already put
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:35.560]  40,000 more in. And I don't know what you call that trick, but that's just one of hundreds of
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:42.200]  tricks. And I know all their tricks now, and it makes my head hurt, Darryl, that I can't explain
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:46.360]  it to people that they don't want to know. They don't want to understand. I mean, what would you
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:51.960]  call that trick, a bait and switch? Well, pure deception, first and foremost. But yeah, it's
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:57.240]  what is the norm now. And I think, specifically speaking, it really makes sense because it says
[2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:03.000]  there'll come a time when people will say that evil is good and good is evil. And that's exactly
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:09.160]  what we see. We see people constantly, continually worship this guy. I mean, they're keeping our
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:15.560]  kids to sing songs to them and so on and so forth. And they dismiss and don't even want to know the
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:20.760]  true facts of what's going on. In fact, you know, it's interesting that I care with people all the
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:25.560]  time. And it's just like this information about the new order and what's going on in the world
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:30.440]  today, the evil atrocities these guys commit. You kind of remember one thing, and we've talked about
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:35.160]  this before. These people are blind. They're blind to the truth. They're blinded by the world. They're
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:40.200]  blinded by a lot of things. They're greed, they're money, whatever it is. And you never get mad at
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:43.960]  the blind man. That's the first rule. So when they don't want to know, you got to remember this isn't
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:48.600]  an argument to be won. This is just information to be shared. So don't get frustrated. Don't give
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:52.840]  yourself a headache over it. Hey, it's between them and the truth. And if they don't want to
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:57.640]  acknowledge the truth, move on to the next person and continue to share the information. But don't
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:03.320]  let those who don't want to receive the truth in love that you're sharing with them get to you
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:06.840]  because there's nothing you could do that's really ultimately between them. Well, Darrell,
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:11.880]  I mean, it doesn't really get to me. I am just sick of looking at all the lies and corruption and
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:21.720]  evil. And it's so obvious what's going on. We just need to abolish the whole system. It's rotten.
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:27.240]  You know, it's like, it's like if you open up your refrigerator and there's maggots in a stew you
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:32.200]  made a week ago, you don't pick pieces of it out and eat it, you throw the whole stew away.
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:38.120]  How do we do that? How do we get the population to realize that it's a tissue of lies, a false
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:43.640]  reality, a great delusion? Here's the biggest problem I see is facing. Whether you're a Christian
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:49.000]  or not, whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, if people would actually follow what Jesus
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:55.160]  said, our problems would be over very quickly. They would actually read what he said, what he did.
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:43:07.000]  But the system created a counterfeit, a Christianoid system that is fraudulent, greedy, corrupt,
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:17.320]  deceptive, pro-war, worldly, ninny-ing, dithering. It denies any type of corruption. It says only
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:24.760]  serve government, do whatever you're told. And so people of conscience see that and say,
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:32.040]  I want nothing to do with this. See, that's another... So how do we change these Babylon churches?
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:35.800]  Go ahead. Well, I think that's the key. In fact, I got a couple of scriptures for you.
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:42.120]  Galatians 5.1 clearly says it's for freedom that Christ is set free. Stand firm then and do not
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:48.520]  let yourself be burdened again by the yoke of slavery. 1 Peter 2.16, live as a free man,
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:53.960]  but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil. Live as servants of God. See,
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:58.200]  the last time it was on your show Friday, there's about 6,000 or 7,000, I guess about 4,000-5,000
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:02.680]  people view the video you guys posted. There's a lot of comments on there questioning the validity
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:07.160]  of the Bible and God and Jesus. And I don't blame people for thinking that. I used to think that
[2:44:07.160 --> 2:44:11.560]  most of my whole life because I would see the hypocrisy in the church and I would say, wow,
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:15.720]  if that's what a Christian is, that's the last thing I want to be. What I didn't realize is
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:20.040]  there's a lot of people in the church who still act like people in the world because they're not
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:24.680]  really Christians. I can say I'm a millionaire, but it doesn't make me a millionaire. I can
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.080]  say I'm a Christian, but it doesn't make me a Christian. If people truly knew who Christ was,
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:34.360]  what he stood for, and what he was really all about, they would not sit alphabetically by
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:40.200]  while people vote about no prayer in school or no ten commandments on public property or abortion.
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:47.000]  But that's my point, is the new Christianoid religion is about loving corruption, serving evil,
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.680]  dressing up, driving fancy cars, being glitter bugs. Right. It's like this, Alex. What you see
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:57.960]  on TV is not true Christianity. They say, come to Christ, he'll give you health, wealth, and prosperity.
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:45:03.160]  Right? He'll make you have a great life. In fact, I often use an example of two professors on an
[2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:06.920]  airplane. If I go to a guy on an airplane and say, hey, put this parachute on, it's really going to
[2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:10.920]  improve your flight. You're going to pee, to joy, and happiness. It's going to be the greatest flight
[2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:15.160]  of your life. Well, the guy's skeptical because he can't understand why putting the parachute on
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:19.720]  is going to improve his flight. But in an experimental fashion to see if his claim is true,
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:23.720]  he puts the parachute on. But what happens? In a few minutes, he starts to notice the weight of
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:27.640]  the parachute on his back. He can't lean back in his feet. It's cumbersome. He looks around.
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:31.800]  Other passages are mocking him, making fun of him. So he peels the parachute off. He throws it on the
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:35.720]  ground. And as far as he's concerned, it'll be a long time until somebody puts one of those on him
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:40.040]  again. He's disillusioned and he's bitter towards those who gave him the parachute because as far
[2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:44.360]  as he was concerned, he was told an outright lie. But if instead I go to passage or two and I say,
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:47.880]  hey, put this parachute on, because any minute you're going to jump out of this plane, and this
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:51.720]  parachute's going to save your life from the jump to cum. Well, he doesn't care about the weight of
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:55.560]  the parachute, nor does he care if other people mock or make fun of him. In fact, he probably has
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  sympathy towards those mocking him because he knows what their fate will be when they have to jump
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:04.040]  without the parachute. In the same way, when we tell people, come to Jesus, they'll solve all your
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:07.560]  problems. Well, that's just not what he promised. He never said, in fact, he said, Becoming a
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:11.880]  Christian will make your life harder. It's a hard road. It's a narrow road. It's not an easy thing
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:17.000]  to do. So I would just encourage those people who think Christianity is a sham and a fraud,
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:22.760]  I would say you're right when it comes to religion. Jesus hated religion instead of all the religious
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:27.320]  leaders of the day, called them sons of hell, brutal vipers, hypocrites and so on, because they
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:31.880]  were bogged down into the law, the letter of law. They loved their power. They loved the praise of
[2:46:31.880 --> 2:46:36.600]  men more than the praise of God. So they didn't care about whether Jesus was fulfilling hundreds
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:41.000]  of prophecies right before their eyes. They didn't care he was performing miracles and so on. They
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:44.520]  just would try to dismiss it because they wanted to hang on to their control, their power, their
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:48.440]  money. It's the love of money, root of all evil. So to get back to your reason... And the one time
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:54.600]  Christ got mad was with the money changers. Tell folks that story. Well, the bottom line is that,
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:59.320]  you know, when he came in and he turned over those money changers in the temple, their tables,
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:03.880]  okay? Notice he didn't do it to everybody that was in the temple selling their wares. It wasn't
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:08.840]  about them selling wares in the temple, as most people would probably believe. No, it was because
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:14.520]  they turned the house of God into a den of peace. These guys were the bankers of the day. They were
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:19.640]  the Federal Reserve of the day and they had a monopoly on the coins that Jews could use to
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:25.400]  exchange for the perfect spotless land to make their sacrifice. So, you know, they would hike
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:30.040]  up the price and exchange rate on that because they knew they had the only coin that didn't have a
[2:47:30.040 --> 2:47:35.400]  faith of an emperor or some other political leader and that's the only coin that Jews would use to
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:40.120]  buy the spotless land to make the sacrifice. And, of course, they turned the house of God and do a
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:44.440]  den of peace. So, once again, the love of money is the root of all evil. And to get back to the
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:51.000]  original question, really the answer to setting God aside for a second, because obviously if my
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:55.960]  people who are called by my name would humble themselves in prayer, turn from their wicked ways,
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:01.080]  God would hear our prayers from heaven and heal our land. But because, you know, setting that aside,
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:05.560]  it's the bankers. You know, I think Ron Paul's on the right and we need to, you know, get on
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:09.960]  board with that and push for an audit of the Fed. Once those books are revealed and we see the
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:14.120]  trillions of dollars that's stolen from the American people, hey, maybe people will then
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:19.080]  wake up and abolish the Fed. We have an honest monetary system. Exactly. Look how far we've
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:24.200]  come from almost no one knowing about the Federal Reserve being the real power to the majority
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:29.320]  of Americans in Gallup polls saying, we know it's bad. Let's abolish it. Let's at least audit it.
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:36.600]  We are seeing major movement, but it's just not fast enough because the average person is in
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:43.400]  these phony 501c3 churches where they tell them government is God. Do whatever government says.
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:48.120]  If the government says abort babies, do it. If the government says go to war, do it. If the
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:54.920]  government says, you know, do all of these things, do it. But the entire Bible is the opposite of
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:49:00.680]  that. Well, once again, they stand up to the false interpretation of Romans 13 and they say, oh,
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:04.440]  you got to submit to the governing authorities. In fact, there's a gentleman I'd introduce you to
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:09.080]  by the name of Marshall Foster. I don't know if you've ever heard of him, but he's well-renowned.
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:16.040]  He's a great scholar and a constitutionalist and he understands why it's so important for Christians,
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:20.520]  the church in particular, and like me, keep the lanes, everything that's going on in the world
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:25.560]  today on the church. If the Christian would rise up and stand up for what's good, what's true,
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:29.480]  and what's right, we wouldn't have all these issues today. We would demand accountability.
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:34.680]  We demand transparency. We would ask questions, demand answers, and we would hold our politicians
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:41.880]  accountable. But like sheep to the fodder bands, they're just blessed. They just follow and they
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:46.280]  don't ever question what that pastor says. You know, why? Because they don't ever read the Bible
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:50.920]  themselves. If they take the time to pursue the truth, the truth would set them free, but they
[2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:57.160]  don't. They follow the Bible. Well, I just want to add that the groups promoting the atheist,
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:01.560]  they're all of atheists who are legitimately atheists or agnostics, but every time I study the
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:08.680]  groups that fund and run the atheist, they're not atheists. They're occultists. And I guess if
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:14.440]  they can't get people to be occultists, they will just get them to become atheists. And then
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:21.160]  atheists almost always become supporters of eugenics and abortion and humans are just blobs
[2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:29.000]  and humans don't have any great destiny and humans are a parasite. And you just can't ignore the
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:33.960]  fruits of these people. Well, that's what's so dangerous about those who fight the new old order
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:40.040]  and yet don't submit or believe in God. The day will come when they'll realize there is a God
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:44.360]  and unfortunately they were on the wrong side. So they may fight the new old order till the day they
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:48.600]  die, but it didn't end unless they repent Christ, man, they're gonna end up in hell.
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:52.200]  Unfortunately, sadly, right alongside those that they were fighting against.
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:59.720]  Our country, our world's becoming hell. Everywhere the globalists take over, we have hell on earth.

[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:09.080]  pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:14.520]  in proper pH balance. For 15 years, people had trusted Alcazone, the simplest way of keeping the
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:19.080]  body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup and boosting the immune system through
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:24.360]  antioxidant support. Alcazone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc,
[2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:29.160]  and the antioxidant selenium along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.

[2:53:00.280 --> 2:53:08.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:13.240]  to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from
[2:53:13.240 --> 2:53:19.000]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress,
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:25.160]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[2:53:25.160 --> 2:53:30.680]  to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:36.200]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:53:36.200 --> 2:53:41.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:45.960]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[2:53:45.960 --> 2:53:53.000]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:59.800]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:15.320]  Darrell Rundus built Udo News.com. He's going to give it to Free Speech Systems, my corporation.
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:23.480]  And the next few weeks, we'll be taking control of it. I appreciate the gift. It's also a
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:31.240]  responsibility. I'm kind of like, oh, Darrell, thank you. But it is a really nice site,
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:35.480]  and I want to thank Darrell because you just go sign up. It's got a, what, a free sign up,
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:39.160]  free membership. Yeah, I want people to understand this is different than YouTube,
[2:54:39.160 --> 2:54:45.800]  and that one, it's not just video, it's audio, it's images, and blogs as well. And so you could
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:50.520]  write a blog every day if you want, then import a video that pertains to your blog and put it
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:54.600]  right there in your blog. So it's kind of nice. But also there's two types of members. There's
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:59.880]  regular members who just want to view videos, make comments and rate videos and things like that.
[2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:06.200]  And then there's reporters. And reporters have the ability to upload media. So when you go to sign
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:10.520]  up, look closely, there's two different types of memberships. One will just be members. You won't
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:15.960]  be able to upload any media if you're a member, okay? But if you click reporter and register as
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:20.360]  a reporter, then you'll be able to upload media. And we did that on purpose because we want this to
[2:55:20.360 --> 2:55:25.480]  truly be an independent press of the people by the people and certainly for the people.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:31.800]  Well, that's exciting. And so I know that you had a family illness. That's why you're not here
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:37.480]  today. But we need to get you down here next week. I need to have my IT guys look at this and
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:42.760]  maybe just keep using the platform you're using, the servers you're using, but try to beef it up
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:48.440]  because as soon as I start posting videos on it, we've already had, you said 45,000 views
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:52.520]  when you launched it a month ago and you haven't even really been promoting it. And it looks great.
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:58.360]  The site works really well. This is really exciting. UdoNews.com. And I don't think people
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:05.320]  should stop uploading to YouTube. That's where the big crowds are. But then doppelganger. Come over
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:11.320]  exactly come over here and have a place. So you've got an archive of your material. If
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:15.720]  YouTube erases your account, which they do to patriots and anti-globalists and Christians
[2:56:15.720 --> 2:56:21.480]  and others. And then as the site gets bigger and bigger, but absolutely Darrell, it's got blogs,
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:26.680]  everything. You really put a lot of time and energy into this. It is a first rate site,
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:31.400]  everything I'd been wanting to do and I've been too busy to. So yes, we will do a great job for
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:37.880]  you. And I'll have you talk to my IT guy when you leave us hearing about eight, nine minutes from
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:43.400]  now. Hey, I just want to encourage people real quick, Alex, too, that, you know, something you
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:48.040]  and I have talked about before, we both just get so busy with so many other things with like kids
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:54.920]  and businesses, you know, so on. Please, folks, do what Alex and I know needs to be done. Record
[2:56:54.920 --> 2:57:00.840]  the news from Boston, CNBC and CNN and so on. And then do commentary. You have the right
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:05.720]  over the fair use back to take and then make commentary on them. I would call it TV news
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:10.840]  review or just news review, but yes, that is actually what I'm intending to do. We are finally
[2:57:10.840 --> 2:57:16.840]  getting our permits three months later from the city of Austin in the new area we leased four
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:23.080]  months ago. All of that's going on. And that's what I'm, and it's total fair use for folks that
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:28.760]  don't know. That's how CNN and Fox play clips of each other stuff. If you're showing something and
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:34.840]  commentating on it, total fair use, it makes for a riveting show. And it doesn't have to be high
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:42.840]  tech play a clip of it with a TV besides you make comments on the lies or propaganda, post it. And
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:49.320]  it's do it at you do news.com. Absolutely, Darrell. That is just a idea I've had for many years.
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:53.720]  You simultaneously, of course, brought the same idea to me. Our minds think alike.
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:59.480]  I want to make a whole film analyzing TV lies. That's something I plan to do in the future.
[2:57:59.480 --> 2:58:03.320]  And I would love to do that. I would love to take the history channel, which is filled with lies.
[2:58:03.320 --> 2:58:08.680]  I mean, take their latest review of 9-Eleven and all the stupid stuff they did. I mean, come on,
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:15.080]  put one single small little I beam above a breaking fire and oh, see, you know, I mean,
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:20.120]  it was obvious that they set that up as a gift. Hey, Darrell, we're gonna come back to five more
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:26.120]  minutes. When is the other contest going to be announced? Hey, we'll talk about it when we get
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:30.200]  back. But because my wife's illness, we actually extended the deadline. I'll let you know when we
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:35.000]  come back. All right, we'll be right back. Yeah, Darrell's wife had to go to the hospital this
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:43.640]  weekend for surgery, but she's okay now. We'll be right back. America's number one stories for
[2:58:43.640 --> 2:58:53.480]  independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network. Hundreds of nations have
[2:58:53.480 --> 2:58:59.320]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:58:59.320 --> 2:59:04.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:10.600]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:16.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the
[2:59:16.360 --> 2:59:22.680]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[2:59:22.680 --> 2:59:28.280]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists,
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:32.760]  they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to today?
[2:59:32.760 --> 2:59:38.680]  It seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the
[2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:45.640]  Republic. Get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online
[2:59:45.640 --> 2:59:58.680]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:10.680]  Network.
[3:00:17.800 --> 3:00:23.400]  I really can't thank Nero Apprendas enough of all he's done. And I want him to tell you about his
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:31.560]  latest contest where you can win a hefty sum for simply learning how to recite the 10 Commandments.
[3:00:31.560 --> 3:00:36.920]  I know it's a serious thought crime. Might be medieval under the new hate crime legislation,
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:42.200]  but we're going to have to go ahead and stand up against Caesar when he says that we can't
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:47.880]  read and say certain things. Of course, Romans 13 says, according to the churches,
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:55.400]  that the Christians should have fallen down before Caesar and worship Mithra. And I guess,
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:01:01.560]  I guess Romans 13's right. I guess those Christians were evil. But Daryl, finishing up,
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:05.880]  tell us about the contest. Hey, real quick on that one, though, before I get to the contest,
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:11.160]  you know, the same thing happened to the apostles early on and in Acts, you know,
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:16.120]  chapter 529, Peter and all the other apostles replied to the officials of the government,
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:23.640]  we must obey God rather than men. And when the law of men is in conflict with the law of God,
[3:01:23.640 --> 3:01:27.640]  it's a clear cut decision for anybody that the Christian or say they believe in God. And that
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:33.240]  says, hey, if it's lying, cheating, stealing, killing, coveting, and so on, then you ought not
[3:01:33.240 --> 3:01:38.840]  to do it. You ought not to stand up for it. You ought to stand firm and not let yourself be burdened
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:44.440]  and not to live as a free man. And don't use your freedom as a cover up for evil. Obey God,
[3:01:44.440 --> 3:01:49.400]  not men. But as far as pen and wind goes, you know, God works in mysterious ways. My wife had an
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:54.120]  emergency as a decimation Monday. So as you might imagine, that was the day I was supposed to be
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:58.600]  calling. I sent out an emergency announcement to everybody not knowing how the surgery would go,
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:04.360]  what the recovery time would be. We postponed the giveaway until November 13th. That's actually a
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:09.480]  Friday the 13th turnout to be a very lucky day for somebody where they're going to get a chance
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:15.720]  to win 20 grand. So if you just go to penandwind.com, it explains itself. But in short, all you've
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:20.760]  got to be able to do is name all 10 commandments in order in 20 seconds or less. And if you're the
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:26.280]  first one I get on the phone, as I draw the names one by one, who can do that, you get 20 grand.
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:32.840]  Very simple. Darryl Rundis, I salute you and your great work. And I'm going to let you talk to
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:39.880]  the IT guys to Will and Matt right now. I'm going to put one of them on the line with you. You want
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:45.480]  to give us the codes to youdonews.com so we can look at it, figure it out, tell us about the servers,
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:51.480]  give us the number to your IT guy. And then as you said, for liability issues, I probably want to
[3:02:51.480 --> 3:02:57.400]  roll that into one of my corporations. And yeah, let's give it some time. How about a week and a
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:03.400]  half from now in studio for two hours or an hour and a half. And then we can officially
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:09.880]  sign some documents and paperwork. We'll get it officially transferred over to you guys. Hey,
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:13.960]  how about, and I'll talk to your producer as we get off the line, but we'll check your schedule,
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:19.800]  not this Friday, but next Friday. We can come down and we'll talk some more about it. You
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:25.080]  could even do 10 and win from here. There you go. Hey, see, that's the same day. Maybe the 13th,
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:30.040]  and we can do it on air live. So that way people will know that it's no gimmick. It's no trick.
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:33.880]  We're not, you know, we're not making this up. People are really going to get their chance to
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:38.680]  win 20. Okay, so you'll have the numbers. We can have a keypad in front of you. You can dial the
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:44.280]  numbers. Actually, we set it up on our site, our IT guy. So cool. He took the database and had it
[3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:50.120]  automatically randomly select a number that'll pop up on the screen and give us their record
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:53.080]  with their name and their address and their phone number. So then, you know, one by one,
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:57.240]  as I click that bus, you can do that here. Yeah, I could do it right there. Hey, we'll do 10 and
[3:03:57.240 --> 3:04:02.840]  one here as long as your wife's better. Yeah, Friday 13. All right, buddy. Thank you, Daryl,
[3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:07.000]  for all your support. Well, we thank God for you, Alex. Keep up the good work and don't let
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:12.760]  them get in your head, man. No, I just got a headache today because I'm not complaining. I
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:17.160]  really have a bad headache. Probably because I've had too much coffee or something. And I just,
[3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:22.200]  I need a vacation, Daryl. You know, I, I'm not complaining, but I want to fight the new world
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:29.160]  order. And that's all I want to do. And then I overdo it. All work and no play makes jack-o-doll
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:32.600]  boys, they say. Well, in that, I think for you, it's probably the most frustrating thing is that
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:36.920]  you give your heart, your soul, your mind, your time, your energy, and other people are so passive
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:41.320]  and so apathetic, it just makes you sick. Absolutely. Well, I mean, I thought there were
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:45.080]  only two sewage treatment plants that we're going to put on Lake Travis. Just an example.
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:51.560]  Now I find out Austin's putting a gigantic sewage plant and it's going to ruin the lake and nobody
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:57.080]  cares. It's just, that's just one example of something local that gives me a headache. Daryl
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:05.080]  Rundis, God bless you. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:10.440]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:15.880]  would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[3:05:15.880 --> 3:05:21.080]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts,

[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:26.200]  Okay, I have cleared the phone boards. I apologize other callers, but it wouldn't be congruent.
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:33.160]  I want to open the phones up this hour specifically and only for questions for
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:39.880]  the author of Defeating with the Salitarian Lie, Hilmer von Campy. I had him on for an hour,
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:44.600]  a month ago or so. He was a Hitler youth when Hitler first came to power. He was then in the
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:48.920]  German army. He grew up in the Hitler youth to be trained to be in the German army.
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:57.000]  And he has written a book about the parallels between our society today and the police state
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  and everything else in Germany. And this idea of doing whatever the government says,
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:07.240]  and the government is the boss, the people are the slaves. He wants to go back to 1776,
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:17.160]  not back to 1933. Now, I get a lot of emails, especially now that folks have seen follow the
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:23.560]  Republic and they say, so what if they're training the Boy Scouts, the Eagle Scouts,
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.960]  with M16s to take on disgruntled veterans and to be a brigade serving Homeland Security,
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:36.440]  we'll just wipe them out. No, ladies and gentlemen, if they're 14 now, they're going to be 18 in a
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:44.120]  few years. This is the process of getting people young, indoctrinating them and getting them ready.
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:50.040]  Sure, you might not have been too afraid of Hilmer von Campy when he was 12 in the Hitler youth,
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:56.680]  or 10, but you would have been afraid of him when he was 18. Okay, that's the issue here,
[3:09:56.680 --> 3:10:03.080]  or 20 or 21. They're taking over the Girl Scouts. They've got, Obama's got his domestic
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:08.840]  security force, city year, all these groups in red and black uniforms saying, I'm fierce,
[3:10:08.840 --> 3:10:14.760]  coming to your door, knocking, trying to intimidate you. All this is really happening.
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:21.080]  And we've seen this in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Eastern Germany, under the communist,
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:29.480]  Fidel Castro, tyranny tries to take control of the youth. Obama wants a year round schooling.
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:33.720]  He wants to address your children and ask them to aid him in his mission.
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:41.720]  This is a telltale sign of corruption. So I'd like Hilmer von Campy to recap
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:48.200]  the keys of his book, the parallels first between what he saw on the Hitler youth and in Germany
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:55.640]  itself and the tattletale society versus what he sees manifesting in the West today.
[3:10:56.600 --> 3:11:02.920]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls and questions at 1-800-259-9231,
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:13.480]  questions only for Hilmer von Campy about the parallels between Nazi Germany and modern
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:21.640]  America and Europe today. And this system calls for our guests today in the 50 minutes we have
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:28.120]  left. Hilmer von Campy, author of defeating the Tattletarian lie. It's good to have you here with
[3:11:28.120 --> 3:11:33.720]  us. Thank you very much. I'd like you to be here. Did you get a good response last time you were on?
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:40.440]  It was the best ever. It was a very, very good report. Even better than when you were on the
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:47.000]  700 Club? Well, that was a different story because that was a television that came here with their
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:57.800]  equipment to my house. But on the radio show, this was the best ever advice, the reaction of
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:02.600]  listeners was disconcernt. Well, it's great to have you here with us and I want to take calls
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:07.880]  today to do something different. But in this segment we have left here in the next eight minutes,
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:13.160]  nine minutes, let's say you were on national television, you had eight minutes to say your
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:19.160]  piece, the parallels, the warning from the past, the message you want to get out, you've got the floor.
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:34.440]  But I think the most important thing is that we look at the whole picture and not only at individual acts which infuriate one.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:13:00.440]  In other words, you can attack and they should be attacked. In debt, the trillions of dollars these people in Washington want to spend and debit them to our children and grandchildren, this is a scandal, and that has to be fought so that everything, that these things must not be law.
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:26.440]  So therefore, at the same time, morality, totalitarian systems like the Nazi systems, grow out of immorality, totalitarian system is not because of poor and rich people, but about God abiding or immoral people.
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:42.440]  And that has all to be seen from the heart here, from the core, from what really, what is it all about. And that is what I learned from the Nazis.
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:14:08.440]  It is all about the role of God in human society. And the World War II was, in my view, the first ideological war. There were two nations or two countries, Germany and Soviet Union, who represented a materialistic ideology.
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:18.440]  And the so-called free world, which is a democratic western civilization.
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:36.440]  What made it is that I realized that after that, when I began to think about what it is, is that it is the Godlessness which has brought Germany down.
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:50.440]  And the totalitarians, they want to remove God because they want to be God. They put the state and the dictatorship and the power of the state. It becomes the new God, and everyone must follow it.
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:15:00.440]  Romans 13, Hitler's favorite Bible passage, that distortion, instead of people standing up for individual liberty and freedom and western culture.
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:18.440]  And you're absolutely right about, I mean, obviously you lived it, but I've read the history, that happening. But I do think it's important, Hilmer von Kampi, to show the parallels so that people can recognize it's happening, to hear from somebody who was a Hitler youth and then a German soldier,
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:30.440]  to hear about, this happened in Germany, now it's happening here. I think that's what wakes people up, to understand that both Hitler tried to CPS and take people's children.
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:39.440]  They went all over Europe and grabbed Aryan children, what they believed to be Aryan, away from their parents. They took children that weren't Aryan and took them and killed them.
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:49.440]  They believed in the social welfare, they believed in racial hygiene, they believed in the eugenics, they believed in abortion, they believed in everything we're seeing now.
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:56.440]  They believed in free love, everybody having sex with each other.
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:16:12.440]  Well, it is Godlessness, which brought Germany down. And the answer is, you have to have an answer to Godlessness.
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:29.440]  We were told in the Hitler youth and in school that you can pray and sing hymns in your churches and your homes, but you have nothing to say in society, that's our job.
[3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:46.440]  In other words, they had realized that, as you correctly stated, that if there is an authority about government, they would have a problem with their program.
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:17:04.440]  So therefore, they wanted to push us out of society. Now, I say that the ACLU, for instance, is the advanced guard of National Socialist ideology, because that is exactly what they are doing.
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:09.440]  They are taking God out of society and they have been very successful.
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:18.440]  Well, sir, we actually went and got the archives of the twenties and thirties and forties of the leftist intellectuals, all the top names.
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:30.440]  We have them supporting Hitler on video. These were hard to get. We have them supporting eugenics. We have them supporting taking all the children at birth.
[3:17:30.440 --> 3:17:41.440]  And it was the left in the United States and England and Europe that actually supported Hitler. People think Hitler was right-wing in that paradigm. He wasn't, was he?
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:59.440]  No, he was. He was the extreme left. And there was only just about two days ago that in Germany, there is what would be the FBI here. That is a similar thing in Germany. And they are watching the right.
[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:20.440]  And they are watching the right, which is a party, which is not an anti-party, but which has conservative likes. And they say if another FBI, the German FBI, decided they will also watch the left organizations.
[3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:30.440]  And I realized, and the left began to protest that if you go from the right to the left, that is very bad, because they think the left is okay.
[3:18:30.440 --> 3:18:39.440]  And I realized that in the mentality and in the mind of the German of today, they have not understood what the Nazis are all about.
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:45.440]  They only have looked at the atrocities, but they don't. They have not looked at the fundamentals of Hitler.
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:56.440]  Hitler was a big environmentalist. He had to clean the earth of bad humans. He was a vegetarian. He was an animal rights activist. He was a national socialist.
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:23.440]  Yes, that is also another thing, that you have the same evolution theory in school, and not that God created this world and created every human being, but that there was a kind of evolution which came so that you had people out of hate or whatever it is.
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:41.440]  But the basic philosophy of this guy was that it is a strong who survives, and the strong has the right to eliminate the weak, and that was of course what Hitler and the Nazis.
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:57.440]  And that social Darwinism, whether you believe in evolution or not, they have made it a fake scientific debate by pinning down Christians with quacks. Whether you debate how God made it, they are just saying we are all slime, we are weak, we deserve to die.
[3:19:57.440 --> 3:20:23.440]  That is the essence of evolution. Stay there.

[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:14.440]  As we are finishing off this agenda, we will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:21:14.440 --> 3:21:20.440]  We have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:21:20.440 --> 3:21:25.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:35.440]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:35.440 --> 3:21:42.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:21:42.440 --> 3:21:49.440]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:28.440]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit,
[3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:34.440]  then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:43.440]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:52.440]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works. Call for your copy, 1-800-686-2237.

[3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:24.440]  Todd, Craig, Kevin, Mark, Rich, you get a chance to talk to Hilmer von Kampi as we start the next segment, the last 30 minutes.
[3:24:24.440 --> 3:24:39.440]  But in this short segment, Hilmer, you've written this book trying to warn people. You were getting into Hitler loved and was obsessed with, for those that have read Mein Kampf and read his speeches, read the history books with his statements.
[3:24:39.440 --> 3:24:50.440]  He was obsessed with evolution, obsessed with social Darwinism. That's why the Rockefellers had funded the Kaiser Velhelm Institute on eugenics, the Colesprings Harbor eugenics facility here in the U.S.
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:25:00.440]  IBMs, Hollerith machines with the tattoos on the people in the camps was to be entered into the machines, how much they'd be fed, how long they'd be worked.
[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:19.440]  I know you know all of that, but absolutely. When we look at evolution, it's not really a debate about how life develops. It's saying humans are worthless, humans are blobs, humans are a cancer.
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:30.440]  I believe with the churches they set up a false debate between church and science, like the church was a bunch of idiots and they'll put an average preacher up going, I didn't come from a monkey.
[3:25:30.440 --> 3:25:41.440]  I didn't come from a, instead of saying something put us here on this planet, there's a higher power. There's a greater law. Instead, Hitler or Stalin, he was a big eugenicist.
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:48.440]  They become the law. They love this system. So that's a key point you hit on.
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:52.440]  Did you ask me?
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:59.440]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying that's a key point you brought up. You were talking about Hitler saying it's the strong's right to kill the weak.
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:00.440]  Yes.
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:23.440]  Then they allowed themselves to kill as many as were against them. They practically, as you correctly stated, he made himself to the God and every disapproval of him was normally answered with Gestapo and the land in the concentration camp.
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:42.440]  We had, in front of our home, not from our home, from our church on Sunday, we had agents of the Gestapo who took the names down of all the people and went and everybody knew that they were there for, it was a kind of intimidation.
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  And that's the way it worked.
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:54.440]  Now, our in the fed protest and tea parties have the army in the feds watching us and marking our names down in the feds admit that they are in the churches doing that as well.
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:58.440]  All of this is being announced to intimidate people.
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:02.440]  Yeah, absolutely correct. That's the way it is.
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:27.440]  But this is only the result of decades of violations of the government agencies, of the government structures where the systematically, a bit there, a bit there, a bit there, the reality of the Constitution was violated.
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:37.440]  And what we have now is everything what they're doing in Washington, as far as I am concerned, is against the Constitution, is unconstitutional.
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:45.440]  And I'm really very astonished that there is no, I have not heard, I know that I have talked myself to the tea parties.
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:28:08.440]  They are patriots, these people. But there has to be some circles where they put together a team of lawyers, so that you attack what is unconstitutional, not just get trillions and trillions of dollars into debt and make organizations which I have only in, only at the,
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:22.440]  at the own population and not at anything else. Anybody who, all those who are not in agreement with what the government is, is involved in.
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:34.440]  But I don't see that. I see the Republicans, even the Mrs. Snow yesterday, that it goes to get to something, be partisan. No, Mrs. Snow, it's not be partisan.
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:50.440]  It's what is right. And this, these things that you bring out as law, that is against the Constitution, we have to stop it.
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:29:00.440]  Absolutely. Those trying to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, they, according to the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights Constitution, are the enemies of the republic.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:09.440]  They are the criminals. But instead, the FBI has been trained, we have their training manuals and police are being trained, that people that talk about the Constitution are bad.
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:19.440]  It's upside down. We are bad because we're not letting offshore banks become the government and then become God and have unlimited power.
[3:29:19.440 --> 3:29:30.440]  Yeah, I have, as you mentioned, the Declaration of Independence. I have it here in front of me. And here it is in the second paragraph.
[3:29:30.440 --> 3:29:38.440]  Well, stay there. Come back to the second paragraph and we're going to phone calls with Hilmer Von Compey, the author of the book, Defeating with the Talitarian Lie.
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:51.440]  The calls are straight ahead after this quote from the Declaration of Independence or questions for Hilmer Von Compey. I'm Alex Jones, prisonpoina.com.
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:30:01.440]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:11.440]  The solution created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:16.440]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:30:16.440 --> 3:30:31.440]  Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness. Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[3:30:31.440 --> 3:30:47.440]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health manager. I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system. Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[3:31:02.440 --> 3:31:09.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:18.440]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:21.440]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:26.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:26.440 --> 3:31:36.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:42.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:42.440 --> 3:31:49.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:31:49.440 --> 3:32:00.440]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:32:00.440 --> 3:32:10.440]  Times are tough and many of us expect them to get worse. The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[3:32:10.440 --> 3:32:19.440]  Therefore you have no excuse not to be prepared. If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[3:32:19.440 --> 3:32:30.440]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food. Patriotfood.com is different because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[3:32:30.440 --> 3:32:37.440]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty food grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[3:32:37.440 --> 3:32:47.440]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds of great bulk food supplies for a fraction of that.
[3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:53.440]  Our company is owned by a famous patriot, Big John Lipscomb. I know you can trust him. He's my dad.
[3:32:53.440 --> 3:33:19.440]  Patriotfood.com is the wise choice for food insurance.
[3:33:24.440 --> 3:33:30.440]  But the blight, the scourge of big government and the control freak authoritarians is now upon us.
[3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:37.440]  Hilmer von Kompi, we're going to get more into ideological philosophy before you leave us, but I promise to go to calls right now.
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:41.440]  But you wanted to say something about the Declaration of Independence. Go ahead.
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:54.440]  It says in the second paragraph, we hold those truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal,
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:34:02.440]  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:07.440]  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:17.440]  And that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, so that is their task to secure our rights.
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:24.440]  Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:30.440]  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:39.440]  they are right of the people to order or to abolish it and to institute new government-led foundations and such principles
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:50.440]  and are organizing its power in such form as to themselves seem most likely to the effect of their safety and happiness.
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:35:02.440]  I think that our government and our government in the Congress are acting in a very irresponsible way destroying our constitution.
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:10.440]  And I think it's the right of the citizens. As you've already said, the rules have been turned around.
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:16.440]  What is up is down, and what is down is up. But you don't need to accept that.
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:23.440]  I just wonder how to, and I have no answer to the question about how to effect our constitution.
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:30.440]  You do it state by state. You have to have the states not secede but declare sovereignty under 9th and 10th Amendment.
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:36.440]  You have to then march through a mass awakening to take back the Congress,
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:41.440]  and you have to audit the Fed and arrest the banking leadership that are the true shadow government.
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:48.440]  By doing that, we can win this very quickly, but as you said earlier, we have become a decadent, wicked society on average
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:59.440]  that made us easily taken over. So because people are so lazy and decadent, they can't even grasp basic philosophy that is ingrained in the natural law.
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:04.440]  But that sounds, the Declaration of Independence is a great threat to the New World Order,
[3:36:04.440 --> 3:36:11.440]  because today, people go, okay, all men are equal. But that was a revolutionary statement then.
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:18.440]  We take it for granted. Before, kings were sovereign and above everyone, and everyone was an equal.
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:23.440]  Equal in our rights, not equal in our gifts or what we're able to do individually.
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:30.440]  And we are independent, free, and equal to create our own systems and our own wealth
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:34.440]  without having it sucked off of us by the parasite class.
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:41.440]  So that's why the elite demonize the Declaration of Independence, because the document written by Thomas Jefferson
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:52.440]  is the ultimate threat and stands in complete ideological resistance to their philosophy of the collectivist parasite system.
[3:36:52.440 --> 3:37:00.440]  Let's talk to Todd in Florida. You're on the air with former Hitler, Eugen, and former German military man in World War II,
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:04.440]  Hilmer von Kompi. Go ahead, Todd, you're on the air.
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:10.440]  Yeah, it's a pleasure. Thanks, Von Kampen, for coming in here and taking the time to talk to us.
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  I had two questions. One that was directed to you, Alex, and one that was directed to Von Kampen
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:22.440]  and directed to the parallels in our current government in Nazi Germany.
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:29.440]  My first question kind of leads into my second one, but basically, Alex, my fiance just gave birth to a one-month-old baby,
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:34.440]  or excuse me, is one month now, but of course the doctors are pushing some of the vaccines on.
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  My first question is one, did you give your kids when they were young to see the hepatitis?
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:44.440]  No, my children never had one vaccine.
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:48.440]  Okay, I'm a huge fan, and I just always wanted to know that, especially since I have a young baby now.
[3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:53.440]  And for Mr. Von Kamp, I wanted to talk to you about the parallels between the vaccinations that is going on now,
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:59.440]  the ones that they're trying to push on everybody, and the parallels between how the Germans and Nazis did that back then.
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:02.440]  I know they obviously did a lot of horrendous things to the Jews.
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:12.440]  Yeah, medical tyranny. The state running healthcare and using it as a way to control people. Mr. Von Kampen.
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:21.440]  Well, honestly, I can't remember. I know that there were some injections at the time, but there was nothing.
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:35.440]  I mean, I was a boy, and I think it's very difficult to compare because we are now about 60, 70 years later,
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:46.440]  and the medicine has been developing fast in many aspects. And what they had at that time in Germany, I have to admit, I don't really know.
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:53.440]  But they did use the medical tyranny to euthanize, to abort babies, to kill babies. I think that was a larger issue.
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:57.440]  But thank you, Todd. Craig in Kentucky. Craig, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:38:58.440]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:38:59.440]  Pretty good.
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:10.440]  Mr. Von Kampen, was there any type of town hall meetings implemented before Mr. Hitler went completely berserk into totalitarian government?
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  No, there were. As far as I know, there wasn't anything of this nature. I think each party, you had a very strong communist party and also a strong socialist party.
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:36.440]  And they used to have their own reunions from their party point of view. And the stormtroopers, as we called it, were the task.
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:45.440]  They were the Nazi force, which they intimidated the rest of the people.
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:40:00.440]  And by the way, that was one reason Hitler came to power and stated power was because as bad as Hitler was, people were even more afraid of the communist and the socialist because people knew about the death camps and mass murder in Russia,
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:08.440]  and they knew the Soviets were behind these groups. So that was one thing that drove people into Hitler's arms. Correct, Mr. Von Kampen?
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:19.440]  Yeah, I think there was no secret in the Soviet Union. In Germany, it was different. Most people did not know about it all because I had no idea.
[3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:35.440]  But we all knew about the discrimination which the Jews had to suffer. And there was no national outcry because, and that is also similarity, because the people were comfortable and they didn't want no risk.
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:41.440]  What about the Holocaust of unborn babies in this country? Nobody seemed to care about them.
[3:40:41.440 --> 3:40:45.440]  You mean the 50 billion? Because they're aborted here in America, no?
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:47.440]  Yes, 51 million now.
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:41:16.440]  Yeah, there is no difference between killing a live human being or his mother, and if you push a Jew into a gas chamber, that is the same killing which is against God and that we have a government with this immorality representing us and making our laws representing us in other countries.
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:18.440]  I think it's disgusting.
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:21.440]  Alright, thank you. Anything else, Craig?
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  And I want to say that I have plenty of information on this question, as far as I know, in my book, which you can get at my website.
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:37.440]  We're going to give that out before you leave so people get pencil and paper ready. Anything else, Craig?
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:51.440]  I just wanted to mention, as far as a democracy in this country, they're trying to say that this country is a democracy, even on the mainstream media, and we're a constitutional republic, and I don't think people actually understand what's going on.
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:58.440]  Exactly. Hitler was a democracy. He was elected. He then set up a tyranny after a democracy got him there.
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  In a republic, if 51% say we're going to tax the other 49 or we're going to take their property, you can't do it because rule of law protects the minority as well as the majority.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:17.440]  But in a democracy, they can put the carbon taxes on you. They can enslave you, and that's what's happening.
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:23.440]  If 51% says restrict their First Amendment, it happens, but not in a republic.
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:28.440]  Kevin in Texas. Kevin, you're on the air.
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  Hi, Mr. Bond. I'd like to ask two questions if I may. I was wondering if, if you believe that you were successfully propagandized as a child, and also with the Nazi morals that they were pushing on you, did they differ from that of the morals of your parents and grandparents?
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:57.440]  So what were the tactics that they used to try to get you onto their side? Yeah, how did they help break up families? I mean, families were still together, but how did they, as you said, there was a split in your family, but it was kept private.
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:10.440]  How did they turn the youth against their parents? Well, they didn't. I don't think they were successful. The question is up to where can they influence people?
[3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:22.440]  And there are two sides. One, for instance, it was forbidden and managed with capital treatment that you would be killed if you...
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:44.440]  My father used to listen to German-speaking broadcasts from Britain and from Switzerland at 10 o'clock at night. But the problem you are putting forward is how did they do it? They asked questions at the children about their parents, about how are you doing?
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:44:00.440]  There are many ways that you can ask children, and they hoped that this way they can get hold of the parents if they recognize if there is anything which is against the Third Reich, against the Hitler regime.
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:10.440]  So they told the children to spy on their parents? Yeah, but they didn't call it this way. I mean, that was a very harmless question.
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:31.440]  Exactly. Public schools nationwide have free federal computers, and this has now been declassified, and they have you write a journal in sixth and seventh grade about your family, and they ask, do your parents ever discipline you?
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:41.440]  What's in the medicine cabinet? Does mommy yell at you? And the children are there being taught to type this in or write this, and then it's transcribed and put online.
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:51.440]  It's like when I have had children, my wife said three children, and after the first child I learned at the hospital, the nurse says, huh, will you take this file downstairs for me?
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:45:03.440]  And then when I left, they said, how you doing money-wise? Does he ever mean to you? And then my wife's like, no, we have enough money, and he's not mean to me, and well, does he hit you?
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:12.440]  And a lot of women are, their water's broken, they're about to have a baby, they're waiting to get an IV in their arm and go into the, and they tell the induction nurse, well, yeah, we're having trouble with money.
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:24.440]  Now the health department's called. You don't have enough money to have the baby. Now the state's going to take it. The spies are everywhere, and they don't tell you they're setting you up when they're doing it.
[3:45:24.440 --> 3:45:26.440]  Is that how it was in Germany?
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:45.440]  Yeah, that's the way, and let me say also that they didn't really, at least in the small cities, we were living in small, in the small cities, in contrast to what the big cities like Berlin and Hamburg and Munich, that was different.
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:57.440]  But they did not try, in the Hitler use, to make us, to indoctrinate us and make us Nazis. We were indoctrinated with ideological purposes.
[3:45:57.440 --> 3:46:12.440]  In other words, what Hitler wanted from us is to make it possible that he could realize his program, which was to expand Germany towards the east, and capture.
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:24.440]  Yeah, you were cannon fodder. You were being bred for military service, and it was all under a peer pressure system. Let's go ahead and take another call. Kevin in Texas, you're on the air.
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:26.440]  I believe you just had me on.
[3:46:26.440 --> 3:46:32.440]  Okay, Kevin, thank you. They told me Kevin was next. Mark in Georgia. Mark, go ahead.
[3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:44.440]  Oh, just a second. People say how free we are in this country. I say, yep, we're the freest country in the world, and gosh darn it, I have the government's permission to say so.
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  People say how free we are, and I point out to them, well, you tell that to Sarah Weaver. Oh, that's right, she's dead.
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:47:09.440]  You tell that to Erwin Schiff. I don't know if you've heard. He recently lost a toe to gangrene when he was in diesel therapy. Gosh darn it, I thought he had...
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:25.440]  Yeah, and I haven't heard his son, who we want to get on about that, or maybe he's commented, has his son commented on that lately on when he's on all these TV shows, talking about the economy?
[3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:33.440]  There may be an understanding that if he brings it up, his dad's situation will go from bad to worse. I don't know.
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:45.440]  On Udu News, my user ID is MarkAnabaptist, and I uploaded a clip from Monty Python and the Holy Grail to bring out your dead scene about Obamacare.
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:53.440]  And if somebody can take that and polish it up, I'd be grateful. Okay?
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:56.440]  All right, sir. Do you have any questions for Mr. Von Campy?
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:48:07.440]  I'm just wondering what you see going on here and what happened in your youth. I understand you see a number of disturbing parallels.
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:17.440]  Because what I said to some neocons was Thomas Jefferson, the word liberal stems from the word liberty. The founders were liberals in fighting for liberty.
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:25.440]  I tremble for my nation when I ponder that God is just. And the thing is, what is going on here, what happened in your youth?
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:28.440]  You're saying that there's very disturbing parallels.
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:33.440]  Yes, sir. Mr. Von Campy, you covered it last time you were on the people just in a shotgun pattern.
[3:48:33.440 --> 3:48:40.440]  But see, they've changed all the terms. Classical liberal, the media ask, who are you? And I go, I'm a classical liberal.
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:48.440]  Well, what's that? Well, it's a paleoconservative because they've changed all the terms around till they mean almost nothing.
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:52.440]  It's liberty versus tyranny. It's individual freedom versus the state.
[3:48:52.440 --> 3:49:02.440]  But, but, I mean, the parallels, the youth being brainwashed, the spies, the secret police, the government knows all the social Darwinism.
[3:49:02.440 --> 3:49:05.440]  I mean, those are the parallels. Are they not?
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:17.440]  Well, America should be a nation under God. That would mean that God's commandment would rule the society.
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:28.440]  Instead, they do the same thing as an artist did. And that is not just Obama that has been going on for decades.
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:40.440]  That bit by bit, the constitution is being destroyed. And now we are that the government can do anything.
[3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:48.440]  Yeah, here's a big parallel. Hitler had secret arrest. Now we have secret arrest in the United States.
[3:49:48.440 --> 3:50:07.440]  Yeah, it's the destruction. Because the founding fathers have, I have a whole package of it, where they say that the American Constitution has to have Christians as citizens.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:21.440]  Because otherwise, the structure will be destroyed. And we have a president who, when he came, when he accepted his speech, he already stated that he wanted to change the Constitution.
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:27.440]  Because according to our Constitution, you can't take out money and give it to somebody else.
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:37.440]  But they do that. They do not recognize the right of people to his property. And they want to control everything.
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:43.440]  Yeah, that's the big parallel. The Nazis would take your property if they wanted to in the name of the state.
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  Now they do that here and they're saying, we're not just going to take it for imminent domain.
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:53.440]  We're going to take your property without compensation if somebody else just wants it who gave us a campaign contribution.
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:51:01.440]  The new London kilo decision of three years ago stated somebody can give a campaign contribution to take your land.
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:10.440]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine. I'm not. Don't trust it. But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:18.440]  So I use pure works and unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form. Pure works is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:26.440]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes. Use pure works to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:34.440]  You can find out all about it and order it online at no germs dot info. That's no germs dot info.
[3:51:34.440 --> 3:51:43.440]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[3:51:43.440 --> 3:51:49.440]  Don't pick your nose. Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[3:51:49.440 --> 3:51:54.440]  Do try pure works available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[3:51:54.440 --> 3:52:02.440]  Go to no germs dot info. That's no germs dot info. Be well and stay well. Best MZ.
[3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:10.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:15.440]  They're finishing off this agenda. They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:21.440]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:26.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:36.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:42.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:42.440 --> 3:52:49.440]  Today it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:16.440]  I was a highway man. Along the coach roads I did ride. With sword and pistol by my side.
[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:27.440]  Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade. Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[3:54:27.440 --> 3:54:37.440]  Rich in Ohio. You're on the air with the author of Defeating with the Talitarian Line. Go ahead Rich.
[3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:43.440]  Actually it's Rich runner but that's fine. Thanks Alex. I've been listening to you for a couple years. Wonderful job.
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:57.440]  Mr. Von Komp, my wife was born in Hof, Germany. Her folks were totally against Hitler and wouldn't let him go to any of the rallies or anything like that.
[3:54:57.440 --> 3:55:06.440]  I want to speak directly to what you've been talking about. Alex from a quote, have you heard of Ernst Hackel as a science advisor to Hitler?
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:14.440]  The name rings bell but I can't remember what it is. Well I would like to read. He was one of the scientific advisors to Hitler.
[3:55:14.440 --> 3:55:23.440]  A German evolutionist. He wrote that Christianity makes no distinction of race or of color. It seeks to break down all racial barriers.
[3:55:23.440 --> 3:55:31.440]  In this respect the hand of Christianity is against that of nature. For not the race is the mankind, the evolutionary harvest,
[3:55:31.440 --> 3:55:40.440]  which nature had toiled through long ages to produce. May we not say then that Christianity is anti-evolutionary in its aim?
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:50.440]  I just want to say the full title of Darwin's book is the origin of the species, the origin of species by means of natural selection
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:55.440]  or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:56:01.440]  And Mein Kampf, is that word Kampf not struggle?
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:10.440]  Well sir, no one debates that the eugenics, Darwinistic system, Darwin basically invented eugenics and then Galton termed it,
[3:56:10.440 --> 3:56:18.440]  but there's no debating this. What they do is they create fake science and have quack preachers get up and argue science with people
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:27.440]  when there's evidence of creation. I'm not debating how God created things. These are mind tricks they play with us to make us look stupid.
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:37.440]  We just need to explain that eugenics is wrong and putting poison in the population's water like the White House Sciencear calls for is wrong.
[3:56:37.440 --> 3:56:43.440]  And these are control freaks. I appreciate your call. Don in Alabama, last caller, go ahead.
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:49.440]  Man, I'm glad I get the last word, Alex. Thanks for all your hard work and the new movie.
[3:56:49.440 --> 3:56:55.440]  And I just wanted to say I get to look at Hilmar eye to eye every Sunday and Wednesday night.
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:56:58.440]  I call him a friend. We go to church together.
[3:56:58.440 --> 3:57:04.440]  And he's a man of real courage and an amazing fortitude.
[3:57:04.440 --> 3:57:08.440]  And I think he's the real deal when you talk about patriots.
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:16.440]  He's come to this country. And I know within our group of people, he has awakened us to action.
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:24.440]  In fact, we're going to meet tonight to jot up some details of how we can be more effective.
[3:57:24.440 --> 3:57:29.440]  Well, make no mistake. If there's one message I want to get across, we're in a war.
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:38.440]  And the totalitarians, the authoritarians have taken over and they are thieves and they want to control your life.
[3:57:38.440 --> 3:57:41.440]  And they will rob you and they will kill you.
[3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:45.440]  They'll keep stealing and stealing to the whole society collapses and put us in work camps.
[3:57:45.440 --> 3:57:49.440]  That's in the executive orders. So people had better get involved.
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:52.440]  So Mr. Von Kamping, you know Don from Alabama.
[3:57:52.440 --> 3:58:00.440]  Yeah, I'm seeing him tonight. That was a message from Alabama. I like that very much. I'm glad you came on.
[3:58:00.440 --> 3:58:02.440]  All right, Don, thank you. We're out of time.
[3:58:02.440 --> 3:58:05.440]  Hilmer Von Kamping, give us the website for folks that want to get your book.
[3:58:05.440 --> 3:58:10.440]  It's www.funkamping.com.
[3:58:10.440 --> 3:58:13.440]  Can you spell it? You can spell it in English. I can spell it.
[3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:17.440]  Yes, V-O-N-C-A-M-P-E dot com.
[3:58:17.440 --> 3:58:19.440]  We've got your name up on infowars.com.
[3:58:19.440 --> 3:58:23.440]  Folks can Google that and find it. The book is Defeating the Talitarian Lie.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:25.440]  My new film.
[3:58:25.440 --> 3:58:31.440]  And you guys, if you do it by, all right, can all of you on my website and you get my signature.
[3:58:31.440 --> 3:58:33.440]  I send it immediately to you.
[3:58:33.440 --> 3:58:35.440]  Absolutely. Hilmer, it was great having you on. Thank you.
[3:58:35.440 --> 3:58:39.440]  And we cover the eugenics in my film Endgame.
[3:58:39.440 --> 3:58:42.440]  Retransmission starts now. Great job, crew.
[3:58:42.440 --> 3:58:45.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:45.440 --> 3:58:51.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.

[3:58:54.440 --> 3:58:58.440]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
