[00:20.840 --> 00:33.560]  it is Wednesday the 21st day of December 2011 our nation and the rest of the
[00:33.560 --> 00:41.240]  world from China to England from Russia to Mexico is being imploded by design
[00:41.240 --> 00:45.800]  and brought to its knees through controlled depression we have this from
[00:45.800 --> 00:51.160]  the IMF and World Bank documents BBC 2002 they're playing and they are now
[00:51.160 --> 00:56.720]  carrying it out massive new banker bailouts which is really just direct
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.040]  taxation over the population to the big six megabanks much of it US taxpayer
[01:02.040 --> 01:08.120]  money has now been announced in Europe last year at Davos they wanted 100
[01:08.120 --> 01:15.600]  trillion in new taxpayer money the power to taxes the power to destroy the
[01:15.600 --> 01:20.760]  globalist want to shut down all of their competition the worst of the worst have
[01:20.760 --> 01:27.280]  competed to get control of society they engage in high-tech propaganda to
[01:27.280 --> 01:36.520]  manipulate and befuddle and bamboozle the dumbstruck population we are here to
[01:36.520 --> 01:44.160]  shake people out of their morass out of their dazed existence to become actual
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.600]  actors in the game of life to be on the field not mindless programmable
[01:49.600 --> 01:58.720]  spectators nothing but virtual biological androids I knew this would come I
[01:58.720 --> 02:03.000]  knew that Louisiana and surrounding areas were a beta test I knew at the time
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.880]  they were going door-to-door confiscating guns in the high and dry areas and
[02:06.880 --> 02:11.320]  killing US citizens it was all a big exercise in martial law and media
[02:11.320 --> 02:16.040]  control the government cut the police lines sheriffs and others went public
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.360]  they jam police communications as the storm hit so they could claim that the
[02:20.360 --> 02:26.320]  police stood down and set a pretext for FBI leading regular army big army
[02:26.320 --> 02:33.800]  National Guard and military police and SWAT teams from around the country you
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.560]  saw that happen almost six years ago now as the welfare state implodes as the
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.400]  crime accelerates in Chicago in fact I'm gonna have Paul Watson and Nemo add
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.200]  this right now in Chicago and in New Orleans but the new article is on
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.040]  Louisiana New Orleans remember block the Blagoia that's just a month or so
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.880]  before he got indicted you can pull this up was any associated press and the
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.440]  audio of it and said we want National Guard and regular army doing door-to-door
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.000]  gun sweeps and they've actually had them now in Chicago quietly so we should by
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.400]  the way add that caveat to this to show folks that it is a Democratic Party but
[03:13.400 --> 03:20.040]  Bush did it as well operation where they've got state reps on TV saying we
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.640]  want troops on the streets to stop the guns and the drugs the guns the
[03:23.640 --> 03:27.640]  government ships in and the drugs the government ships in here are the
[03:27.640 --> 03:31.880]  articles by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones Louisiana state officials calls
[03:31.880 --> 03:35.080]  for troops on the streets National Guard engage in door-to-door gun
[03:35.080 --> 03:41.320]  confiscation during Hurricane Katrina that was a beta test and here is Kurt
[03:41.320 --> 03:46.040]  Nemo's excellent article top story at info wars comm as well martial law
[03:46.040 --> 03:53.480]  attempt in Louisiana echoes wrong Paul's warning do I need to tell you to get
[03:53.480 --> 03:56.440]  these articles and get them out on Facebook Twitter
[03:56.440 --> 04:01.280]  YouTube's got social network systems as well do I need to tell you to do that
[04:01.280 --> 04:08.480]  this is an absolute red alert because in Iowa in Indiana in California in
[04:08.480 --> 04:16.960]  Florida in Michigan in Illinois in Boston in Dallas Texas different cities
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.920]  statewide you name it they're having knock-and-talk where they come now with
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.000]  the army with the police this is in the news we'd like to talk about your firearms
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.080]  today ma'am mind if we come in and then they basically force their way in in
[04:30.080 --> 04:33.760]  Boston they admit they just forced their way in no warrants and they are
[04:33.760 --> 04:38.720]  really getting the police drilled and ready to commit these crimes under peer
[04:38.720 --> 04:44.960]  pressure and so it's on I've got the audio in the video from seeing in coming
[04:44.960 --> 04:48.960]  up on the other side of this break where they're like absolutely let's put
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.360]  troops on the streets and let's get those guns that's how you fight crime the
[04:53.360 --> 04:58.040]  war on drugs is not gonna be the war on your guns and the same people ship both
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.800]  in to the criminals
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.280]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[05:10.280 --> 05:14.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home after
[05:14.520 --> 05:19.440]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[05:19.440 --> 05:24.560]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.560]  attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.760]  criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[08:15.160 --> 08:21.840]  my friends this is incredibly important information unfortunately day by day
[08:21.840 --> 08:28.960]  week by week month by month year by year our worst concerns are proven right
[08:28.960 --> 08:34.840]  and our analysis is just absolutely devastatingly on because we're following
[08:34.840 --> 08:39.640]  globalist documents planning drills we reversed engineered the parts that
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.360]  aren't declassified and have just been absolutely spot-on if I have to say we
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.280]  been 99% correct on the big picture it's because the 1% is that it's just
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.920]  always worse than we thought it's always worse than we thought it the
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.600]  criminality that we have in the government and the mega corporations
[09:00.600 --> 09:08.000]  that control it is unparalleled in history now you know that there are
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  literally hundreds of newspapers and TV stations right now including CBS news
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.480]  Bloomberg Associated Press I can't even track it all and I got up at 5 a.m. this
[09:20.480 --> 09:24.560]  morning I only spent about 30 minutes on that and there were hundreds of them
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.360]  saying Ron Paul is nuts he believes there's a plan to put military on the
[09:29.360 --> 09:36.000]  streets he is insane this is and of course Alex Jones is just as evil I'm in
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.080]  the articles as well and they have links to where he said it on my show this is
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.440]  when we have endless congressional clips and more we found on c-span that are
[09:45.440 --> 09:51.480]  up at info wars.com right now with the entire Congress basically going yes
[09:51.480 --> 09:57.680]  Obama can now kill any US citizens he wants torture them arrest anybody well
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.480]  let me tell you something just because you claim you have dictatorial powers just
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.920]  because some teleprompter Rear and the criminals that put him in office and
[10:05.920 --> 10:13.000]  bankrolled him say that doesn't mean it's so and of course these powers will be
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.200]  passed on to the next person I don't even think they plan on making Obama a
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.920]  dictator it's the office of the presidency that the bureaucracy and the
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.840]  special interest puppeteer that's who is going to use this power and they might
[10:25.840 --> 10:28.400]  use it next month they might use it two years from now I'm not saying they
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.240]  couldn't pull something like that stage a bunch of domestic terror attacks start
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.320]  arresting opposition shut down the internet I mean they've said they're
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.080]  going to do all of this you know it's not cookie anymore when you talk about
[10:41.080 --> 10:45.560]  internet censorship it's all over the internet the head of the FCC's warning
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.720]  about it right now Google's come out and said it's true and the Pentagon says we
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.760]  don't care we'll shut down what we want I mean it's even creeping out some of the
[10:54.760 --> 10:58.480]  powerful elites that are out there because this is getting down to the
[10:58.480 --> 11:06.920]  wire and I want to say something I have seen again literally scanning over them
[11:06.920 --> 11:14.440]  50 or more articles that I had time to look at from red state and CBS you name
[11:14.440 --> 11:23.200]  it attacking Ron Paul and almost every comment is for Ron Paul it is not just
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.840]  some highly vocal minority that swarms every article it is people on red state
[11:28.840 --> 11:35.920]  to say hey I'm not even a Ron Paul supporter but stop lying about him and
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.960]  so since they pulled out the stops two days ago it started the racist smear
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.480]  like they did on Rand and all the rest of it his numbers have gone up even more
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.080]  in Iowa and New Hampshire so it's definitely backfiring right now which
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.040]  shows you I've watched this process for 17 years on air 19 years awake tracking
[11:58.040 --> 12:06.880]  media intensely every day I've never seen the awakening this turbo charged and
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.120]  I could tell you we are I can feel the establishment I can see it in their
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.320]  actions their memos that are public because they're so arrogant still about
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.800]  how great a new Oklahoma City would be to blame on domestic groups financial
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.520]  times of London Democratic Party press releases I mean they don't even veil
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.120]  them even Glenn Beck said a year ago they're getting ready to stage new
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.000]  Oklahoma cities pointing at Democrats on the screen and blaming on
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.280]  conservatives you bet they are I mean they don't even hide it they think we're
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.120]  so dumb they think you're so dumb even though they're a little awake and a
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.640]  little concerned about the awakening they still can't help their old arrogant
[12:45.640 --> 12:51.400]  instincts and so last night we re-showed those memos and documents and clips of
[12:51.400 --> 12:54.840]  Glenn Beck admitting that the government's preparing to stage terror
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.520]  attacks look if you don't come to grips with the fact that criminals have
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.640]  hijacked the federal government and call their bluff and realize that they're
[13:04.640 --> 13:08.600]  staging a terror attacks and they're financing the Muslim terrorist in every
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.960]  major case and protecting them and that they're setting up domestic groups if
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.200]  you don't come to grips with the facts they're going to use this tool to gut
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.720]  this country and that means devalue your dollar and take your pension funds just
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.240]  as sure as the sun rose this morning and just as sure as it's going to set this
[13:28.240 --> 13:34.360]  evening it is going to happen they are following a recipe a blueprint a program a
[13:34.360 --> 13:40.920]  plan a operational manual that they've done in countless countries the Army's
[13:40.920 --> 13:46.080]  false flag manual was leaked by WikiLeaks four years ago the Army did not deny
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.280]  that that was theirs they said we're gonna find out who released this and we're
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.000]  gonna prosecute them okay I've had a lot of family in the Army folks who were
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.520]  officers and let me tell you what they will say will blow you away and they
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.800]  and they're saying it's a lot worse than that okay stop being naive little
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.600]  kids okay America's the big global empire not the American people they're
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.000]  there they're in a narcoleptic state you know walking through life literally in a
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.480]  dream state America look America has has murdered 51 million of its babies and
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.720]  just says all they're not humans so don't tell me evil can't happen it is
[14:28.720 --> 14:33.360]  happening we had a government 60 years ago shooting black men up with syphilis
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.560]  and watching them die over 45 years we have a government that sterilized half
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.640]  a million women in this country on record because they had below a B plus
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.240]  average under eugenics we have a government that five years ago was
[14:47.240 --> 14:51.160]  admitted in the New York Daily News until the story got shut down because CPS
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.640]  workers wouldn't be that evil and they said we grab little black kids and we
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.400]  take them who are totally healthy we give them a big pharma here are the
[14:58.400 --> 15:04.560]  facilities and a month later they're dead they're dead in some of the studies
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.760]  they give them pesticides and strap them down and kill them in the course of a
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.760]  month I mean ladies and gentlemen you sign on to this government you might as
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.560]  well get on your knees and say Satan I love you and I want to go to hell and I
[15:19.560 --> 15:23.720]  know you were only people don't believe in the devil whatever you're gonna
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.600]  manifest hell on earth I mean really let's grow up here okay you know what
[15:27.600 --> 15:33.240]  I'm not even getting to my top story yet I should it's just it's all coming true
[15:33.240 --> 15:39.080]  I told you New Orleans was a beta test then we saw Governor Blagojevich one
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.600]  month before he got indicted and I've got a call Paul and Curt Kertzer in the
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.120]  office I got a call Paul have mad this because that just backs it up more I
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.600]  just looking at these articles just remembered the Marine Corps checkpoints
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.280]  in California the gun confiscation drills in Iowa gotta give them full
[15:53.280 --> 15:56.400]  spectrum analysis or folks are gonna be in denial we gotta show them more more
[15:56.400 --> 16:01.040]  points it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a standard system graduated such
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.960]  successive approximation incremental buildup inchworm attack profile and he
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.480]  said because of the crime in Chicago we're gonna do door-to-door gun
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.840]  confiscation with the National Guard and regular Army and you know what they've
[16:11.840 --> 16:15.160]  done some of those tests but they'll have the army standing around outside
[16:15.160 --> 16:19.880]  while the police do it which is still illegal you saw the gun confiscation
[16:19.880 --> 16:24.240]  door-to-door in New Orleans and the media for six months after said it isn't
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.480]  true till the videos of it got released even when we had ABC News reporting it
[16:29.480 --> 16:35.040]  people said that's not true until it all came out people were in denial they
[16:35.040 --> 16:38.920]  went all over the state not just New Orleans they were confiscating guns in
[16:38.920 --> 16:45.680]  towns in Mississippi they were taking guns in red stick in baton Rouge they're

[19:11.080 --> 19:17.920]  the dark side 100% willing to do anything and the only way to defeat an
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.960]  enemy like that is to man up and admit to yourself who they are and to say I'm
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.720]  committed against you and that's the end of it no matter what happens and you
[19:28.720 --> 19:32.640]  know what they take us out individually folks we grow a hundred more heads and

[24:57.160 --> 25:04.480]  military is awake 70 plus percent of the donations to Ron Paul period of all the
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.280]  other presidential candidates but they've got specialized mercenaries
[25:09.280 --> 25:13.640]  specialized that they've questionnaire they've got I would say they probably got
[25:13.640 --> 25:17.400]  10 brigades from my sources and studying what they've announced and what I've
[25:17.400 --> 25:25.640]  seen they've got about 10 brigades how many what's 10 times 4,000 I mean they've
[25:25.640 --> 25:35.840]  got they've got 40,000 troops that will eat their guts and ask for seconds and
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.760]  shoot American citizens all day long and then they've got all these public deals
[25:40.760 --> 25:44.080]  that are in Toronto Star Washington Post and I'm over the years I'm like look at
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.840]  this they say they'll use foreign troops in America during civil emergencies and
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.760]  then you see NLE09 from FEMA saying it two years ago two and a half years ago
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.760]  and then you see at the Olympics Mexican and US troops in Canada Boston
[25:58.760 --> 26:02.840]  Canadians around I mean we're in the North American Union and they tell
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.200]  Europeans in Germany and France you will pay any taxes we say we're gonna send
[26:07.200 --> 26:13.880]  EU police paramilitary police and to collect it it's just like when our
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.640]  government's been used for over a hundred years to invade Latin American
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.320]  countries that don't you know pay fake loan sharking debts to private banks
[26:21.320 --> 26:24.840]  Spendley Butler Marine Corps two-time congressional medal honor winner
[26:24.840 --> 26:31.440]  exposed all that I mean our government is illegitimate it runs the drugs it
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.440]  runs it all and I've just got stacks of news coming in mainstream news about
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.240]  tanks microwave guns sound cannons I didn't even cover this last week we
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.080]  covered on the nightly news they're coming out Raytheon and local police
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.160]  departments are getting them with a riot shield that has a system that
[26:50.160 --> 26:57.840]  transmits a wavelength where you can't breathe and chokes you and you know
[26:57.840 --> 27:04.760]  nosebleeds all of it if they're calling it a Darth Vader choke shield Darth
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.360]  Vader you know chokes people with his mind the police come up to you and of
[27:08.360 --> 27:10.520]  course you know they're gonna want to use it and pull the trigger it's like
[27:10.520 --> 27:13.440]  you know people they've killed rubber bullets right up close and they just
[27:13.440 --> 27:17.840]  choke you and again they call it less lethal than they kill us with the weapons
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.760]  the tasers the rest of it and then it's just a training aid and everybody used
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.040]  to sing the public shot with rubber bullets and the rest of it then it's
[27:26.040 --> 27:30.200]  real bullets of course this won't go quite like China other places if one
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.320]  percent of the population fights back that has guns that's 1.5 million I would
[27:35.320 --> 27:40.840]  not want to be one of the bully boys if this kicks off and believe me I don't
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.860]  want it to kick off we're not gonna be on air the total collapse is a
[27:45.860 --> 27:51.200]  certainty if that happens our whole world is a disaster zone and you know
[27:51.200 --> 27:57.720]  where they're coming first they'll whack Ron Paul so fast it'll make your head
[27:57.720 --> 28:04.160]  spin playing crash heart attack they'll pull me over I mean they had the Houston

[28:30.160 --> 28:35.220]  control the most evil of the evil survival of the most wicked and they're
[28:35.220 --> 28:39.120]  now in control and they they hope their propaganda would work on people but
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.080]  because a lot of us knew the truth we got the jump on them and because they
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.600]  were arrogant we got the jump on them but now they know and they are gonna
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.520]  want to launch this and they're gonna try to sell it I'm gonna come back and

[34:47.120 --> 34:54.480]  Jones talking about troops on the streets and gun confiscation and then
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.880]  meanwhile meanwhile they're drilling all over the country to carry this out and
[35:00.880 --> 35:04.920]  the articles are up at info wars calm Louisiana state officials call for
[35:04.920 --> 35:08.880]  troops on the streets National Guard engaged in door-to-door gun confiscation
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.760]  during hurricane Katrina don't forget that and the other article by Curtin M.
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.040]  Marshall a temp in Louisiana echoes Ron Paul's warning you want to you want to
[35:18.040 --> 35:24.480]  get these articles and send them to the paid hacks at Bloomberg and CBS and Red
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.280]  State and the rest of them and say how are you gonna feel as the depression
[35:28.280 --> 35:33.440]  intensifies how are you gonna like it when they end up first registering and
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.360]  then fully confiscating guns how are you going to like being occupied how do
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.120]  you like the TSA checkpoints already being set up on highways how do you
[35:42.120 --> 35:45.480]  like what America's turned into how do you lie I mean I remember 10 years ago
[35:45.480 --> 35:48.280]  talking about face-cannon cameras and license plate readers and being laughed
[35:48.280 --> 35:53.320]  at as they were putting them in now they're giving tanks armored vehicles
[35:53.320 --> 35:58.640]  microwave guns sound cannons and telling local police prepare for war with
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.480]  the American people I had Ardee Savetta in here the awesome police chief who I
[36:03.480 --> 36:07.800]  think at the end of the day is a good person but it's so in in the system that
[36:07.800 --> 36:11.840]  he's he's slowly awakening I don't want to get him in trouble but he said a few
[36:11.840 --> 36:16.520]  things off record that you know show me that that he he's basically I'm not
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.680]  gonna even get get into it and of course you know when I get people like him in
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.640]  studio I shouldn't immediately try to get him you know to break and stop going
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.640]  on their script because that just makes them go more into the turtle shell when
[36:29.640 --> 36:33.320]  I start you know going at him a hundred miles an hour right out of the gates but
[36:33.320 --> 36:36.200]  I said what are you gonna do when they want to put military on the streets and
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.680]  he said the sky would literally have to be falling to have military on the
[36:40.680 --> 36:46.720]  streets really are all over the country the National Guard and old bases are
[36:46.720 --> 36:50.320]  providing FEMA says we'll give you this money County or city but you got to move
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.480]  in with the military in this base they're using the military to quote
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.000]  surveil pot growers and now it's extremist or now it's families that are
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.560]  right wing on their farm and predator drones that's how they always sell it
[37:04.560 --> 37:13.640]  it's here art and just because people like you aren't consciously evil just
[37:13.640 --> 37:20.360]  because you haven't been to the urban warfare drills doesn't mean that we're
[37:20.360 --> 37:25.920]  not going down this road and I saw it with the governor of Illinois pushing
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.760]  troops on the streets I've seen others calling for it and the idea is locals
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.720]  the states the counties the cities no our federal eyes is now federalized
[37:35.720 --> 37:40.960]  another thing that's unconstitutional National Guard it has to patrol the
[37:40.960 --> 37:47.920]  streets and the state rep says that it made it made the people have good morale
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.200]  and and feel good yeah the feds jam communications of the police everything
[37:53.200 --> 37:56.760]  breaks down and then they send the military in not to give food and water
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.000]  for six days but to go into high and dry areas and loot and rob houses as
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.120]  happened on record police were caught robbing banks robbing Walmart's we
[38:07.120 --> 38:10.920]  first reported they were shooting people trying to walk out on the dry bridges
[38:10.920 --> 38:16.360]  imagine you're trying to walk out on the dry highways and the feds ordered the
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.440]  police to shoot citizens and then the feds indicted the local cops who followed
[38:21.440 --> 38:25.640]  orders remember at the time we had eyewitnesses saying other shooting
[38:25.640 --> 38:29.160]  people families that try to get out there's dead bodies everywhere they're
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.560]  hiding the dead bodies they're claiming they died from water and the local
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.360]  police got on TV one of them was the parish sheriff and cried and said the
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.800]  feds told us not to go in and rescue anybody so the first day I called my
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.280]  mama her phone was still cell phone was still working battery mama I'm coming
[38:46.280 --> 38:49.120]  to get you out of the nursing home the second day the third day the fourth day

[39:11.080 --> 39:14.880]  cocaine in that's all in the federal documents nobody gets in trouble I mean a
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.660]  bunch of crooks and suits everybody's so scared of them and their black
[39:18.660 --> 39:23.720]  suburban's and flashing lights their dirt their murderers their dirtbag rats
[39:23.720 --> 39:29.440]  their scum their Hitler's Hitler had an office Hitler had uniforms he's supposed
[39:29.440 --> 39:39.400]  to bow down and kiss his boots kiss his wart covered derriere huh no no Stalin
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.120]  had military all around him and uniforms and the rest of it every other
[39:44.120 --> 39:47.840]  country in history has gone this route do we really want to go here folks we're
[39:47.840 --> 39:54.720]  now there's no room for denial anymore we're right up to it now a big criminal
[39:54.720 --> 40:01.520]  group who has committed to implode the country who's stolen over 600 times the
[40:01.520 --> 40:08.040]  debts that this country actually owes well 655 trillion they claim we owe
[40:08.040 --> 40:10.960]  that internationally it's 1.5 quadrillion so it's a hundred times or so
[40:10.960 --> 40:17.960]  what supposedly we even owe the 14.5 trillion 14.5 trillion I mean it's all
[40:17.960 --> 40:23.440]  a giant stinking fraud and they put these people up on TV to sell the public
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.720]  the answer is the military that's called martial law they're saying put New
[40:28.720 --> 40:35.320]  Orleans under martial law and they're preparing Chicago and Detroit what do you
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.600]  think daytime curfews are in some areas of Arkansas there are areas of Arkansas
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.480]  I can play the CNN clips of those just type in Arkansas towns under martial law
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.920]  and it shows the cops going in the town of 40,000 the citizens feel much safer
[40:48.920 --> 40:51.600]  because of the crime and it shows checkpoints they're like oh where are
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.360]  you going let me see your ID all right you're allowed to drive through to leave
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.800]  their houses at the end of the block and again this is sold as if it's safe
[41:01.800 --> 41:06.240]  meanwhile the government lets 30 million illegals and be felons and then
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.720]  millions of those engage any crime they want have any aliases they want the
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.400]  government loves the crime the government sociologist and anthropologist and
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.600]  and psychologists know that the prisons are colleges for crime they know the
[41:19.600 --> 41:23.000]  more prisons they build the more crime we're gonna have they know the more
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  people are gonna go in there for petty crimes and come out with master's
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.800]  degrees PhDs and crime they know that there's been globalist manuals that
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.960]  came out 50 plus years ago on that what was it it was like a Chicago police
[41:37.960 --> 41:41.200]  chief something like 20-something years ago got caught and recorded going yeah
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.440]  they don't know we love the crime yeah this is what they do and you notice it
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.760]  Chicago it's New Orleans it's all these big welfare state corrupt dependent
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.880]  cancer zones cancer zones where you've got dependent people just just just
[41:57.880 --> 42:04.160]  abscess program by Jerry Springer and gangster music and the whole culture and

[42:26.680 --> 42:30.800]  you should do whatever you've got to to get out to go live in the country to get
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.080]  extra jobs to do what it takes man I look at these women these poor women I
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.080]  feel sorry for them and they look like they weigh about 600 pounds and they're
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.880]  in and they're in there in this government programming zone and they're
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.560]  talking about oh my gosh the crime you know they should be talking about why
[42:47.560 --> 42:54.120]  is the government ship the drugs in here to destabilize this area and and why
[42:54.120 --> 42:57.440]  have we bought into the big government welfare society that's destroyed our
[42:57.440 --> 43:03.640]  culture completely instead they get up there and say I'm an official and not a
[43:03.640 --> 43:09.600]  servant and other officials we all want to have the military on the streets so I
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.240]  want everybody I want everybody to get these articles and get them out to
[43:14.240 --> 43:21.720]  everyone you know martial law attempt in Louisiana echoes Ron Paul's warning and
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.160]  the other article Louisiana State officials call for troops on the
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.200]  streets and I told you they're not gonna just say we're arresting political
[43:30.200 --> 43:33.040]  dissidents and we're taking over society because we're an evil government
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.120]  they're gonna bring us into incremental depression with upwards of 50 million
[43:37.120 --> 43:41.960]  people on food stamps as those food stamps even though you're still issued
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.120]  them won't buy as much food as they did before as people don't have money to buy
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.320]  their crack cocaine anymore as all of this happens there's gonna be more and
[43:50.320 --> 43:54.720]  more crime more and more riots more and more problems and the military the
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.240]  police in every case are ordered to stand down and if they don't stand down
[43:58.240 --> 44:01.400]  they'll jam their communications like FEMA did in New Orleans they'll come in
[44:01.400 --> 44:06.760]  the police guard the tower and they'll chop it down that CBS news and then when
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.680]  the police stand down the criminal police run off start robbing pawn shops and
[44:10.680 --> 44:16.800]  banks and Walmart's on record of their playstations and jewels and the good
[44:16.800 --> 44:20.120]  cops don't know what to do because there's no command and control they're
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.720]  gonna send in the military and then after they set the precedent to do that
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.160]  they're gonna stage domestic terror attacks it'll be completely sappy you
[44:30.160 --> 44:33.400]  know how the how the how the right-wingers killed the babies it's
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.600]  always the same and the military was trying to get food to the children when
[44:37.600 --> 44:43.120]  the militia bushwhacked them and now the military didn't want to do it they're
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.960]  gonna take the guns and go after the American people and most the good old
[44:46.960 --> 44:50.360]  boys are gonna cry and come out to the front of their house and turn their guns
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.480]  in and salute the military the military will say you're on the list they're like
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.120]  I understand I'll get the back of the truck I'll prove I'm good I didn't blow
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.480]  up the babies and they'll go home good job and then they'll take them off a
[45:00.480 --> 45:03.280]  little FEMA camp and you know the military that takes you to the camp
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.400]  they really believe they're doing a good job and then special officers come in
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.960]  interview you all right put him on the plane and then they take you and they
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.400]  got those foreign mercs and it's like we're gonna have you come out and say

[45:28.640 --> 45:32.360]  go ahead and start getting to this I'm telling you what's gonna happen I told
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.400]  you so far I know how tyrants operate I've made it my business to study them
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.840]  and I've made my business to meet them head on and stop them and you could stop
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.880]  them we know their plans we can stop them and expose them remember everything
[45:46.880 --> 45:50.400]  you hear this guy talk about the government the just department eight
[45:50.400 --> 45:56.600]  federal agencies ATF FBI all of them border patrol shipping drugs in and guns
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.960]  out remember everything he's talking about is the government now let's go
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.040]  ahead the welfare state all of it the government martial law attempted in
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.120]  Louisiana that's the headline info wars calm they're trying it right now it's
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.240]  more than just this state rep it's a whole coalition they got the public
[46:15.240 --> 46:21.560]  begging for it begging for tyranny by the time they're done they'll have what
[46:21.560 --> 46:25.800]  they always wanted military directly delivering the cocaine and heroin from
[46:25.800 --> 46:31.120]  Latin America and Asia directly to them that'll really boost profits let's go
[46:31.120 --> 46:36.680]  ahead and play the clip a Louisiana state official says crime in New Orleans is
[46:36.680 --> 46:40.800]  out of control so much so that he is now asking that the National Guard be brought
[46:40.800 --> 46:44.280]  in to patrol the city streets this was all sparked by the recent death of a
[46:44.280 --> 46:48.840]  toddler so here's the background just this past weekend Kira Holmes was gun
[46:48.840 --> 46:53.160]  down while playing outside of her home for a toddler how the vigil with
[46:53.160 --> 46:56.480]  candles and birthday balloons in the same courtyard where she was killed she
[46:56.480 --> 47:00.360]  was to be turning to right around Christmas and emotions ran high as
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.400]  family members spoke of the little girl who who never got to see her second
[47:04.400 --> 47:18.800]  birthday I have toys under my Christmas tree I have stockings in my house I
[47:18.800 --> 47:23.720]  didn't even want to have a Christmas this year because I felt like this now my
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.080]  baby gone have a conscious and do what they have to do and turn itself because
[47:29.080 --> 47:36.360]  that's my grampy or lady lady just turn itself in do this for me doing for a
[47:36.360 --> 47:42.960]  grandma they have a car to use this poor woman's pain the shell tearing I want
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.080]  to bring in Louisiana State Representative Austin Badal joins me live
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.480]  from New Orleans he's one of the officials who wants to bring the National
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.920]  Guard just as they did after Hurricane Katrina Mr. Badal thank you for coming
[47:53.920 --> 47:59.040]  on I've read that you said your city's at war you'd need the National Guard why
[47:59.040 --> 48:04.720]  can't local police do the job well you know we've done a lot after the storms
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.080]  of 2005 but this is on in it's just totally intolerable and it's
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.920]  unacceptable behavior in our city the local police need help stop right there
[48:13.920 --> 48:18.240]  do a lot of the military admittedly is filling up with the very gangs that are
[48:18.240 --> 48:23.160]  there our government won't stop the MS-13 the Mexican mafia any of it the
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.720]  government sells most these groups the drugs on record gives them the guns to
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.080]  knock out rival groups that don't wander money properly and take orders
[48:31.080 --> 48:37.600]  properly again and and now the gut the state and city government can't do it
[48:37.600 --> 48:43.120]  now we need the National Guard this is how it happens society collapses by
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.880]  design and the people that engineered the collapse are there to save us with
[48:47.880 --> 48:53.360]  a bigger nanny state this is what martial law is called the National Guards
[48:53.360 --> 48:58.640]  called into your town at checkpoints that's called martial law but hundreds
[48:58.640 --> 49:03.040]  of newspapers are making fun of Ron Paul let's go and play that clip different
[49:03.040 --> 49:06.560]  things that are building our city we're rebuilding our infrastructure we're
[49:06.560 --> 49:11.400]  building our schools back we're building our economic base but we have a select
[49:11.400 --> 49:15.600]  few people who are going out there and committing heinous crimes in broad daylight
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.560]  killing people killing babies it's intolerable we must do something about
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.160]  it so what I have done is I have called upon the governor to bring in the
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.000]  National Guard after the storms of 2005 people are a lot more comfortable by
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.920]  seeing the National Guard on the streets of New Orleans oh yeah the morale
[49:32.920 --> 49:38.160]  higher we are doing a lot of good it boosts the morale everything's military
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.640]  now like some third-world country it boosts the morale oh yeah to have the
[49:42.640 --> 49:45.920]  National Guard going door-to-door taking guns with big army and the FBI
[49:45.920 --> 49:52.200]  commanding them oh that was wonderful let's go back to the clip things the
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.120]  people here in New Orleans are very resilient they're rebuilding and they
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.440]  have a real great passion for our city but we cannot allow certain individuals
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.440]  to carry guns and to go out and to shoot people on a daily basis in this city so
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.640]  I've brought I've asked for the National Guard to come in and create order to

[54:16.440 --> 54:21.840]  52% chance of winning Iowa with their big scientific breakdown and that Romney's
[54:21.840 --> 54:26.240]  at 20 something in a distant second and that's what other polls I have show is
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.160]  that Ron Paul is turbo charging ahead showing the American people are waking
[54:31.160 --> 54:34.520]  up and the media is like but he's worried about troops on the street you
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.800]  open up the paper armored vehicle sound cannons microwaves given a local police
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.080]  army standing by in every city government wants checkpoints TSA running
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.560]  checkpoints with army in Tennessee families jerked out of vehicles yeah
[54:48.560 --> 54:55.360]  that Ron Paul he's really nuts every day this stuff comes out and the military
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.360]  the police everybody's got to decide what side you're on I mean the globalist
[55:00.360 --> 55:06.200]  are gonna hurt 99.9% of us even if you're immoral and evil it doesn't give
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.160]  you a good deal to go along with this but I understand those of you that are
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.040]  evil you can't help it you're like a moth to flame you like to side with
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.600]  darkness a lot of it because you're cowards others because it's it just it
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.680]  gives you a thrill well you're gonna get more than a thrill if this all goes
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.760]  through because the globalists when they take down America are going all the
[55:26.760 --> 55:32.280]  way a Soviet style red terror operation roundups arrest I mean they've been
[55:32.280 --> 55:39.520]  training for it total reeducation total breaking this country's back and again
[55:39.520 --> 55:42.440]  there's going to be people like well we'll have a big war with the police
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.880]  and military the globalists love that they'll let that in the first waves chew
[55:46.880 --> 55:54.800]  up the military and police and bring in the foreign mercs on record so you
[55:54.800 --> 55:58.000]  idiots they're gonna have war with the American people you are literally
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.720]  sticking your hand down a badger hole and I don't have any thrill of who there
[56:03.720 --> 56:09.560]  might be a conflict and a 1776 physically only anyone who studied
[56:09.560 --> 56:13.800]  history would never want that but you can't go to FEMA camps you can't become
[56:13.800 --> 56:19.280]  a total slave and it's just escalating more and more into that area but we've
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.600]  got whoever fires first loses so we don't want to go there now a lot of
[56:24.600 --> 56:28.160]  times in history with the tyranny people wake up and it gets reversed and it
[56:28.160 --> 56:33.680]  could happen now if these globalists are not as coordinated as they'd like to be
[56:33.680 --> 56:37.880]  they're outrageously criminal fast and furious came out proving they stage
[56:37.880 --> 56:43.120]  false flags a lot of stuff has come out a false flags a frame up folks they

[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.720]  time it's a wonderful time to be alive it was the best of times the worst of
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:41.960]  times great literary mind once opined Ron Paul CNN admits has a 52% chance of
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.240]  winning Iowa versus Mitt Romney at 20 some percent we're gonna play that clip
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:54.080]  coming up in other polls he's as high as 35 to 27 percent of the vote in the
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.200]  eight-way race there in Iowa are now seven seven-way race so extremely
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.560]  powerful information and the system is pulling out all the stops to demonize
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.760]  Ron Paul in fact I saw one headline was it CBS News he went on a guy's show that
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.440]  said the government puts things in the food to make you gay Alex Jones that's
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.280]  like one of their favorite talking points in a think tank but George Soros
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.200]  his group two years ago picked up on and went wild with and I really want to
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.800]  thank him for all the publicity they probably had over a hundred fake
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:33.680]  liberaloid blogs attacked me and some mainstream news for it and of course all
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:40.760]  I was doing was reading BBC and Reuters about bisexual fish and frogs because of
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:46.400]  all the chemical runoff in the water and the gender bending and males with
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.520]  the estrogen mimicers of a bisphenol and other things and then I pulled up some
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.880]  university reports from the 60s where they proposed putting the chemicals in
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.600]  the food chain so that people wouldn't have children and then it also increases
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.000]  women's breast cancer that was the second part of my report we have the
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.120]  highest in the world you're up after us because bisphenol a mixed girls going to
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.080]  puberty earlier produces a lot more of the toxins that precipitate out in the
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.680]  breast and bioaccumulate and cause breast cancer I was trying to warn women
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.520]  out there about bisphenol a that's in most printer ink and that's in the
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.320]  receipts you print and I had all the articles but the system you know wants
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:28.760]  to make it how I'm bashing gay people see it's like that Ron Paul why of tens
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.360]  of thousands of newsletters 14 published at one time alone with a lot of
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.560]  guest writers there was a few things in there saying Martin Luther King was a
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.680]  communist and that you know that stuff like that oh it's just horrible he
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.880]  hated black people that's why the actual articles he wrote in like 1988 was as a
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.120]  medical doctor was about HIV being a race-specific bio weapon to kill black
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.920]  people just you know he hates black people so much he wants to warn them so
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.760]  that's the type of stuff that we're dealing with here but if you just joined
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.760]  us the top stories are in infowars.com and prisonplanet.com we'll put those
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.040]  back on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers radio listeners go there now and
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.600]  again I'm gonna have Kurt and Paul also add some other news here because you
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.600]  if you don't see it all then it doesn't give you the big picture obviously we
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.120]  have Marine Corps checkpoints Army checkpoints TSA checkpoints all over the
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:29.000]  country from California to Tennessee from Florida to Maine we've got door to
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.560]  door knocking talks about taking guns and we've got the Illinois governor
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.960]  calling for the military on the streets again this is all in areas where they
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.640]  have massive gun enforcement the public has basically been disarmed the cities
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.120]  where a lot of this is happening have incredible attacks on the second
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:54.120]  amendment all of that is happening so if you go to info wars.com martial law
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.040]  attempt in Louisiana echoes Ron Paul's warning Louisiana state officials
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.000]  call for troops on the streets and I was just playing the state rapper there's a
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.640]  bunch of them a coalition calling for them to boost morale and patrol the
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:15.240]  streets and wage war on the citizenry basically on the criminals that he said
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.640]  the people that are shipping drugs in and guns they're they're people shipping
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.400]  guns in you mean like Eric Holder
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.440]  think of this as society collapses they're saying only the army can restore
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.360]  order only federal troops and the National Guard was federalized years
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.800]  ago by the way do you need me to play the clips again I'm gonna do it tonight on
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.240]  the nightly news but I might do it later but we can dig them back up all the
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.360]  guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed remember that quote by
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.960]  the New Orleans police chief as a puppet for the FEMA or ABC News the
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.200]  military the regular army goes house to house bang bang bang door to door
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.400]  confiscating weapons and it shows citizens in handcuffs in rich areas even
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.720]  the point is there was nothing going on there having their guns taken their
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.440]  gun safes busted open being ordered at gunpoint by the military this is on the
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.200]  news to open their guns safe so the military could take them and give them
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.080]  to the ATF in the backs of big flatback trucks and in other areas of the state
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.200]  they would pull up at small towns and come up knock on the door and say give
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.720]  us your guns people are like what and they would do it because it's so shocking
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.480]  what we're fine we're sure it was flooded but we got food we're you know
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.080]  country boy can survive give us the guns and the NRA made a documentary about
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:42.520]  it they will come during any emergency and take your guns and set that present
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.520]  say because we're in a war against crime let's go ahead and go to the rest of the
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.440]  clip here it is for statistics to justify this level of emergency yes
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:14:00.000]  we are at urban warfare right now you have people who have drug crimes drug
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  warrants who are out on you know warrants that they should be in jail you
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.040]  have people who are proliferating the streets with firearms and the problem
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.480]  is just permeating throughout our society so what we have to do is we have
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.160]  to get in there with social services you know this is a short-term effect on a
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.720]  long-term problem we have to rebuild our schools and have better schools and good
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.560]  schools but what's going on is certain people are going out and they're
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.320]  creating a problem within our society and they're there just it's a negative
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.680]  environment upon every of the positive things who is creating the problem in
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.840]  our society who made these drugs illegal cocaine heroin you could buy at any drug
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.280]  store until the 1930s over-the-counter kids drank Coca-Cola with cocaine in it
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.720]  small amount I'm not saying that's good why it's called coke I can spurious eat
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.840]  theory folks I know some people are new listeners and don't know anything but
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:00.320]  that's a fact Dr. Pepper all of it had cocaine in it but they had the pure
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.840]  stuff there and you look at the statistics maybe a third on average the
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.240]  drug users we have today and you know what it was dirt cheap people sure
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.680]  weren't robbing liquor stores to get their fix but they made it illegal the
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.600]  price goes up now people got a rob and it's a tax paid to the bankers who
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.320]  launder the drug money and who own the private prisons and we've got the
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.680]  biggest prison population in the world and it gets worse and worse and their
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.440]  answer as I always told you as society implodes they're gonna sell you on this
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.640]  idea as it's a war on crime it's a war on extremist and we got to go in and get
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.360]  the guns and they can do it over the rubric of crises and that's what they've
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.920]  done now and as we go into a deep depression instead of having 50 million
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.200]  people on food stamps it's going to be a hundred million and then that's not
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.680]  going to buy what they need and you're going to see crime explode and the
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.640]  government's answer is going to be you can't have a gun to protect yourself
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.280]  just like Chicago just like New York just like Los Angeles and every other
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:08.040]  globalist-run system and then you find out about the rural council run by the
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.120]  army the Pentagon with the army leading it via Northcom and FEMA but that's
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.520]  official with drones watching farmers and checkpoints harassing rural
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.240]  communities and setting up block captains every couple of miles that watch
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.120]  their neighbors I mean I've been sent the manuals the training videos where
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  they tell local farmers come to an anti-academic everybody shows up they
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.160]  go are your neighbors growing pot they're talking bad about the government
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.400]  are people selling vegetables without paying taxes and the farmers most of
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.440]  them will creep out of the meeting and the feds are writing that down okay he
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.120]  obviously didn't like it they have a little psychological you know behavioral
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.920]  assessment people okay mr. Johnson mr. Jones mr. Brown mr. Schmidt got upset
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:56.960]  from that okay okay out of 50 people that showed up 50 slaves seven of them
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.400]  stayed there who these are some real bootlickers come on up here I'm on up

[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.200]  learned about in Iowa Texas other states the clergy response teams going back
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.520]  now seven years ago we got the secret documents three years after that they
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.320]  were made public people couldn't believe us I had these documents with phone

[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.880]  Truth I don't get present point about TV but I assume your show with him and all
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.720]  yesterday which I didn't get to hear because it was on the TV internet would
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.640]  that be on a YouTube video for everybody absolutely sir we have a YouTube
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.920]  channel with 160 plus million views on that one channel it's called the Alex
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.320]  Jones channel and if you go to info wars.com any news article has some icons
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.480]  at the top and one of them is the symbol of YouTube and we post about 90% of the
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.000]  material up there on the YouTube site here's the kind of thing we usually won't
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.920]  post for documentary purposes just like PBS does we're gonna show police
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.120]  brutality tonight versus police brutality in Egypt that our media decries
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.800]  it's gonna have a bunch of profanity on it so that is not going to air and once
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.760]  for broadcast TV won't be able to air it either but that's not gonna be put
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.520]  probably on the YouTube channel just because you know it's more of a family
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.160]  YouTube channel but yes sir we haven't made a secret of it have you ever been
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  to info wars.com before Scott of course you just see everywhere everything on
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.680]  the day after is posted right there in articles every day I want to bring up
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.160]  general Ben part but first a quick mention of chemtrails if we're being
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.280]  sprayed with barium and aluminum the symbols for the chemical symbols for
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:44.960]  better BA and AL those bail maybe just coincidence but I notice there's no
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.520]  that we have pilots when I live on truth how can we don't have pilots for
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.200]  chemtrail truth I mean if there really is we're being sprayed everywhere well
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.600]  that's because it's me in the patents most of it the particular is mixed with
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.840]  the jet fuel and then and then disperse you can't even see it in the jet fuel
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.560]  it's the big companies that are involved so the pilots I mean they're just like
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.600]  a general public this this geoengineering started in the mid 90s we'd always known
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.400]  that now it's declassified and just like everything else is now pretty much in
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.320]  our face I appreciate your call again we're opening the phones up about the
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:27.000]  military I have announced you know and we played the clip that in all over the

[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.240]  and you know they're declaring that the people are the enemy Ron Paul myself and
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.960]  others have pointed out this is a declaration of war against the American
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.280]  people in the National Defense Authorization Act and now you heard the
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.880]  state rep saying there's a bunch of others in Louisiana we want troops back
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.080]  on the streets you know we want them to quote get the guns and we know how they

[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.760]  Marine Corps checkpoints on highways TSA setting up more checkpoints on the
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.160]  highways because they've passed letting the military be on the streets and
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.440]  secretly arresting citizens and I found new C-SPAN clips we've just got to
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.720]  excise it out of the full two-hour long program but it's on the C-SPAN website
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:59.760]  we have links to it at info wars.com and an article where they have people on
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.160]  C-SPAN admitting and the White House admitting that yes we can kill American
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.080]  citizens in America and we will it's not just secretly arrest you it's kill
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  you kill you the globalists that hijacked our nation have taken over most
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.720]  the world with our military and our money our defense budgets bigger than all
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:24.280]  their militaries combined it's like 54% of the entire world's defense budget the
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:30.600]  US our wealth that came from liberty was used to forge this great evil they've
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.840]  always got good propaganda for you that's what militaries have military
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.320]  propaganda for the officers propaganda for the troops the citizens all these
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.920]  movies where troops are in the USA all but always fighting aliens but then on
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.800]  TV shows it's fighting the militias but it's all to condition you to see troops
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.200]  in every city every movie it's all acclimation just like the government
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.840]  paid with the show SWAT team back in the 60s and 70s admittedly to condition
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.520]  people to see guys in black uniforms with military weapons now all the
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.080]  police are to be militarized it's all conditioning and a lot of slaves love
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.360]  their conditioning well I don't I don't want to be a slave and again why are
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.760]  they getting ready to trigger it now because they have a plan to implode
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:21.200]  the economy down to nothing one country said no Iceland they've rebounded they
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.000]  went in and pointed out most the money was owned by the banks not the
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.280]  citizens so why are you the debtor who who engaged in the fraud running our
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.720]  government and telling us that we're your slaves we're gonna arrest you and
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.120]  the bankers literally flew out on their private jets the government officials
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.760]  ran everywhere else though they come in and take over let's go to your phone
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:46.560]  calls John in South Carolina you're on the air hey how you doing pretty good
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:54.200]  sir what's your view on what we're talking about here well about the NDA I
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:02.640]  was at school and I'm in high school and a student that was in a class with me
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.240]  asked the teacher who if he vote for out of the candidate of course he says
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:13.280]  gingrich and I was like oh god here we go and that was when I told them what the
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:19.320]  NDA was and how he supported it and all the bailouts and all of it and the
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.600]  teachers like well maybe I'd be worried about it I was doing something wrong but
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:29.480]  I'm not I mean it's just complete disgust no that's it they just want to go
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.040]  home and watch dancing with stars take some pros act drink some liquor maybe
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.880]  get an abortion or something and you know watch TV and and and cheer when
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.240]  smart bombs blow up whole families and and they think well I groveled with the
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:46.560]  system I'm gonna be fine and people have thought that throughout history but
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:53.360]  remember cattle like that never are even in the equation okay the except for one
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.440]  thing they will vote to steal their brother's money that's why democracy is
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.960]  so dangerous we're not a pure democracy we're a representative republic because
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.480]  in a democracy two wolves and a sheep vote for what's for dinner well the two
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.320]  wolves are gonna out vote the sheep the sheep's gonna say I don't want to be
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.480]  eaten they're gonna go democracy you know wolf wolf and bark bark we say
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.520]  we're gonna eat you and that happens in a republic it says you can't break this
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.600]  rule of law okay within this parameter and so what did you say to her when she
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.760]  said well it would be a problem to have Americans secretly arrested and
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.360]  disappeared to a black hole if you have something to hide and that's the tide
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.120]  pool start saying I hurt my neighbor talk bad I mean literally in a lot of
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.200]  tyrannies they run up in gravel sir I heard mother them talking bad about you
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.080]  and then they watch their neighbor arrested and come out and say can I have
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.040]  some of their stuff and they actually feel morally good about it as your drug
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.640]  away but then later they're drug away just because the system wanted what they
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.080]  had they're like but I I let your boots I I grovel to you they're like shut up
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.360]  just Billy club them in the head in that nice so that little coward will get
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.520]  what they want as they conjure hell itself sorry John anything else
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:13.480]  well that's about it but I didn't really try to explain it to him because I knew
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.680]  I wouldn't get anywhere just he'll just accept it no matter what no you should
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.960]  you should print off my articles about it you should you should direct them to
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  Ron Paul talking about it and you should say so no one had to worry in Nazi
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.440]  Germany when they got rid of checks and balances are in Russia or in Cambodia you
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.400]  need to write a paper on the subject and you need to hand it out to everyone in
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.440]  the class and you need to talk to everyone and that's your right then
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.800]  she'll probably try to shut you down or he said he or she I mean he probably
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.040]  will and he's former military of course he'll do whatever he would probably line
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.480]  up I'm telling you these type of people will do anything people ask how German
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.200]  soldiers did what they did because they get off on it they think they're part of
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.440]  the winning team and they'll do whatever they're told so so he's like I like the
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:05.320]  India appreciate your call John John get in there warn them warn the people it's
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:08.400]  your responsibility and then and then when they try to kick you out of class
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:14.240]  call the local newspapers make an issue out of it like I meant to get to this two
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.880]  days ago there's so much we don't even get to because there's so much happening
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.520]  of the Catholic priest gets up their banning speech that criticizes the
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.960]  government in any way at the city council was at the San Jose Mercury news
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:32.760]  video of it and he gets up and politely speaks and says you know this you're
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.520]  arresting people are kicking him out of here let's say that you're you're
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:40.240]  arresting of homeless people is what happened in Nazi Germany that's how it
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.760]  started they started picking up the homeless people first which they did and
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.000]  so people have a right whether you agree with it or not even if it was true or
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.640]  not to talk about history and the mayor goes shut him down shut him down you're
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.680]  not to talk about Nazi Germany you know the old thing it's so liberal that's
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:01.200]  racist now to do it's not be like the Nazis the word Nazis now racist and the
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.600]  guys like no no no it's my right I have free speech my redress of grievances and
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.840]  the cops come over and get behind trying to intimidate him going we're gonna
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:13.880]  arrest you we're gonna arrest you and the and the mayor is all up there
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.360]  delusional folks I'm seeing this everywhere because the feds and others
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:26.760]  are there telling him this and we're in so much trouble folks and it turns out
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.120]  at that city council meeting they did arrest other people so you don't
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.760]  criticize them in any way or you're going to jail and the cops follow the
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:42.000]  order and look like they were getting off on it I mean we're in trouble don't
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.960]  you get it corrupt people get in power they hire people in uniforms to do
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:50.200]  whatever they say and they take over
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.720]  we've always known that you know communist countries in North Korea and
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.200]  corrupt countries like Mexico have troops on the streets but Mexico doesn't
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:06.440]  put it on paper that they can kill you they at least have a kangaroo court
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.280]  about it if the military shoots a protester now they're just saying we'll
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.640]  kill you we'll secretly arrest you we'll torture you
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.120]  Lieberman says I want Americans to be scared of us torturing them and they
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.120]  start laughing like demonic skexies or something from the dark crystal I mean
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:27.080]  it's super creepy these are super wicked people flaunting it who run the banking
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  cartel that's Rob this tyranny Buster in Illinois you're on the air
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.480]  greetings from the slave grid Alex how are you I'm not good it's all unfolding
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.600]  like we knew it would historically and it's it's quite frankly disgusting it's
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.960]  very sad absolutely disgusting I mean I live up here in Chicago we spoke and
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.360]  several times over the past six seven years here and I just you know I've
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.640]  already contact my I'm from a rural Missouri town at Oak Ridge Missouri it's
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:02.200]  important that we named that town but I've already informed my family that
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.520]  minute I see a troop on the street my family's out of here we're gone and
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.760]  there may we've arrangements have been made but to the people in Chicago I mean
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.320]  look and and to the rest of the country listening right now y'all need to start
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.520]  putting your guns behind your doors you need to stop stop opening these doors
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:23.160]  with these soldiers out front without that gun in your hand that this this
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.480]  letting these people in you're not in the military America you are not a you
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.040]  are not a member of the military you are a private citizen martial law be damned
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.320]  I will not recognize a blue helmet from the UN I will not recognize the rank of
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.200]  any soldier they'll probably make me the example I'll probably be the guy shot in
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:45.880]  the back of his head in front of everybody but I don't care rather than
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.480]  rather to die like that standing up to these people than to be these sick
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.280]  little sycophants that I have to hear and see on TV all day long these baby
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.680]  killers aren't my heroes they're not my this ain't a draft these people aren't
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.880]  in war for under threat of jail under threat of loss of their freedom this is
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:10.040]  a volunteer army who keeps going back they keep I don't want to hear about
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.680]  redeployment I don't I don't want to hear it they keep I'll tell you what
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.280]  tyranny buster I'm gonna stop you right there and come back to you governor
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.520]  Jesse Ventura I didn't know was in the news with and I'm just now getting the
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.040]  development Sharon is printing it off we have him now okay governor Ventura
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:50.760]  you're on the air with some breaking news good to have you here sir so now
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:45:02.560]  they're trying to imply you're some type of wicked devil I haven't been to
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.480]  California since my birthday in July and this was reported that it happened
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.800]  Monday and it's gone out over the news it seems a lead story here in Minneapolis
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:26.880]  well I appreciate you correcting that here to show my ignorance I know this
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.880]  just broke last night and it was actually in my stack I've not been told I
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.440]  didn't get to some of the other news I didn't know this went on but we have we
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.320]  have the headline put it back up there for me and of course TMZ is hooked in
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:45.600]  with Fox Jesse the body Ventura rears up in the valley cops rush in and they're
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.960]  yeah they're acting like you're some type of you know big troublemaker who's a
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:53.920]  horrible person and meanwhile you haven't flown in over a year you will
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.400]  not fly and they're now just making this up and and I'm not even seeing
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:21.640]  retractions here well I didn't even know that you were still in the US we
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:39.080]  hadn't talked in a few weeks and well that's good I'd like to get you on for
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.440]  a full interview with the stuff that's happening have you heard about the NDAA
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.000]  to allow the secret arrest and even execution of citizens now Obama is
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.280]  saying and now they've announced they want to put troops on the streets in
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:56.760]  in high-crime areas this is mainstream news CNN in Chicago in New Orleans it
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:01.080]  doesn't surprise me Alex because the people around here have been taken at
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:06.800]  all and they're allowing their rights to be stolen anyway I gotta run because I'm
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.640]  unlimited time but I just wanted you to get it to you put the word out that this
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.760]  is a fabricated story I haven't been on a plane in 15 months well I talked to
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.760]  Tyrell just like a week ago and he talked about you about to go to Mexico or
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.440]  might stay but you were in Minnesota I mean this is crazy you're calling us we
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.240]  saw the color idea you're calling us because you called our studio line hot
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.520]  line you're calling us from Minnesota but it says Jesse the body of Ventura
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.760]  rears up cops rush in law enforcement sources tell us Jesse was pulled over
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.480]  for tailgating deep in San Fernando Valley on his way to the airport when
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:45.080]  cops ask why he was driving so close to their vehicle Jesse replied damn the
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.240]  driver was going way too slow it doesn't sound like a legal argument worthy of
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.480]  Johnny Cochran but at work cops let the former Minnesota governor skate with a
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.400]  warning I agree with you this is Fox that doesn't like you who's associated
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:01.040]  with a teamed up with TMZ I know you've got to go but specifically because we
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.200]  don't know the whole story you're saying you're having to calm you you're
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:20.760]  having to call media and explain this wasn't you oh so this is just now in
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:39.920]  the last hour or so okay that's why no but listen look at this police let
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.560]  Jesse Ventura off with a warning for tailgating and I'm telling you this is
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.440]  a Psyop test because I guarantee you the retraction is gonna end up being some
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:52.880]  little bitty Blair Blitt and the way the public doesn't pay attention it's gonna
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.560]  be all that tailgater that guy that you know that guy that thinks he owns the
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:01.280]  road I agree with your instinct governor this is a beta test for baloney
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:25.840]  well again that that just proves it right there you but you're you're in
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.000]  Minnesota you've got witnesses get affidavits I mean no one them they'll
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.400]  just say we don't care we're gonna say it but in closing because I know you've
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:38.000]  got to go here looking at this obviously you've got a big political book
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.280]  coming out next year they obviously are tapping your phones they know what it's
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.080]  about they know that your your your credibility is rising they know Ron
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.080]  Paul is now the leader in Iowa and I mean have you been off record talking
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.440]  about maybe running because that that would signify that they're getting ready
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:50:00.040]  to come out for you well I made the statement I'm good morning America that
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.840]  is Dr. Paul left the Republicans and ran independently I would certainly give it
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.800]  consideration to running with him I highly doubt if he wins the Republican
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.760]  nomination if the Republicans would be two people at BB's running mate well
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.960]  that's another question he's now the leader in Iowa pulling that out 10 points
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.480]  ahead of Romney almost 20 ahead of Gennrich who's plummeting he's exploding
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.440]  from number two to some polls number one in New Hampshire they know people are
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.560]  hungry for that he's the front-runner now and they're saying let's not be too
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.080]  mean to him or he may run third-party isn't that evidence that if they do
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:57.960]  cheat him in the primary he could run third-party and win that's a good point
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:01.880]  well we'll certainly try to get you on then perhaps right before Christmas if
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:18.440]  we can I agree with you and we appreciate you taking us up on the offer of
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.240]  anytime you've got breaking news governor the hotline is yours I have a
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:35.680]  great Christmas thank you so much yeah that this is definitely there was any
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.160]  other group but now the police may have given this disinfo to them or they may
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.960]  have thought it was Jesse Ventura but that's probably a 20% chance I'd give
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:48.520]  it 80% chance it's as funny as a $3 bill a lot of times I talk about Ventura
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.560]  and they go he's the one whose kid crashed that race car and he's the one
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:58.480]  with that blonde wife and you know the one that puts baby oil on his daughter
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.680]  I'm like no that's Hulk Hogan no Jesse Ventura the woman blonde hair no that's
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:07.840]  Hulk Hogan you mean the one who got divorced no that's Hulk Hogan Jesse
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:14.600]  Ventura has never been divorced I'm a one woman and just again they know the
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:18.600]  public doesn't pay attention I had neighbors over at my house repeatedly
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:22.560]  over the years they go yeah I heard that Hulk Hogan on your show I'm like it's
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:29.560]  Jesse Ventura I mean it and the reason I tell that story is that it shows the
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:35.200]  general public is just like an amaze that's why the government can arrest you
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.680]  say for child porn or whatever later it comes out you didn't do it I've seen
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.480]  many cases of this it doesn't matter because all people heard was that and
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.720]  that's why you cannot believe a word comes out of their mouth it's like North
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:52.240]  Korea North Korea says Kim Jong-il died on a choo-choo train and I told you day
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.080]  one there was credible sources he'd been dead for a year and now that's all over
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.760]  the news that he'd probably been dead for close to a year the South Korean
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:05.160]  president doesn't buy it you'd have to be certifiably stupid to believe anything
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:08.640]  the North Korean government tells you and anything the US government tells you
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:13.240]  when you've got not just you know some out of control or people that did a
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.280]  little something wrong in government and cover it up that stuff goes on no no no
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:21.480]  no this is a conscious criminal enterprise I want to make that clear
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.720]  okay I want to go back to your calls until five after and then we've got a
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:27.960]  guest coming up we'll continue with calls but tyranny buster sorry to interrupt
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.880]  you for the governor you got 60 seconds to finish up we're getting everybody
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:38.880]  else I've worth it to get interrupted by Jesse but uh no I just real quickly everybody you know you
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.880]  you need to get off your soldier worship trips you need to remember that you are
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.160]  private citizens and not members of the military I do not recognize the UN do not
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.600]  refer to soldiers by their rank but by their name they are nothing to you
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.960]  nothing and people need to get out of this mindset people need to get their
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.720]  stuff together guns behind the door you see soldiers at the front door you
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:04.360]  sure don't own the broken that door got that gun in your hands you best remember
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:08.760]  that old lady in Louisiana that video made me smat almost broke everything in
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:12.720]  my house you know because I spent a lot of time in Louisiana then some great
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.040]  people down there well they are but imagine they come behind dry areas as
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.200]  old lady I'm staying here I got plenty of food with my dogs
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.560]  boom punch her out in the face because I mean this is what America's turned
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.000]  into oh yeah let me tell you Alex you declare they declare martial law we can
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.880]  come on down to Oak Ridge Missouri and we'll have a party and I promise you I
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.120]  might lose but they're gonna be less you at the postgame show I promise I know
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.800]  that's what the people don't understand the people in the system don't
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:45.800]  understand good people are not afraid we're just have restraint and a global
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.840]  us know the global us know and I would not want to be in the military or the
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:54.360]  police and try this but again they're going to run psyops they're gonna do it
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:00.440]  and crack infested hell holes first as I keep telling you and I knew this
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.760]  already from studying them and because I'm historically done a lot of research
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.040]  so I understand how things work but when they were released last year the
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:16.440]  national prospectus the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act that
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.640]  was everything we'd known how they roll it out how it's gonna be for the poor
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:25.280]  and homeless centers with a stockade and emergency FEMA camps and old bases and
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:29.440]  how they're gonna you're gonna have to be enrolled into it they're gonna make
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:36.080]  you so poor you beg to go to the camp that's how they operate and again the
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:40.200]  average military is good people but he's right they always taught military not to
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:43.160]  wear their uniforms except when they were on base because you keep the
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.920]  military separate from the rest of America because it's dangerous in every
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:53.360]  other country the military takes over in Rome 2,000 years ago 2,060 something
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:59.120]  years ago and in Venezuela just a decade ago and in every other African and Asian
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.800]  country in Middle Eastern the military is not even supposed to be in your
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.640]  country ladies and gentlemen in the Constitution a navy and that's it because
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.120]  the founders realized how dangerous it was I don't know how to explain this to
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.800]  people you're just gonna have to find out some of you let's talk to Angie in
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:23.560]  North Carolina you're on the air thanks for holding hi Alex I spoke to you the

[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.080]  was a previous contract it's probably still ongoing but the document that

[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.160]  was actually introduced they the contractors are responsible it's all
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.880]  out martial law scenario they're responsible for setting up an
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:29.440]  operation center where they can communicate with the president they

[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.120]  may know what that is but if others out there don't know what that is it's a

[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:58.880]  never got it that's why we found the thing from May or June dealing with the
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:04.040]  FEMA camps being activated she sent us where there's red force blue force and
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:08.400]  how to communicate with the blue force against the red force this is this is
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.320]  for camps with military operations in the US that's a hundred percent with the
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.960]  barricades all the rest of it that's a FEMA camp run by the military against the
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:20.000]  citizens and they're already announcing they want to use troops against us so

[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.680]  info in the investigation even though it's the most important specifically for
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:14.920]  us where do we find the part about blue and red forces I'm sorry say that again
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.920]  Alex where do you find the part about blue and red forces do a control blue part

[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:02.680]  three is where it says other efforts of the operations division includes
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:07.640]  initiatives such as operation rendezvous task force rendezvous the
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.600]  development integration of the federal emergency response official repository

[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:55.680]  just called in and mentioned that we just pulled up on screen is on Homeland
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.520]  Securities website it admits the military and the NSA is gonna run it and
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:07.120]  talks about the military the other stockades the barricades and blue force
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.920]  communications against the Red Force now that's all code but I've been at the
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:15.520]  urban warfare drills and I was talking to her off air and I said well how do you
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:18.600]  know because I mean certainly Red Force Blue Force the command and
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:22.480]  communication of their blue force that that's military parlance for war that's
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:26.480]  how they they call themselves generally the Blue Force I've been to Marine Corps
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.640]  drills where it's you they got it all up on big satellite projections of where
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:33.200]  the troops are Blue Force Red Force where they're training to take on quote

[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.520]  gonna say much more than that we've got a guest already scheduled but I'm gonna
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.200]  have her pop in at the bottom of the hour and the computer we were getting
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.200]  all this up on we had to go to Skype and get our guest cons were pulling it up
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:03.800]  on another computer highlighting it all but I read it there on screen you're
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:07.760]  watching Prison Planet TV you saw me this is the Homeland Security FEMA
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:13.680]  website Department of Defense you know a bid system and it's super ultra
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.400]  creepy and really upsets me because you've got the state reps calling for
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:24.200]  martial law in Illinois and on CNN and in New Orleans in Chicago and New
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:28.400]  Orleans you've got the calls for checkpoints to be set up all over the
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.960]  country you've got the NDAA passing and the and same we'll use the military
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:37.400]  against citizens we found C-SPAN video from last Thursday where they talk about
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:42.720]  killing US citizens I mean that's gonna be on the nightly news tonight my head
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:47.840]  is my head is even spinning this is a giant buildup for war against us and I
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:54.200]  was really impressed a few weeks ago when I was talking about the NDAA on the
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.960]  biggest overnight talk show in the country second biggest in the world
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:04.520]  coast-to-coast AM and they had a Greg Hunter on after me I can't remember it
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:09.160]  was before me the point is I heard him on the show and he heads up USAWatchdog.com
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.120]  I've seen some of their great reports but the way he understood it all tied it
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.560]  all in where he saw the world going before creating and producing the site
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:20.840]  Greg spent nine years as a network and investigative correspondent he worked for
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:24.640]  ABC News and Good Morning America so great journalist the most recently Greg
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.480]  worked for CNN for shows just Paula's on American Morning and various CNN
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.360]  business shows Greg's a hard-hitting reporter who has a history of getting
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.240]  the truth out no matter how difficult the subject USAWatchdog.com now Greg
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.880]  obviously you being in the media know about breaking news I am on the
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:42.240]  Department of Defense site during the break the caller calls in and says look
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.400]  I already tried to give us to you once look at it it talks about FEMA camps
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.320]  being manned by the Department of Defense contractors and military and red
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:56.200]  force in combat with blue force what is what do you make of that breaking news
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:02.920]  well there's a lot I think we're still coming down because you just look at the
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:07.560]  numbers of what what they're doing and the people and what they're saying just
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.520]  out in the general press I don't try to do anything other than really just
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.360]  analyze the news and things that Christine Lagar the head of the IMF has
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.280]  said recently that things are intensifying that they're not only
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.960]  unfolding but they're intensifying this is what you're saying in the press on top
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:28.320]  of it you know you have the old Dominic Strauss-Kahn the former chief of the IMF
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.080]  who's is saying basically they have a growth problem they have a debt problem
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:36.800]  the EU has a leadership problem and he's healing is it weeks now they just dump
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:41.440]  a bunch of money into that bailout fund but if you believe the people who handle
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.320]  money for a living the five hundred billion dollars they put in it or six
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.280]  hundred billion dollars whatever it is so far this is what they're reporting and
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:51.320]  who knows what they're doing behind the scenes but if you if you take a look at
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:54.640]  people who handle money for the for a living they say it's gonna cost trillions
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:59.440]  that it just looks like this is gonna collapse and this is this is how we got
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:02.600]  all of our debt incidentally over the last 30 years that we would just
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.040]  continually borrow money and borrow money and borrow money and create more
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:10.440]  debt and nobody ever intends to pay this off obviously it's unbelievable
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.880]  amounts of debt than the hundreds of trillions of dollars just derivatives
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.080]  alone according to the Bank of International Settlements have grown a
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:23.580]  hundred trillion so what that tells me if they're giving they're handling the
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.760]  debt situation with more debt and incidentally this money in Europe
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.800]  they're not paying anything off to giving people more loans debt they're
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:36.480]  putting that on top of debt and this is a how long is problem and by the numbers
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:40.960]  by the math of it I just don't see how it stays afloat just by the numbers on
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:49.760]  the face of it the whole worldwide economy well I totally agree with you
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:56.280]  I'm just dumbfounded by the sense that you're speaking here in fact I have the
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:02.440]  article you mentioned from AFP and Breitbart World Economy at a very
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:08.280]  dangerous juncture IMF chief and just last Friday she said this could be a
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.920]  repeat of the 1930s for those that don't know what that means that means
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.400]  global depression the deflationary depression but back then it was a whole
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.640]  totally different scenario than we have now I mean they let things collapse at
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.960]  the back then and money retained value the dollar two things in the Great
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.160]  Depression never were questioned and number one thing in the Great
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.040]  Depression was the US dollar now a lot of people are afraid the euro's gonna
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:36.440]  collapse they're gonna run back in the dollar and gold's coming down some but
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:39.680]  the dollar was never in question the other second thing was the credit
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.520]  rating of the United States was never in question and both those things have
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.120]  come into question the veracity of the dollar as it's declining also our
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:52.280]  credit rating has been cut even though it's only been you know what one great
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.960]  it's still we no longer have the top credit rating they're threatening to
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:59.600]  cut the credit rating of France threatening to cut their credit rating
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:07.080]  of the UK you all this is about the bankers making crazy reckless that I
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:12.280]  think in some cases fraudulent loans and bets and they don't want to take a hit
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.280]  they don't want to take a loss they want to kick the can down the road
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.400]  tink-tink-tink and they want to they want to you know it's still all this
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.240]  austerity and they want people to pay them back their money and they don't
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.720]  want to take loss my goodness they want another bonus this year because after
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:33.280]  all they have to pay to retain that talent you know the talent that almost
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.480]  destroyed the entire world economy and we still know we're out of this and
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.120]  that's the thing that the mainstream media just really doesn't report on it
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.040]  that's one of my specialties is is what does the mainstream media tell people
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:49.320]  they don't really lie and you probably have read into this didn't really lie
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:53.880]  I don't want to say that what they do is they just simply don't cover it they
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.920]  simply ignore it now they lie by omission or a bio mission or they bury it in the
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:04.040]  article or they spin it I just did a story with the USA Today newspaper I
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:09.680]  used to work for a guinette and it was just a few days ago and I called it you
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.880]  know oblivious because of the main because of mainstream media and people
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:18.640]  are completely and totally in the dark and they basically they're there I was
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:21.680]  reading the story on us today it's the last week
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.920]  I mean the story I said well this isn't really in a fair and balanced you know
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:31.080]  this is a objective news story about the economy better write a bad piece on
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.920]  this because you know here they are talking about the economy and listen
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.160]  their facts they use yes car sales are up yes the home sales are up but they're
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:44.040]  they're in reference their bottom bouncing from being off 75% so they're
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:47.960]  just bouncing along the bottom and this is this is with at home prices are
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:52.360]  falling and this is with the government suppressing interest rates to
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:58.240]  unbelievable lows down to around 4% and but anyway but so real estate's a huge
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.240]  factor in the trouble the economy is in I mean we've got this foreclosure for all
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:07.000]  they called it you know Robo shiny was nothing more than basically creating
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.440]  fraudulent documents so banks go into court and take back houses that they
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:17.000]  should never loan money on in the first place but listen a really track story
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.440]  came out at four more than four million foreclosures are now in the pipeline
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.320]  and so they're doing a story about the overall economy not a word about the
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.800]  four million foreclosures in the pipeline they're actually saying wow
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:35.000]  real estate could actually contribute to the economy in 2012 huh really with
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.800]  four million foreclosures more than four million foreclosures in the pipeline
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:44.360]  according to realty track it's unbelievable the amount of omission
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:48.640]  that they have I mean you're right they wrote this so their advertisers in the
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.040]  newspaper will feel good about the Christmas season and hey you know you
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:56.080]  guys it this is what this is my conjecture hey you guys at the USA today
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.720]  hey you know we're trying to sell things here don't come out with a negative
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.320]  article two weeks before go week before Christmas exactly and then they're using
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.000]  the irrational exuberance in this smoke screen to continue down the same
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.800]  derivatives path the bailouts the banks have been given they're only using to
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:14.720]  leverage it even more so it's going to make things worse it's not like we're
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.800]  saying let's be negative but meanwhile I've confirmed and obviously you see it
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:23.840]  all over the news now but they are getting the military ready to be on the
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.240]  streets of America obviously the system knows there's going to be a total
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.600]  collapse and it's going to be a hundred times worse when the general public has
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.960]  no idea this is coming I mean if we had the incredible homelessness in the Great
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:40.480]  Depression with people that were pretty much self-sufficient what's going to
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:46.800]  happen when let's face it a lot of spoiled rotten people I mean this is
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:50.320]  scary this is scary well and I think what's going to happen with these and I
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.000]  get up the longest time I was like oh come on see my campsite well you know I
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:01.240]  hate to say this but these people have to be as smart as me I I don't have any
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:05.160]  great degrees at accounting I'm not an economist I'm an investigator reporter by
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.640]  trade with a trade I've learned and I applied my investigative reporting
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.920]  skills to the economy and basically what I do is I look at what's out there go
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:18.320]  what can I prove what can I nail what can I put out there and prove and there's
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:22.840]  so much out there Alex by the numbers that you can prove from very good
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:27.960]  sources that say you know we have 12 trillion dollars Alex 12 trillion
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:33.160]  liquid dollar assets held outside the country according to John Williams an
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:37.080]  economist the shadow stats that comment that you know he is now can you imagine
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  what kind of debacle could happen if people all of a sudden wake up and
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:46.000]  realize that that the people around the globe are selling these dollar assets

[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:09.520]  coming up with Greg Hunter USAWatchdog.com I knew when I heard him on
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:14.000]  there just amazing information spot on and it's really great to have him here
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.880]  hopefully he can pop in every month or so to give us updates on his research but
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:22.800]  listen I'm not trying to be sensational here I've got children I've got a wife I
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.320]  wish when I went to urban warfare drills 12 years ago I didn't witness
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:31.200]  Marines training to take on US militias but I shot video of it it's not my word
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.320]  it's in police state 2000 but I knew it was long term then they were just beta
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:40.280]  testing I've got family in the military they say everybody officers you name it
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.200]  is being trained for crowd control the last three years so they're gearing up
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:48.000]  and now I just read the documents on the Department of Defense site and FEMA and
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.840]  that business of federal filing site where where you file for contracts on
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:57.200]  three sites that the caller pointed out where it talks about the military
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:01.720]  manning FEMA camps and blue force situation command and control against
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:05.880]  red force here in America now folks that is military wage and war against the
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:08.840]  American people I'm sorry Greg Hunter you were making a point about an
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:13.800]  investigative journalist looking at all these pieces please continue well I
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.280]  only try I'm like you Alex I don't want to be sensational I will be aware when we
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:20.920]  did stories at ABC and CNN people would come to us and say hey I've got this
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:24.120]  story and it's about such a touch and I would say you know what I believe you
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.280]  how do I prove it how do I prove that X amount of cars are killing people or how
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:33.000]  do I prove that depleted uranium is so terrible and how do I prove that and if
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.640]  I could prove it I could do it so I only do what I can prove let's go back to the
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:40.760]  banking system and here's why if you take a look at the big picture people
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.320]  don't realize everybody thinks 2008 we were saved we were not saved we were
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.720]  postponed they spent 16 trillion dollars according to a government
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:52.880]  accountability report thank you Bernie Sanders for slipping that in to the to
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:57.600]  the bill last year so we audit the Federal Reserve what they did 16 trillion
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:01.160]  you know you heard about the more than 7 trillion given to the banks but 16
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:05.880]  trillion anybody report on that the mainstream media no that's not a story
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.440]  I have friends of mine still in the mainstream media and I say that's not a
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:13.080]  story that's not that's that's a government accountability report that's
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:17.240]  not something filed by some guy in Montana living in some cave this is the
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:23.400]  GAO and it was put into a bill by a US sitting US Senator from Vermont and we
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:28.000]  found out they spent or doled out 16 trillion dollars in the wake of this and
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.480]  we still have a problem and you know Alex why I think we still have a problem
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:36.200]  because they're not using the money to fix the problem that's too big to ever
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.320]  fix too big not enough money and I wrote a piece when I first went on I've been
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.280]  on you know you've been on for 10 15 years but I've only been on for a
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.920]  couple years and I one of my first pieces was default option and I said we
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:51.080]  should just take the banks to receivership I mean doesn't fly everybody
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:54.640]  well Ron Paul has said that that's impossible to pay off a black hole we
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:59.360]  should take the banks to receivership we should protect only the depositors we
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.720]  should the bondholders sorry you get some the shareholders you poof you made a
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.060]  bad investment depositors that's your capital base that's capital
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:12.680]  formation it would only cost us six trillion dollars six trillion we could
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:17.480]  insured everything in the banks instead we've got to pay off the banks for their
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:23.360]  gambling and and and they as you said you hit the key they want it all they're
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.720]  gonna keep getting bailouts they run them the government and they've got the
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:31.440]  military in Europe standing by and here the military now works for the big
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:35.960]  megabanks to squeeze it out of us you know this is how serious the problem
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:39.880]  is that most people in the mainstream media I watch you know CNBC and some of
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.280]  the stuff they do like I quote stuff from CNBC about really track okay some of
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.600]  the stuff they do is good it's good actually information but again you know
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:52.840]  they basically omit they lie by omission how do you omit when you're doing
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:58.080]  analysis of a bank okay and I'm not an economist and I don't analyze banks but
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:03.440]  how do you analyze a bank that's allowed to lie this problem is so big they
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:07.040]  change the accounting standards the financial accounting standards for the
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:11.840]  FASB standards in April of 2009 2009 you can change it they can value these
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.840]  tier three assets you know real estate mortgage-backed securities that whatever
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.200]  they think they'll get for them in the future now you think about that wow we
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.880]  think we'll get par value for the houses we have in these securities that
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:28.000]  weren't bought by the Federal Reserve and any money we bring in let's pay
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.960]  ourselves a bonus and that's what's going on so this problem was so big they
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:38.040]  couldn't just pump out 16 trillion no they got to allow them and also corporate
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.840]  America you know it's the banks that mostly get this financial accounting
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:45.520]  standards for treatment where they can value their these assets these toxic
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.160]  assets whatever they think they get for them in the future as long as they're
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:52.880]  not bought by the Fed the taxpayers however so if they're allowed to do
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.000]  that must be an awful big problem and also corporate America they say oh
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:02.160]  corporate America's flush with cash well you know not according to the former
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:06.640]  budget director who says that corporate America under the Reagan administration
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:10.280]  that corporate America has about 11 trillion in debt so corporate very isn't
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:15.360]  doing so hot but the banks definitely are not doing David Stockman the banks
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:20.120]  definitely are not doing hot at all and you know General Electric who's bailed
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.840]  out they should take that company down to a dollar well Greg Hunter long

[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:55.200]  saying that the military is involved and that it's blue force you know versus
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:58.400]  the red force the command and control and i've been to urban warfare drills
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.000]  i'm like well how do you know that and then
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.800]  angie off air told me some things but i'm just gonna leave it that and see what
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:06.400]  she wants to say obviously we'll you know give her anonymity so she
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:09.680]  don't have to worry too much uh but now you've got
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.680]  here's the headlines marshal law attempt in louisiana echoes ron paul's warning
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:17.520]  louisiana state officials call for troops on the streets in war against
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:21.680]  guns and drugs i've got in illinois i've got
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:27.040]  mbcn ap are saying yeah we want troops on the streets so that's a new
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.720]  talking point but it's always going to be in the bad neighborhoods first ahead of
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:33.040]  this and we're going back to investigative
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:36.800]  journalist greg hunter we're not going to spend a lot of time
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:43.120]  with the caller in fact my my phone system just crashed john
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:45.440]  but we're going to spend a few minutes with angie and then i'm going to work on
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.160]  getting her on the tv show tonight and maybe even her husband
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:53.280]  because again this stuff's all public but you'd have to know where to go
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:58.080]  look where they're doing all this it was wall street journal in 2006
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:03.040]  about the 386 million dollar to establish through halibut and three
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.560]  one million person camps but now they admit hey we're going to use the
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.840]  department of defense against citizens hey we've got the emergency centers
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:14.160]  establishment act for economic collapse so now
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:18.400]  it's pretty much admitted it's just what are the details of it
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:22.640]  super creepy creepy greg and you keep going back to economic collapse
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:26.240]  obviously if they know it's all going to collapse i guess they think they're just
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.280]  going to put the homeless people and the dissenters
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:33.120]  in these facilities are i mean what do you see as an investigative journalist
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.920]  well by the numbers if we lose our currency so we have this 12 trillion in
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.600]  liquid dollar asset that's that's treasury bonds that's dollars but treasury
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.720]  bonds are really nothing more than you pay somebody a dollar today and
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:47.920]  in five years or three years or ten years or thirty years you get some more
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.280]  dollars back and hopefully the interest rate will make up for the dollars you
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.760]  gave and you'll actually have a profit i don't see how
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:57.680]  paying somebody two or three percent or four percent over five or ten years
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:00.000]  you're ever going to be able to get your money back
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.760]  in terms of real buying power the buying power of your money back so
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:08.560]  a lot of countries in the on the planet you know know this and if we do have a
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:12.160]  dollar route in other words uh... if we do have a
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:16.560]  a cell of uh... you know let's say it's not all they have to sell all 12 trillion
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:20.160]  let's say they sell two or three trillion that could cause interest rates to
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.480]  spike anybody with a adjustable rate mortgage
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.760]  that could cause you know you know inflation we might be paying ten
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:29.040]  dollars a gallon for a gallon of gas that's the kind of
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:32.480]  things that can happen if we have a change of currency and i believe
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.120]  ultimately this will all come down to a currency crisis and that uh
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:40.400]  they'll have a bank holiday when they do have a bank holiday as they have in the
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:44.640]  past they do value your currency and you just have a lot less money to spend
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:47.760]  by the way let me stop you i have another headline here
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.160]  us ask banks to keep more cash on hand yes
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:56.320]  uh... that's uh... an ap and afp so there it is and they say
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:00.400]  more people are coming in wanting their money well yes and you know let me tell
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.200]  you uh... martin armstrong the famous economist
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.120]  economist that was held for you know years for contempt of court which is outrageous
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.640]  but still he is he is a renowned uh... brilliant economist that came up with
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.560]  this uh... economic confidence model which is really the theory of cycles and
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.080]  it's the theory of of economic cycles give way to
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:23.840]  political cycles you know uh... we had a depression in the 30s
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.680]  uh... you know uh... we had the hyperinflation in the 20s for germany we
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.640]  had depression in the 30s and hitler came to power in the 30s
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:34.640]  so an economic cycle for example gave way to a political cycle
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:39.200]  and he has uh... he's out of jail now uh... for his contempt and he was held
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:42.400]  for five or seven years for contempt i'm not an expert on his case but i
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:45.920]  talk about a police state he was totally he was wrongly confused
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:51.120]  couldn't uh... can uh... convicted or wrongly accused of a crime he did
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.440]  plead guilty to one crime it thought he was going to get out anyway
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:56.560]  long and short of it uh... martin armstrong the brilliant economist who i
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:38:00.080]  believe he just gave a seminar in philadelphia
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:02.800]  and you know people flying from all over the world people with real money you
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:05.520]  know as i kind of know twenty five hundred or five thousand dollars to
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:07.680]  attend or whatever which is nothing to people with money
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:10.560]  and he says you know when i have people fly in it's kind of like the united
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:14.160]  nations you know i have people come over from from really around the globe is
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:17.280]  going to have some more of these uh... more of these conferences

[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:24.800]  martin armstrong says hey listen without real reform
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.800]  the the system is going to blow up the world is going to blow up
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:32.480]  the economy the world economy because you know the number one question was at
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.720]  this conference of all these people the number one question according to him a
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:40.400]  recent interview was is my money safe in america
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:43.520]  and he says listen i gotta tell you with this ms global thing
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:47.680]  i gotta say no i i don't have good confidence that anybody's money is safe
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:51.280]  in america because basically they just went in according to martin
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.440]  armstrong now this is a source a real source not my just buy i don't think
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.040]  money is safe in america this is a guy that that councils governments and
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:02.320]  congress he's been called to congress on more than one occasion
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:05.200]  uh... you may not seem you know testifying in front of the house the
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:08.080]  financial committee but they've had him up there
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:12.240]  and he says that uh... you know with what's going on i your money's not safe
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:14.800]  in america with the whole mf global debacle
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:18.720]  so that's a problem also and barnhart you remember you remember her
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:24.000]  yes shut her brokerage down um because she said hey in good faith because he's
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  trade can't settle i can't tell my client that i had their money is safe
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.880]  hey hey they've had a bunch of other heads soros
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:33.840]  gave the money up a few months ago and said i'm not taking your money
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:36.320]  and they've had a bunch of others do it the last six months
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.720]  well yes and why why is that because systemic failure could lock
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:44.240]  everybody's uh money up they're talking about a credit freeze you know over in
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:47.200]  europe which is totally a misnomer they're not fighting a

[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.360]  the banks are insolvent i was guest hosting on a radio show and they had
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:57.680]  this wall street general reporter a couple of months ago and he was over
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:00.960]  there talking about the the european banks and i said hey listen

[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:26.880]  the accounting rules because they couldn't print
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:30.800]  but what does the system think because if you have one of this caller because i
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:35.600]  want to ask you to tell us more about the the uh this huge military news

[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:31.600]  jersey a former u.s. senator and a co-chair a co-
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.960]  a ceo of goldman sacks and he doesn't know anything going on and the two guys
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:41.360]  within the coo and cfo also say they don't know
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.560]  what's going on i called it i said the three students testified for the
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.640]  congress i mean the only thing they were missing
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.320]  was uh most laughing larry and currently for the dumb answers they were
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:52.400]  giving so why do you think they're getting so
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:56.480]  bold and reckless i mean i think we're back to the insolvency
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:00.480]  problem over in europe and of course they're adding more debt to tackle this
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:04.000]  so it's like past the hand grenade it's like the crisis it's like past the
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.280]  hand grenade they pull the pen out they just pass the bad debt around well
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:10.320]  yes and i would be talking about dan barnhart the
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:14.320]  woman that shut her business down says hey listen you need a hundred
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.480]  trillion dollars to bail out europe at least and you know what they came out
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.680]  in the davos-switzerland thing in january they said we want a hundred
[02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:25.120]  trillion that was how much did they need a hundred trillion you tell me how
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:28.480]  they're going to pay they're going to handle this insolvency crisis with the
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:31.920]  banks with five hundred six hundred a trillion
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.000]  two trillion dollars over in europe it's a solvency crisis
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.520]  they are insolvent and let me tell you what i did get out of this reporter
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:42.480]  uh from the wall street journalist as well they've changed the rules about
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.640]  sovereign debt and yes you too can hold that you know you can hold greek bonds
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:50.080]  that are what 30 cents on the dollar 50 cents on the dollar they wanted to take
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:53.840]  a 50 percent haircut you can hold greek bonds at par
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:57.200]  makes your bank your makes your bottom line look really good that's like you
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:01.840]  saying hey uh i've got uh ten ounces of gold but uh i'm going to hold it on my
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:05.200]  books not at uh sixteen hundred and forty dollars or whatever it is right now
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:08.240]  thirty dollars an ounce i'm going to hold it on my books and what i think i'd get
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.520]  for it in the year 2024 uh i think it's worth ten thousand
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:15.680]  an ounce i've got a hundred thousand dollars let's leverage that up
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:19.600]  let's pay some bonuses let's go buy a car that's what's going on with the
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.760]  accounting they are allowed to hold these toxic assets that they're toxic
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:26.960]  because what the fed bought at least a couple of trillion dollars because they
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:30.560]  weren't really good and you think about it alex i want you to back up and do a
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:34.160]  wide shot and i'm going to tell you something really simple
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:38.400]  and it's going to be like oh you had the robo signing remember that
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.160]  robo signing remember that yes i do okay so
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.600]  so now we know it's widely reported that millions of documents were forged
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.600]  with people like linda green and we're talking about promissory notes and you
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:55.840]  think you pay for your house after 30 years no you don't you pay it when you
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:59.520]  sign a promissory note that's a financial incident
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:04.320]  much like a federal reserve note you can't go counterfeit a fed reserve note
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:06.800]  go down to seven eleven to buy a slurpee can you
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:11.120]  no you can't counterfeit a promissory note either
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:16.000]  so now if we know that million this is good you like this so we know millions of
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.320]  of documents were forged widely reported story
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:23.760]  then riddle me this how did they create
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:27.680]  mortgage-backed securities when they didn't have the documents
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:33.760]  obviously they have to forge them how did they bundle the securities
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:38.320]  well that too how did they rate the securities if you have to forge the
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:42.080]  documents how did you rate the securities number
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.920]  number three how did you get a tax advantage if they weren't really
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:48.880]  securities how did you get a tax advantage so the
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:52.720]  income goes straight through to the bond holder to the pension fund do
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:56.480]  whoever's called a rivick how did that happen and finally
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:01.760]  if you know there is major fraudulent activities as Alan Grayson said and many
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:05.840]  other people have said it was fraudulent why isn't the justice department
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:08.800]  filing charges they're busy shipping guns into
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:12.560]  mexico they created the mirror system defraudently claimed that they own the
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.880]  houses and had the deeds and they AAA rated the bonds and had
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:21.360]  corrupt companies certified as AAA rating which they then sold those
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:24.320]  insurance policies as more crud so they sold
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.840]  crap on top of crap nobody's being arrested
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.560]  according to William Black the renowned economist
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:37.200]  professor of economy he's got phd economy phd uh uh in law
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:40.240]  uh he was the big guy that sent a bunch of them to prison last go around
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.840]  well yeah we they put a thousand financial elites in prison
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:48.720]  this is 70 times bigger according to him zero financial elites have gone to jail
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:52.160]  oh we've heard they're gonna have civil charges against the executives of fanny
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:56.560]  may and freddy mac and we're Greg hunter don't worry north com standing by
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:00.160]  to take out the evil people that are criticizing and i want to briefly we're
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:03.040]  going to go to break come back and have you finish riveting information
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:08.000]  hope folks are waking up out there and spread the word uh angie in north carolina
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.200]  i don't know how much you want to say what you told me off air but uh you have
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.680]  reasons to notice these things in the department of defense uh orders but how
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:19.760]  big an issue just just you know to our guests breaking it down to talk about
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:23.360]  the military running emergency camps well you could say it's for floods and
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.440]  things this says blue force situational awareness
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:30.320]  communication and you're absolutely right when they
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.880]  talk about blue force versus red force that means a combat situation
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:39.760]  angie finish up your points on that yeah i think it's very disturbing this whole
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.040]  entire document um is their bid to contract
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:49.280]  for the establishment of a communications system
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:53.760]  for the purpose of essentially a complete societal breakdown
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:57.440]  continuity of government situation and that's exactly what it says that
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.880]  the operations division uh need to provide the you know basically the
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:06.080]  electronics communication and look at outreach support that's going to be
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.360]  psyops and then in there it talks about red force
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:12.800]  and again i've been to the drills that means waging when they go red blue
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:16.640]  or a blue red one talks about blue force that's that's the government against
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:20.480]  somebody right it's actually it says blue force
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:24.080]  situational awareness and i'll say it again for those that don't know what
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:28.000]  that is it's it's the uh communication system
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.720]  that the military uses its military program to identify
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:36.400]  friendlies and non-friendlies in the battlefield for the purpose of avoiding
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.480]  friendly fire um so you know generally it's a
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:43.760]  transponder unless they think the enemy is tracking them then they turn them off
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:47.440]  for it's what's painted on the tanks it's codes that are blurped down
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:51.600]  and anybody else who hidden uh you know on the blue list you're on the red list
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:55.600]  right or or they can use other colors but usually it's a blue red
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:59.520]  i mean this is amazing and i mean you know about it i mean one of the people
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:03.840]  you know that are involved in this are they pretty upset right now
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.160]  yeah very it's an extremely disturbing development um
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.760]  you know basically anything that that would provide for
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:17.440]  you know a 72-hour standby uh in order for them to be able to pull together
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.640]  you know uh situational control within the borders of the united states using
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:26.320]  the military is disturbing you know that's why we have
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:30.000]  posse comatitis because uh well we don't need more they just
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.760]  passed in daa now i mean sure it's outrageous but
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:37.280]  wait we found a c-span clip it's in like a two hour long shows we
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:39.920]  didn't play it on the radio we found it at the start but we're going to try to
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:43.200]  play it tonight where they're on c-span going look we're not just
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  going to arrest you we're going to kill you
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:49.040]  and they say yes we're going to kill americans without a trial
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.640]  uh i mean just the magnitude of this well well that's what's so disturbing
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:57.760]  and uh as you were saying before with the with the blue
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:00.640]  force red force the way that that works is you're right
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:05.440]  uh blue force has blue forces considered friendly and they carry
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.880]  transponders and essentially anybody that does not have a transponder
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:14.800]  that identifies them as a friendly is considered
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:20.240]  a red force or enemy um and that's what they use out in the battlefield now i
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:23.680]  don't know why they would want to set up a system to be able to use that here
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:27.440]  within the united states unless they know something that we don't
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:30.720]  well look i was told by insiders and now of course the drones are actually
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.880]  tracking farmers so people believe it now
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.760]  that they got the gps marking of your door or swat teams army truck pickups
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:41.360]  and drone attacks and i was told this by an army colonel
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:45.200]  uh who was so scared he wanted i'm not going to get into it uh listen i'm

[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:11.920]  media real journalists like yourself and others are firing up their own

[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:20.400]  storm of old line media and government open industry openly
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:23.680]  saying let's censor people to where you have 80 of the
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:26.880]  inventors of the internet coming out last week and saying they really are
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:29.360]  planning to shut down alternative speech so
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:33.440]  you see them gearing up for what you call i mean what i would call
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:37.520]  an iron curtain descending on america well listen if you take a look at the
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  data points and i'm gonna tell your viewers another and listeners another
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:45.120]  little data point that's coming out today uh before i start and these are just
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.400]  data points you can say hey you know these are what why aren't they telling us
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:51.920]  national association of realtor see if anybody covers this tonight this came
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.560]  out today the n a r national association of
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:57.840]  real owners is according to john williams who is a ivy league trained
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:01.760]  economist who sells his information to hedge funds and nobody in the world
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:05.520]  would ever make a decision based on government unemployment government
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:10.480]  inflation uh government gdp numbers they hire people like john williams say okay
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:14.000]  here's the raw data what does it really mean and that's why john williams
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:18.320]  shadowstands.com does what he does for people who handle money well he does it
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:21.760]  the old way the government used to that's correct i mean what he says inflation
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:25.360]  is 11 percent if you did it the way it was done by the bureau of labor
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.680]  statistics in 1980 or or unemployment's really 22
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:34.000]  employment's really 20 22 correct if it was done the way the bureau of labor
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.920]  statistics did it 1994 or earlier unemployed underemployed
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:42.800]  unemployed and underemployed is really 22 percent so if it really we had the
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:45.600]  first two quarters of the year we had a couple of percent shrinkage according to
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:48.720]  him uh so that's that and that's not getting up and here's
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:51.200]  another story just as a data point that i'll get back here the thing the
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:56.960]  national association of realers just uh read did refresh their figures uh
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:02.720]  and uh they they basically uh they corrected their estimates and 3.54
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.160]  million homes vanished sales of 3.54 million homes
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:10.560]  vanished since 2007 just another little data point let's see if that
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:16.240]  gets widely reported in the press that that the sales of 3.54 million homes
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:20.400]  vanished since 19 2007 according to the national
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:24.720]  association realers adjustments but back to the mainstream media versus the real
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:28.320]  media which is now us we're not the alternative media we're the real media
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.680]  i know i know what a story is alex jones i know what one is
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:35.920]  i did stories against ford motor company i did stories against big car companies
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.200]  i did stories about depleted uranium munitions i had to
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:43.440]  you know i did some of that stuff on my side i know what a story is
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.640]  i did nothing i didn't cover fires i didn't cover floods
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.840]  i worked in the r&d department of abc news and cnn i work with the lawyers i
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.240]  work with standards i work with legal i didn't say anything unless i had i
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:00.320]  said a line like so it did such and such do you have a document to prove that
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:04.000]  i had to have documents for everything i know what a story is i know what to say
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.360]  and i know what to how to say something that's true and what's going on today
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.600]  is outrageous but let's say let's take 60 minutes the pinnacle of broadcasting
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:15.040]  they interview uh and i did this on my side they interview
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:18.240]  ben bernicke uh what you know several months ago
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:22.720]  and he says oh we're not printing money uh and you know how i know he's lying
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:27.440]  because uh john steward on the daily show found a clip where he was on 60
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:31.280]  minutes a year earlier and he says that essentially we're printing money
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:35.280]  and 60 minutes decided not to ask him about any of that i tell you what greg
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:42.640]  hunter let's do five minutes overdrive back in 60 seconds i want you to finish
[02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:51.040]  thank you for listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:54.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:58.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:05.680]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:08.560]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:12.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:15.680]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:19.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:23.200]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:26.240]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:59:26.240 --> 02:59:29.360]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:32.800]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:36.160]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest

[02:59:55.520 --> 03:00:10.560]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:13.040]  all right five minutes overdrive and we're going to have an incredibly
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:17.200]  important info wars nightly news seven o'clock central late o'clock eastern
[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:21.520]  we got 15 day free trial for the nightly news and then of course you see it
[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:24.240]  first and it's all archived all the films at one spot and then we put it
[03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:26.560]  out for free everywhere else millions watch it
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:29.680]  over the week after these shows get released but you are financing others
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:33.360]  getting real news and information so well i'll have time to digest all this
[03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:36.160]  information i learned the last two hours here
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:40.000]  that just flips me out because i've been to urban warfare drills
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:43.600]  and i know what all of these transponders mean and they admit the
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:48.080]  military is going to run the camps against the red force and all of it
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:51.840]  this is not this is not good news i mean i knew this and it fits with everything
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:55.200]  else but it's just like really it's really happening
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:58.960]  i guess the germans said that too but at least we got a jump on them here
[03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:02.080]  uh now going back to greg hunter an amazing investigative journalist
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:05.760]  now you were finishing up though getting into calls for censoring the web
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:09.280]  they're everywhere now it's like they've gone from denying this stuff as we
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:12.160]  watched them eat around the edges to now they're just
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:14.640]  right out in the open saying yeah we're going to shut you down
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:18.640]  yes and i think they're not going to go to your show or my side or somebody else's
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:22.560]  side when it hits the stand and listen if the currency goes poof
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:26.240]  uh i'm telling you dollars physical dollars are going to work really good
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.000]  for a while but they won't work good for long and i'm not telling trying to
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:33.120]  tell everybody to go make a run on a bank but i think everybody no matter
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:35.600]  you know whether it's a hurricane or a flood or whatever you should always have
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:39.120]  some cash on hand but the long and short of it is that you're not
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:42.400]  really being told the whole truth and this is what happened in the wake of the
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:46.800]  last uh debacle in 2008 and and reliable sources
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:51.040]  which is named howard curts came on and and with all of his panel of the
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:55.440]  regular mainstream media and they all had one overarching thing and the rate
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:58.800]  and mainstream media in general had one overarching thing and it was nobody saw
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:01.680]  that coming and i had a producer friend of mine who
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:04.320]  was at cnn who said hey wait a minute no no
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:08.560]  greg hunter saw it coming uh he did this story then he did this video here some
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:11.120]  of the stories are on my side one of the story on my side he's looking at the
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:14.560]  about tab i have john williams on in 2008 and he says
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:19.600]  what i have it an inflationary depression well we got a depression i think
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:23.200]  and the inflation part is 11 percent so we don't we we have inflation but he
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:26.240]  thinks it'll be it'll turn into hyperinflation and people say well
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:29.120]  you know wages aren't going up how can it turn into hyperinflation
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:32.080]  remember that 12 trillion held outside the country
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:36.400]  listen if that starts getting sold forget it uh you know we do have
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:39.120]  the dollar backed by something it's backed and that's right once the
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:42.960]  rush to the exit happens and it's already kind of started the avalanches
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:45.680]  you know the rocks like just a few rocks are bouncing down
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:49.520]  then it will happen and for my research isn't that the worst kind of depression
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:54.080]  is it is a uh inflationary depression because your currency goes
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:56.960]  you know the great depression bill oh it's so terrible well the credit rate in
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:00.960]  the u.s was sterling never lost a click uh and the dollar
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:04.240]  wow even though they devalued the dollar against gold you know a 20 dollar gold
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:08.960]  piece these two exist because because fdr needed to print dollars and he so he
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:13.200]  revalued the gold to 35 dollars an ounce he sure we valued it to 50 dollars an
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:16.800]  ounce or 70 dollars an ounce but he did 35 so they brought in the 20
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:20.720]  dollar gold pieces because 20 dollars uh it was not an ounce of gold actually
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:25.120]  0.967 it's actually 20 dollars and 67 cents
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:28.400]  67 cents bought you like 10 gallons of gas back then but anyway
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:32.560]  so but the dollar if you had dollars you had currency you had money you had
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:37.040]  something now if you have dollars the problem is uh you know oh I have
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:43.200]  fdic insurance oh okay hey bob hey pay this lady her 150 thousand
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:46.480]  dollars you need your money too sure no problem we have a line of
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:49.840]  credit at the treasury and what does that mean we'll give you your money but
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:53.760]  we're not going to give you your buying power and if it's so bad alex what
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:57.360]  they'll do is they'll have a banking holiday they'll read you know what they
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:00.720]  could do is they can have a banking holiday just like they did in the 30s
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:04.240]  and they revalue the money or they introduce a new currency
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:07.360]  or whatever but what could happen and this is why I think it could be
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:09.920]  pandemonium do you know how fast things could leave the
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:13.360]  grocery store shelves do you know how fast we could be out of things just
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:16.800]  like one day one day well a few days and I think they
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:19.520]  made with these camps may say hey listen you want to live
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:22.480]  you need to go to this camp no I agree they're gonna sell it
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:25.280]  oh hackers hit the internet we've got to shut some sites down
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:28.560]  oh you got to go to the camp because you're starving that's what I think
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:31.680]  they're already arresting homeless people saying you can't be on the street
[03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:34.800]  well what happens when your whole family's homeless bye bye I tell you
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:38.640]  Greg you really are spot-on with your research and a great mind
