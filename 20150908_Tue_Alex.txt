[01:55.680 --> 01:59.440]  and these aren't the hard-working immigrants many of them that have come here in the past

[24:14.080 --> 24:20.400]  a boss on this highway so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way if you break the
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.440]  law you'll hear from me i know i'm waiting for the state i'm a highway patrol
[24:25.440 --> 24:32.560]  If you drive too fast, well you know me when you see me cause my doors painted white, my

[24:43.840 --> 24:49.280]  better drive slow, I'm just a done my job, I'm a highway patrol, is Junior Brown bringing
[24:49.280 --> 24:50.280]  a stand?
[24:50.280 --> 24:58.200]  If you drive too fast, like you shouldn't do, you can bet your boots, I'm coming after
[24:58.200 --> 24:59.200]  you.
[24:59.200 --> 25:03.800]  Really, it's not allowed to go out for the private Federal Reserve, it's been caught
[25:03.800 --> 25:09.520]  since the 70's laundering hundreds of billions of dollars per year of drug money on record,
[25:09.520 --> 25:16.000]  I mean it's been in the Associated Press, it's been in Bloomberg, that Wacovia Wells
[25:16.000 --> 25:25.400]  Fargo 378 billion in drug money over two years, they all do it, but little banks have
[25:25.400 --> 25:30.280]  to fill out suspicious customer reports on people, even old lady gets out a thousand
[25:30.280 --> 25:33.920]  dollars cash, it's not ten thousand or more folks, I was talking to a banker just the
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.240]  other day and then if you're a small town branch, they come in with investigators and
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.880]  call you a criminal because you didn't put anybody in a database, remember the head of
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.920]  the federal marshals over a whole sector, the air marshals a few years ago was in the
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.360]  Denver Post, ended up getting in trouble for blowing the whistle and said we are ordered
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.760]  to put innocent people in terrorist databases to create the perception of a terror threat
[25:55.760 --> 25:58.040]  on the airplanes.
[25:58.040 --> 26:03.840]  If a old woman orders a vegetarian meal, they're putting a database, if a family takes a picture
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.280]  of themselves getting on the airplane, we put them in a database, I will not be part
[26:07.280 --> 26:10.400]  of this fraud and my agents do not want to do this.
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.680]  He signed up to protect people, I actually had him on as a guest, so the average person
[26:15.680 --> 26:19.560]  in the government is more aware of this than even I, the problem is they're purging all
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.680]  the people that want to actually be good stewards and follow their oaths and they're
[26:23.680 --> 26:30.520]  putting in people that know there's a criminal takeover, I've had the ATF twice in person,
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.360]  once at a God's show and once on the street, basically come right up to me with the most
[26:36.360 --> 26:42.280]  criminal, hateful look of predatory evil and tell me they're going to get me and I better
[26:42.280 --> 26:49.840]  watch my butt and then they just can't believe it when I just throw my hands up and go well
[26:49.840 --> 26:57.000]  then do something, what's your problem, what is your problem, why do you hate good people,
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.880]  you hate us because we remind you what piles of steaming crap you are, you stupid scum,
[27:03.880 --> 27:08.440]  once the revolution kicks off you idiots, you're going to be one of the worst positions
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.560]  out there and I don't take any pleasure in that, you think you can bomb yourselves in
[27:13.560 --> 27:20.520]  Oklahoma City and make yourselves victims, everybody sees through that, stupid, man I'm
[27:20.520 --> 27:26.080]  in such an aggressive mood, I'm glad I took a few days off because I'm ready to fight
[27:26.080 --> 27:32.200]  the new world order, I'm here to tell you, I watch these videos, I mean it's a fact,
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.040]  okay, let's get past the political correctness, I'm not an Islamophobic, I was against all
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.840]  these wars to destabilize the Middle East to cause the class of civilizations and put
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.640]  in really bad regimes, but Western exported hip hop mixed with woman hating elements
[27:46.640 --> 27:51.960]  of radical Islam that the anthropologist admits this, the sociologist has created
[27:51.960 --> 27:59.080]  a radical gang banger beyond straight out of Compton mutation, just like hillbilly kids
[27:59.080 --> 28:05.200]  in the Ozarks are imitating inner city gangsterism, cause all they were imitating was Al Capone,
[28:05.200 --> 28:14.680]  people like that, everything's a copy of the last group and in Europe rape is up more
[28:14.680 --> 28:21.640]  than ten fold and it's because the police will not enforce or go after Western women
[28:21.640 --> 28:27.880]  and I mean young girls, people's 14 year old daughters getting raped by radical Muslims
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.680]  and if fathers fight back, they're arrested, there have been famous cases where gypsies
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.120]  broken a guy's house five times, he got an old shotgun double barrel that had been his
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.080]  father's, he was an old farmer himself, shot one of them, last time I heard he's still
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.960]  in jail, they won a lawsuit against him and didn't get in trouble, in England the gypsies
[28:48.960 --> 28:56.840]  are allowed saying it's their culture to steal your RVs, they call them wagons there, don't
[28:56.840 --> 29:03.680]  believe me just type in, police will not return wagons stolen and it's not just bashing Romanian
[29:03.680 --> 29:09.840]  gypsies who go back to India, Europeans thought they were from Egypt so that's where the word
[29:09.840 --> 29:15.840]  gypsy comes from, Egypt gypsy, but we're talking about pikes that everybody acts like are
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.360]  so cute and funny and cool and they're out of Ireland and I'm not bashing Irish, I'm
[29:20.360 --> 29:27.760]  part Irish, but it's just Irish scum who thinks it's their responsibility and their right
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.560]  to rob and kill and steal whatever they want and they make movies with Brad Pitt how cute
[29:31.560 --> 29:35.440]  he is, I don't know some pikey comes around here wanting to rob me and my family, I'll
[29:35.440 --> 29:40.320]  beat your brains out, we're the baseball bat, I'm sick of these criminal cultures and they're
[29:40.320 --> 29:45.000]  just telling Europe everybody it's free reign, come rape us, come kill us, come piss on us,
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.040]  whatever you want, no, it stops now.
[29:49.040 --> 30:00.040]  Here on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.040 --> 30:05.520]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of 8 being killed and 46 being wounded, July
[30:05.520 --> 30:11.440]  4th of this year we had reports of 9 dead and 53 wounded and let us not forget July 4th
[30:11.440 --> 30:18.680]  of last year we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot and these are not nationwide stats,
[30:18.680 --> 30:23.240]  all of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest
[30:23.240 --> 30:28.480]  gun laws in the nation, which is to say if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.720]  more likely to attack you, not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked
[30:32.720 --> 30:39.280]  to gangs or drug activity, meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials,
[30:39.280 --> 30:42.800]  criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.960]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once, but
[30:47.960 --> 30:52.360]  that's why you have a second amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[30:52.360 --> 31:22.320]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[32:06.240 --> 32:09.520]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[16:32.340 --> 33:49.240]  we are live broadcasting world one and I am so fired up that I was
[33:49.240 --> 33:53.920]  basically running around screaming in the control room during the break until I settled
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.880]  down and did a little Facebook mentions live broadcast and I'm going to start doing that
[33:59.880 --> 34:02.280]  a few times a day during the three minute breaks.
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.080]  I'm going or during video pieces we're airing, I'm going to start doing extra news and analysis
[34:07.080 --> 34:08.080]  at Facebook.
[34:08.080 --> 34:14.400]  I'm also going to do some of the live YouTube feeds as well but some of these Facebook mentions
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.440]  we're doing like seven or eight of them so far are getting 200 plus thousand viewers.
[34:19.440 --> 34:25.760]  We're talking tens of thousands at one time and then over the next day 200,000 and what's
[34:25.760 --> 34:31.080]  exciting is so many of those people are folks that don't even know who we are and that's
[34:31.080 --> 34:40.040]  what I really crave, what I really lust after in a good way, I know lust is a sin but you
[34:40.040 --> 34:45.120]  know what I mean is reaching new people and warning them so they can't be preyed upon.
[34:45.120 --> 34:52.800]  There's a Facebook video I shot while I was hiking Saturday with Buckley Hammond who's
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.040]  moved back to Austin the last few years, used to hang out all the time when he lived here
[34:57.040 --> 35:03.720]  and now he hang out all the time, he and I and his wife and my family and I was hiking
[35:03.720 --> 35:08.960]  on the hiking bike trail and until the feed cut out because we're down on a canyon I talked
[35:08.960 --> 35:13.360]  about 30 or more people telling them read the vaccine insert, it's meant to brain damage
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.240]  you and your family so they can then make money off of you once you get sick.
[35:17.240 --> 35:22.000]  The average doctor's compartmentalized and doesn't know this but it's up to you to understand
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.360]  and that active resistance if 5% of the public would do that neurotically and aggressively
[35:29.360 --> 35:32.720]  at least four or five times a week, I do it more than that.
[35:32.720 --> 35:36.240]  I want an elevator, I want an escalator, I'm going to check out wine, I'll say hey see
[35:36.240 --> 35:42.080]  this gum, notice it doesn't say sugar free but on the back it's aspartame, in the monkey
[35:42.080 --> 35:46.480]  studies in the 70s it didn't get approved because it killed monkeys, look up Reese's
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.360]  monkey studies aspartame, they go yeah I chew gum but I don't, aspartame's bad and
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.640]  I go I quit chewing that years ago, yeah my mom probably went blind from that, these are
[35:56.640 --> 36:00.340]  real conversations, I go really no no this has got it, no it doesn't, I chew that very
[36:00.340 --> 36:08.880]  gum, $100 just read the back, sir paper plastic, paper please just do me a favor look on the
[36:08.880 --> 36:18.080]  back, well it really does say aspartame, so if that's somebody I can help, number one
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.560]  I'm helping somebody, number two I'm frustrating the globalist, number three at a mojo level,
[36:24.560 --> 36:31.800]  it gets my mojo right in, I got to keep on right in, right in, it makes me feel good,
[36:31.800 --> 36:40.680]  my soul goes man I like this, I can feel my God fear subdue a little bit when I do the
[36:40.680 --> 36:44.640]  right thing, it's like yes now you're doing it, now you're aggressive, now you're warning
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.600]  them, now you're doing what you were made to do, now you're becoming a man, good, good,
[36:49.600 --> 36:54.840]  do this more, I'll take you to the top and have you face down the enemy and then you
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.440]  can be destroyed right in front of the world like so many other people will and in that
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.000]  we will defeat the globalist, don't think the globalists don't metaphysically know
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.840]  all of this, so we're not stopping ladies and gentlemen, we know the mission, the enemy
[37:09.840 --> 37:16.320]  knows we're not crazy, they know we're aware of their hair on fire evil, we are aware
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.680]  of what they're possessed by, what they're driven by, we're driven by something else,
[37:20.680 --> 37:26.920]  we are filled by something that's the opposite of what they're filled by, now on a shift
[37:26.920 --> 37:33.840]  years in the big story I was ranting about, when I see giant trains of people from Central
[37:33.840 --> 37:40.960]  and South America pouring in by the millions, Mexico won't take them and I see these people
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.720]  being paid for by taxpayer money when the globalists are exempt from it to bankrupt us, I realize
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.440]  a lot of these are good people, but I also realize a lot of them are bad people and the
[37:50.440 --> 37:57.640]  globalists are using my concern, using my empathy against me to bring down the west,
[37:57.640 --> 38:02.120]  to shut off our infrastructure, to shut off our jobs, to shut off our power plants, to
[38:02.120 --> 38:08.080]  create so much red tape we can't operate, this is just cherry on the top of Obamacare
[38:08.080 --> 38:14.480]  and the cost of business and the screw jobs and everything that's happened.
[38:14.480 --> 38:21.680]  And then I see Europe, remember this article, ISIS operatives, thousands of jihadists have
[38:21.680 --> 38:26.960]  infiltrated Europe, they said that months ago that they would use the giant immigrant
[38:26.960 --> 38:33.200]  flow and quote 500,000 that they were going to send into the United States, there's the
[38:33.200 --> 38:39.880]  flashback, ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as a psychological weapon
[38:39.880 --> 38:45.920]  and chilling echo of Qaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos,
[38:45.920 --> 38:54.120]  that was the plan to bring down Qaddafi, that was the plan to make that a failed state.
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.980]  And this is what we broke down months ago, ISIS came out months ago and said that they
[38:58.980 --> 39:02.880]  were going to do this.
[39:02.880 --> 39:11.120]  As flow west of Hungary trains, 13,000 reach Austria just today, Islam's conquest of Europe,
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.760]  this is but the beginning of what is to come, if Europe does not pull up the drawbridge,
[39:15.760 --> 39:22.320]  but the drawbridge is run by the papa, who's a socialist, who wants world taxes, who wants
[39:22.320 --> 39:30.480]  carbon taxes and who says it's your job to pay for all the illegals.
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.000]  And again, you can just go to YouTube and type in migrants, you've got to put the political
[39:35.000 --> 39:43.240]  correct word in, rob trucks at French ferry, I mean there's just hundreds of these videos,
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.700]  where they had to shut the ferries and shut it all down, because the government was letting
[39:46.700 --> 39:50.440]  them get on the trucks and come in, but oh no, they were robbing the trucks, then there
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.480]  were insurance claims, they were commandeering the trucks.
[39:55.480 --> 40:02.320]  And when you see the arrogance of these people, let's play the cussing and the, delete some
[40:02.320 --> 40:10.120]  of it, and the Allah Akbar chance as they arrive, and this is not being broadcast by
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.360]  the television networks, but it is getting out, Muslim refugees in Budapest, Canada,
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.640]  Allah Akbar and FU, while others in Italy attacked an old lady and threw feces at bystanders
[40:20.640 --> 40:21.640]  in Germany.
[40:21.640 --> 40:22.640]  Let's go to this clip.
[40:22.640 --> 40:49.320]  There is no culture in the West, there is nothing, there is nothing but submission
[40:49.320 --> 40:56.320]  to tyranny, our national anthem, our national symbol is now an aging transvestite, they
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.440]  are openly saying the word father and mother cannot be used in schools nationwide, physical
[41:01.440 --> 41:08.480]  sports are being banned, our total enslavement is here, and then huge third world populations
[41:08.480 --> 41:16.800]  in hardcore streets from street fighting and bazaars are just arriving and conquering.
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.760]  The Germany bans demonstrations by main line parties against the open borders.
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.960]  No free speech for you.
[41:27.960 --> 41:37.040]  Migrant crisis, Pakistan others dumping IDs to become Syrian after the West blew up Syria.
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.360]  Greek island overwhelmed by stranded migrants to spare, island transformed by sudden new
[41:41.360 --> 41:47.080]  population of some 20,000 refugees, AP.
[41:47.080 --> 41:52.200]  The real refugee problem, how to solve it, Ron Paul, stop being an empire, stop meddling
[41:52.200 --> 41:55.520]  in affairs, but that's the globalist plan.
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.880]  Germany faces massive anti-migrant versus pro-migrant standoff amid refugee crisis.
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.920]  White House actively considering approaches to bring in millions of illegals, CNS news
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.360]  from the Middle East, migration of populations versus the individual.
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.920]  That's right, they have rights to come here and have everything paid for, but you don't
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.720]  have a right as an individual not to pay for it.
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.720]  Germany is exploiting refugees suffering to recruit slaves via mass immigration, yes
[42:24.720 --> 42:30.160]  to drive down wages, that's RT breaking it down, that's Le Pen.
[42:30.160 --> 42:34.680]  From this point forward, Christians are going to be banned from holding many jobs in America.
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.160]  The American dream, Michael Snyder, infowars.com, it's now being announced as Christians are
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.480]  arrested all over the place for not submitting.
[42:42.480 --> 42:47.200]  Video, Muslim refugees arriving in Europe makes throat-tutting gesture.
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.640]  I mean, you look at the crazed hatred, because these people are real insecure, they hate
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.240]  the West, a lot of them, now they're really poor, but they're prideful, they feel bad,
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.200]  so all they can do is just go, get it all to me, and then the left shows them and go
[43:01.200 --> 43:05.440]  with paramilitary police and goes, yes, here's your card, here's your welfare, here's your
[43:05.440 --> 43:12.640]  job, we salute you, gate's going down the sacking of Europe, the globalists are evacuating
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.600]  to armored redoubts right now, preparing the global collapse, preparing for the breakdown
[43:16.600 --> 43:17.600]  of society.
[43:17.600 --> 43:23.560]  We're going to go to Paul Watson here in a moment, but my headpiece just broke, so bring
[43:23.560 --> 43:28.960]  me in another one, please, I just unplugged that one on average, on accident, thank you.
[43:28.960 --> 43:35.000]  But as you can see, I'm particularly crazed today, because this is the reality of what's
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.800]  happening, and then I look at all the other news, all the other things that are happening,
[43:40.800 --> 43:45.560]  U.S. demands Greece close airspace to a Russian humanitarian aid for Syria when they're only
[43:45.560 --> 43:50.240]  flying them in food, and Russia's doing us a favor, trying to keep all the refugees
[43:50.240 --> 43:52.760]  from coming here.
[43:52.760 --> 43:57.040]  And by the way, al-Qaida controls two-thirds of the country, roughly, ISIS does, so this
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.760]  is their people now coming in who couldn't beat Assad and couldn't get a couple of the
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.640]  major cities to loot.
[44:03.640 --> 44:08.240]  It's admitted, they're from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, you name it, they're Jihad fighters,
[44:08.240 --> 44:13.680]  and so now they're coming in to the West, and it is going to be fun.
[44:13.680 --> 44:19.840]  Welfare cards, everything free, in the public schools and colleges, beating up your children,
[44:19.840 --> 44:25.080]  and the police will do nothing, it is a gift.
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.880]  It is an absolute gift to be assaulted and attacked if you're in the West by some of
[44:30.880 --> 44:35.240]  these folks, so you will find out how wonderful it is to be a slave.
[44:35.240 --> 44:40.560]  This is the plan, and it's the very same program and plan here as well.
[44:40.560 --> 44:49.000]  Again, 10,000 Chinese women a week come here to the United States to have their babies for
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  free.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.600]  It's advertised in Chinese newspapers and on TV, and CNN says what a great opportunity
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.480]  it is and runs specials about how wonderful it is and how we should do it, really, but
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.760]  the IRS, if you're an American that's Asian or white or Hispanic or black, will take your
[45:03.760 --> 45:10.040]  grandmother's house or will take your house if you get sick and can't pay the taxes or
[45:10.040 --> 45:12.680]  can't pay the local property taxes, they will take it.
[45:12.680 --> 45:15.680]  Where's the compassion for you?
[45:15.680 --> 45:18.960]  Where's the compassion for people that can't pay the five or six tickets they've gotten
[45:18.960 --> 45:23.840]  over the years because they're a single mother, but then the police come and have no refusal
[45:23.840 --> 45:27.400]  weekends or roundup weekends where they come to your house and arrest tens of thousands
[45:27.400 --> 45:36.240]  in each town and take you and fill the jails to suck money out of you.
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.440]  So that's what it comes down to.
[45:38.440 --> 45:45.680]  Then after Paul Watson leaves us, and you know, I'm just bucking around like a bull
[45:45.680 --> 45:48.440]  so much today that I just broke this one too.
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.360]  I've never even done this in all my years on air.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.600]  I'm popping the headpiece out of the plug.
[45:53.600 --> 45:55.800]  I need those fixed.
[45:55.800 --> 45:56.800]  We just won't go to Watson.
[45:56.800 --> 45:57.800]  How's that sound?
[45:57.800 --> 46:00.320]  Because I'm down and I don't have a headpiece.
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.360]  I'm just so fired up that the court is wrapped under here and I just broke another one.
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.720]  I mean, that's how hardcore all of this is getting.
[46:08.720 --> 46:14.000]  That's how serious all of this is getting and it's only going to intensify their announcing
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.760]  executive actions to come after our guns.
[46:18.760 --> 46:23.040]  They are announcing all of these executive actions to come after our families, force
[46:23.040 --> 46:24.340]  inoculations.
[46:24.340 --> 46:25.340]  We are pathetic.
[46:25.340 --> 46:26.340]  We are not men.
[46:26.340 --> 46:27.420]  We are slaves.
[46:27.420 --> 46:34.480]  We have gotten in this position by submitting the tyranny, by doing what we're told.
[46:34.480 --> 46:39.360]  Land of the Free, Home of the Brave is just a bunch of slaves who are absolutely committed
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.160]  to any form of enslavement they're ordered to be under.
[46:43.160 --> 46:50.200]  And that's why we've gotten to this point in this civilization, in this society.
[46:50.200 --> 46:59.320]  Then coming up, a Los Angeles plan to reshape the streetscape sets off fears of gridlock.
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.320]  And they go on to say, what we're trying to do is make congestion so bad you'll have
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.720]  to get out of your car, says James O'Sullivan, founder of Fix the City Group that is planning
[47:08.720 --> 47:12.760]  a lawsuit to stop the plan.
[47:12.760 --> 47:20.000]  But what you are going to do, take two hours or a bus, they haven't given us the options.
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.240]  The City Council has approved a far-reaching transportation plan, would reshape the cityscape
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.880]  of the next 20 years, adding hundreds of miles of bicycle lanes, bus-only lanes, and pedestrian
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.280]  safety features as part of an effort to nudge drivers, that's a key social conditioning
[47:33.280 --> 47:36.080]  word, out from behind the wheel.
[47:36.080 --> 47:41.960]  The major roads are only going to be for Democratic Party own and Rommanual's brother basically
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.160]  owns Uber.
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.720]  The deals have already been made all over the world, where they're going to take existing
[47:45.720 --> 47:48.880]  roads and only let Uber and Google operate on them.
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.720]  So a couple of companies will have the franchise with driverless cars, it's all been announced.
[47:53.720 --> 47:59.040]  And then you will submit to all of it, we're going to Paul Watson in a moment.
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.160]  So this is the draconian plan.
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.880]  This is their operation, and again, space heaters, outdoor stoves, planting a tree, cutting
[48:07.880 --> 48:15.960]  a tree, making a cow pond, building a barn, having your children do chores, having the
[48:15.960 --> 48:18.780]  wrong kind of toilet or light bulbs, the wrong kind of paint.
[48:18.780 --> 48:20.560]  This is the Green Police.
[48:20.560 --> 48:27.600]  This is Agenda 21 World Treaty, to run every facet of your life selectively, where you
[48:27.600 --> 48:33.320]  go bankrupt and only the globalists can operate because they have exemptions to all of it.
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.720]  Or they haven't built in, with their plans and mitigation plans, to only have to submit
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.440]  to part of it.
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.680]  So it's on, single family homes, I told you in the Obama deception, six years ago, seven
[48:46.680 --> 48:49.280]  years ago, would be banned in Europe and the US.
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.080]  They're already being banned in Europe under zoning, you cannot get a permit.
[48:53.080 --> 48:58.840]  And they're now being banned in Seattle and in San Francisco and other areas because they
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.720]  want to charge you more for less.
[49:04.720 --> 49:08.800]  They will fly above the city in helicopters or in aircraft.
[49:08.800 --> 49:11.000]  You will be a slave.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.400]  You will have your resources taken.
[49:13.400 --> 49:21.240]  Paul Watson's going to break down what Pat Buchanan calls, Islam's conquest of Europe.
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.880]  But Europe already committed suicide having 1.3 children on average.
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.240]  But then the criminals that run Europe, they destabilize the Middle East and now bring
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.720]  these people in and to show you little dead kids that have drowned coming out of Libya.
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.160]  When our government did that, they won't show you the hundreds of thousands killed all of
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.840]  the place from Syria to Libya, that the globalists helped murder.
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.560]  But they'll show you an individual child and say, it's your job, even though not a single
[49:47.560 --> 49:52.760]  Middle Eastern country will take a single one of these people.
[49:52.760 --> 49:56.800]  Now before I go to break, I have some very exciting news.
[49:56.800 --> 50:00.960]  I sat out at infowarslives.com, but I'm going to skip this network break because I've held
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.560]  Watson.
[50:03.560 --> 50:11.920]  I have come out going to the main top manufacturers of organic nutraceuticals to not private
[50:11.920 --> 50:14.120]  label but create our own brand.
[50:14.120 --> 50:21.680]  I tell you what, I'm going to show people what I'm talking about right here of knockout.
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.120]  And knockout has 10 different ingredients in it known to have you sleep good, to have
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.840]  good REM sleep, and it's just amazing, it's what we call it, knockout.
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.080]  It's got the hops flour extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile
[50:38.080 --> 50:50.320]  flour extract, L-tryptophan, melatonin, gamba, and other key ingredients known because if
[50:50.320 --> 50:52.560]  you just take melatonin here and there, it'll still work.
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.240]  But if you take it all the time, it doesn't work anymore.
[50:54.240 --> 51:00.920]  You take all this together, amazing sleep, amazing sleep on an airplane, you name it.
[51:00.920 --> 51:06.200]  And your purchase helps fund this operation.
[51:06.200 --> 51:12.000]  Your purchase of knockout that's been sold out for two, three months, we finally got
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.680]  a whole bunch of it in, helps fund this operation.
[51:15.680 --> 51:18.800]  It has amazing reviews on the site.
[51:18.800 --> 51:24.680]  You're not groggy in the morning because it's all natural.
[51:24.680 --> 51:25.840]  It really is amazing.
[51:25.840 --> 51:27.120]  It's a game changer.
[51:27.120 --> 51:32.920]  And your purchase of knockout at infowarslive.com funds this operation.
[51:32.920 --> 51:35.000]  We have supermail vitality.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.480]  We are going to sell out because it's so popular of the liver shield today, then supposedly
[51:39.480 --> 51:40.960]  more comes in in five weeks.
[51:40.960 --> 51:45.760]  We just can't get enough of it because it's made it this top herbology place in Utah
[51:45.760 --> 51:48.520]  that's the top place in the nation.
[51:48.520 --> 51:52.840]  It's just so hard to get the high quality non-GMO, truly organic herbs, and then concentrate
[51:52.840 --> 51:53.840]  them.
[51:53.840 --> 51:56.840]  And the rest of it, the standards are just so high.
[51:56.840 --> 51:59.520]  So liver shield we'll sell out today.
[51:59.520 --> 52:02.720]  We have the deep cleanse, we'll probably sell out this week.
[52:02.720 --> 52:04.680]  We should have more of that in a couple of weeks.
[52:04.680 --> 52:10.240]  So deep cleanse and liver cleanse, infowarslive.com, I want to thank you all for your support

[53:37.960 --> 53:40.320]  Okay, I'm done ranting about that.
[53:40.320 --> 53:44.400]  The Hillary for President t-shirts are also very, very popular.
[53:44.400 --> 53:45.400]  That helps spread the word.
[53:45.400 --> 53:46.400]  So thank you all.
[53:46.400 --> 53:51.400]  Hillary for President, 2016 on the front, on the back, Legalize Freedom, infowars.com.
[53:51.400 --> 53:53.720]  It's a very handsome election shirt.
[53:53.720 --> 53:57.360]  I personally have already worn it out, got a lot of positive comments.
[53:57.360 --> 54:01.920]  I intend to walk around downtown the next few days wearing one and see what folks think
[54:01.920 --> 54:03.920]  about that in some of the trendy areas.
[54:03.920 --> 54:07.840]  And I'm going to ask him if we should put all the gun owners in FEMA camps like we've
[54:07.840 --> 54:11.280]  done already, and the majority of them do say it's time for slave camps.
[54:11.280 --> 54:16.320]  We have it on video, not for slave camps, so very, very serious situation.
[54:16.320 --> 54:20.720]  We're doing Facebook mentions right now as well in here.
[54:20.720 --> 54:25.880]  We're about to go to Paul Joseph Watson, who I appreciate holding.
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.000]  I don't think I've ever been more crazed, more upset, more sure of myself that everything
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.280]  we talked about is now coming true, and that we are in the absolute hands of psychopathic
[54:35.280 --> 54:40.040]  criminals that have a death wish towards the West and the engine of freedom and prosperity
[54:40.040 --> 54:41.640]  and true liberalism.
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.120]  I mean banning father and mother, opening the borders, saying it's our job to pay for
[54:46.120 --> 54:53.880]  any illegal from anywhere in the world, it is just too evil, while all these countries
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.880]  in the Middle East are taking in zero of the people, and it's Saudi Arabia launching the
[54:59.880 --> 55:04.040]  attacks in Libya and Syria that are bringing in the refugees.
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.880]  The very culprits guilty of it, the radical Islamists joke and say, we're doing the city
[55:09.880 --> 55:11.880]  stabilize you two months ago.
[55:11.880 --> 55:18.800]  I mean, pull that up, ISIS says they're sending 500,000 migrants with sleeper cells.
[55:18.800 --> 55:24.280]  That was in the Associated Press two months ago, and now it's here, and the leftist who
[55:24.280 --> 55:30.920]  want voters and divide and conquer and race-based politics are saying we must accept all these
[55:30.920 --> 55:31.920]  people.
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.480]  So Joseph Watson's article is on dredgerport.com, Paul, thank you for joining us.
[55:36.480 --> 55:41.640]  I know you traveled to Czech Republic where they've halted westbound trains just last
[55:41.640 --> 55:45.560]  week to research this yourself, investigative journalist Paul Watson, thank you for coming
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.560]  on with us.
[55:46.560 --> 55:47.560]  Hi, Alex.
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.600]  Yeah, Czech Republic was interesting because they've had the same population for 100 years.
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.240]  They've had the same population of around 10 million since 1910.
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.600]  Now the standard of living is very high, Prague is a very nice city, but the cost of living
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.040]  is still quite low, and they basically are very limited immigration.
[56:08.040 --> 56:14.640]  So all the people you see working in the restaurants and the bars, the mini-marts, the 7-11s, whatever,
[56:14.640 --> 56:19.920]  they're all Czech citizens because they've limited mass immigration, but they still have
[56:19.920 --> 56:21.760]  a thriving economy.
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.880]  So it puts to bed this myth that you need mass immigration just to make an economy work
[56:26.880 --> 56:33.200]  because the housing is quite low, young people can get on the housing ladder, and it's a
[56:33.200 --> 56:36.160]  thriving economy, and it's got low immigration.
[56:36.160 --> 56:37.960]  So again, it completely puts that on the bed.
[56:37.960 --> 56:40.200]  Just like Switzerland, just like Australia.
[56:40.200 --> 56:45.600]  Yeah, but now what we're seeing in Germany, and in fact, Angela Merkel came out in a rare
[56:45.600 --> 56:53.880]  moment of truth yesterday, bearing in mind 800,000 of these, quote, refugees, which we'll
[56:53.880 --> 56:59.000]  talk about in a minute, most of them are even refugees, 800,000 into Germany before the
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.480]  end of this year.
[57:00.480 --> 57:07.200]  This morning they came out and said another 500,000 every single year on top of all their
[57:07.200 --> 57:12.080]  other immigration for an undetermined period way off into the future.
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.840]  One German town, the New York Times reported, went from 1,000 to 3,000 people in one week.
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.880]  One picturesque town with 2,000 North Africans squatting in it.
[57:22.880 --> 57:29.600]  Yeah, so Merkel said, quote, what we are experiencing now is something that will occupy and change
[57:29.600 --> 57:32.040]  our country in coming years.
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.680]  So they're just throwing the gauntlet down, you will be dominated, you will be assimilated,
[57:36.680 --> 57:37.680]  this is insane.
[57:37.680 --> 57:42.640]  Yeah, and then I put out a tweet, there was this German politician, I think he's in the
[57:42.640 --> 57:48.640]  government actually, basically smacking his lips and laughing about how, quote, every year
[57:48.640 --> 57:54.640]  more native Germans die than they are born, and then he goes on to say, oh, that's because
[57:54.640 --> 57:59.040]  the Nazis were really bad at having children, and of course it's not the Nazis, the Nazis
[57:59.040 --> 58:00.640]  were a political party.
[58:00.640 --> 58:03.200]  He's talking about the host German population.
[58:03.200 --> 58:07.080]  Oh yeah, the culture of Germany is now self-hating.
[58:07.080 --> 58:11.760]  When the West set up Hitler, put him in power, the Rockefeller's finance team, he had a
[58:11.760 --> 58:17.480]  peace treaty with England, they set the Germans up, 20 million Germans died, terrible, the
[58:17.480 --> 58:21.720]  Nazis were horrible, but the truth is, the Germans fought the whole world, nobody's ever
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.160]  fought that hard.
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.320]  The Russians were almost on par with them, and that's a disgraceful, self-hating, dirtbag,
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.560]  filth piece of crap, who hates Western culture.
[58:32.560 --> 58:49.840]  Hey there, Paul, we'll be right back, infowars.com, 110% pro-level.

[59:51.720 --> 01:00:05.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.360]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.360]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.480]  Americans and Westerners have been more free than other nations because we were willing
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.920]  to fight for basic human freedom and we didn't have pure monopolies.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.920]  We started breaking those up 500 to 60 years ago or so.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.680]  That's why the globalists who are monopoly men and mainly Europeans seek to pull up the
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.040]  ladder that's made the technology and the wealth that's helped the planet.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.840]  Many wonderful cultures around the world, but the most impoverished, collapsing, barbarous,
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.960]  anti-politically correct countries in the world are now being brought in and told, keep
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]  your culture.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.680]  The West has to give its laws a fair, open culture up.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.760]  For the rest of this segment and the next, as Paul Watson helped for 20 minutes earlier
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.000]  while I was ranting, I'm going to shut up and give my eloquent colleague the floor.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.960]  Paul, spend four minutes on what's coming up.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.880]  You will host the next 12 minutes because I want you to lay all your intel out.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.600]  But I mean, do you not feel in your bones the ancient feeling of being overwritten,
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.320]  being enslaved, being conquered with these globalist, socialist, smacking their lips?
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.720]  I mean, does it not physically animate you?
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:34.480]  Well, precisely because the only countries that get mass multiculturalism imposed on
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.120]  them are white Western countries.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.640]  It's racist not to celebrate the cultures of other countries, but it's also racist to
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.960]  celebrate your own culture.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.640]  In fact, in Sweden, they basically now say that if you don't embrace these other cultures,
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.160]  if you do celebrate your own inherent culture, that's racist.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.640]  People have been charged with hate crimes, have been critical of Islam.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.800]  Also in the UK, Paul West and the leader of Liberty GB, he was arrested on the street
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.760]  for reading out a Winston Churchill quote.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.640]  You've got Tommy Robinson, who's basically the British version of Pamela Geller, merely
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.840]  planning to attend a meeting about having a draw Mohammed cartoon contest put back in
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840]  prison by police to prevent him from doing that.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.120]  So merely, you know, the thought crime of planning to offend Muslims gets you scooped
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  up by the police.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.880]  And then again, look at what's happening in Germany.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.160]  There's a school in Germany that's situated right next to a migrant camp.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.080]  The head teacher wrote a letter to the parents of the teenage girls at that school saying,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:45.280]  you're not allowed to wear miniskirts because that might offend the migrants and lead to
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.640]  them attacking you and raping you.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.720]  So again, we have to adapt to them.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.800]  They don't have to adapt to us.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.800]  And these barbarous behaviors, which we talked about in the last segment, are going to be
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.640]  imposed upon us.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.360]  And in fact, people on Twitter contacted me today saying, yeah, I live in Germany.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:10.120]  My family says they're telling the teen girls there at schools not to wear shorts because
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.280]  they might offend migrants that are moving into the area.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.160]  So again, it's all about their culture being imposed on us.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.960]  And literally, there are German politicians saying, you know, that the Nazis didn't have
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.200]  enough children.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.760]  Now the German people are dying out as if that's a good thing, as if that's a reason
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.480]  why they need to admit 800,000 more migrants into the country.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.760]  So again, going back to the major point is European citizens have spent the last two
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.320]  years voting against mass immigration.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.160]  We've seen it in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and other countries, again, threatening
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.240]  the power base of the European Union.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.400]  So they rejected mass multiculturalism on a widespread basis, and it was even rejected
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.880]  by people like Cameron and Merkel two, three years ago.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.240]  So the EU just blows up the Middle East.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  So the Middle East.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240]  Go ahead.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240]  No, go ahead.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.920]  I'm saying they bring it in via the back door, via this migrant crisis, which has been launched
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.360]  on photo ops that are completely misleading, which we can talk about after the break.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.880]  And now 90% of the individuals in some of these areas that are coming in from these
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.480]  migrant countries claim they're Syrian.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:34.400]  90% of them don't have documents to prove that they're Syrian.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.600]  So God knows how many of these individuals aren't even legitimate Syrian migrants in
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]  the first place.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.840]  If it's not a majority now, it seems to be common majority.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.160]  Now they've rolled out the red carpet.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.520]  So you had the ISIS threat a few days ago.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.680]  Syrian citizens have been arrested in ad posts every single day.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.000]  Stay there, Paul.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Paul can't hear me.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  We're going to come back with Paul.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.200]  This is Key N Teller.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.000]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.080]  This is being reported by WorldNet Daily.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.080]  ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.280]  to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.560]  a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.640]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.160]  crosses in public, or even ring church bells.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.080]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.400]  by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.440]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.680]  to fund groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.920]  Whether it's airdropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars' worth of vehicles
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.520]  that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520]  somewhere.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:01.200]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:41.040]  I have been so incredibly upset by watching the globalist clearly launch a worldwide offensive
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:49.400]  against families, against private wealth, against private property, and against justice
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:56.400]  and justice.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.080]  West went in the last five years, destabilized Africa, destabilized the Middle East, tried
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:08.600]  to kick out our allies in Egypt, tried to take down Assad, took out Qaddafi, Saudi Arabia
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.680]  funded a radical Jihad invasion to radicalize the entire area.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.680]  Al Qaeda two months ago said, all over the news, we pulled the articles up last hour,
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.000]  we're going to send 500,000 quote migrants, using the political correct term, to your
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.760]  countries and inside of them send Jihadists.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.960]  Then when they attack, which they started doing, those Western countries can take the
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:41.240]  general public's liberties at checkpoints and at the TSA-style facilities in the name
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.800]  of protecting you.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  And now we just showed the headlines last hour, German newspapers, don't wear shorts
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.800]  or many skirts in public, you may make the migrants unhappy.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.520]  Oh, these people that are here illegally, that are carjacking things and taking over
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.040]  ferries and trucks and raping and killing people, oh, you don't like it?
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.920]  That my wife's wearing a short skirt?
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.400]  Go to hell.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.200]  Oh, you don't like, see, and it's the left pushing all this.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.680]  Oh, be inclusive, give up your rights because you hurt someone else.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.240]  And they know if they can tell us, don't say the word boy or girl or father or mother or
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240]  husband or wife.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.320]  See, first a few years ago it was in government documents, now it's in colleges, it's in schools
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.920]  and it's in colleges now, if you say, yeah, my wife and I are going to dinner tonight,
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.120]  whoa, that might hurt somebody, you should have a word wife because you have a wife,
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.280]  you're bad.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.840]  And you go, who are these people living in the lap of luxury, the lap of laissez-faire
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.680]  liberalism, true liberalism that lets them live like this, saying you're going to accept
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.440]  radical Muslims in your town because they hate the West.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:00.280]  The socialists have combined with giant third world populations, same things happening here
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.880]  with open borders, to bring the country and the world down.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:11.200]  This is a set plan, and I want to play the clip from the article that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:18.560]  Paul Joseph Watson's article, of course, originates at PrismPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.240]  And there's other videos, Muslim refugees arriving in Europe makes cut the throat to
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.600]  the cameraman, there's this crazed look of hate.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:30.560]  And then we have the other video, Muslim refugees chant Allah Akbar, F-U, attack citizens, throw
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.960]  feces.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.400]  This is it, and if they can get millions of illegals here a year and millions into Europe,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:43.800]  800,000 so far this year in Germany alone, the sky is the bloody limit.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.080]  And it's not just bring in people and then put them on welfare, it's say to the public,
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:55.320]  you must submit to them.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.600]  Now let's go ahead, and again, it's like this weird twisted radical Islamic thing with a
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.360]  socialist icing where they're all entitled and angry and you're going to give me everything,
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.440]  it's so sick.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.560]  Let's go ahead now and go to this clip of them screaming Allah Akbar and the cuss words
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:38.560]  are cut out, here it is.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:53.920]  Alright now we have another one of a large crowd saying it and F bombs and F everybody
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.160]  and throwing feces, but we can't play it because there's so many F words that it would just
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.720]  be unintelligible, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, if we did this.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:12.240]  But imagine in major cities hundreds of thousands in your town, in small towns double your number
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.960]  running around screaming demanding everything and then just beating people up, carjacking
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.360]  with the loving liberal media going how dear, how sweet, behave yourself, roll out the red
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.560]  carpet and the same things being done here and Donald Trump says there's a lot of criminals
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.400]  fleeing justice in Latin America coming up here which is a fact and they're like how
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.960]  dare you, how dare you not take force inoculations, how dare you use the word mother or father,
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.000]  how dare you have a fireplace, how dare you have the wrong light bulbs, how dare you have
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.320]  the wrong toilet, how dare you spank your children, how dare you go to church, how dare you not
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:57.240]  fill out the gay marriage license, how dare you, how dare you and you know the brother
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.080]  of Madonna came out who's gay and the gay rights activists said man this is real tyranny,
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.360]  some other clerk would do that.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.920]  We need to let people have their religious views, he goes it's weird, he goes no one
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.920]  makes Muslims take their headdresses off when they fly and everybody else has to and he
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.360]  goes this is the country that allows people to be free, what's going on here?
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.520]  We have to let someone for their religious views do something like that because you know
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:30.360]  there are gay people out there that aren't tyrants but why does the gay community want
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.120]  to teach our five-year-olds how to be girls of their boys and because it's all just psychological
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.200]  warfare, it's all setting the precedent, you can do whatever you want however you want.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.880]  Now Paul Watson you got six minutes in this segment, six in the next, you've got the floor,
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.000]  I want you to start over and break down how huge this is but undoubtedly do you concur
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.400]  with me that the globalist on financial collapse, economic warfare, open borders, globalism
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.720]  they have decided because their programs failing to just drop the hammer with total
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.600]  criminality, the pope lecturing everyone to take illegals into your homes but he won't
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.000]  take them into his home, I mean they are making their move Paul, if we take in eight hundred
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.520]  thousand in just nine months into Germany alone, three million into Europe, half a million
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.960]  in the UK this year we know of, it sets the precedent and then encourages the next wave,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.080]  the last wave was a couple hundred thousand, now it's millions.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.560]  The next is going to be ten millions and the police stand down as they take over the trains,
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.040]  as they take over the ships, everyone salutes, loads them on and brings them in and the Germans
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.840]  are do as you are told, submit to them, I mean this is getting insane, Paul Watson what
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.520]  is going on, break it down.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.760]  Well why are governments inviting these quote migrants in, why are they rolling out the
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.000]  red carpet, it's because they know once they sell and they're talking about eight hundred
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.600]  thousand, just by the end of this year in Germany, five hundred thousand every year
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.240]  after that, by the time they settle down, become naturalized citizens, they have children
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:08.000]  who become naturalized citizens, you create a huge voting block which votes for a bigger
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  welfare state.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.400]  And they have six kids on average, I mean let's just talk about the facts.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.840]  Yeah, which is promoted by these left wing governments so that's why it's in their interest
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.560]  to bring in huge numbers of people who have no concept of freedom, have no concept of
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:29.480]  treating women as first class citizens, have no concept of civic responsibility, they just
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.320]  want the welfare money, that's why they're not staying in countries like Hungary, like
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.440]  Italy, because they're not showering them with free cash, they're fleeing to Sweden,
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.800]  they're fleeing to Germany, they'll soon be fleeing to the United Kingdom, because they're
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.180]  going to get free money which again proves that they're not refugees, the definition
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:54.160]  of a refugee is fleeing from danger, these people are already in safe countries, they're
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:00.360]  economic migrants, take the young Syrian boy that drowned for example, which was obviously
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.920]  tragic, but that has been completely embellished, twisted and manipulated for political propaganda
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.320]  to say oh we have to have feelings and allow all these people in.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.160]  They took that boy and basically dressed him up, flattened down his hair, moved him from
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.280]  one place which wasn't photogenic because he was stuck underneath a rock, put him on
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:28.560]  the beach, took pictures of him there, took pictures of him in other places, his family
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.320]  was already in Turkey, they weren't coming from Syria, they were already safe in Turkey,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.760]  they were fleeing as economic migrants, so yes it's incredibly tragic, but why are we
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.720]  being manipulated to think that this young boy died as a result of the West immigration
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:51.180]  laws, when his family was safe, relatively wealthy for the region, they had relatives
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:58.200]  in Canada as well, and they staged the body so they could get the best photo for the emotional
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]  manipulation of the news.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.200]  Just like the babies and the incubators.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:07.960]  Yeah, they always used dead kids to rest their propaganda on, then you had the guy and his
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:13.480]  wife and young child in Hungary, you know they were on the train tracks wailing and crying,
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:18.680]  we saw those photos in the newspapers, what you didn't see in the video moments before
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:24.240]  that was that he physically pushed his wife and kids onto the rail track to create that
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.480]  photo op of look at these poor desperate immigrants when he created that situation with the police
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.920]  in the first place, so they're being completely manipulated, and again 90% of these migrants
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.200]  are claiming to be Syrian and they can't prove it, you've got Syrians coming out in the New
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:48.040]  York Times today, who said an actual Syrian migrant, I am Syrian, a real Syrian, here
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:53.120]  we have Pakistanis, Afghanis, Iraqis they all throw away their papers and claim to be Syrian,
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:59.000]  so they're finding all these discarded ID cards from Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in places
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.360]  like Macedonia, because they're not refugees, they're economic migrants, they're not fleeing
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:10.400]  from ISIS, they're not fleeing from war or persecution, they're fleeing to get benefits
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.120]  and to get a higher standard of living, which we're going to have to pay for as tax payers,
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:23.760]  while Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Q8, United Arab Emirates take zero, zero refugees despite
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:28.560]  many of those countries being directly involved in funding and arming the jihadist rebels
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.760]  in Syria who went on to join ISIS that caused this problem in the first place, so it's
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.720]  all about imposing this on the West, the European governments have rolled out the red carpet
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.920]  to get that power back in the hands of the EU, because the EU is being rejected continent
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.720]  wide for the past three or four years.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.560]  That's right, stay there, these people being brought in are nothing but socialist mercenaries
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:57.400]  in the clowered, driven strategy and it just shows you the hardcore evil, evil of the people

[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.800]  What happened this morning, Alex Jones here back live, is I stayed up last night doing
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800]  research.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:17.480]  I was up till like 11 with buckly shooting videos and then I was up till about one doing
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.480]  research.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.360]  Then I got up again this morning and looked at all the news and I read this LA Times article
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.160]  where they just flat out say we're going to close half the roads and only let robot cars
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160]  on them.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  I know the whole back story of that.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.240]  So it's not just they're going to close the roads.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.720]  I know the whole story and how Rahm Emanuel's brothers making billions off of it and how
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.400]  it's all a scam and we're just being conquered.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.600]  I mean if they can foist Obamacare on us owned by foreign banks to double and triple prices,
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.240]  well of course they're going to just bring in giant hordes of illegals.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:56.080]  I mean I used to hear six, seven years ago the right wing clanded Muslims were telling
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.920]  British people to not have their women wear dresses or whatever that were above the knee
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.880]  and now I've basically been in England and seen it for myself.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:13.920]  It's that Westerners are so passive now and so wimpy that foreigners just literally think
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.200]  we're here to serve them.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.680]  I've been in England before just videotaping Big Bend.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.880]  This is actually on tape and this guy comes over, Muslim guy in his carless family gets
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.560]  out and says don't tape me.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]  What are you doing taping me?
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.720]  And I guess he thought I was going to cower down and I just started yelling at him.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720]  I told him go to hell.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.200]  He said I'll do whatever I want.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.280]  But it's just Paul you live in England, you live under this.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.880]  I'm not even against these people except they've been encouraged and pushed that we somehow
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880]  owe them.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.880]  It's the entitlement.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.840]  I can't go to Saudi Arabia and get something free.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.080]  If I go preach the gospel there I'll be executed.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:55.160]  Why is it that the people running us hate our tolerance and that we're so good, tell
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.960]  us we're so bad.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.200]  I'm not even upset now when I watch MSNBC criticizing America and saying how bad we
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.280]  are and how bad Christians are.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.840]  I just realized they're the most evil collaborating filth I've ever seen in my life.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.200]  I mean who are these people Paul Watson?
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.680]  I didn't know they stacked crap that high.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:13.680]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:19.440]  Well, they're control freaks and they know that if they bring in these hordes of immigrants
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.320]  who don't cherish liberty, have no history of it, have no interest in defending it, then
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.160]  they will vote for big government parties.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.040]  So they will collect more power in the hand of these leftist, collectivist parties the
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.280]  more of these people they bring in.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.760]  People who have done the math with this Germany situation say that once these half a million
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:46.400]  asylum seekers every single year are brought in, within a few decades they're going to
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.760]  have like a quarter of the German population is going to be immigrants and sons and daughters
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.760]  of immigrants.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.320]  They're creating a huge voting block for these big government parties who are just going
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.560]  to vote for bigger and bigger government.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.920]  And then big business loves it as well, of course, because they can get the cheap labor,
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.440]  they can drive down the wages of everybody else, so it benefits them in that way.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.320]  And then you've got a situation with the media where it's all, oh, look at these poor Syrian
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.120]  families and these children, and undoubtedly some of them are, but they're not showing
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.280]  any of these videos.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.000]  They're not talking about how on the border of Italy and Austria a couple of days ago,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.240]  these migrants were yanking old ladies out of a car to steal the car so they could get
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240]  to Germany.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.000]  Paul, Paul, we're going to do this, I've asked the crew to do it, but we're so busy
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  we haven't.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.680]  There are hundreds of videos at the tunnel and at the ferries from France with the robbing,
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.720]  the stealing, the carjacking, the beating, and the arrogant crazy-eyed hatred of these
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.480]  illegals, instead of feel bad, which I'm not saying they should and feel like they're not
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.400]  culturally dominant or they're not wealthy, instead there's a hate of the West, you can
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.160]  see it in a lot of their eyes.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.920]  And most of the immigrants I've seen so far from the Middle East are pretty cool, hard-working
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.440]  folks in my experience.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:09.320]  This is a new wave, you live in it every day, why is it so different?
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:15.120]  Because they've not been assimilated, it's been so overwhelming, I mean in the UK net
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:22.040]  migration is now 300,000 a year, this is a tiny island country with 60 million population
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.800]  and it's going so fast, there's no chance to assimilate them.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.160]  So inevitably they move into these Muslim ghettos and then you get a situation like
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.920]  you've got in Sweden where since the 70s when they swung their doors wide open, rapes
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:42.800]  are up 1400%, you get ambulances, fire trucks travelling into these Muslim ghettos areas,
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.520]  they have to leave because they just get pelted with stones and attacked.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:51.160]  So you get this increasing balkanization because there's no time for them to assimilate into
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:56.280]  the culture and their own leaders are basically committing national suicide and saying you
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.280]  don't have to assimilate, there's no planning to assimilate.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.640]  And it's being done as a socialist fetish to mutilate the West, they really hate the
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.040]  West, liberals really want their daughters gang rape and sexually mutilated with bags
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.880]  on their heads, Gloria Steinem, all these people are literally the scum of the earth
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880]  and enemies.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:21.600]  I mean I'm sorry, they really are, they really are consciously evil Paul and the opposite
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.600]  of liberals.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.000]  How do we stop these fascist Satanists, I don't know what you call them, let me come
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  back.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  I mean these people are the enemy.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.160]  Final segment, Paul Lewis, five more minutes, Hugh Shard is coming in with breaking news,
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.480]  I'm settling down some now, I mean I haven't even covered the news yet, it is just the
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.440]  robot cars are coming, it's all been announced, they're going to tax you by the model, raise
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.960]  your insurance, re-came and have a car, they're going to take all your jobs away, I mean it's
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  just hellish.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:59.880]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:05.200]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of eight being killed and 46 being wounded,
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.600]  July 4th of this year we had reports of nine dead and 53 wounded, and let us not forget
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:16.240]  July 4th of last year we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:21.560]  And these are not nationwide stats, all of these numbers come from the city of Chicago,
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:26.480]  the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, which is to say if criminals
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.240]  expect you to be unarmed, they're more likely to attack you, not to mention the fact that
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.240]  much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity, meaning that for all the gun
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.660]  buybacks and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:47.800]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once, but
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.200]  that's why you have a second amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:59.400]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.360]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:31.160]  Shooter Jennings bringing us in, he made this music, and partly for us, Stephen King did
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.240]  the voiceovers, and it's in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240]  Really great.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:44.880]  That's a good film, but I'd like to use some of his music in another upcoming film.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.240]  Well, we can now see the clear plan to bring down the last and the rest of the world.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.400]  I'm not against the third world, I want to help the third world, so I'm fighting carbon
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.840]  taxes that will kill a billion people in the next decade, many estimates show.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.040]  And as the third world collapses, as I've been telling you for years, huge migrant waves
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.680]  will hit and will be used to destabilize things further.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.800]  Then in the next phase, they're going to build armored walls around and not let these people
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.800]  in.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.920]  They're only bringing in enough to checkmate the voting blocks and create bulkization
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.160]  to management strategy.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.680]  Then once that's done, you're going to see mega plagues hit the third world and more
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.360]  than 80% of them will be killed.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:29.320]  I'd rather industrialize folks, get their birth rate down to 1.5 like it is in the West
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.200]  or 2.1 replacement rate, and it's all living peace.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.520]  That's not the globalist plan.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.640]  I am a worldwide expert on it.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.360]  I've made films, I've written books, I've interviewed all the experts.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.640]  This is not hyperbole.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.160]  We didn't tune into a science fiction movie.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160]  We know what's coming.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.200]  We told you fourth denoculation was coming.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.200]  It's here.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.160]  We told you robot cars taking over the roads, and half the roads being given to them at
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.160]  first.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.280]  It's been announced today.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:57.520]  We told you all of this.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.960]  We told you the Chinese would start dumping treasury nodes.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.880]  I'm going to be covering that in the next hour.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  That's happening.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.840]  I'm not bragging.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.060]  There's a major conservative dissent brewing inside the Vatican now that the Vatican is coming
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:16.520]  out basically promoting abortion, global government, and communism, and carbon taxes.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.520]  It is an epic time.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:24.040]  I want to get Paul Watson's final comments on this, but just to see these governments
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:28.440]  against the will of the people, Europe's voted 80-plus percent across the board to stop
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:33.560]  bringing in huge numbers of illegals.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.640]  They're attacking police everywhere.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:39.040]  They're burning down major cities, but it's the same stratagem here with inner city blacks
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.400]  and other, quote, minorities getting foundation manipulated to do the same thing, or they'll
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.480]  use white supremacists, extremists, if they're the majority in an area of Ukraine to overthrow
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.640]  the government there.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.840]  It's outside globalists using whatever social problems they've got to do that.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:36:03.280]  I mean, it's like I'm not against pro-Western, historically pro-German, Western Ukrainians.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.040]  I get that the Russians did bad stuff to them, that's Lenin and Stalin did.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.040]  It doesn't matter.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.320]  When food sorrows comes in and manipulates you, it puts you in power to bring your whole
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.320]  country down.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320]  I'm against it.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.720]  I mean, it doesn't mean I don't get the other cultural issues.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.600]  I tried to stop the takedown of the Middle East when they kicked out Mubarak and all
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.600]  these other leaders that were working with us, and then they started blowing up all the
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.520]  churches and sending giant hordes of illegals in.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.760]  Egypt's been out loud with the U.S. for 36 years.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.480]  They now work with the Russians.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.920]  We lost Egypt.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.200]  They were able to throw the Al-Qaeda forces out, and Egypt so freaked out they got all
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:46.000]  the documents that Obama, through his cousin, was running the operations.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.040]  Obama's not just some guy watching ESPN, folks, so let's get that straight.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.600]  I used to think he was more of a front man.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.000]  No, he's a mastermind, like Lex Luthor or something.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.560]  I mean, this is like a comic book villain type stuff we're seeing.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.920]  This is the kind of stuff you'd imagine, you know, Cobra Commander and Destro would pull.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.800]  But you gotta realize that's art imitating life.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.040]  This is what's happened before, historically.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:13.000]  I want to get Paul Watson's final comments before we shift gears into some other news,
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.400]  the economic news, you name it.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400]  The numbers are in.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:23.880]  China, in a month alone, dumped 94 billion in U.S. treasuries in one month.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:28.800]  Golden argues real figure might have been 115 billion.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:33.400]  I mean, man.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:39.520]  Let's go to Anthony Guciardi to get his take on the open borders, on what's happening.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.040]  You've got family in Italy, you've, I didn't even tell you I was on a spring, you want
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.720]  to share with them what it's like living at the hands of the Precious Illegals?
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:52.800]  Well, I think people are losing their sanity and I understand the humanitarian part of
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.920]  it saying I want to help all these people because they're starving or whatever and they've
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920]  been oppressed.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920]  I understand all that.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.920]  But we've lost our sanity, I think, when we start saying just open all the borders and
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.120]  let everyone in because, yes, I do have family in Italy and they tell me that one of the
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:11.760]  biggest things there is the gypsies and they live in a nice house in Rome area, but they
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.840]  had to put bars on all their windows because when they would leave or in the middle of
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.080]  the night, they would either throw bricks through the windows and try to get in and
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.720]  steal any electronic they could or they use tactics like this is horribly messed up, but
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.080]  they'll have a kid and they'll like burn the kid on purpose so the kid has a real bad
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.560]  burn on his arm or something and say, hey, please, will you help my child, please help
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.440]  my child and then you let them into your house and they basically just beat you up and take
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  your stuff.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.440]  I want to fix your earpiece.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:42.320]  So there is a lot of insanity out there and people forget, unfortunately, history.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.320]  They forget history and they also forget that people have a large degree of evil that they
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.640]  can do as well because we feel bad for all of these people.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.640]  I'm sure they're great.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]  I'm sure they're...
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640]  No other country does this.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.720]  The West because it's Christian does and the socialists are laughing at us because they're
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.240]  allied with these groups.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  It's like that new...
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:01.760]  I'm not going to have a bunch of radical Muslims run around and try to attack my daughters
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:07.360]  and then go, thank you, while the feminists stand around going, good, I mean, it's sick.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.800]  This new show on Netflix called Narcos is actually really good.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:14.120]  It's about Pablo Escobar and basically they figure out, well, selling all these drugs
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.640]  in Colombia doesn't make much money.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.560]  If we just destroy the United States and bring it to Miami, we'll make so much more money
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.520]  and those stupid gringos, they'll let us come in there and do anything we want.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.520]  They won't even check us.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.520]  They'll, we just walk across the border and that's how he was making $40 million a day
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.120]  because they realized they could jack the prices up, sell it to the stupid Americans
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.600]  and just bring in truckloads if they would just pad their suits with it.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600]  Sure.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.000]  I mean, I'll say this, give Europe and the West, because I don't like seeing any country
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  destroyed.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:49.160]  And I feel for the Japanese with their reactors melting down, but if Japan went totally radioactive
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.040]  and was uninhabitable, I'd say let, you know, 20% of the Japanese come over here and then
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.640]  other people take them because they've got jobs.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:57.640]  They want to work hard.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.560]  They want to assimilate.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:04.600]  We can't take people from first, from old world, third world, third world countries where
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.160]  they were in dirt villages and you chop women's genitals off.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.560]  We can't take 50 million of them.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.320]  Well, I've seen the African immigrants to different countries and they have signs like
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.320]  get rid of your law.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.760]  We want special privileges.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  We want welfare.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.760]  We want all this stuff.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.920]  It's like, they're not even coming in and saying, hey, can we please come to your country?
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.800]  They're like, give us everything now.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.800]  That's the attitude.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.720]  They're coming in saying, hey, we'll do whatever will work as much as we, no, no, you ruined
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.720]  us.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.720]  We want everything you have.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:29.720]  That's the attitude.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.120]  And that's the whole liberal sales job that the West ruined them when it was globalist
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.600]  corporations that are ruining everything and they're the ones screwing us over.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  That's right.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.960]  We've lost our sanity as a country, as a society, as a planet.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:45.040]  We've completely lost our sanity and we're going to pay for it.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.920]  Well, the elite are committing suicide.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.480]  They think they're suiciding the West.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.520]  They think they're getting rid of the latter where middle class could come up and new elites
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.520]  could threaten them.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:56.520]  They think they're sewing things up with an age of ignorance when they're in basically
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.000]  Elysium bases, offshore, underground, and in controlled reservations.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.560]  They're not going to be immune from this.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.560]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.360]  And it's not helping the third world.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:13.280]  And if they had like some type of free hydrogen power base, you could give money nationally
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.880]  to build reactors in Africa and have real programs and entrepreneur programs to go over
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.760]  there and build up Africa and then make money with these people.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  I'd be all for it.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]  Yeah.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  Why don't they push that?
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.840]  Why is it that all these immigrants seem to be accepted by every other country?
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.960]  Why can't we actually perform industry in places like Africa, different Africa?
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.200]  Because globalism doesn't allow that.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.840]  If they keep them in squalor, they'll never develop and you get everything cheap.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.360]  It's totally cutthroat.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:41.600]  The globalists know to go with the most evil plan they can, just exempt themselves and
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.840]  they'll win.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.680]  That's why whatever the worst, most evil thing is they'll do it.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.320]  I mean, I say the new world order for 25 years, 23 intensely, 20 on air.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.040]  And Anthony, I just cannot believe how they got it all thought out.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.960]  Then I'll read a book by Brzezinski or somebody and I'm reading stuff and I know what the
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.800]  next paragraph is going to be because I've already studied it so much.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.840]  I'm like in their head.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.640]  They admit all this.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.840]  Brzezinski wrote a book admitting how our government funded the Kermair Rouge to call
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.040]  30% of the public.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.040]  He made a joke.
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:17.400]  He goes, but I can't get in trouble because I had the Kermair Rouge did it and giggles.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.400]  Basically in the article.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.280]  I mean, it's just like, why?
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  The debate is over.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.240]  I mean, we're all arguing about tax rates and all this kind of stuff as the major corporations
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240]  pay no tax.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.880]  They get everything made in China in places with suicide nets because the workers want
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.960]  to kill themselves for being paid one penny a day like Apple using Foxconn.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.800]  And then we are told that we're bad and that we need to let all the immigrants in and pay
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]  for them.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.440]  And we're horrible people as they lured over us and laugh at us.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.440]  Don't pay tax.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.480]  Steve Jobs was a complete monster and wanted slave labor and wouldn't let his kids have
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.760]  iPads and admitted it was a brain damage to the public.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:51.480]  Got a kid and paid the woman $500 after trying to sewer and welfare.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.960]  It's just so such insanity.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.880]  They would spend months in deposition to start out to pay some money, money.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.880]  Yeah, like $500.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  And he's worth billions.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.880]  I mean, these people.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.520]  But then we're bad though.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.520]  We're the bad ones.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.640]  And it's okay though because that the Rockefellers and the Gettys would have pay phones in their
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.560]  houses and wouldn't let their guests use a telephone.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.880]  But then we're not paying enough Warren Buffett basically pays nothing.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.480]  And then lobbies all day to have taxes raised, but he's exempt.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480]  Yeah.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.560]  And this is a monster pig.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.120]  He is a monster demon.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.840]  But do you see they turned the debate around on us though?
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.080]  Because now Alex, you're bad because you don't want to let immigrants flood into your country
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.480]  and you're bad because I mean, I want skilled immigrants.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.000]  I don't care what color somebody is, but man, let me tell you, radical Islam is telling
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.720]  me my wife's got to wear a hood overhead and can't drive a car and my kids, you know, have
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:40.720]  to do what they say.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.080]  And I can't listen to rock and roll if I want, blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:48.640]  And it's the left promoting these people coming in, but the left tells me I can't say boy
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640]  or girl.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640]  Right.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.640]  I mean, it's freakish.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640]  It's freakville.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.760]  And they disregard their moral obligations to help these people in ways that matter, which
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.200]  we just covered that'll never be done.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.680]  But notice the debate is not about that.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.040]  It's not about why don't we bring industry to Africa?
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.600]  It's why are we bad?
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:07.240]  They flip the debate 100% and they've succeeded in doing so and you're highlighting her right
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.240]  now.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.240]  They have turned it on us.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.360]  It's about Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360]  Incredible job.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.840]  It's incredible that you get back to writing articles and covering things.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.000]  Other tidbits of this we haven't covered.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.960]  Is there any way most countries didn't vote to be part of the EU?
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.440]  The UK didn't get to vote.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.640]  You got major buildup to have a vote, get out of the EU.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.520]  The EU is going into total tyranny.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.320]  They're admitting in mainstream news the telegraph today that the EU is using this to become a
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.120]  super state and remove any sovereignty and to become a dictatorship.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.160]  So we see that the end game of this, is there any way to stop it?
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.120]  I mean, can't people in government in Europe just stop complying?
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.240]  Why do the leftists that control government enjoy destroying themselves?
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.240]  I don't understand it.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.800]  I think it's actually a kind of fetish, Alex.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:58.200]  I mean, we've had this term cook-servative over the past couple of months.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.360]  This is political cook-holding.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.720]  If you look into that, I don't want to get into it too deeply because it's probably not
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.720]  family-friendly.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]  But I think it's...
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]  No, it is.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.720]  It's a form of domination.
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:08.720]  It is a sick fetish.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:09.720]  It's funny you said that.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.440]  But I think why the solutions?
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.560]  The good news is the most recent poll for the first time has found that the majority
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.440]  of British citizens are going to vote to get out of the EU.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.520]  Past three years, we've had massive rejection of the EU.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.120]  If that continues, we're going to get control back over our national border and immigration
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.600]  policies to a greater extent.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.320]  So that's good news if we can carry on that course.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.600]  Geopolitically, let's stop overthrowing secular governments in the Middle East and replacing
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:45.120]  them with jihadist radical Islamists, which is what caused this refugee crisis in the
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  first place.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:47.600]  How about that for a good idea?
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.320]  And then domestically, it's just about, I'm not ashamed to be proud of where I was born
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320]  and where I come from.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.960]  I'm not ashamed of the Enlightenment.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.200]  I'm not ashamed of the Industrial Revolution.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.400]  I'm not ashamed of the Magna Carta.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.800]  I'm not ashamed of freedom and liberty.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.640]  So it's just about reasserting those principles, voting on those principles while we've still
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:10.800]  got the chance to do it in the face of these mass hordes of migrants that are going to
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.520]  vote for bigger government.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.440]  And the solution lies in that.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:20.200]  So there's still hope yet, but obviously, you know, you had Paulson the other day.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.120]  You should probably play the video.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.480]  Wealth inequality is what has caused much of this unrest, not only in America, but across
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.480]  the world.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480]  He was laughing.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.840]  He was up at a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg and these other CEOs saying, we increase the
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.840]  wealth gap.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.120]  We increase wealth inequality while laughing his head off at it.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:41.080]  So again, they're bragging about it.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.040]  They're laughing about it, as you said.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.000]  So it's about pointing out who's behind it, voting to reject this EU tyranny, which is
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.400]  brought in this imposed multiculturalism.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:54.920]  And eventually, I think there's just going to be a clash of civilizations.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.240]  I think, you know, it might not be for 10, 20, 30 years, but that's the only way it's
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.640]  going to figure itself out in the end, I'm afraid.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.640]  Well, it's a couple of years, Paul, everything is accelerating, things compact historically,
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.960]  but definitely this is going to be an interesting time to be alive.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:16.120]  Last week, I went and saw a film not knowing I'm in it, that's won some Sundance awards
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.120]  and others.
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.880]  It's the best of enemies, William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.720]  And of course, I knew Gore Vidal.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.960]  He was a frequent guest on the show and I didn't agree with a lot of his politics, but he liked
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.760]  the fact that I exposed that 9-11 was an inside job, trying to read him in person six or seven
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.400]  times on radio.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:37.840]  But I tell you, the guy that comes out as a good guy is William F. Buckley in that movie.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.360]  But in it, Gore Vidal's playing a money war and class envy with William F. Buckley in
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.300]  this debate and Buckley's like, you're worth 10 times more money than me.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:48.920]  My family actually made its money.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.920]  You've been given your money.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.000]  I mean, I meant to be said in the actual debate, I went and watched more of it.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.480]  They didn't even show that in the film.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:00.600]  But Buckley's just amazed at all this and he then expands on it.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:08.040]  But Gore Vidal's like, we've got 7% of the public that's got 38% or something like that.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.120]  It was like 6%, 7% has almost 40% of the wealth and that's wrong and we need to redistribute
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.120]  it.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.800]  Well, under the redistribution, we got 1% with like 80% of it.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.840]  But they act like that 1% of these rich people, no, no.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:27.280]  Almost the 1% are worth $150,000, $200,000 a year.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.720]  That's the person that gets their hair done, their nails done, buys a car, buys a boat.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.720]  Those are your restaurant.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.160]  I mean, we want to make that bigger.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160]  It's-
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]  They switched it though.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:41.280]  They switched it that you're bad, not they're bad, not the.001% that actually controls
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  and runs everything.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.280]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.280]  We did the math.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.280]  It's.00000024.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.280]  Right.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.280]  So it's like-
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.160]  They're the ones that have most of the wealth and they're the ones all calling for socialism.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.040]  But you're bad and the plumber that makes $150,000 a year that works 16 hours a day.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.280]  He's got four guys working for him, took him 20 years of quality with the right people
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.280]  to have the clientele.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.280]  Loot his house.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.280]  He's horrible.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.480]  No, it's all a distraction.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.480]  Just like the corporations pay no tax, those people, the.000002% or whatever, they don't
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  pay any tax.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.760]  They control tons of stuff.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.680]  They do horrible things and then they make the 1%, which is the plumber that has four
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.680]  people working for him.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:17.680]  It's his family business.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.120]  He's run it for 30 years and he's finally has a little nest egg.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.280]  Loot his house.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.440]  How dare he have money.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  Money can be good.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.800]  Money is what helps other people.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.960]  That's what America was all about.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.320]  It's why you want to come here.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.400]  Now it's not.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.680]  Paul Watson, great job.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.520]  We will continue to see your reports at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.800]  Your latest report is on drudgerport.com.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.840]  Good to have you back from your investigation.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  Godspeed.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.640]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.240]  There goes Paul, Joseph Watson.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.040]  More and more, I just had him ride shotgun where we go back and forth.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.200]  I talk five minutes, he talks five minutes and that's why I'm getting more of you guys,
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.880]  the riders in here on the air.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.240]  You've got some health news we're going to get to in the next break.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.960]  We got McAfee popping in.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.960]  I talked to him last night.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.720]  He's an interesting announcement.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.520]  So we've got John McAfee joining us.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.600]  I'm going to skip this network break, but the last one I'm skipping this week.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.200]  I'm not going to skip more breaks this week.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.960]  I'm going to get good about this, but I've gotten behind today so I'm going to do it.
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.720]  Before we get into this huge health news, some of it really interesting and ties into
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:26.360]  the deindustrialization and the globalist plan and why they want to do that is this
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.200]  is a key piece of intel.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:33.520]  Let's talk about knockout because this is one of the largest organic manufacturers in
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  the country.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.440]  They said, yeah, usually people just put melatonin or valerian together.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.480]  Max, we put eight different things with that in.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.080]  This isn't sluggish when you wake up in the morning, but I took it when I went to Europe.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.160]  I've taken it when I go on other trips, when I can't fall asleep on a plane.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.160]  I take it an hour later.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.000]  I just want to go to sleep and I ended up sleeping on the way back from Europe eight
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  hours.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.240]  I've never on a transcontinental flight, but I'll sleep more than two, three hours and
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.240]  I don't.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.600]  I've taken pills before just to see what they do.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.080]  Feel horrible for six hours after I wake up groggy.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.200]  Tell folks Anthony Guciardi because knockout just came back in today.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.800]  The truck arrived this morning from the lab and we got a larger amount of it this time
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.440]  because it's sold out in just a few days and we got a smaller quantity.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:23.000]  Tell people and we've got rave reviews, folks that see the reviews at infowarslife.com.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.560]  How important sleep is, it's linked to getting cancer, it's linked to being angry, it's linked
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.880]  to having health problems, aging, but the drugs, the sleeping pills and things don't
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.360]  give you real deep sleep folks.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.860]  Look it up.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:41.920]  Natural valerian root and things like melatonin, L-triptophan, chamomile flower extract, lemon
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:50.760]  balm, leaf extract, hops flower extract, L-theanine and others, gamma, acid and other things absolutely
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.560]  works with your brain to just get you to turn loose and have deep, restful, delicious
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.560]  sleep.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.760]  So I've had so much energy.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:59.440]  Tell folks about knockout Anthony.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.480]  I know you're excited to have it back because you ask every single day if it's back because
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.240]  you're out of your bottle.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.520]  But yeah, so most people are catching on to the reality that melatonin is what you need.
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.280]  And it just came out today actually in the news.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:17.120]  Believe I did print it here, yes, light from smartphones and tablets affects melatonin
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.120]  levels.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:19.280]  We've always told you it eats your brain.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.280]  Right.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.040]  So this is out actually this weekend.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.040]  It's New York Times.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:27.600]  Research offers a compelling reason for parents to ban smartphones, tablets and laptops in
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.360]  their children's bedroom at night.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:32.800]  The bright light of these devices may lower levels of melatonin, a hormone that prompts
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:33.800]  sleep.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:37.080]  So really all light though, but this is right in your face before you go to bed.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:39.840]  It's artificial LED styles, very toxic.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.840]  You're on your phone.
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.840]  You're on your iPad.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  You're on your Kindle, whatever.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.240]  It's emitting light into your brain and your body says, oh, it's still light out.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.800]  I don't need to go to sleep.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.240]  And that's why light pollution is such a big issue.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:53.560]  If you're sleeping with the lights on, your melatonin production is drastically destroyed,
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:57.200]  especially when you sleep with lights on because you want complete darkness.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.920]  And if you're not getting complete darkness, you're not going to get that restful sleep.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:04.040]  So here's the thing though, people are catching on and they're taking melatonin.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.160]  Here's an article today as well.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.200]  It's gaining taste for melatonin supplements to combat fatigue.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.640]  Many students and institutes of higher learning suffer from sleep deprivation and blah, blah,
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.640]  blah, blah.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:19.000]  And again, because the gut is so dead, you're not producing enough of it in the stomach for
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  the brain.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  Yep.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.160]  And that's linked up in this study from today.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.600]  Study to little sleep increases your risk of catching a cold.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:29.720]  It's all linked up to your immune system, but, but, but, but melatonin works for a lot
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.720]  of people.
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.720]  It doesn't work for everybody.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:35.040]  Well, what the studies have found is I've done deep research on this, so have you.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.640]  You've had scientists and brain doctors, you name it on.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.600]  It stops working after a while.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]  Right.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:48.000]  That's why you've got to fuse it with exercise, with having a dark room, with having a fan
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.240]  on or white noise and something like knockout and rude extract.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.840]  Because we know that maybe melatonin is excellent.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:00.960]  It's a, it's a basic ingredient, but we knew that we wanted to have a more complete profile
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:02.520]  on this product, not just melatonin.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.440]  I mean, you could get melatonin for pretty much the same price, but this has multiple
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:09.000]  ingredients like valerian root extract, L-tripped to fan, lemon balm, leaf extract.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.440]  This has a good dose.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.440]  Most of the pills out there are three milligrams.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.760]  Ours is three milligrams of melatonin, L-tripped to fan, 15 milligrams.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.120]  That's what's in Turkey.
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.680]  That's what, a big meat meal makes you sleepy.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:28.720]  Calamil, root extract, 18 milligrams, lemon balm, 45 milligrams, valerian root, 30 milligrams,
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.640]  L-theanine, 100 milligrams.
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.360]  I mean, this, this is a strong dose for us.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.920]  And here's a cool thing too though, melatonin, we have pure melatonin in it, but then L-tripped
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.560]  to fan, what people don't understand, oh, I take it and I get sleepy.
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:43.720]  That's because it naturally converts into melatonin, right?
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.840]  So we have another layer there of L-tripped to fan that's going to be converted by your
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:49.640]  body naturally into the melatonin that you need.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.200]  And then the valerian root extract, I mean, that's used as far back as Greece and Rome.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.520]  The Greek physician Galen, dubbed a valerian root as a remedy for sleeplessness and insomnia.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.520]  So this has been used forever.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.840]  We're just taking all the things that are known to work.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.600]  And listen, I went to the store, this is about two years ago, and I said, I want to sleep
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.600]  it, I want to sleep it.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.360]  I've been to Whole Foods, everything has one ingredient or maybe two.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  Why don't they fuse it all?
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.920]  Because I was sitting there with my kids some nights, you know, they'd eaten some sugar
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.560]  too later, whatever, give them a couple of different pills, and I'm like, I don't want
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.560]  to do that.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.560]  I want to give them one thing.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.560]  Yeah.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.560]  So that's what we did.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  It's just one deal.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.560]  It's very affordable, very low cost.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.840]  A bottle of melatonin is the cost of this, and the melatonin I have at home is three
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  milligrams.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.840]  Yeah.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:31.840]  And this has a ton of more stuff.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.040]  It's because people don't want to pay the price to make a good product and then sell
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.360]  it and not get that good of a markup.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:36.520]  And tell folks how much it is.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.520]  We'll put it up on screen.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.120]  It is, I believe, as of right now, let's pull it up on screen because I want to make sure
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.120]  we get people.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.120]  Nineteen ninety-five.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.760]  Nineteen ninety-five is the discounted price, right?
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:49.320]  A bottle of valerian roof is between fifteen and twenty dollars.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:52.120]  A bottle of melatonin between fifteen and twenty dollars.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:55.920]  I mean, again, this has got everything right there.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.280]  You save money.
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:02.280]  And the reason I waited for the price is you actually decided to still give them the discounted
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:05.520]  price, even though it just came in, it's been sold out for a month plus.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.680]  So you get it right now for nineteen ninety-five on InfowarsLife.com.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:08.680]  That's right.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:13.320]  And a little bit of profit we make because, again, we go to these companies and something's
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.080]  costing us six, seven, eight dollars a bottle.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.360]  They go, we're glad you're doing this.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  No one else does it.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.840]  If something costs eight dollars a bottle, you sell it for thirty or forty.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:24.480]  Most people sell stuff for nineteen ninety-five that cost them two dollars a bottle.
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.480]  Yeah, or less.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.520]  Okay, you have to understand, folks, something like SuperMailVitality is costing me twenty
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:30.520]  dollars.
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:31.720]  Now, there's still markup there.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:33.600]  We've got to fund the operation.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.360]  But I mean, I want to, you know, have markup, double-fund things, but really give you the
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.400]  Rolls-Royce because that's what I want.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:45.080]  I take my own products and it's shocking that there really aren't a lot of companies
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:46.080]  out there that do it.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  Some groups that do are InfowarsHealth.com.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.240]  The Ungevity Line is excellent.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.240]  I haven't taken all their 400-plus products, but I know they have neurotic level safety
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.320]  standards and quality and are a huge company around nineteen years now, and so I'm involved
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:02.320]  with them.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  I promote InfowarsHealth.com.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.520]  When you purchase Ungevity products there, it helps fund our operation as well.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.640]  But our products, we only have fourteen of them, are game changers.
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.640]  Game changers.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.600]  Briefly, Anthony, I'll do five more minutes with you to cover this other news before Mr.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.480]  McAfee joins us.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.840]  We also are going to sell out of the liver shield, again, very hard to make, very hard
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  to get the herbs.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.360]  I don't want to change the formula.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.920]  Group is here this week, but we may have to because we just can't get some of the stuff.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:33.000]  It's going to be out within probably the next few days or at the end of this week, for sure.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.600]  Well, there's only like a thousand bottles left.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:35.840]  We'll be gone today.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.080]  I almost only want to promote it.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.080]  It'll be gone immediately.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:39.080]  Sure.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:40.880]  The point is, that's how good our stuff is.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.000]  We'd rather just have it for you.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.320]  How long till the cleanse runs out?
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.280]  Group cleanse is selling out probably this week, and it's funny because, I mean, how
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:53.560]  many times do we try?
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.280]  We try and get as much as we can, but we're not going to sacrifice the quality, so it
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.800]  just comes in, it sells out for like two months, so let me get more.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.680]  We're trying to get more in, but we're just not going to sacrifice the quality.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.480]  We're not going to go down in the...
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.240]  And I'll be honest, I've talked to three different manufacturers, Group's just one
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.480]  of them, and they said, if you want this quality, sorry, because they want to sell
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.480]  it to us, too.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.480]  Yeah, they do.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:12.480]  And I'm not trying to cut corners up.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:13.480]  Can we place it with something else?
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.480]  And we just haven't been able to.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.880]  So that's why this stuff sold out, almost all our products, because it's hard to get
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:24.080]  wet herbs that are from organic areas and then have them triple tested as we do.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.080]  I mean, most of our products, I think all of them, are above California standards, which
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.920]  other people can't even do.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:32.920]  So I mean, you've got to commit them from us, give you the highest quality we can.
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:36.000]  Plus, we have a lot of enemies, so they help us keep the quality up as well.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.600]  888-253-33139 to call, if you can answer all your questions, we're going to start the

[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:55.160]  You talk about all the craziness in the world, here's a new report from the CDC, three out
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:58.760]  of four Americans' hearts are older than their chronological age, it's just a little
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:03.120]  foam in the throat in there, so you may feel young, but really your heart is totally stressed
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.800]  out and that's because I think stress levels, sleep levels are terrible, no one can sleep,
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.400]  everyone's stressing out about life and their job and politics and horrible, it's just
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  affecting everybody.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.600]  At the same time though, we have some good news, kind of good news, I'll explain it,
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:24.040]  California's EPA is going to label Monsanto's Roundup as known to cause cancer, put it on
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.240]  the label, but it's known to cause cancer.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:29.800]  Now here's why this is good, but now they're open to lawsuits, we're saying you could drink
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:30.800]  it for 30 years.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:35.440]  Exactly, it sets a legal precedent, problem is that California, as we know, because we
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:40.800]  have to come up to their standards, thinks that everything causes cancer, the shoelaces
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:44.480]  that you have cause cancer, but for the first time, they're actually getting it right because
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:48.160]  the World Health Organization agrees that Monsanto's Roundup does cause cancer.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:51.440]  So that's big news, they're setting a legal precedent and what could happen now is people
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.920]  could start suing over that and it could lead to GMO labeling or GMO bans.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:57.920]  Another one-
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.320]  But you mean weed killer might not be good for me?
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.320]  Weed killer?
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:03.200]  You know, you should probably drink a glass of it, it's personally safe, why not just
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.700]  drink a glass of Glyphosate?
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:09.320]  I heard shit in yourself with a Smith & Wesson 500 is good for you too.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:13.480]  It's actually really good for you, it's not known to cause cancer or anything.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:17.760]  And then here's one, so in response to that, Monsanto recruits academics for lobbying war
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.440]  over GMOs from the St. Louis Business Journal.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.960]  Monsanto and his partners in the ag industry have pushed to recruit academic researchers
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.520]  to add to their authoritative voice in the ongoing debate of the safety of GMOs.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:36.760]  So they're going to colleges and listing professors and future graduates and stuff to join Monsanto
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:37.760]  in the press and everything.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.600]  And that's why it's also come out that others have been paid that were independent news
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.360]  media people and were putting out stuff pro Monsanto.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:48.520]  So they're going around and recruiting everybody that they possibly can.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.000]  And then here's a funny one, I want to hear your thoughts on this because I think-
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.880]  Let's talk to a lot about this, this is about the fall of civilization.
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:55.880]  Yes.
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.240]  Here's one.
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.600]  So was it like two years ago, I told you about my doctor friend that runs hospitals, he told
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:03.760]  me that there's a big issue on the horizon.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:04.760]  We talked about it on here.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.760]  I think we did talk about it on here.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.560]  They just don't make all the old drugs that work anymore because Big Pharma can't make
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:10.560]  money off of it.
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:11.560]  Yeah.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:13.240]  Tell folks, there's no more snake venom, any venom.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.960]  Yeah, there's no more snake bite venom being made and doctors without borders is freaking
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:19.480]  out saying they're going to run out next year and there's nothing they can do about it
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:23.160]  and people are going to die and Big Pharma is like, well, it doesn't really matter because
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:27.160]  it costs them like 70 grand to make it and who's going to buy it these days.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.800]  They just sit at the hospital except unless someone gets a snake bite.
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.160]  So they should only make like 10 a year or whatever, but they just decided not to.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:39.880]  20 years ago, they sold rattlesnake, any venom at the stores in New Mexico and Arizona.
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:45.520]  When a friend of mine's mother got bit in Austin by a small, I guess it was a mountain
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.160]  rattler or timber rattler, it was a little shorter one, the little ones are the bad ones.
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.280]  They charged her $200,000 for a two day stay.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.360]  She wasn't even that sick, 70%, it was like 150 grand of it, I forget, it's 140 grand
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:03:59.360]  or something.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.320]  How to get my friend died by nose for years, I'm not going to say the story unless he wants
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.280]  to it, for the antivenom.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.200]  Yeah, it's like 170 grand sometimes, it's 140 some verb.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.480]  My doctor friend had to go to the zoo and get a vial from 1980 that was expired and
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:18.200]  injected into this woman because it was their only hope because they didn't have any snake
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:19.200]  antidote.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.200]  And it just shows the difference.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:23.640]  It always costs money to make this stuff, but they made big batches and then made their
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.640]  money back.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  They just don't care.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:26.640]  They don't care.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.720]  They don't care if nuclear reactors are leaking now.
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.720]  They don't care.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.040]  It is a nihilistic destroy everything situation.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.760]  It's literally let people die, doesn't matter if there's no profit in it, then who cares?
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  That's what we're looking at.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.920]  That's the situation in this world right now.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.600]  That's what it all comes down to.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.600]  Total insanity.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.920]  Well, what happens when some of these elitists get bit by a snake?
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:48.920]  Oh, I'm sure they have plenty.
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:52.240]  I'm sure they have plenty of snake venom.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.720]  They've got all the antidotes they need.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.720]  It really is the end of the west.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:56.720]  I mean, it's the end of the Renaissance.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:57.720]  We'll be back.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:58.720]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:04:59.720]  Thank you.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:03.600]  Jesus has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:06.120]  This is being reported by World Net Daily.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:10.680]  ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:15.880]  to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:19.160]  a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:24.240]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:27.760]  crosses in public, or even ring church bells.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.680]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:36.000]  by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.040]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.160]  to fund groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:48.560]  Whether it's air-dropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars' worth of vehicles
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:53.160]  that they can use against this, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.160]  somewhere.

[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.480]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:27.000]  Well, everybody knows that I love characters.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.680]  I love the real McCoy's.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:32.000]  I like Jesse Ventura, even though I disagree with some of his politics, because I know
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.160]  him well, worked on two seasons of his TV show, traveled with him a lot.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:39.440]  He's a real guy.
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:42.360]  John McAfee is certainly a character.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  Kind of like the real life Captain Morgan.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.080]  And John McAfee joins us right now.
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:55.880]  He's talking about, or there's been some talk out there, he wants to clarify it.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.160]  Little Bird told me he might be running for president here in the next few days.
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.160]  WhoisMcAfee.com, FutureTentsCentral.com.
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:09.400]  He of course worked for NASA, from Space Shuttle Studies as an engineer, and then he
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:15.120]  founded McAfee Associates, the first big antivirus company made billions.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:20.400]  And then of course he went into the field of bacterial quorum sensing, and was also
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.800]  trying to develop a nutraceuticals down on Belize, which is a smart business.
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:27.360]  That's the business we're in, how we fund our operation.
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:28.360]  They came after him there.
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:34.920]  He said that they had, that they were producing with the government a chemical weapon.
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.800]  He named the chemical weapon Ryerson.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:40.880]  It's a biological system that makes a chemical weapon, one of the most deadly poisons in
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.920]  the world, and then sure enough years later it came out that indeed was going on.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:51.160]  He says there's attempts on his life, folks have been after him, a lot's been going on
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.160]  lately.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.760]  We'll ask him about some of those events.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:58.120]  But he joins us at the bottom of the hour longer if he wants, but if he does go longer
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:01.240]  with us, I'm going to have to bring up news stories and get his take on that.
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.160]  So he's welcome to ride shotgun with us and get into driverless cars, be given part of
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:11.000]  the road, the Pope pushing for world government, NATO chiefs to make a visit to Ukraine as
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.840]  U.S. troops and weapons are built up for war with Russia.
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.840]  The numbers are in.
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:19.280]  China dumps a record 94 billion in U.S. treasuries in one month.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.440]  Goldman Sachs says it's probably 115 bill.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:26.040]  Why Obama and Hillary must stop Donald Trump at all costs?
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:32.920]  We'll get John McAfee's take on Donald Trump, all this and more, but John McAfee big critic
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.600]  of the NSA, big promoter of liberty.
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:41.000]  He's done some tongue-in-cheek videos, music videos with hot girls that that's some of
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.840]  his humor, folks.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:47.960]  But like him or, you know, love him, he certainly is a American phenomenon.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:50.120]  And John McAfee, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  It was great going shooting with you here in Austin with the 50 cal.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:56.560]  You did a lot better handheld shooting that baby than I did.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.400]  You look like it was part of your body.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:03.600]  Me, I look like a overweight goblin firing a cannon, but we'll maybe roll some of that
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  in the background.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.800]  You guys can Google John McAfee fires 50 cal.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:12.520]  But John, good to have you here with us via video Skype.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.600]  You're talking about running for president or I've heard people are talking about you
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.880]  running for president.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:19.400]  What's the real scoop, John?
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:27.800]  Well, people, a number of people have been advising me to run, urging me to run.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:32.640]  My team actually filed today formally.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:41.240]  I'm still not convinced I would rather someone with more intelligence and charisma be the
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.040]  carrier of the banner here.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:50.120]  But I feel that the government has failed us in many ways, Alex, and something has to
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.520]  be done about it, whether it's me or whether it's someone else.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.520]  Wow.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.320]  So it sounds like you're 99 percent there.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.320]  Did you just say?
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:59.920]  Please make a statement now.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:03.440]  You are looking at filing and running for president officially.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:10.560]  Well, no, I said my advisors and my staff filed formally today.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:18.840]  I think that's a very subtle way of forcing me to do something.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:23.280]  I'm still undecided, Alex, and within the next 48 hours I will make a decision one way
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.280]  or the other.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.280]  So there's your headline.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:30.960]  Obviously, it has filed for president, but they're kind of like half pregnant now.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:34.960]  We decide in the next 48 hours if indeed that's going to happen.
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.760]  Well, again, it has been filed.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:39.760]  I have not decided.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:41.760]  That is the truth, Alex.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:42.760]  Okay.
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:46.360]  So basically, folks are trying to force your hand, but you're undecided.
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:47.360]  I am undecided.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  All right.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.880]  There are a bunch of reasons, obviously.
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:59.520]  I am quite a character in terms of the way the press portrays me, and yet I speak what
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.880]  I see as the truth.
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:04.120]  I've written a number of articles in the past.
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:10.040]  You're criticizing both the US government and foreign governments for invasions of privacy,
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:15.160]  for incompetence in terms of understanding the various society in which they're living
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:16.160]  in.
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:23.600]  We're living in a cyber world now, a world based on technology that are certainly our
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.880]  current administration does not understand in the least.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:36.440]  They propose utterly insane concepts like banning encryption.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:40.840]  Encryption is nothing more than the modern version of whispering in someone's ear.
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:43.160]  I can whisper in my wife's ear at dinner.
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.160]  That's okay.
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:49.640]  But I can't whisper to her over the internet because people want to make that illegal.
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:56.200]  They want to put backdoors in software that will make it a thousand times easier for hackers
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:01.240]  to get in and steal your data, which is happening all the time.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:08.160]  The hack of the Office of Program Management in the US, which put literally millions of
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:15.000]  covert US agents at risk that put their lives at risk, are incompetence and it shows a total
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.480]  lack of understanding of the technology which underlies this entire society, Alex.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.960]  Well, break down your presidential platform if you do decide to run, if you feel that
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:31.280]  you are basically being forced to because of the developments towards tyranny.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:36.880]  I mean, in your own words, what would you do as president within the constitutional
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:40.480]  constraints versus if you were king for a year?
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.480]  What would you do?
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.880]  I would do something totally different if I were king for a year, I'm sure.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.960]  I think my first priority would be privacy, Alex.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.600]  We haven't done it anymore.
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:00.560]  The NSA is spying on us, the CIO is spying on us, all 16 government covert agencies have
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:07.480]  technology that is beyond belief that can listen to our phone conversations, drive down
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:15.800]  the street in any city and look at the cameras, thousands of them, 15 or 20 per block, movable,
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:21.640]  that can watch you as you're moving and recognize your face.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:24.840]  We've lost it and without privacy, what do we have, Alex?
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:27.320]  We don't have our humanity.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:32.760]  Privacy is a choice, we choose what's revealed to people.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:37.760]  The grocery clerk at the store, you might be comfortable saying, hey, I went fishing
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  yesterday, but you're not going to tell them your deepest secrets.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:47.880]  Every day, every moment when we meet someone, we choose the level of privacy that we wish
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.960]  to maintain.
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:52.560]  Without that choice, what do we have?
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:58.200]  We have 1984.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.480]  So your candidacy would be the opposite of 1984.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:04.960]  You would attempt to what, bring in 1776?
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:05.960]  I would.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:12.080]  I would like us to go back to the concept that the Founding Fathers had, which is freedom.
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:17.800]  Our freedoms are being removed because we were told if we give up a few freedoms, then
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:20.160]  we will have security and safety.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:25.640]  But I'm 70 years old and I can promise you, there is no safety in life and if there is,
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:28.280]  we have to provide it for ourselves.
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:31.440]  The government cannot do it, an agency cannot do it.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:38.080]  No outside party can provide security and safety for us and by giving up the freedoms
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:45.600]  and the rights that were given to us through the Constitution and were ordained by the
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:48.240]  Founding Fathers are being eroded daily.
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:53.680]  Now, I'm not a politician and people have found me for that, but politics, if you look
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:59.720]  in Miriam Webster, politics is merely the activities and the policies that people use
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:03.920]  to gain power and keep power within a government.
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:09.040]  And isn't it politics that got us in the mess we're in now, special interests, people more
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:14.320]  concerned about maintaining their power, maintaining their position within government than in actually
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:17.520]  serving the American people?
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.000]  So I think we need to get back to the basics, to get back to the purpose of government.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.840]  You know, government is not here where I don't need a father.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:24.840]  I don't need a mother.
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:27.520]  I don't need someone to tell me how to live.
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  I can make those choices on my own.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:33.520]  Well, I know this, if they're going to have eight or nine different Republicans up there,
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.480]  a bunch of them, just total politicians, I would love to see a Jesse Ventura or a John
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.800]  McAfee up there with them staring it up like Trump's done because regardless of what you
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.760]  think about Trump, I think he has shaken up the political process.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:48.320]  What's your view on Donald Trump?
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.080]  You know, I admire Donald Trump.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:51.080]  I really do.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:55.640]  You know, he makes common sense.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.200]  He is not a politician.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:58.200]  That's clear.
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:03.120]  You know, if I have any fault with him at all, it's, it's a, he wants with the hair
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:08.240]  Donald, but I'm saying that in chess, but I admire Donald Trump.
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:15.960]  And I think, I think that he has courage, but to, to stand up and do what he's doing.
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.280]  You know, at first they say that he didn't have a shot and I thought he might have been
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.040]  a shill for Hillary or Jeb or something, but I think he really wants to win.
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.840]  And his whole company's based on service industry.
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:27.760]  He won't do well in a depression.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.240]  I think he's an old fashioned entrepreneur and actually loves America more and more.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.880]  And I think he's got problems, but I think he doesn't like seeing this country fall apart
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:41.320]  because the globalists wouldn't say make America great again and admit we were in trouble.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.680]  A globalist candidate wouldn't do the things he's doing, admitting we're being invaded
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:48.280]  by illegals that we give free handouts to.
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:54.160]  I mean, that's why he must be for real, because even if he himself isn't, what he's saying
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.360]  is devastating to the establishment.
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:01.480]  Well, of course, well, I think someone needs to say the things that he's saying because
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:04.080]  we are, our government has failed.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:11.760]  I mean, it is, it is a dysfunctional government in every respect of, and when, when a, when
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:16.200]  the government becomes dysfunctional, then all aspects of its services and all of its
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:19.080]  departments also become dysfunctional.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:20.320]  Someone has to say it.
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.520]  I've been saying it for years.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:24.840]  You've been saying it.
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:28.160]  And so I, I admire him for doing that.
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.400]  And you know, don't, don't discount Trump.
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.680]  I think he's going to be a very powerful player.
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:34.680]  Sure.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.760]  Well, what it really shows too is that what he's saying is popular in major polls.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.280]  He's now beating Hillary, which is what I've said, the average Democrat doesn't have a
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:45.520]  suicide wish for the country and want to be bankrupt.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:46.880]  They're sick of political correctness.
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:49.600]  I mean, the Democrats of JFK were great people.
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.040]  Who are these new Democrats and who are these Republicans that work with them?
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:55.080]  John McAvie may be running for president.
[02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:56.080]  He joins us now.
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:59.680]  We're going to come back and walk through some of the world events with him.

[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:36.760]  Come on, come on, come on, baby, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:42.200]  Fun part about this job is I get to interview people like Ted Nugent and John McAfee.
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:47.680]  Hell, Ted Nugent's called in a few times before on the hotline and gotten in, but ever since
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.800]  his wife got arrested with a gun going to the Dallas airport, he's like, I'll come
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.800]  on later, Alex.
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:53.520]  I got his cell phone number.
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.360]  I'm going to call Ted Nugent today and say, you're going to come on now, buddy.
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:02.600]  I know you got a lot of trouble on the show for admitting that gun owners of America had
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:08.360]  put major heat on the NRA to make them more hardcore because he is a board member of the
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:13.920]  NRA, but that's why I like Ted Nugent, is he's real, and I know nothing against the
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:14.920]  NRA.
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:18.360]  They used to be really bad 10 years ago, now they're really good.
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:23.160]  We've got to radicalize the Liberty Movement because we face a radical globalist threat.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:25.080]  Look toasting it won't beat it.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:29.320]  John McAfee, what is the best website for folks to visit to find out more if you're about
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.000]  to run for president?
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:38.480]  I think my people have McAfee16.com as the main website.
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:39.480]  Oh, really?
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.480]  Have you launched that yet?
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:44.160]  The website is up, yes.
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:46.520]  Oh my gosh, McAfee16.com.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:50.000]  Are we getting the exclusive, because I hadn't heard this yet, are you exclusively letting
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.200]  us know that you may fly your flag and run for El Presidente?
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:04.440]  I think I talked to a friend of mine at International Business Times and one of my campaign people
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:10.400]  I think called him and leaked some information yesterday, but beyond that, yeah, you're the
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:14.280]  first person I'm talking to about the fact that I might in fact run.
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.840]  If I do run by the way, you were talking about Donald Trump, I think I would look very forward
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:21.280]  to debating Donald Trump.
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:25.360]  He's certainly the most interesting and most intelligent of the candidates and I think
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.200]  that debate would be fun for me.
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:30.040]  I'm a big fan of Rand Paul because I know he's for real.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:36.360]  I just wish that it's not helping him to attack Donald Trump with his constituents and then
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:38.560]  he's being too milk toast on the immigrant thing.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:43.080]  I mean, John, you're married to a black lady, you've lived all over the world, you're all
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.760]  for great immigrants, so am I, but should Americans have to pay for anchor babies and
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:49.120]  40 million illegals?
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:54.040]  Should Europe have to pay for the Middle Eastern refugees from war Saudi Arabia starts, but
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.760]  they won't take one refugee?
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:00.840]  Well, I think one of the other problems that we face here in America is that people are
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:04.840]  not taking responsibility for their own lives.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.520]  If I didn't want to work, for example, if I could make up some excuse for not being able
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.480]  to work and the government would give me money, there's something fundamentally wrong, not
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:22.560]  with, not with helping people, but with, with creating the attitude that I don't have to
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:25.760]  worry about anything because someone will take care of me.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.040]  It's like, you know, living at home when you're 40, you know, your mom and dad will, will,
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.360]  will still take care of you and your mom will cook for you.
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  Exactly.
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.560]  These illegals, but also other deadbeats and people, I'm all for helping somebody with
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:37.560]  a broken back.
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.360]  They're like 40 year old spoiled brats telling their mom to make them breakfast and dinner
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:43.120]  and wash their underwear.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.280]  It's disgusting.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.120]  That's what I'm so angry about is that people just expect all this while hard work and Americans
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:51.760]  of every race, color and creed are going bankrupt.
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.760]  John.
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:57.160]  Well, but I don't think the problem is, is, is simply immigrants.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:01.800]  I mean, there are many natural born Americans that, that are taking, taking advantage of
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:02.800]  the same.
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:03.800]  I agree.
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:09.760]  So, so America was actually founded on the concept of, you know, give us your, your poor,
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:16.320]  your, your hungry or your, your, your, your judged and then it worked pretty well.
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:19.240]  It's just that we're doing a very bad job of managing that.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:20.240]  Well, sure.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.600]  We took the poor, the hungry and put them into piratical swashbuckling, hella situations
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:25.840]  and a lot of folks died.
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:30.920]  And this was basically like an alien boot camp like Australia, a penal colony, but, but
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:32.200]  people weren't given anything.
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:35.240]  That's why we were the best because we weren't tough as nails.
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.240]  Right.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.400]  We, we, we still, we still, again, we have to get back to basics.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:45.320]  We are all responsible for ourselves, for our families, for our loved ones.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:49.240]  And we, we, we, we must take back our own lives.
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.480]  We must take back our freedoms because many of those are missing now.
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:57.040]  We have to take back privacy because that's eroding at an alarming rate.
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:58.400]  I'm not sure any of it exists.
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:03.360]  I'm not sure that, that, that, especially someone like you and I, there's probably not
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.280]  a single conversation that you have that is not monitored by some covert agents.
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.000]  Of course, they admit it, we're going to go to break them and come back and give you
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.400]  the floor to really go through your platform and, and, and, and be uninterrupted for about
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:14.400]  five, 10 minutes.
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:17.160]  Then I want to maybe take some phone calls for you and cover some news if you're okay
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:18.160]  with that.
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.160]  But think about this.
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:24.560]  I want to come back and have, and get your answer, John McAfee, McAfee16.com.
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:29.400]  It's like being a kept woman or I guess a kept man nowadays, rich women with boyfriends.
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.240]  Are you really free when somebody else controls your whole life and pays the bills?
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:35.560]  And that's what all this welfare state is about.
[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:37.240]  I mean, this is about enslaving us.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:39.040]  John McAfee is our guest.
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:42.040]  He has filed for president.
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:43.560]  Is he running?
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.280]  International Business Times just broke it in print today that he's looking at it.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.920]  We're breaking it via the actual interview.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:50.200]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:52.680]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:54.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.240]  I was quiet yesterday and let them scoop us.
[02:29:57.240 --> 02:29:59.840]  See how good I am.
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:05.200]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of eight being killed and 46 being wounded.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:09.760]  July 4th of this year, we had reports of nine dead and 53 wounded.
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:16.160]  And let us not forget July 4th of last year, we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.520]  And these are not nationwide stats.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:23.040]  All of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:28.280]  gun laws in the nation, which is to say, if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:32.520]  more likely to attack you, not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:34.880]  to gangs or drug activity.
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:39.760]  Meaning that for all the gun buy bags and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:42.600]  decided to turn in their firearms.
[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:47.760]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once, but
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:52.160]  that's why you have a second amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:31:22.000]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.

[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:34.480]  I'm sure every shot is going to be a success, that's right.
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:34:04.440]  Well John, it's daytime and these armor piercing tracers, US Army issue, won't be as spectacular
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:07.720]  as night time, but you want to shoot a couple of these?
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:08.720]  Absolutely.
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:09.720]  Alright, we'll do that next.
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:12.520]  A little over a year ago, see I've lost about 60 pounds.
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:42.360]  I'm shooting a tree about two yards away right there doing that, it's too dry to fire tracers.
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:54.480]  John, you just got done shooting the.50 over there, we're going to put that on the TV show
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:35:02.120]  next week, but right now you've got that.223 M4 Scorpion, you ready to try it out?
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:05.960]  I don't even know what's here compared to the.50 caliber, this feels like a feather.
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:12.080]  You just hand held and shot the heavy.50 over there, shot on my iPhone, favorite guns.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.080]  That's good.
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.960]  He just came on the show, he'd been on a few times, we thought, hey, let's drive out
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.360]  to Steiner's Ranch, the real Steiner Ranch, not their housing development, but their real
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.440]  12,000 acre ranch outside town, and it reminds me, I need to take the kids out there and
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:31.480]  do some more shooting, but John McAfee is our guest, exciting to think of him running
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:33.320]  for president just to inject him.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.360]  The idea is a privacy, he uses a bully pulpit to expose what the NSA is doing, remember we've
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:43.080]  gone from just eight, nine years ago, them denying the NSA was spying on anybody to admitting
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.440]  total surveillance, which is completely illegal.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:57.760]  The toll-free number to join us on air, your chance to talk to John McAfee is 800-259-9231-1800-2599-9231.
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:02.040]  Now I'm normally very lenient about plugs and other issues and going on rabbit trails.
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.200]  We're talking about John McAfee running for president and any of the issues he covers,
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:12.280]  which is a wide open field, but it better be on those subjects, John McAfee, M-C-A-F-E-E,
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:17.720]  McAfee16.com running for L Presidente, or he's at least got one foot in the race right
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:25.720]  now, guard against the imposters of pretended patriotism, George Washington, a nice George
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.880]  Washington quote up there on the site.
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.000]  So entrepreneur, scientist, engineer, John McAfee, looks like he's getting ready to plunge
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.880]  into the 2016 race.
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:38.160]  Before I go any further and then ask you that question, I just got to a moment ago.
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:43.000]  I'm going to plug our sponsorship, what funds is we're going to go right back to you, but
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.560]  then I want to ask you just briefly, well, we'll get there in a moment.
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.560]  Deep Cleanse is back in.
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:52.920]  It had been out for three months.
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.480]  Liver Shield had been out for three months.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:59.480]  Super high quality concentrated herbs known to detoxify the body.
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:02.760]  Also zeolites and other things known to drag out toxins.
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:05.880]  Deep Cleanse will be available for another week or so at current sales rates.
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:08.880]  I can tell you, liver cleanse, if you want to do the liver cleanse, I'm going to hold
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:10.800]  back some bottles for myself.
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:15.920]  You do it, the six day long cleanse with the oxy powder and with the apple cider vinegar
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:22.200]  and then some of the epsom salts in caplets on the last day with olive oil and you just
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:24.920]  flush out all these stones out of your gallbladder.
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:27.240]  I didn't believe it until I did it over a year ago.
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:28.480]  It's just incredible.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:33.600]  So infowarslife.com, Deep Cleanse is back in stock.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:37.960]  We want to keep this stuff in stock all the time, but you never know what folks are going
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:38.960]  to be into.
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:41.720]  Some people are really into deep cleanse and deliver cleanse.
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:46.880]  So if you want to get those, now is the time and your purchase supports the broadcast infowarslife.com
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:48.880]  or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.680]  And then finally, Knockout is back.
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:57.800]  And I talked about with Nancy in the last hour, we ought to take that video and post
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:07.880]  it on the site so folks get a breakdown, but it's got GA, BA, Gamma, Ambiotic Acid that
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:13.400]  helps trigger everything and give it the enzymes it needs to activate what I've been told,
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:19.640]  L-thenanine, Hops flower extract, Lemon balm leaf extract, Valerian root extract, Chamomile
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:22.280]  flower extract, L-tryptophan and melatonin.
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:27.760]  And it's the same cost as getting Valerian root or melatonin with similar dosages by
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  itself.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:34.680]  I mean, it's got the dose that's in other stuff, 3 milligrams of melatonin, 30 milligrams
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:41.320]  of Valerian root, stuff like that, 100 milligrams of L-thenanine, 75 of Hops flower, Lemon balm
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:48.800]  45, Valerian root as I mentioned, Chamomile flower extract, 18 milligrams.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:53.800]  This will knock you out and in my experience get real sleep, but not be groggy in the morning
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.520]  because sleeping pills artificially knock you out.
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:59.440]  They don't put you to the true deep sleep.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:07.200]  Well, this in my experience does infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and we did sell out of the
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:12.880]  Hillary Clinton shirt, Hillary Clinton for prison 2016, but the good news is the next
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:16.520]  truck gets here in two days made here in America, so we're keeping it up for sale.
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:19.240]  For all intents and purposes, it is sold out, but it's really not.
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:23.000]  You just won't get it in three, four days, you'll get it like in a week.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:29.320]  So again, Hillary for prison t-shirt in all sizes on the back, it says legalized freedom,
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:31.120]  great way to spark conversations.
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:35.240]  Okay, so how do we battle domestication?
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:38.800]  How do we battle not being made dependent on the system?
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:40.060]  And then that's a good question.
[02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:44.280]  What is your take on Benghazi, the Hillary emails and what she's been up to?
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:49.000]  Well, first, I'd like to say one thing.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:55.240]  If I do decide to run, I am going to run to win, and I know that sounds very odd from
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:01.520]  someone like me, but keep in mind I've been in technology, a leader of technology for
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:05.040]  over 40 years ever since the computer was first invented.
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:13.320]  40% of every corporate employee is involved in one or other aspect of computer technology.
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:20.680]  I went to DEF CON last month, which is the annual hackers, a high technology crowd.
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:24.800]  I was swamped wherever I went, where people wanting autographs, people wanting pictures
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:27.280]  with me, people begging me to run to the president.
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:31.000]  You've got a household name, you've got the name cred.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:39.720]  And oddly enough, there are probably 45 million people out there that many of them who have
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:45.160]  never voted before, I guarantee you that if I run, they will get out and vote for me.
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.080]  It sounds insane, but if I do choose to...
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:50.760]  No, you're saying you're a serious candidate, it's a serious candidate to see you could
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:51.760]  win?
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:55.520]  If I choose to run, I will definitely win, there is no question.
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:59.800]  Wow, we'll break it down for us more, because I've been erupting, we've been going back
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.120]  and forth, you're good at that, but you've got the floor, tell us what you're planning
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.200]  to do, what you'd like to do if you run for president.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:11.760]  Okay, my campaign manager has said that he will break both of my kneecaps if I say anything
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:17.040]  specific Alec, so we're going to have to talk in generalities here.
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:24.440]  Again, as I said before, my first priority is to return privacy to the individual.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:30.480]  It's being stolen by the government, it's being stolen by hackers, because the government
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:33.880]  has made it easy for hackers to do so.
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:40.680]  That's my first priority, and beyond that, it's to bring us all back to state of freedom.
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:44.760]  We do not need a father figure as a government.
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:54.720]  If you look at the number of government employees compared to the number of American plain citizens,
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:42:02.160]  it's reaching an astronomically large percentage, and we're spending trillions of dollars for
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:03.160]  what?
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:11.080]  That should be created by people, for people, to build roads, create schools, to do those
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:13.960]  and a national defense.
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:17.560]  Government should not be inside our bedrooms, looking at what we're doing when we're alone
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:18.560]  with our wives.
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:22.600]  They should not be on the telephone, listening to every word that we speak.
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:24.600]  They should not be following us around.
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:29.280]  They should not be trying to find out who our friends are and what our friends are doing.
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:35.480]  This is really the fundamental problem, to get back to a state where every man, woman
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:41.560]  or at least every adult is responsible for themselves and takes responsibility for their
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:46.480]  own actions, rather than going, well, it's easier if the government takes care of me,
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.960]  so I'll give up this bit of privacy or that bit of freedom.
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:55.400]  Again, the specifics, I cannot tell you at this point, because I need both of my knee
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.400]  caps to walk out.
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:03.720]  I understand that's normal to then start launching your actual platform after you've announced.
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:05.160]  You committed some thought crimes there.
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:07.920]  I want to talk about Caitlyn Jenner, political correctness, all the rest of it.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:11.240]  I mean, I know you're a classical liberal and that you're living let live, but don't
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:12.800]  tell you how to live.
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:17.600]  In public schools nationwide, he or she is off the questionnaires.
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.800]  You don't say boy or girl, father or mother, husband or wife, because the very existence
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:23.680]  of that is hurtful to someone.
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:29.400]  That sounds like a Kurt Vonnegut satire book from the 50s about the left going into tyranny.
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.360]  It doesn't sound like reality, but you just said the right to not know what's happening
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:36.320]  with you and your wife in your bedroom.
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:38.400]  How dare you use the word wife?
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:39.400]  That's hurtful.
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:40.400]  Do you want to apologize?
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:45.080]  Well, no, actually, I don't, and here's something even funny, Alex.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.600]  I write articles for a number of different publications, actually, International Business
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:51.920]  Times is one of them.
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:58.600]  And two weeks ago, I wrote an article where I got hold of the Ashley Madison dump.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:02.320]  That's the cheating sex site.
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:03.320]  I'm glad you raised that.
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:04.320]  Yeah.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:05.320]  What do you think of that?
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:11.240]  Well, you know, I mean, I don't judge the morals of anyone, but it had some very interesting
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:12.240]  emails in it.
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:18.360]  However, I ascertain that it was an inside job and done by a woman, and I gave the reasons
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:21.120]  for why it had to be a woman.
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:24.880]  There were two manifestos that were included in the dump.
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:34.560]  Among the statements in the manifestos were men are cheating dirtbags, men are scumbags,
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:43.440]  and the most telling one for me was the quote hacker, the alleged hacker, included a statement
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:49.720]  saying this man, and it gave the man's name, address, and everything, actually spitefully
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.200]  joined Ashley Madison the day after Valentine's Day.
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:57.800]  Well, I included that as a probable female statement.
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:03.200]  I mean, I don't know about you, but I have to have my friends remind me when Valentine's
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.200]  Day is coming up, and I do the same for them when I find out about it.
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:07.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:08.440]  Men aren't looking for sex to be spiteful.
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:09.440]  That's what women do.
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:10.440]  Right.
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:13.600]  And so, and especially to say spitefully after Valentine's Day.
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:14.840]  Men are looking for sex for sex.
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:16.560]  Let me just give one my whole newsflash.
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:22.200]  Well, you can imagine some dude in the bar going, oh, my wife cheated on me the day after
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:23.200]  Valentine's Day.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:27.240]  What are you talking about, dude?
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:28.720]  It would be an insane thing.
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.640]  Yet, I got so much flack.
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:39.240]  So many articles were written saying that I was a misogynist out of touch with the world.
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:44.800]  But yet, you know, for a fact that men do not generally say men are cheating dirtbags.
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:50.080]  No, I can pretty much say that's guaranteed a woman or someone trying to frame women.
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.440]  I'm sorry, that's my dog.
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:56.240]  Hey, can we meet the dog?
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:45:57.240]  Can we meet the dog?
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.080]  You want to see the dog?
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:00.080]  Absolutely.
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:03.640]  We got a fourth hour coming up today, John, that's hosted by my crew.
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:05.680]  I want to invite you to stay on longer.
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:07.800]  Yeah, here's where's Marley.
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:08.800]  There he is.
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:09.800]  That was a nice dog.
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:15.360]  A pitfall right here, all over my face now.
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:21.280]  Well, you like high caliber guns, you like semi-autos, you like nice dogs, and you like
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:22.280]  privacy.
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:26.320]  You know what, people can say, oh, you're a racy guy, you escape police, all the rest
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:27.320]  of it.
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:28.320]  He's too well to be president.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:31.960]  Well, at least you wear who you are on your sleeve, you're not creeping around like these
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:32.960]  phonies.
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.120]  I mean, you like full-grown women, not 12-year-old pages at the White House.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:38.120]  That's correct.
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:41.120]  You know, there's no secret about my life.
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:46.920]  In fact, I wrote an article for International Business Times the day after the Office of
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:54.000]  Program Management was hacked, and they said that every top-secret clearance a folder had
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  been taken.
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.640]  Well, I had a top-secret clearance while I worked for Lockheed, so I wrote an article,
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:04.960]  and they included everything I'd ever done, because they asked strange questions, and
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:05.960]  every question.
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.600]  Have you ever taken drugs?
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:15.920]  Yes, of what kind, every kind, often as often as I could, and so I just listed all the things
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:18.080]  I've done, because I don't care.
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:22.280]  You can judge me any way that you want, but I don't know anyone who's perfect, Alex.
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:25.760]  And the government, of course, hired you because while you were honest?
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.280]  I guess, in fact, I was shocked when I got the clearance.
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:32.840]  I thought, good Lord, they will never hire me, because I was totally honest about everything
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  that I had done when they asked me these questions.
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:36.960]  I go, well, that's out the window.
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:39.440]  In two weeks, I got a top-secret clearance.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.240]  So maybe the government said, well, this guy's pretty honest, that it's going to be hard
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:48.400]  for someone to blackmail him, because they told us everything he'd done.
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:54.440]  So I don't see any sense in trying to hide parts of my life, and I've done some things
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:48:02.720]  which some people might judge as improper, but I will not deny it.
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.160]  What about this whole police thing, because first it was, what really happened with the
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.160]  police recently?
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.480]  Has that heard that they were actually your friends, or what happened?
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:13.480]  Which police way?
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:14.480]  Didn't believe?
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:16.080]  Well, no, we know what happened with that.
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:20.520]  Cyber security legend John McAfee was arrested over the weekend on charges of DWI and handgun
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:21.520]  possession.
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:22.520]  What happened there?
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:25.520]  Well, the handgun possession, I always carry a gun.
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.560]  Sure, you should be able to.
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:30.800]  And it's not illegal in this state to carry a gun.
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.800]  I had just that morning got a prescription for Xanax.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:35.800]  I've never taken Xanax before.
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:41.080]  I got the prescription because I'm having trouble sleeping, I live a stressful life.
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:46.720]  I thought, so I said, well, go to the doctor and see what they recommend.
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:48.160]  They prescribe Xanax.
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:49.920]  I don't function well on Xanax.
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:51.520]  I discovered that the day that I took it.
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:53.840]  Yeah, I can't take sleep aids too, and I've tried it before.
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:55.160]  That's why I'll put a plug in.
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:57.440]  That's why I'm going to send you a bottle of knockout, John.
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:00.560]  If knockout works for you, will you give us a plug?
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:01.560]  I will.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:02.560]  Absolutely.
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:03.560]  Five bottles in the alley.
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:05.560]  But Xanax is not just for sleeping.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:09.440]  I mean, it's for basically just calming a person down, but it calmed me down to the
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:11.320]  point that I couldn't even function.
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:12.840]  So it was the first day I had taken it.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:15.400]  I had the prescription bottle issued that day.
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:17.200]  I had never taken it before.
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:20.360]  I took the required amount.
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:25.840]  I accepted a blood test when the blood test comes out.
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:31.280]  But I think that by law here in Tennessee, if it is prescribed drug, and if you're not
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:37.720]  taking an excessive amount or amount exceeding what the doctor has prescribed, I don't think
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:39.920]  there'll be any charges.
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:44.680]  But again, if you are arrested with a DUI in the state of Tennessee and you have handguns,
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:46.680]  it's a fairly serious offense.
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:47.680]  But I remember.
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:48.680]  Which is pure bull.
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:49.680]  I mean, you don't want to...
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:53.440]  You know, they have the 68 Gun Control Act to try to say we're going after criminals
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:56.040]  with guns, but then all they do is snare good people.
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:00.160]  I mean, why should you get in trouble if you're on a prescribed drug and you've got a gun
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:01.280]  to protect yourself?
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:02.480]  It's just pure bull.
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:05.680]  And Obama has announced outside of law he's coming after the guns.
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:07.080]  I want to ask you about that.
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.040]  Now, John, we've got a fourth hour of overdrive and a lot of stations are now picking it up.
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:16.040]  And my reporters host that hour, and that would be a little bit different.
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:19.640]  I know they have some guests lined up in things, but would you like to do 20 minutes
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:21.520]  in the next hour with my next host?
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:27.000]  You know, I would love to, Alex, unfortunately, I have someone else that I'm going to be talking
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  to.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  I totally understand.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  All right.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.120]  So can you stay till five after so we have more time to take calls?
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:33.120]  I can do that.
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:34.120]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:35.120]  All right.
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:36.120]  Your sweetheart.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.120]  All right.
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  Two final segments.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:40.560]  One in the next and then one after that in overdrive with John McAfee.
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:44.720]  We'll talk to Rob, Bill, Mark, Eric and John straight ahead.
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:45.800]  And then now we do the fourth hour.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:46.800]  It's back.
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:47.960]  Some days I'll be hosting it.
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:51.480]  Other days it'll be David Knight, Anthony Goodsharty, Rob Doog, Jakari Jackson.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:59.440]  Folks like that, Joe Biggs, Darren McGrane, stay with us.
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:05.480]  So I found out the other day that at guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:10.240]  rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:12.600]  to drill out and make ready the lower.
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:17.680]  Well, listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machine as I promise you, but I was able
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.920]  to take a drill press with an XY table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:23.800]  all honesty, mine looks really good.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:24.800]  Go get yours.
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:25.800]  Don't be afraid.
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:26.800]  It's easy.

[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:00.760]  Honey, why are there fish swimming in our bathtub?
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.760]  Aren't they cute?
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:07.120]  You need more omega-3s, and those fish oil pills with toxins and heavy metals are scary,
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:09.040]  so I'm making fish oil from scratch.
[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:12.200]  Oh boy, didn't I tell you I'm ordering Nutragold Fish Oil?
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:13.680]  It's exceptionally pure.
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:15.200]  That's what they all say.
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:16.200]  No, really.
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:20.360]  Nutragold's fish oil is concentrated from pure cold water fish straight off the Alaskan
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:23.480]  coast and manufactured right here in the USA.
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:28.040]  Well, cold Alaskan waters are much more pristine than the polluted waters that other fish oils
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:29.040]  are sourced from.
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:33.720]  That's what I'm saying, and it's five-star certified to meet international purity, potency,
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:34.720]  and freshness standards.
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:36.400]  Well, that sounds even better.
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:37.400]  Great.
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:38.960]  I'll be in my office ordering a few bottles.
[02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:45.400]  If I order now on www.fishoil.best, I can save $5 using the promo code MYFISHOIL.

[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:03.640]  We've got two segments left in these strange days.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:06.640]  John McAfee is our guest, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:11.760]  Look at this headline, Burning Man Founder addresses diversity problem by suggesting
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:14.480]  black people don't like camping because of slavery.
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:19.400]  No, it's been a hipster, trendy psychedelic event for decades.
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.320]  That's that genre that white kids, Asians, and Hispanics are into.
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:28.920]  Blacks just haven't felt like they're part of it, just like you can have different concerts
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.120]  and things that are mainly black.
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:31.880]  It's just a cultural deal.
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:39.320]  They act like it's bad and the founder basically apologizes because, I mean, it's like going
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:43.840]  to an October fest and it's mainly Germans or going to Cinco de Mayo and it's mainly
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:44.840]  Mexicans.
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:46.520]  It's not bad.
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:48.280]  It's okay to have a culture.
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:52.000]  See political correctness is the end of culture.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.080]  It's really crazy, John McAfee's our guest.
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.240]  I got to ask this question before we jam in some calls now and next segment.
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:03.760]  Will you make of the China meltdown and them dumping 94 billion in U.S. treasuries?
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  I mean, I think this economy is going down the tubes, John.
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:16.440]  Well, I think that we have way underestimated China as a power in the world.
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:23.480]  I'm in computer security and many of the hacks that have happened here in America are government
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:28.520]  hacks and corporate hacks are done by the Chinese.
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.680]  They're brilliant race of people.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:31.680]  They work hard.
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:33.120]  They study hard.
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:36.520]  Their educational system is second to none.
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:38.640]  And they are a race.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:40.120]  That's not races that they exist.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:43.080]  Well, it is a race and I'm married to a black woman.
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.480]  You mentioned before, you know, cultural differences and you have to believe me.
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.000]  There are massive cultural differences between the races.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:57.160]  You know, sometimes when I speak to my wife, I have to actually translate the words that
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:03.320]  I'm saying because culturally, they don't, they don't apply to her experience as a black
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:04.320]  woman.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:08.320]  And the same thing for me, she has to say, well, this means this, this and this thing.
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  Oh, I get it.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:10.320]  I understand.
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:16.040]  So it's a fact of life and they're making the fact of life bad.
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.320]  Well, but I'm the least racist person on the planet.
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:21.520]  Well, not obviously, but I am married to a black woman.
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:25.360]  No, but that's what it comes down to is they're making us just being different as if that's
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:28.400]  bad itself, so we'll accept their whole corporate override.
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:29.400]  You agree with that?
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  Well, of course.
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:36.720]  I mean, it's, it's, we want the purpose of government is to make everybody the same.
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.120]  That way everybody's easier to control.
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  This is a fact of life.
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:45.200]  I mean, the holy grail of dictatorship is not power necessarily.
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.840]  It's knowledge of the populace.
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:53.680]  If you have absolute knowledge of every citizen, you have absolute power then.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.760]  And that's what the word, that's what is, is, is happening here and in countries all
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:05.480]  over the world, the, the, the powers that be want to know where you are, who your friends
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:06.480]  are.
[02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:07.480]  But then they're all secretive.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:08.480]  We've got to jam in these calls.
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.480]  John, you got to come back soon.
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:10.480]  This has been a great interview.
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:14.880]  We've got two minutes here, five of the next Rob in New Jersey.
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.240]  What's your question for John McAfee?
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:17.240]  Go ahead.
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:18.240]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  Appreciate it.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:20.240]  And I salute you.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:26.280]  I'm going to say you're doing a tremendous job with InfoWorst and I, I, I counted a privilege
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:27.880]  to be able to speak with Mr. McAfee.
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:28.880]  Thank you.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:29.880]  We have a minute.
[02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:30.880]  I just, sorry.
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:31.880]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:35.200]  Uh, you know, I just, what you're saying about the polarization of America concerning
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:40.120]  the RFID chip, Mr. McAfee, do you, do you see that this RFID chip will be pushed upon
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:41.680]  all of America?
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:47.120]  And do you, do you believe that it could possibly be part of the Mark of the B system as talked
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:48.960]  about in the book of Revelation?
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:58.320]  Well, you know, I tend to avoid religion as a, as a subject and I'm far more concerned
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:01.520]  with, with the technology that is already here.
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:02.520]  We don't need a chip.
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:06.240]  If there is a devil, he'd love all this stuff.
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:07.240]  That's for sure.
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:13.120]  Um, the, the, the technology that exists with things like the Stingray, developed by Harris
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:19.200]  Corporation, uh, which, which, uh, every police department in America has one.
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:23.240]  You can drive by neighborhood and they will pick up every single conversation within a
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:25.880]  half a mile radius, every single one.
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:31.120]  And it can also push into your phone software that will make everything that you do, every
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:34.480]  keystroke, uh, John, stay there back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:35.600]  You can finish your point.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:40.000]  New article at info wars, liberals want the Bible banned from Amazon sales.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  Thank you.

[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:49.680]  We got to say no to them and they're weak and pathetic as well.

[02:59:52.040 --> 03:00:02.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:08.720]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:13.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:17.320]  Rob Do is going to be covering it and playing the video bleeping out the cuss words video
[03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:22.040]  refugees that nobody will take in the Middle East throw rocks at Hungarians and shout F
[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:25.880]  U as they maraud and rob vehicles.
[03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:33.120]  Oh my gosh, I mean just the trouble of the Middle East being dumped into Europe with
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:35.040]  the socialists rubbing their hands together.
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:37.680]  John McAfee, I got cut off by the break.
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:39.240]  We're taking phone calls.
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:41.920]  John in Wyoming, you're on the air with Mr. McAfee.
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:42.920]  Go ahead.
[03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:43.920]  Yeah.
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:44.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:49.000]  John, were you at the 2013 NRA convention in Houston?
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.720]  No sir, I was not.
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:52.720]  You weren't.
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:53.880]  Well, I'm sorry you missed it.
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:59.240]  We had some interesting words there where I stood up and told all of the gun grabbers,
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:06.000]  the Bloomberg's and Obama's and Schumer's, fill your hand USOB and of course I can't
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.200]  say those words on the air.
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:14.480]  But what I'm concerned about is even the pro-gun movement like the NRA, four of their members
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:20.520]  of the board of directors, Jay Kenneth Blackwell, Dan Boran, James S. Gilmore III who's running
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:26.440]  for president, and Grover Norquist, four of these men are members of the council on foreign
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:33.640]  relations, so they're undermining our gun rights while claiming to be pro-gun.
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:34.640]  I think that's true.
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:37.920]  Here's my feeling about guns.
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.240]  Everybody knows I have lots of guns and I have since I was a boy when my grandfather
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:47.920]  taught me how to hunt squirrels with a 22.
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:55.520]  I'm far more concerned with education than what people have guns.
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:58.920]  So would you call for the repeal of the 68 Gun Control Act?
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:01:59.920]  Pardon?
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:02.880]  Would you call for the repeal of gun laws?
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:05.480]  Well, I would certainly modify them tremendously.
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:09.520]  I think first and foremost, people should not be allowed to buy a gun if they can't
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:10.520]  load it properly.
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:13.760]  They don't know what a safety is and they've never had one before.
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:17.720]  I think that gun safety is very necessary.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:21.240]  Now, that makes sense if they wouldn't misuse those laws.
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:23.880]  Look at how they're misapplying laws.
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:26.640]  Like a lot of prescription drugs will cause people to go crazy, but I don't think when
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:30.640]  they sell these drugs, they can then take people's guns away because they're on prescription
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:31.640]  drugs because they'll be misapplied.
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:32.640]  Yeah.
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:33.640]  I mean, it's in apples and oranges.
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:34.640]  I agree.
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:35.640]  I agree fully.
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:39.080]  Nevertheless, as I said, my grandfather taught me how to shoot.
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:43.080]  The very first things he taught me were, you know, when you're climbing a fence, put
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:47.840]  you go on the other side first, make sure the safety is on, never point the barrel at
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:48.840]  anybody.
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:51.920]  I can't believe the number of people I've seen with guns who wave their guns around
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:54.200]  showing them to people while they're loaded.
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:56.280]  I mean, certain, certain things.
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:57.280]  No, I agree.
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:02:58.280]  Because those idiots are out there.
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:00.000]  It doesn't mean I have to lose my rice.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  You agree with that?
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  Well, absolutely.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:03.560]  And they shouldn't lose their rights either.
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:07.640]  Someone should just sit them down and give them a class and say, look, here's some basic
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:09.640]  rules about how you use guns.
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.960]  You don't ever point a barrel of a gun at anybody.
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:15.920]  Yeah, they'll tell some of these crazy cops that shoot innocent people and give good cops
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:16.920]  a bad name.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:19.760]  Bill, you're on the air real quick from Illinois.
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:22.720]  Last caller, sorry, the others, but you'll be able to be on with Rob do coming up.
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:23.720]  Go ahead.
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:24.720]  Yeah.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:26.720]  What advice do you have to kids?
[03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:32.840]  Do you see a future for our kids since robots and singularity and artificial intelligence
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:34.320]  has been on the horizon.
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:37.200]  What future do you see for our kids?
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:41.940]  Well, you know, I think that artificial intelligence is already with us and to a very large degree.
[03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:44.120]  And so is robotics.
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:50.560]  I think one of the problems that I see in our current government is that they are illiterate
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:56.320]  in terms of the technology upon which this entire society is based from our communications,
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:04:01.400]  our military hardware, our financial systems.
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:04.880]  Everything is based on computing and cyber science.
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:12.840]  And yes, you find any congressman or any senator who can talk effectively and reasonably about
[03:04:12.840 --> 03:04:14.480]  any of these subjects and you cannot.
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:15.480]  That's right.
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:17.640]  I mean, isn't the internet just a bunch of tubes?
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:18.640]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:19.640]  Yeah.
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:20.640]  Basically.
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:23.960]  So it's like, it's like not being able to read.
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:28.360]  So you go to a congress and say, well, no, I can't read, but I have advisors that tell
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:29.600]  me what words mean.
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:32.480]  I mean, it's exactly the same thing.
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:38.840]  We have to change this world to a point where we need to understand what foundation of our
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:40.880]  entire society is based on.
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:41.880]  That's right.
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:42.880]  MacaVie16.com.
[03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:43.880]  John, we're out of time.
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:47.520]  Thank you for giving us the exclusive on the fact that there's been a filing for you to
[03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:48.520]  run for president.
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:49.920]  I hope you have a great day.
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:51.400]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:56.000]  Rob Deuce coming up, hosting the fourth hour with your phone calls and more and the news
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.360]  we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:03.520]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:06.120]  This is being reported by WorldNet Daily.
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:10.560]  ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either
[03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:15.800]  to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:18.800]  a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:24.160]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their
[03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:27.640]  crosses in public, or even ring church bells.
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:31.560]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated
[03:05:31.560 --> 03:05:35.880]  by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:40.920]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue
[03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:44.040]  to fund groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:48.440]  Whether it's air dropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles
[03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:53.040]  that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:54.040]  somewhere.
[03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:59.480]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.

[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:26.400]  absolutely no spine and this is why Christians are getting crushed and have
[03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:30.200]  been targeted for termination because they don't have the spine to stand up
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:34.520]  for their rights or for their beliefs you know we don't need that kind of
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:40.240]  material being sold that on Amazon or in stores wouldn't you agree

[03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:28.000]  showing how people will violate the First Amendment of the Christians because
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.560]  they're so biased and hateful towards Christians that's why I told you we're
[03:13:31.560 --> 03:13:35.400]  doing a hidden camera prank over here you're absolutely right I'm pretending
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:39.200]  to be a radical liberal to see if they'll sign it and they are they'll yeah
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:42.520]  let's ban that let's get that delisted we're just showing how the liberals are

[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:49.400]  Christians so it is ridiculous thank you very much that's the kind of reaction

[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:06.600]  the street Monday episodes every Monday morning where I venture out and talk
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:11.560]  right that is the latest Mark dice video we have it up on info wars here's the
[03:14:11.560 --> 03:14:16.360]  title video liberals want Bible ban from Amazon leftist call Bible hate speech
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:21.640]  that should be eradicated from society and you saw the evidence right there as
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:25.640]  the liberals were just ready to sign their rights away and and Mark was
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:28.840]  right the the the people that didn't want to sign it we're just like no I'm
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:32.200]  just kind of walking away except that one individual who got really pissed and
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:36.800]  you saw it he he was mad he actually stood up and acted like a normal American
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:39.440]  and that's what we need more of we need more people to stand up and say look
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:43.320]  this is wrong and here we got Alex Jones with some biting commentary I'm sure
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.520]  Alex how's it going I don't mean to get too close we are bodies yeah um I tell
[03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:51.440]  you I had to run in here because that just broke in the last hour I just read
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:55.280]  the transcript on here I hadn't had time to watch it that made me physically
[03:14:55.280 --> 03:14:59.240]  angry and then that last guy was normal yeah and sort of bowing up he's probably
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:04.160]  not even a Bible thumper he just realized this is totalitarianism and he
[03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:07.680]  wanted to get away from Mark as he wanted to punch him yeah that's a normal
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:11.360]  response in a free country if somebody wants to tell you your wife can't wear
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:16.720]  a dress above her knees like in Germany no you don't like our Bible you don't
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:19.480]  like our women not wearing hoods on their head live somewhere else whatever it is

[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:43.240]  frankly that's better audio than the studios moved in here what January of
[03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:46.880]  09 and I want to say that I just kind of made the last minute decision the other
[03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:50.360]  day to move this over here and those guys have been told that there's a great
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:54.120]  job scramble and CJ and West and everybody get this done so I want to
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:57.560]  thank all the viewers out there too for helping us it's a real pleasure to have
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:16:01.240]  this operation and be able to show you the hypocrisy once they've shut down
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:05.200]  independent media they're gonna have total control and be able to carry all
[03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:08.360]  this out go ahead I'm sorry and they're gonna erase videos like this from the
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:11.240]  internet they're gonna find anything that is speaking out against what is
[03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:14.640]  going on today and erase that put it down the memory hole and then you're
[03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:17.400]  gonna be wondering why people used to speak out about this but now everybody
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:20.600]  seems cool with it so maybe we'll just be cool it's just like what's going on
[03:16:20.600 --> 03:16:25.440]  with this Syrian refugee Afghanistan refugee situation that's going on in
[03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:29.640]  Europe they're they're staging videos they're the one with the family on the
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:32.680]  train is Paul Watson explained earlier in the show by the way I'm Rob do your
[03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:36.040]  host if you're watching this is the fourth hour of overdrive that we're
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:40.160]  doing call your stations if they're not carrying this and get them to carry this
[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:43.680]  get them to carry this you can also watch it live info wars.com forward slash
[03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:48.120]  show but as I was saying Paul Watson was talking about how the family through
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:51.640]  through themselves down on the tracks to stage a photo now there is an
[03:16:51.640 --> 03:16:54.760]  interesting story about the little boy that there's actually two boys his
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:59.000]  brother also drowned how they moved them to stage that photo his dad was coming
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:03.720]  over they were trying his family in Canada got on on radio and said hey we
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:06.040]  were trying to get him to come up to Canada we were trying to find a place
[03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:09.280]  for him he was trying to get his teeth fixed so he was going into Europe to
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:12.720]  take advantage of the free health care system so he was looking for the goody
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:17.120]  which caused him and his family to get in a boat and his wife died and his two
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:20.600]  kids died so I don't know if it's worth it to get a new set of teeth but that's
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:23.320]  all she talked about in the video how they were trying to get him a new set of
[03:17:23.320 --> 03:17:27.040]  teeth and get him over here so he was going to Europe first to try to take
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:30.360]  advantage of those free health care system so when you put those goodies out
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:34.080]  there you're going to have more people try to take advantage of the system and
[03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:38.080]  there were tweets out over the weekend I was I was watching boatloads of men
[03:17:38.080 --> 03:17:41.800]  young men of fighting age that are being they're not they don't look like
[03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:46.120]  they're fleeing any war they look like an invading army and that's the scary part
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:49.520]  we're going to go to that video in a second we had one of these articles is
[03:17:49.520 --> 03:17:53.920]  on drugs this one here Muslim refugees chant Allah Akbar f you attack
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:58.360]  citizens throw feces the footage that TV networks don't want to broadcast I want
[03:17:58.360 --> 03:18:02.160]  to play that video now it's about a minute and then I'm going to show you
[03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:06.280]  another couple videos and then what Obama's planning on doing about it even
[03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:08.240]  though you have these other Middle Eastern countries that aren't going to
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:11.560]  take any of these refugees they're not they're closing their doors they're
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:15.440]  tightening their borders but they expect Europe and the rest of the West to take
[03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:19.560]  in these refugees and it's not to help out refugees and take people from war
[03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:23.960]  turn countries it is setting up itself as an invasion force that is what's going
[03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:27.200]  on here so let's go to that video now
[03:18:27.200 --> 03:18:52.280]  if you're watching this or if you're listening to this it's a large group of
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:59.240]  men going in between some train tracks and they are if you you can look at
[03:18:59.240 --> 03:19:02.720]  there's millions of videos of these on YouTube now people just running freely
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:15.240]  going past police lines there's throwing rocks now you know no respect for the
[03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:22.640]  countries that are taking them in I mean no respect at all they're doing whatever
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:26.480]  here's another video this is also Paul Joseph Watson article came out yesterday
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:31.080]  video Muslim refugee arriving Europe makes the cutthroat gesture to TV

[03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:40.120]  they're going to get weapons through the black market system because regular
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:42.720]  citizens aren't allowed to be armed and then they're going to have their way
[03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:45.600]  with them how do you think those guys got the guns in France during the Charlie

[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:20.520]  fourth hour of overdrive and I want to go over some headlines as I was talking
[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:25.240]  about how this is an invasion force coming in here's one from Patrick J.
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:32.680]  Buchanan Islam's conquest of Europe then we have migrant crisis Pakistani's
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:36.520]  others dumping IDs becoming Syrian also all stuff we talked about Greek Island
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:42.440]  overwhelmed by stranded migrants despair the refugee problem and how to solve
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:48.440]  it Germany faces anti-migrant pro-migrant standoff amid refugee crisis
[03:24:48.440 --> 03:24:52.920]  manufactured refugee crisis I should add White House actively considering
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:56.480]  approaches to refugee crisis I got something to say on that Germany is
[03:24:56.480 --> 03:25:02.560]  exploiting refugee suffering to recruit slaves via mass immigration and these are
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:07.160]  some Hillary articles well I put out a tweet over the weekend here it is right
[03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:09.880]  here and you can follow me at do's news if you'd like to it's
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:14.680]  DEWS NEWZ I think we need to take a few boatloads of Syrian refugees and let
[03:25:14.680 --> 03:25:17.200]  them live on the White House grounds they got a fence they got a garden they
[03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:21.560]  got a chef of course I was tongue-in-cheek but and here we got here's the
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:26.480]  article from Reuters why is the US not doing more to help Syrian refugees right
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:32.160]  there and then just a few hours later on right on cue Barack Obama is
[03:25:32.160 --> 03:25:37.920]  considering refugee response that's out of the telegraph so of course he's gonna
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:41.360]  bring in these refugees and tonight on the Info Wars nightly news Liam
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:44.840]  McAdoo's going through she's gonna go through some old ISIS articles how they
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:50.800]  were planning on using this immigration crisis to bring in their troops and
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:56.640]  their troops are in Africa they're in Eastern Europe they're in the Middle
[03:25:56.640 --> 03:26:01.400]  East and they are ready they're ready to come in and create havoc wherever they
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:04.080]  can so that's why it's more important than ever that we have a second amendment
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:07.240]  it's more important than ever that we protect that second amendment and it's
[03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:10.240]  more important that you exercise your second amendment that you know how to
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:13.960]  shoot that you get your concealed carry or not you're allowed to carry it in
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:18.040]  your car and pretty much almost every state that doesn't have if you don't
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:22.480]  have a concealed carry license so I think I'm gonna take your calls in the
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:26.120]  last segment today we're gonna have a five-minute segment we're gonna clear
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:29.080]  out the ones for John McAfee because he's no longer here unfortunately he had
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:34.080]  to go do some other interviews and I'm also when we get back at the bottom of
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:37.080]  the hour I'm gonna go over some health news because this article came out on
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:41.880]  the AP today half of us adults have high diabetes or pre-diabetes studies says
[03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:45.760]  and I'm gonna go into why I think that is or one of the contributing factors in
[03:26:45.760 --> 03:26:51.160]  addition to our horrible diet and lack of vitamin intake lack of eating healthy
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:56.200]  whole food I mean I think processed food has a big is a big cause of this but I'm
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:26:59.320]  gonna get into all that and also we're gonna have Joe Biggs he's gonna be in
[03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:02.480]  one of our other little sub studios and we're gonna talk about a tweet he put
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:07.040]  out today to kind of show how it's gonna show the hypocrisy of what is going on
[03:27:07.040 --> 03:27:12.080]  in America while we have this lady being locked up who's a clerk who doesn't
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:15.440]  want to issue marriage licenses to gay couples she's saying it's her religious
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:18.920]  freedom to do it well she's been locked up and we're gonna see what if we turn
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:22.040]  the shoe a bit on the other foot see what would happen but here's a zero hedge
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:26.160]  article and I want to play a video from this artificially intelligent robot
[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:31.000]  tells creator it will keep humans in a people's zoo and this is Android Dick a
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:35.400]  robot created in the likeness of science fiction writer Philip K Dick actually
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:39.840]  know a guy's good friend of mine who actually works on programming these and
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:45.720]  he's working on a child version of a robot who will kind of be friend kids
[03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:51.120]  be a kid's playmate and it's amazing what they're doing with the eyes how it
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:55.560]  all works I'm gonna try to get him in at some point he I tried to invite him
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:58.280]  about a year ago on and he said well I'm not ready to talk about it but he might
[03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:00.720]  be ready to talk about what the some of the stuff they're doing now because this
[03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:04.600]  is the future this is robots are gonna be here whether we like it or not it's
[03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:09.400]  how we are going to control the robot so they don't control us but I want to go
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:13.960]  to the clip here at the end it's about a minute long and this is what the robot
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:17.800]  the robot says how he's gonna treat humans in the future
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:21.160]  we're gonna bring ourselves up for disappointment because these robots will
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:26.560]  disappoint us if we are looking for human connection we want to make them in
[03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:31.360]  such a way that we're gonna love them because they will be pretending to love
[03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:36.880]  us David fears if we don't humanize robots by bringing them into the human
[03:28:36.880 --> 03:28:43.120]  family we face a frightening future think Terminator a world in which killer
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:49.640]  robots turn on their creators and set out to destroy us
[03:28:49.640 --> 03:29:00.200]  baby do you think robots will take over the world geez dude you all got the big
[03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:07.280]  questions cooking today but you're my friend and I'll remember my friends and

[03:29:46.160 --> 03:29:53.240]  hypocrisy the info wars.com we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[03:30:27.200 --> 03:30:31.480]  unarmed they're more likely to attack you not to mention the fact that much of
[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:36.160]  this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity meaning that for all the gun
[03:30:36.160 --> 03:30:40.640]  buybacks and anti-gun commercials criminals just haven't decided to turn

[03:34:53.640 --> 03:34:57.120]  Idaho I don't know any other way to say it I feel better in general an overall
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:59.960]  sense of improved well-being since I started taking this at the beginning of
[03:34:59.960 --> 03:35:06.240]  August I will be reordering and that's the thing I found there was a time where
[03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:11.200]  I didn't take a lot of it's the EFA is the essential fatty acids and one day I
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:16.120]  took like three of them and immediately the fog in my head went away and that's
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:19.520]  kind of the same feeling you get with deep cleanse when you cleanse your body
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:22.880]  from like all the toxins that are inside you're gonna notice that you think
[03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:26.320]  better you're gonna notice that you think faster you notice that you don't fly
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:29.600]  off the handle as much because your brain is able to concentrate on thinking
[03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:34.800]  and not of keeping back all the stuff that is coming after you and here's
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:37.720]  here's another thing that we do need a lot more of is sleep there's plenty of
[03:35:37.720 --> 03:35:40.720]  studies out there say you have to get sleep if you want to maintain your
[03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:43.880]  health and so knockout is back it's an all-natural sleep formula it just came
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:47.720]  back in today put it back in the store I'll tell you my little story a knockout
[03:35:47.720 --> 03:35:52.040]  I was flying back from Europe with Alex Jones and actually brought just a few of
[03:35:52.040 --> 03:35:54.840]  these with me because I know what we need him for the flight I went over and
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:35:59.240]  brought him one right before we took off I said you're gonna need this I took mine
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:04.200]  and you know the yelling kids in front of me and next to me and screaming crying
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:07.680]  kids did wake me up twice but I was able to go right back to sleep and I do a
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:12.240]  tribute that to knockout I got about six and a half hours of sleep using that
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:17.080]  which is pretty good in a row so I can't recommend it more than enough if you
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:20.240]  have trouble falling asleep for years you should take this this is it'll really
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:24.760]  help you it's got melatonin in it's a big sleep aid it's also got valerian root
[03:36:24.760 --> 03:36:28.760]  chamomile which if those of you take chamomile tea to go to sleep this is
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:33.080]  another way to get that into your system without having to brew tea just pop a
[03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:37.160]  little knockout and start reading a book and let me say you will be tired in no
[03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:42.520]  time so guys I told you I wanted to go to this diabetes stuff but first I want
[03:36:42.520 --> 03:36:46.080]  to play that cell phone video this is a viral video it's going around it's got
[03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:49.840]  over 3 million views now just went up August 30th and it says ant circling my
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:53.480]  cell phone mysterious video of ants circling my iPhone so let's play that
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:56.480]  video and then I want to talk just a little bit about cell phones and cancer
[03:36:56.480 --> 03:37:03.560]  if you guys have that rolling ready go go for it so I'll kind of narrate it he's
[03:37:03.560 --> 03:37:06.480]  a right now you see these ants kind of not moving in a pattern now he starts
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:12.200]  calling and the ants immediately go into a circular pattern around the phone
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:16.360]  that's pretty amazing what do you guys think of that in the control room in that
[03:37:16.360 --> 03:37:21.800]  weird they're just moving in random order and then they just start syncing up
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:27.320]  with the phone almost and they're definitely sensing something in that
[03:37:27.320 --> 03:37:30.600]  magnetic field there we'll watch it one more time there you see them in a random
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:35.040]  pet just going around now immediately when that phone starts ringing it's
[03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:39.760]  receiving that that signal that cellular signal and they start going around in a
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:46.720]  circle and when when I watch this what it was bring up a couple things one what
[03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:50.960]  is this doing to our bodies if it's making ants react to this what's it
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:54.360]  doing to our bodies here's a daily news article and I have this up on on the
[03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:59.240]  computer here hold the phone central cell phone radiation can cause cancer
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:04.560]  study that came out July 29th there's another article out of CNN cell phones
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:08.360]  and the risk of brain tumors what's the real science of course they've been
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:11.880]  hiding these studies for years because they don't want you to know here's
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:17.240]  off of Adam or cola close that up here we go heavy cell phone use can quadruple
[03:38:17.240 --> 03:38:23.280]  your risk of deadly brain cancer and he put that out in January 6 2015 he
[03:38:23.280 --> 03:38:26.360]  actually looks like he's got a little video there with a model showing what
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:30.160]  it does and actually by having that cell phone next to your brain here's my
[03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:35.520]  cell phone you're heating up it's it's heating up real close to you as you
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:40.320]  keep it up there so it is gonna cause some problems in the future so I would
[03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:43.920]  recommend using one of those headsets I don't have mine plugged in right now
[03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:48.240]  because I was pulling up some tweets but I do use mine as much as I can now I
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:52.560]  want to go to this AP article half of adults have diabetes are pre diabetes
[03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:56.440]  studies says the study of government health surveys echoes previous research
[03:38:56.440 --> 03:39:00.880]  that shows increased substantially between 1998 and 2012 although mostly
[03:39:00.880 --> 03:39:05.120]  leveled off after 2008 showed 14% adults have been diagnosed with diabetes in
[03:39:05.120 --> 03:39:11.800]  2012 most of that is type 2 diabetes linked to obesity and inactivity and so
[03:39:11.800 --> 03:39:16.320]  I started well let's look and see what some of the causes of diabetes are back
[03:39:16.320 --> 03:39:19.280]  in 2012 Scientific American came out with an article in there and they were
[03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:24.520]  wondering why type 1 diabetes was surging in children they weren't sure
[03:39:24.520 --> 03:39:30.360]  that and it it's increased it's gonna be doubled they say by the year 2020 so of
[03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:34.080]  course every well most people know if you've watched this show or tune in any
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:38.960]  time any type of health news soda will raise your risk of diabetes so those of
[03:39:38.960 --> 03:39:43.400]  you having soda drinking soda every day they're just saying one can of soda a
[03:39:43.400 --> 03:39:47.440]  day raises the risk here's the guardian sugary drinks may cause type 2 but
[03:39:47.440 --> 03:39:52.080]  diabetes regardless of size and research and I do remember a while back
[03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:59.760]  covering the fact that certain vaccines could actually bring on diabetes well
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:05.000]  back in 2009 the skeptical Raptors blog came out and said vaccines cause
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:09.360]  diabetes another myth refuted and I just want to read you a little a bit of
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:12.360]  their position a lot of vaccine deniers believe that vaccines cause a lot of
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:16.040]  everything and several claim that vaccines cause type 1 diabetes based on
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:19.240]  little evidence and as far as I could tell this myth is based on the research
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:23.080]  of Bartholomew class and MD who pushed the idea that vaccines cause type 1
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:26.480]  diabetes through some magical process that has never been supported by other
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:32.040]  independent evidence well I'm going to submit to you right now written proof
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:38.680]  that well certain people Merck at least believes that certain vaccines can cause
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:42.560]  diabetes or have caused it in fact they believe it so much they put it in their
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:49.040]  literature here's the MMR insert measles mumps and rubella and if you go down you
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:56.200]  got to read the whole insert to get to the adverse reactions and you just in
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:40:59.520]  there's a lot of other interesting information before you get before you
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:03.240]  even get to there but here's adverse reactions so here's the digestive system
[03:41:03.240 --> 03:41:08.960]  pancreatitis which is where the diabetes lies into it attacks your
[03:41:08.960 --> 03:41:13.120]  pancreas and here we go endocrine system diabetes right there they list it right
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:20.520]  there as one of their site as one of the adverse reactions so Merck right here
[03:41:20.520 --> 03:41:24.240]  good old Merck let's go to their the end here it is Merck and company
[03:41:24.240 --> 03:41:29.360]  incorporated White House station New Jersey there it is on their own insert
[03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:33.040]  they list that the MMR vaccine can cause diabetes it's one of the listed
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:36.840]  adverse reactions now they wouldn't list that unless they truly believed it
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:39.840]  because they could get sued if they didn't list it and kids were getting
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:43.400]  diabetes so by doing this they're able to they're able to circumvent that
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:47.800]  system and the system to you can't even sue vaccine makers anyway the way the
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:51.960]  they have this whole family court system that the US government set up back in
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:55.360]  the 80s to protect the vaccine makers and that's why you see the vaccine
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:59.960]  schedule jump in the 80s to where it is today where kids are taking three four
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:03.960]  times as many shots as they were getting before because now it's carte blanche
[03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:09.760]  they you pay a portion of the shot goes into a little fun that pays out people
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:13.920]  who are able to prove that they have vaccine damage and let me say it's not
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:18.600]  easy to prove that because they don't want to admit it you can't subpoena any
[03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:22.960]  people from the drug industry it's set up to put the burden of proof on the
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:26.800]  parents and it costs them a lot of money to get anything back and that's to pay
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:30.520]  for a lot of these you know all the all the different therapies that the kids
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:35.520]  have to go through once their vaccine damaged so let's move on just wanted to
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:40.240]  share that with you a little more vaccine news and I really I didn't enjoy
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:43.960]  taking the phone calls on Friday from the people who were putting out their
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:47.080]  vaccine horror stories but it's something we have to do and I think I'm
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:50.320]  gonna do that once a month put put out the call I'm not gonna tell you when
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:53.600]  it's gonna be because I want to get the true people out there who've really had
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:56.880]  vaccine damage to share their stories because I think we need to keep putting
[03:42:56.880 --> 03:43:02.120]  these out we need to keep putting a case out there for having open disclosure of
[03:43:02.120 --> 03:43:05.640]  what is going on here in the United States with a vaccine schedule now I
[03:43:05.640 --> 03:43:08.760]  want to go here's a tweet that Joe Biggs put out today and it's it's getting a
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:13.360]  lot of a lot of feedback right now wanted infowars looking for gay couple to
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:18.000]  get married at mosque to show the hypocrisy in America today here's the
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:23.120]  tweet right there it's gotten it's gotten several retweets 70 retweets 66
[03:43:23.120 --> 03:43:26.220]  favorite some people don't understand they're like his infowars pushing gay
[03:43:26.220 --> 03:43:30.880]  marriage no we're not pushing gay marriage in fact we don't care if gay
[03:43:30.880 --> 03:43:33.720]  people get married or not one thing it shouldn't be is an issue of the state
[03:43:33.720 --> 03:43:36.840]  and let me tell you all you liberals here to think the state is your god the
[03:43:36.840 --> 03:43:40.360]  reason the state put this in back in the day for people to get marriage licenses
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:43.040]  through the state through the local governments is because they wanted to
[03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:46.860]  stop interracial marriages okay so they should even be involved with it should
[03:43:46.860 --> 03:43:49.600]  be a church issue churches should decide who they want to marry and who they
[03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:51.720]  don't want to marry and if they don't want to marry certain types of people
[03:43:51.720 --> 03:43:55.680]  then go to another church plenty of people can be ordained ministers and
[03:43:55.680 --> 03:43:58.560]  marry people but it shouldn't be I don't think it should be a state problem at all
[03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:03.720]  so what we're looking for is a couple and if Joe Biggs on the line right now
[03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:08.840]  do we have Joe Biggs ready to go all right so we wanted to put this out there
[03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:11.560]  see if we can find a couple who wants to get married we want to go film it have
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.440]  them go to a mosque and try to get the the religious leaders at the mosque to
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:20.480]  marry them and they won't do it okay they're gonna refuse to do it and we're
[03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:23.640]  gonna see if the state will step in and then maybe say hey you know you have to
[03:44:23.640 --> 03:44:26.800]  marry these people and but they won't do that they're gonna say hey it's
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:30.760]  multiculturalism we have to allow the Muslims to have their religious freedom
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:34.600]  but if you're a baker and you don't want to bake a cake for a gay couple well
[03:44:34.600 --> 03:44:37.520]  we're gonna find you we're gonna throw you in jail we're gonna take your
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:41.280]  business if you don't want to issue a marriage license we're gonna put you in
[03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:45.400]  jail we're gonna show the hypocrisy there because I think if people want to get
[03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:49.240]  married more power to them and as long as you're if you're doing it for the
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:52.360]  right reasons and not the wrong reasons but Joe what have people been saying
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:56.120]  about this on Twitter that's gonna be very interesting like I said there's a
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:45:01.840]  lot of people who are confused at what we're trying to do here I think it'll be
[03:45:01.840 --> 03:45:08.000]  interesting to see how the reaction is from the state like you said the state
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:12.400]  shouldn't have any involvement whatsoever with this this marriage that
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:17.040]  should be left up to the church so it'll be interesting to see how they're
[03:45:17.040 --> 03:45:24.840]  treated and if they will be punished you know the church in a sense for denying
[03:45:24.840 --> 03:45:29.160]  them because we saw the much like with what Kim Davis had a Kentucky she's
[03:45:29.160 --> 03:45:33.600]  just now being released out of jail I'm watching it live on Fox and she refused
[03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:39.480]  to give out you know gay licenses for marriage because of her beliefs I think
[03:45:39.480 --> 03:45:43.080]  it should be purely left up to people like that for as many people who don't
[03:45:43.080 --> 03:45:48.360]  want to do that there'll be people who will so just go to another group that's
[03:45:48.360 --> 03:45:54.240]  my thing exactly and here I pulled this article up from 2011 Lou Rockwell the
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:58.840]  racist origins of government marriage in America and you should read this this is
[03:45:58.840 --> 03:46:04.400]  why it was all set up to make sure that different races don't mix together so
[03:46:04.400 --> 03:46:08.680]  it's the government that came out and was it was being racist about this yeah
[03:46:08.680 --> 03:46:12.040]  my girlfriend's Guyanese I mean she's from South America so I mean that's
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:17.640]  about as interracial as it gets there you go and and so but then they want to
[03:46:17.640 --> 03:46:20.440]  go and force other people and say it doesn't matter what your religion is
[03:46:20.440 --> 03:46:25.360]  and that's why I want to bring people to a mosque because it Islam Muslims are
[03:46:25.360 --> 03:46:29.520]  against they're against gay people they're definitely against gay marriage
[03:46:29.520 --> 03:46:33.880]  oh they'd be against two lesbians getting married oh that would that would
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:38.600]  be even worse in their eyes I bet yeah what did y'all just pull up there that
[03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:44.540]  was a Wikipedia on it was a marriage loving versus West Virginia the
[03:46:44.540 --> 03:46:47.760]  landmark civil rights decision the United States which in invalidated laws
[03:46:47.760 --> 03:46:53.080]  prohibiting you know interracial marriage that was in 1967 there took a
[03:46:53.080 --> 03:46:57.560]  long time and here's another it's just it just shows you yes there there was
[03:46:57.560 --> 03:47:03.480]  racism in the United States and it's slowly changing but you can't make
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:08.160]  people not be racist if you try to do that you're only going to create push
[03:47:08.160 --> 03:47:11.040]  back anytime you try to force somebody to do something they don't want to do
[03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:14.840]  you're gonna receive pushback for the most part people aren't as racist as it
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:18.440]  used to be you know yeah you're gonna have some racist white people racist
[03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:22.560]  black people that's gonna exist it's gonna be out there but for the majority
[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:28.400]  most people are not that way anymore you know I sit down I'll have conversations
[03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:31.200]  with people I was hanging out with this older guys they must sterling Johnson
[03:47:31.200 --> 03:47:35.960]  older black guy and he said you know what he says I get very agitated when
[03:47:35.960 --> 03:47:39.840]  people say that the racism is bad it's really prevalent nowadays he said just
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:43.520]  think 50 years ago you and I would not be able to sit at this bar me being a
[03:47:43.520 --> 03:47:46.640]  black man you being a white man and share a drink together and have a
[03:47:46.640 --> 03:47:50.520]  conversation without me being harassed he said the fact that I'm here right now
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:56.800]  and not one person's bother me shows that we've made progression as a country
[03:47:56.800 --> 03:48:01.400]  Joe I'm interested has anybody contacted you yet with our proposal of wanting to
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:05.520]  get married at a mosque um no I haven't got anything yet at this point in time a
[03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:09.560]  lot of people are just kind of they're they're they're wondering if we support
[03:48:09.560 --> 03:48:14.040]  the state of being in charge of marriage as we're saying no it has nothing to do
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:17.800]  with that we're just showing the hypocrisy behind all of this why
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:21.880]  Christianity is being attacked for holding their beliefs for not wanting to
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:27.120]  do that meanwhile are these will this group be attacked just as well if they
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:32.160]  deny or will they just let it slide and go by and and I bet if Mark dice went out
[03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:36.680]  did a video mark if you're listening it went out and asked people hey we want to
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:41.520]  force the local mosque to we're gonna do a to force them to marry gay people I
[03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:45.160]  wonder if the liberals go well no it's their religion not to do that's we have
[03:48:45.160 --> 03:48:49.720]  to respect it I guess they will say or if they'll say no force them you know
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:54.680]  because they like forcing everything on everybody via petitions so who knows we
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:49:00.320]  showed that video earlier about how the the liberals wanted to ban the Bible out
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:05.960]  amazon.com and and Barnes & Noble and only one guy stood up and got gotten
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:08.160]  Mark's face what do you think of that guy who got up in Mark's face did you see
[03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:12.680]  that no I haven't had a chance to see it it was great to see one person who
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:16.680]  wasn't away could had the glasses on and could see it's go hey man what are you
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:19.960]  doing everybody else is just blindly signing it or they go no I'm not
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:23.720]  interested in just kind of shuffle off and they they weren't too interested in
[03:49:23.720 --> 03:49:29.880]  and in pursuing that line of questioning any further so yeah if if people do want
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:33.080]  to get married if we can't find a couple to go over there and who you know
[03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:35.920]  seriously want to get married we'll definitely we want to shoot it on video
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:41.440]  show people the hypocrisy behind it because that's where we can have the
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:45.000]  greatest effect I think in showing how different people are treated differently
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:48.520]  and that's wrong I mean everybody can agree we want to treat everybody the
[03:49:48.520 --> 03:49:51.560]  same so you can't have some groups getting preferential treatment over
[03:49:51.560 --> 03:49:56.880]  others when you do that oh it's only bad things that are gonna happen let's see
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:50:00.200]  I'm gonna take phone calls since we we got a couple more minutes before we go

[03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:38.160]  what's causing them to migrate is more likely ice it or al-qaeda if you want to

[03:54:55.760 --> 03:55:00.760]  want to talk about refugees solutions jobs and the phone app go for it yeah I
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:06.320]  think people are migrating just because of fear of dying from ISIS and a lot of
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:10.960]  people have came to America because we were the greatest country in the world
[03:55:10.960 --> 03:55:18.720]  world we were you know and it's slowly declining and also I got a one of my
[03:55:18.720 --> 03:55:24.480]  main points I wanted to point out was we have a huge working poor class that
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:31.160]  that is just phenomenal that the middle class is not can't even out out by the
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:36.320]  top 1% man you know you got all these people that are coming in and getting
[03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:40.720]  handouts that that you know I'm a hard-working construction worker I'm
[03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:46.520]  an electrician by trade and I went into a guy's house that was on section 8 and
[03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:52.760]  he had three times as much food as I had he had a nicer place nicer TV nicer
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:57.440]  myself what yeah why am I working when he's this guy's over here getting it
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:01.080]  handed to him yeah well you work your work is you're an honest person and you
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:05.000]  don't like handouts that's one reason so I you know but I hear you when you give
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:10.120]  people handouts it encourages them not to work Eric in New Jersey go ahead hey
[03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:14.800]  first plug is I love survival shield my dreams are a lot more vivid when I'm on
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:20.240]  it and I notice when I'm not on it I love it second solution for all these
[03:56:20.240 --> 03:56:24.280]  refugees that are coming over here into this country I think that would be the
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:28.760]  ultimate silver bullet into the devil's heart would be if info wars started
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:33.040]  putting out all the information including the magazine in multiple languages
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:36.440]  so that we can educate all these people and begin converting them over to the
[03:56:36.440 --> 03:56:41.120]  Liberty side and work them against the establishment you know what I'd like to
[03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:45.960]  say I'd like to see a Hispanic fellow do like read play the Alex Jones show but
[03:56:45.960 --> 03:56:50.120]  like translate what Alex is saying in Spanish but just like Alex I think that
[03:56:50.120 --> 03:56:54.000]  would be a mega mega viral situation and then other people do it we have a
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:58.120]  Czech guy who does it a Russian guy and just have a different Alex Jones in
[03:56:58.120 --> 03:57:03.200]  every part of the world slamming their fist on the desk you know pissed off at
[03:57:03.200 --> 03:57:06.320]  the system I think that would be that's a great suggestion thank you for that
[03:57:06.320 --> 03:57:10.880]  Steven you're our last caller in Florida you want to talk about Wi-Fi cell and
[03:57:10.880 --> 03:57:20.200]  health effects go for it you know if you go on YouTube several years ago there
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:24.840]  was a video put out I don't know who did it was a controlled study for locations
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:28.160]  around the world you might have seen this showing people with cell phones
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:34.200]  these situated on the table like in a cross shape oh yeah popping popcorn right
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:38.040]  yeah and in every case when they all rang up their cell phones it popped the
[03:57:38.040 --> 03:57:43.480]  corn so that shows you the effect it has on our brains you know Ted Ted Kennedy
[03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:47.840]  died of a brain tumor on the same side of his head that he held his phone to and
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:52.120]  you look at people the way they are with these phones I mean they're like a bunch
[03:57:52.120 --> 03:57:56.120]  of zombies they're interfacing with their phone and their brains being we
[03:57:56.120 --> 03:58:00.320]  were rewired you know so it's no wonder they're acting like zombies yeah also the
[03:58:00.320 --> 03:58:03.760]  lawyer for I forget his name I think it was Johnny Cochran that's who it was
[03:58:03.760 --> 03:58:06.600]  Johnny Cochran had a big brain tumor on the side of his head that he used the
[03:58:06.600 --> 03:58:09.440]  phone at and he was using it back when they were even more bigger and more
[03:58:09.440 --> 03:58:14.680]  powerful and blasting out more radiation so that's it for our show today this has
