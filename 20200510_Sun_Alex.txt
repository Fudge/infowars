[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  you have to do every single thing i say or we will not make it understand do you
[00:12.320 --> 00:18.480]  understand come with me if you want to live come with me if you want to live

[01:11.680 --> 01:16.880]  they were all asymptomatic the guy goes that's even worse
[01:19.440 --> 01:23.920]  that means they spread it we don't know and i went no no no no it means it's not that deadly
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.520]  and the guy's like i don't believe it so i try not to carry this little

[01:44.400 --> 01:48.720]  deadly and i said yeah hear about those doctors out in uh california that own a bunch of clinics
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.000]  saying it's a lower death rate the flu off the nih's own numbers and he goes no i didn't hear
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.320]  about it i said well you can't hear about it now youtube took it down does that sound right to you

[02:04.880 --> 02:09.600]  you were crazy but now my husband and i know you're right we were just talking about you this morning
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.880]  i go in to get my tacos it's a little grocery store they make them at the back

[02:35.040 --> 02:39.280]  whether you want them or not but make you accept it be able to travel around and live your life
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.760]  this is their full revolution against us this is the globalist move
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.280]  and so we don't want to have stock home syndrome and learn helplessness
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.840]  and i'm going to lay it all out for you today did you know starting five years ago in sweden
[02:55.840 --> 03:03.440]  they also do in other countries that you get free bus rides if you take an implantable microchip
[03:03.440 --> 03:10.160]  and last time i read more than 10 000 people in stock home think yeah where you get stock home
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.400]  syndrome named from submitting to tyranny loving your captors or the 10 000 people i guess have
[03:16.400 --> 03:23.760]  stock home syndrome and stock home the pilot city and took implantable chips well look at this
[03:23.760 --> 03:32.000]  look at this little juicy benjamin yet and yahoo says he wants every child in israel next year to
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.120]  get chips and the israeli intelligence agency will run the whole thing just like that you're
[03:39.120 --> 03:47.360]  inside the new world order what does us today say you will take a microchip soon two years ago
[03:48.480 --> 03:51.440]  you want to leave your house you want to go to a restaurant you want to get on airplane
[03:51.440 --> 03:54.800]  you're going to take a chip and you're going to do more than that that chips going to say
[03:55.680 --> 04:06.240]  you've taken the new dna vaccine which is a reprogramming mutagen that goes into the nucleus
[04:06.240 --> 04:13.200]  yourself and reprograms it and they admit the trials it kills a lot of the animals they test it
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.600]  on but that's okay because bill gates said a month ago we played the clip probably 30 times
[04:17.600 --> 04:24.800]  he said yeah a lot of people are gonna get sick and die but it don't matter because you're gonna
[04:24.800 --> 04:33.280]  take it haha whoo they got some new vaccines that go in and eat parts of your brain but it feels so
[04:33.280 --> 04:41.760]  good yeah you're not gonna have to wait any more all of you in denial it's here now oh and the globalist
[04:41.760 --> 04:48.800]  are satan worshipers too and pedophiles well of course they are because we got a transmission

[06:25.280 --> 06:31.520]  will not make it understand do you understand come with me if you want to live come with me if you
[06:31.520 --> 06:48.560]  want to live you know what's happening
[06:52.720 --> 06:59.520]  if you study the romans or if you study the Babylonians or if you study the Egyptians
[06:59.520 --> 07:09.120]  if you study ancient Celtic Celtic tribes in Europe or Mesoamericans they would always get
[07:09.120 --> 07:14.800]  elites in charge who would start out having a few human sacrifices just to make sure the
[07:14.800 --> 07:20.080]  population would follow orders but it always escalated until they were sacrificing thousands
[07:20.080 --> 07:27.280]  of people per city every week and then the civilizations would decline and fall apart
[07:27.280 --> 07:33.840]  and if you go study the Aztecs or these other cultures they all believed that there were gods
[07:35.040 --> 07:42.400]  that demanded human blood now why did that happen in every culture according to archaeology
[07:42.400 --> 07:47.440]  that got developed and got built up you could say that psychopaths would get together they
[07:47.440 --> 07:55.360]  would form guilds they would take control i mean with the old vikings a lot of the viking tribes
[07:55.360 --> 08:04.480]  when a man died they would take his wife and sometimes his daughters because he owned them
[08:06.160 --> 08:12.320]  and they would tie them up on a boat a ship and send them out in the water on fire together
[08:12.320 --> 08:14.480]  so they could go to Valhalla together
[08:14.480 --> 08:25.920]  now why did people act like that why did every culture end up setting things up like that
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.400]  well i have the answers history and research has the answers but
[08:33.840 --> 08:39.920]  the the modern ruling classes believe they're too many people and believe they've got to carry out
[08:39.920 --> 08:47.760]  the soft kills or the depopulation in stealthy ways and that's exactly
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.040]  what they do
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.760]  and so now you hear world government's been announced and 200 hollywood quote stars cockroaches
[09:01.760 --> 09:11.440]  came out last week robert deniro and madonna and hanoi jane fonda and they all said this is
[09:11.440 --> 09:18.000]  good this is a reset there are too many people we need you to be poor and realize that you're
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.960]  non-essential these are quotes they're not giving up their jet airplanes or their their palatial
[09:24.960 --> 09:33.440]  policies that's what this whole thing is is the post human world and it's not really because they
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.440]  want to save the environment or doing that it's because they want power and control over everyone
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.840]  and so now my phone rings off the hook
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.520]  with all these people over the years thought i was crazy and now it's all out in the open
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.720]  they're like how did you know this because the new world order the globalist the club of rome the
[09:56.720 --> 10:02.480]  davos group the bill berg group these major universities the bill millen gates foundation
[10:02.480 --> 10:09.040]  and the groups they represent have all written books and articles and given speeches i could play
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.440]  you bill millen gates foundation meetings from 10 years ago at vassar saying thank god bill gates
[10:15.440 --> 10:25.040]  is setting up a global depopulation operation and then snopes funded by him comes out and says it's
[10:25.040 --> 10:34.080]  not true this is all being carried out ladies and gentlemen so here's the name of the show today we

[10:58.880 --> 11:04.560]  it couldn't be a more important time to raise the alarm so let me just do this let me give you some
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.160]  of the headlines and in the next hour and 50 minutes i'm going to cover pretty much all of this

[11:47.600 --> 11:55.200]  that's an admitted fact and i pulled up studies showing it and i pulled up articles showing that
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.920]  if you take the flu shot year after year it lowers your normal immunity i'll show those to you but see
[11:59.920 --> 12:06.880]  oh bbc and new york times said it's fake so they took her down even if she was fake

[12:15.760 --> 12:20.560]  we have her coming on a few days but the point is remember all those medical doctors came out and
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.560]  said covet 19 kills less than the flu they showed the numbers they had five million views taken down
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.240]  cedar sinai came out most respected hospital in the u.s arguably and said no trumps right there is

[14:22.000 --> 14:26.560]  can work with and realizing that you need to start moving off the grid as much as possible

[15:02.880 --> 15:06.000]  they were not a big company they're the biggest in the u.s now because people trust them and they

[15:55.360 --> 16:02.720]  dna force plus 50% off i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.040]  when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.800]  50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[16:16.800 --> 16:22.080]  through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over
[16:22.080 --> 16:28.160]  and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the
[16:28.160 --> 16:34.800]  entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the
[16:34.800 --> 16:41.120]  heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death well
[16:41.120 --> 16:44.560]  for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to you and i
[16:44.560 --> 16:49.840]  believe their numbers because it's the very un that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third
[16:49.840 --> 16:53.600]  world so to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of trump
[16:53.600 --> 16:56.960]  you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what hitler did
[16:57.840 --> 17:04.400]  ladies and gentlemen info wars can now offer high quality storeable food again other manufacturers
[17:04.400 --> 17:10.160]  were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food most folks never were delivered
[17:10.160 --> 17:17.360]  their food well when our sponsors food began to run short they just then it sales till they open
[17:17.360 --> 17:23.600]  more factories and secured more food so if you your orders in right now they can take new orders
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.440]  and get it to you quickly they'll probably have to suspend orders very very soon again because
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.400]  the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution farming you name it and now it's
[17:34.400 --> 17:40.080]  mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen if trump can turn
[17:40.080 --> 17:46.400]  the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist things may be okay but it
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.880]  looks like it's going to get very very rough so again ladies and gentlemen now is the time to secure
[17:50.880 --> 17:55.280]  the number one thing you need high quality storeable food ready to get to you and your family now if
[17:55.280 --> 18:01.760]  you get your orders in at fourstore.com the panic that has been orchestrated by the global
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.640]  corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.680]  already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical
[18:13.680 --> 18:20.880]  to understand that the longer the shutdown persist the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.000]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.480]  said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[18:30.480 --> 18:36.720]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so
[18:36.720 --> 18:42.720]  remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.480]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.760]  yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand
[18:53.760 --> 18:58.960]  times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening i don't like
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.960]  coming to you every day on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.760]  telling you all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible
[19:07.760 --> 19:14.080]  has come true we were warning everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.640]  got a pool put a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers
[19:18.640 --> 19:23.120]  they can hit their head and drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.440]  well ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world the collapse of the first world
[19:27.440 --> 19:33.920]  and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it
[19:33.920 --> 19:38.320]  they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.640]  and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human
[19:42.640 --> 19:48.320]  technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.680]  public because it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.680]  our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them
[19:57.680 --> 20:04.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:04.160 --> 20:14.640]  so
[20:18.720 --> 20:24.640]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[20:24.640 --> 20:35.200]  it is believed that humans are going through a metamorphosis and will
[20:35.200 --> 20:37.920]  emerge on the other side as a new species
[20:43.600 --> 20:50.240]  the controllers of the planet openly speak of the fact that they are accelerating
[20:50.240 --> 21:00.320]  the metamorphosis of humanity and that most of us will mutate and die but they believe
[21:00.320 --> 21:04.320]  out of this forced mutation that will be carried out through the vaccines
[21:05.360 --> 21:09.520]  the superman or the uber mention will rise
[21:12.080 --> 21:16.480]  this is the promise of their dark god lucifer
[21:16.480 --> 21:23.040]  now let's just get into the news right now shall we
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.680]  benjamin yatsenyahu suggest microchipping kids slammed by experts now i didn't just
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.920]  believe the jerusalem post i went with my crew a few hours ago when i saw this article well i
[21:37.920 --> 21:43.840]  saw it this morning but came into the office and we pulled up the video in hebroub of him saying
[21:43.840 --> 21:51.040]  that shin back the domestic intelligence agency of israel tracks every one car with a chip
[21:51.600 --> 21:57.200]  and that children should have it so that it beeps when children get too close to each other
[21:57.200 --> 22:00.400]  and he has their human rights commission looking to see if it's a good plan
[22:01.200 --> 22:06.240]  sweeten is already moving forward with this this is what the globalists want you to do
[22:06.240 --> 22:15.280]  do now let's just tie that little tidbit into this article that's up on info wars dot com
[22:16.400 --> 22:22.400]  congress introduces bill to allow government to mass test americans for covet 19 in their homes
[22:23.600 --> 22:31.760]  orcibly and ladies and gentlemen let me give you the bill number shall i
[22:31.760 --> 22:41.200]  buy six six six six now bill among the gates of four months ago five months ago got a patent
[22:41.200 --> 22:48.640]  on 2020 zero six zero six zero six to track you with either a chip or a bracelet with
[22:48.640 --> 22:54.960]  satellites and 5g where if you carry out the exact task as a robot you get cryptocurrency
[22:54.960 --> 23:00.160]  they have another patent for a digital tattoo given in the vaccine under the skin
[23:00.160 --> 23:04.560]  to make sure you've had your vaccine that's what yet and yahoo is getting ready for
[23:04.560 --> 23:10.000]  he says they have the plan ready but their intelligence agency has not released the plan yet
[23:12.160 --> 23:18.480]  the name of this video and it's on band dot video you might want to share it hr 6666
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.960]  the bill of the beast here it is here's the report the world health organization
[23:26.960 --> 23:33.280]  recommended forcibly removing family members from their homes and putting them in quarantine
[23:33.280 --> 23:39.760]  now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them
[23:39.760 --> 23:45.440]  and isolate them in a in a safe and dignified manner queen elizabeth seemed to be echoing
[23:45.440 --> 23:53.440]  this idea to the uk it reminds me of the very first broadcast i made in 1940 helped by my sister
[23:53.440 --> 24:00.640]  we as children spoke from here at winsor the children who had been evacuated from their homes
[24:01.280 --> 24:10.000]  and sent away for their own safety today once again many will feel a painful sense of separation
[24:10.000 --> 24:18.640]  from their loved ones but now as then we know deep down that it is the right thing to do bill
[24:18.640 --> 24:24.400]  gates has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos and microsoft
[24:24.400 --> 24:32.080]  was recently granted patent number 0600606 for a cryptocurrency surveillance system
[24:32.080 --> 24:43.040]  connected to the human body now enter hr 6666 to authorize the secretary of health and human
[24:43.040 --> 24:50.720]  services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for covet 19
[24:50.720 --> 24:58.320]  and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and as necessary
[24:58.320 --> 25:07.120]  at individuals residences and for other purposes on may 1st of 2020 illinois congressman bobby rush
[25:07.120 --> 25:15.280]  introduced hr 6666 this act is essentially setting up a nationwide contact tracing and
[25:15.280 --> 25:23.440]  quarantine program run by big pharma section 2 covet 19 testing and contact tracing using
[25:23.440 --> 25:32.080]  mobile health units will allow bill gates loyalist alex azar and the cdc to fund eligible entities
[25:32.080 --> 25:39.680]  to conduct tests trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine
[25:39.680 --> 25:47.120]  of these contacts via mobile health units who are the eligible entities qualified to receive this
[25:47.120 --> 25:54.480]  funding health centers nonprofit organizations high schools and anyone else that alex azar
[25:54.480 --> 26:00.480]  deems eligible the amount of taxpayer dollars being asked for to trace the public and force
[26:00.480 --> 26:08.320]  quarantines is $100 billion for 2020 alone and whatever may be necessary as long as the emergency
[26:08.320 --> 26:17.040]  period continues for info wars dot com this is greg reese now a lot of you probably noticed
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.080]  thursday friday and saturday bandot video was up and down quite a bit we're not google we're not
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.040]  facebook uh we don't have anywhere you know near 10 million dollars extra to work with much less
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.480]  billions like they do they're all their stock market fraud and so cobbling together we've got
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.520]  probably five times the traffic we had a year ago at bandot video double the traffic at info
[26:37.520 --> 26:44.400]  wars conservatively so we had to move even bigger server systems and cloud systems uh and and and
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.120]  now for now it's working but that's why you can't take it for granted all this stuff has been banned
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.840]  off youtube facebook twitter when we come back you're going to see one of the top doctors at a
[26:53.840 --> 27:01.200]  major hamberg hospital that runs forensics for the police in the city saying covet 19 is a giant
[27:01.200 --> 27:06.800]  hoax and a fraud there's like five doctors a day i see saying this they said this on national
[27:06.800 --> 27:14.000]  uh german television this has been removed off youtube do you understand every medical doctor
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.400]  you find out there that actually has a big practice says they're telling us put it on the
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.840]  death certificate covet 19 the joke is you die of a shark attack they'll test you and remember the
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.200]  tanzanine president is a famous biologist he's invented a lot of stuff he's a top biologist
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.600]  he had a feeling because he knew that u.m. was paying off the tanzanine national clinic
[27:34.800 --> 27:40.560]  so he said send a goat and a papaya last week to test they both tested covet 19 they test for
[27:40.560 --> 27:47.200]  genetic material that genetic trials and everything that's biological it's fake test folks that's why
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.320]  you see it not going up or going down it's just the death rate they take all the death rate columns
[27:52.320 --> 27:58.160]  heart attack cancer car wreck and even if you haven't been tested they admit that they
[28:00.400 --> 28:05.760]  engage in that activity and counted as that and there you go he blames it on faulty tests and
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.840]  he proved it and what is trump saying trump has a hunch the fatality rate for coronavirus is fake
[28:09.840 --> 28:19.840]  news guys pull up the article and come back 300 plus tyson employees test positive 2000 employees
[28:19.840 --> 28:27.040]  in a meat packing plant 300 plus test positive not one got a fever not one had a cough that's called
[28:27.040 --> 28:35.680]  a symptomatic of course they tested positive if you've had a cold in the last decade you test
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.600]  positive there it is was 300 something 298 workers at tennessee tyson plant test positive cover 19
[28:41.600 --> 28:47.760]  all asymptomatic and they got a bunch of other tests asymptomatic asymptomatic it's a hoax it's
[28:47.760 --> 28:54.080]  a hoax it's a hoax it's a hoax but it's super deadly because it's shutting off the economy worldwide
[28:54.080 --> 29:02.400]  we'll be right back stay with us the superpower that i have is that i tell you what i really think
[29:02.400 --> 29:07.200]  even if it ends up hurting me short term i believe in god and i believe in the long run it'll end
[29:07.200 --> 29:11.600]  up being better for myself everybody else in this world we live together in i understand what comes
[29:11.600 --> 29:16.320]  around goes around you report you so and i live that and i fundamentally the cellular level understand
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.520]  it now if i would have hyped up the virus was going to kill three four five million people like the
[29:21.520 --> 29:28.320]  un did i was told five times more supplements but you know what i didn't do that but i said on a routine
[29:28.320 --> 29:33.920]  basis regardless people are vitamin d deficient people are deficient i died and so many other
[29:33.920 --> 29:39.600]  issues you need those products regardless so we started selling out of vitamin real fusion all
[29:39.600 --> 29:45.760]  the other products i cut the prices from 30 percent off to 60 percent off because i knew it was the
[29:45.760 --> 29:51.280]  right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies
[29:51.280 --> 29:58.720]  defenses but now i'm telling you with economic crises going on get your storeable food down
[29:58.720 --> 30:05.520]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[30:05.520 --> 30:13.120]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the middle
[30:13.120 --> 30:20.400]  of the linda gates foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought off
[30:20.400 --> 30:26.560]  but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post human world and now that we're
[30:26.560 --> 30:33.840]  inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its end game submission to this
[30:33.840 --> 30:41.120]  is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living
[30:41.120 --> 30:47.840]  hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul
[30:47.840 --> 30:54.400]  your future being torn inside out this is a scientific dictatorship to infold control of
[30:54.400 --> 31:00.640]  humanity for its own selfish disgusting power trip one of our best-selling products is living
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.360]  defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients
[31:05.360 --> 31:09.280]  that are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and i want those of
[31:09.280 --> 31:13.760]  you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial
[31:13.760 --> 31:19.040]  i looked in january 2016 i went in the hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was
[31:19.040 --> 31:23.680]  in there until june and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to
[31:23.680 --> 31:28.800]  info wars three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys talking about living
[31:28.800 --> 31:33.680]  defense let me tell you something man i had an internal digestive problem and i stumbled with
[31:33.680 --> 31:38.400]  it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what
[31:38.400 --> 31:42.400]  it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group and those commercials i said you know
[31:42.400 --> 31:46.000]  what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.080]  nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got
[31:50.080 --> 31:55.440]  it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life
[31:55.440 --> 32:01.200]  alex jones and info wars saved my life i'm always excited about info wars life products they're
[32:01.200 --> 32:05.200]  amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info war in the face of the
[32:05.200 --> 32:13.680]  globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing
[32:13.680 --> 32:21.760]  the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's
[32:21.760 --> 32:30.480]  another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's
[32:30.480 --> 32:35.520]  high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i like to put it on my hands rub a little
[32:35.520 --> 32:41.600]  my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but i just love it personally
[32:41.600 --> 32:46.400]  has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation i don't know why others
[32:46.400 --> 32:51.280]  didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't
[32:51.280 --> 33:03.440]  dry you out it smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the alex
[33:03.440 --> 33:21.600]  jones show
[33:24.480 --> 33:27.840]  all right i want to play some of the new scientists some of the new doctors
[33:27.840 --> 33:34.640]  around the world a prestigious ones coming out saying that they're counting regular deaths
[33:35.840 --> 33:44.080]  as COVID-19 i'm i'm gonna get to some of that here in just a moment but i want to play these
[33:44.080 --> 33:48.560]  doctors from two weeks ago dr erickson and his colleague they own a bunch of clinics they were
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.760]  reading NIH numbers that no one will read on air that it kills less people in the flu that they're
[33:53.760 --> 33:59.200]  attributing other deaths to COVID that the tests are faulty that that people that haven't even tested
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.200]  that die that they're they're saying they died of COVID because they get 39 000 plus extra dollars
[34:05.200 --> 34:12.880]  13 000 on top of that to say it's COVID this is all incentivized well then why is COVID made
[34:12.880 --> 34:19.120]  in a lab why why is it a bio weapon because then the loma Linda Gates who cooked it up
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.920]  can profit from it and by the way when i say bill loma Linda Gates are involved in this
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.800]  there have been hundreds of articles come out that of the hundreds of projects going on at
[34:30.800 --> 34:38.560]  wuhan the NIH was funding most of them illegal stuff that the NIH couldn't do in the united
[34:38.560 --> 34:44.160]  states was done at wuhan and bill loma Linda Gates control and finance most of the research
[34:44.160 --> 34:48.400]  and it's back in the news today that a bill loma Linda Gates scientist was running major
[34:48.400 --> 34:55.520]  operations so i'm going to get into that article here on air as well today i'm not just here to
[34:55.520 --> 35:03.040]  villainize bill loma Linda Gates us funder in coronavirus research with wuhan lab and political
[35:03.040 --> 35:11.600]  pressure now that's just a few days ago coming out the limit of the NIH and the obama administration
[35:11.600 --> 35:18.000]  and Fauci and bill loma Linda Gates foundation and and that was mainstream news put that back on
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.400]  screen that's an article i hadn't seen give people that source please but what source is that scroll
[35:22.400 --> 35:30.960]  up forming that's a chemistry world see that's what's crazy this is all on record the discoverer
[35:30.960 --> 35:36.160]  of hiv Nobel prize put it under an electron microscope said it's man-made you can see the
[35:36.160 --> 35:48.800]  p shuttle gene insertions that's where they inserted a new virus into it imagine you see scars from
[35:48.800 --> 35:57.120]  surgeries on viruses and cells they're even bigger because they're so small you just it's there but
[35:57.120 --> 36:01.840]  again we knew that 12 weeks ago before the top scientists said it because the top indian scientists
[36:01.840 --> 36:08.160]  came out and said it but then you turn on the news they go no one says it's man-made no one says it
[36:08.160 --> 36:13.760]  came from wuhan well we did 13 weeks ago and now we've been vindicated but i digress folks
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.400]  here's some of the doctors who had tens of millions of views online and their hour-long
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.440]  speech their press conference that was carried by local news was banned by youtube for violating
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.520]  community standards because see they're telling you all the doctors say covid's the most deadly
[36:29.520 --> 36:33.280]  thing on earth all the doctors say it's the end of the world all the doctors say the end of
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.000]  civilization all the doctors say don't leave your house all the doctors say it's not man-made all the
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.800]  doctors say it didn't come out of wuhan really i've got these scientists 2015 saying why are we
[36:44.800 --> 36:50.000]  giving it to wuhan the university of texas is under fbi investigation we're giving it to wuhan
[36:51.040 --> 36:56.160]  there's the scientists right there creation of camira sars like virus has scientists discussing
[36:56.160 --> 37:05.120]  the risk of gain of function research okay so before i put the new new scientists new doctor
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.200]  coming out saying it's all a fraud let's see the guys they don't want you to hear from just so you
[37:09.200 --> 37:17.280]  remember them here it is after testing thousands of people in their county for covid 19 doctors
[37:17.280 --> 37:24.160]  dan erickson and artin massini owners of accelerated urgent care in bakersfield california
[37:24.160 --> 37:31.760]  held a press conference to share their data along with official cdc data doctor erickson reported
[37:31.760 --> 37:37.440]  that hospitals in california have become empty as a result of allotting all resources to the
[37:37.440 --> 37:46.000]  covid 19 pandemic the hospitals their icu's are empty essentially and they're shutting down floors
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  they're furloughing patients they're furloughing doctors because we just don't have the volume
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.760]  so we're busy with paperwork for coveted and we're all focusing on coveted he then went over the
[37:55.760 --> 38:03.840]  coveted 19 numbers for the state of california we've seen 1227 deaths in the state of california
[38:03.840 --> 38:09.360]  that means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from coveted 19 the state of california and for the
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.600]  state of new york 19410 out of 19 million people which is a 0.1 chance of dying from coveted in
[38:17.600 --> 38:24.240]  the state of new york and then compared these numbers to the seasonal flu in 2017 45 million
[38:24.240 --> 38:32.800]  total cases in 2017 with about 62 000 deaths or a 0.13 chance of death from flu in the united states
[38:32.800 --> 38:40.080]  so the lethality of of covid 19 is much less he then went on to report what is happening as a
[38:40.080 --> 38:46.880]  result of the shutdown and millions of hardworking people losing their jobs child molestation is
[38:46.880 --> 38:52.800]  increasing at a severe rate we could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested
[38:52.800 --> 39:00.000]  due to angry family members who are intoxicated who are home who have no paycheck these things
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.440]  last a lifetime this isn't about a seasonal flu these are things that will follow these people
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.720]  and affect them in a negative fashion for their life and these are for me talking to er's talking
[39:10.720 --> 39:16.480]  to my doctors and talking to people let's stop right there if you go to bandot video the full hour and
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.880]  five minute long press conference has 1.4 million views great it needs 50 million views but every day
[39:22.880 --> 39:28.640]  we have doctors like this now here's a new clip it's at bandot video as well from david night show
[39:28.640 --> 39:35.520]  friday let's put that on screen german forensic professor calls out covet lies on tv he's the top
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.920]  forensics expert in hamburg over the hospital the police departments everything and there he is
[39:41.920 --> 39:48.320]  on national german television and david night covered it and read over the german subtitles
[39:48.320 --> 39:55.360]  on friday the full piece is at bandot video this needs to go viral as well let's hear from
[39:55.360 --> 40:09.280]  professor dr claus pushell here it is so she's introducing him talking about his credentials
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.200]  they've autopsyed everybody who died of covet 19 in hamburg in his opinion the fear of the virus
[40:15.200 --> 40:21.280]  has exaggerated covet 19 is a comparatively harmless disease she's my guest now in the studio
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.840]  very warm welcome to you professor pushell thank you for joining us if you think the corona is
[40:25.840 --> 40:30.400]  affecting us and society in a completely inappropriate and exaggerated way is that right
[40:35.040 --> 40:41.920]  i stand by that to make it clear i'll say that i think it's completely exaggerated for example
[40:41.920 --> 40:51.920]  when this virus is referred to as a killer virus when people are very afraid of it i think it's
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.920]  really completely inappropriate when a president tells his people where war or when the german
[40:57.920 --> 41:05.600]  chancellor compares the situation to the last world war we have a virus here that we already know
[41:05.600 --> 41:17.760]  in principle however this is a new version which came to us as a pandemic so we have to react to
[41:17.760 --> 41:25.120]  it in a very special way it's the fear that always eats souls oh that's good the fear that always
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.160]  eats souls we're not to be particularly afraid there are many other dangers occurring in life that
[41:30.160 --> 41:36.160]  affect us far more ten days ago she says in an interview with a major newspaper
[41:37.520 --> 41:44.720]  you said that you hadn't had a single case of covet 19 on your dissection table not one had
[41:44.720 --> 41:50.400]  died from the illness of covet 19 without another pre-existing condition is that still the case
[41:52.480 --> 41:58.320]  yes that remains the case all covet 19 deaths for this region which have now passed 100 have
[41:58.320 --> 42:08.080]  been autopsy and each one had serious pre-existing diseases there were between 50 and 100 they were
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.520]  between 50 and 100 years old the average age is 80 years old this indicates clearly these people
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.040]  these are people who aren't in good general condition here i must add that they all had
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.440]  at least one special or rather even several diseases the same thing we heard from italy
[42:23.440 --> 42:30.160]  a cardiovascular disease heart attack and large heart constriction of the coronary arteries
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.040]  calcification of the arteries chronic obstruction on the down the full reports of bandod video
[42:35.840 --> 42:38.960]  no when i come back i'm gonna explain why this is so important this is the hoax of hoaxes
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.520]  this will take down all of civilization all of society forced inoculations
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.880]  implantable microchips total control this is the rollout of the chinese communist social credit
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.880]  score this is the excuse for the post-human world listen to me this is an emergency tell everyone
[42:54.880 --> 43:02.080]  you know tune in now we can stop these people make a friend with death it's a saying so old
[43:02.080 --> 43:09.120]  that no one knows who first said it every culture has their own way of memorializing that simple
[43:09.120 --> 43:14.880]  statement but you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of the human
[43:14.880 --> 43:21.920]  species the moment of truth is now here we are facing the post-human era and i've been warning
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.840]  you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis to click put us in the cage and then
[43:27.840 --> 43:35.840]  roll out the robot takeover this is just the beta test china is moving out of beta and into
[43:35.840 --> 43:43.120]  operational control in just a few years we will be under full globalist control forced inoculations
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.240]  total surveillance we're all being taught that we are obsolete the term they use is non essential
[43:50.240 --> 43:57.920]  this is not some dystopian novel this is reality this is the new world order this is satanism
[43:57.920 --> 44:05.680]  was only four months ago that i warned president trump and the american people the calvary would
[44:05.680 --> 44:14.160]  never stand for you resisting our takeover there is no limit to which we will not stop
[44:14.160 --> 44:23.120]  to make you bow via the fear that is innate in your hearts it was i the leader of cobra
[44:23.120 --> 44:30.000]  that foresaw your inner colors and how much you would enjoy watching netflix and wearing
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.640]  mask and gloves when you went out to feel all important like you were in a war when the real
[44:36.640 --> 44:44.720]  time of calvary was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation who were not dying
[44:44.720 --> 44:52.240]  at the tune of over a million people every three weeks calvary thanks you for what you've done
[44:52.240 --> 44:59.760]  continue the lockdowns while i depopulate the planet hey oh calvary hiding in plain
[44:59.760 --> 45:06.640]  view politico the associated press you name and admit that a half a billion people extra 500 million
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.400]  are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.680]  the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by
[45:17.680 --> 45:22.400]  covid 19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the world health
[45:22.400 --> 45:28.240]  organization with bill gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.480]  created depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and gentlemen
[45:32.480 --> 45:37.280]  they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.800]  now back in stock at info war store dot com and you need to get politically active and challenge
[45:42.800 --> 45:47.600]  this verbally everywhere big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people
[45:47.600 --> 45:53.200]  into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing this is beyond 1984 the tyranny
[45:53.200 --> 45:57.680]  of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word in the info war you are the paul
[45:57.680 --> 46:04.080]  reveres it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[46:04.080 --> 46:10.640]  to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two
[46:10.640 --> 46:16.160]  months it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.360]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[46:21.360 --> 46:28.560]  but i'm going to have medical ID cards force inoculations we are now in a giant dystopia
[46:28.560 --> 46:35.040]  but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[46:35.040 --> 46:40.240]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[46:40.240 --> 46:45.840]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[46:45.840 --> 46:51.440]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already starve to death tens of millions
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.920]  more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your
[46:55.920 --> 47:18.960]  lives and our lives congratulations you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:18.960 --> 47:27.120]  hey folks we've got a lot of really interesting articles and a lot of other big news out there
[47:27.120 --> 47:32.720]  i could be covering and i may get to some of the next hour but but really you have to understand
[47:33.680 --> 47:39.600]  that this covet 19 thing is the launch of the new water takeoff so everything else is just a
[47:39.600 --> 47:45.760]  side issue i mean in georgia the original police report said that somebody been robbing the houses
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.520]  taking guns taking fishing equipment stealing four-wheelers and that this dude went into the house
[47:51.520 --> 47:56.640]  and they saw him and then they got in a fist fight with him and they shot the guy i think that's
[47:56.640 --> 48:03.040]  too much lethal force and i wouldn't have done it but that's what happens when people you know
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.080]  look like they're robbing houses and the media is trying to make a race for out of this
[48:09.280 --> 48:12.000]  well i think these guys need to go to prison for what they did probably not
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.280]  it because the guy took swings at him and let me tell you i don't care if you're black or white
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.720]  especially places like georgia or rural texas you start getting people's houses and stuff you're
[48:22.720 --> 48:30.080]  gonna get your ass shot i mean i won't even cut through somebody's yard because i get it um but i
[48:30.640 --> 48:38.480]  to me i've transcended all this race business it's the human race but is there an entitlement
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.080]  in the left i mean i saw the comments on twitter about the guy that got killed now that it came
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.320]  out that he was going in people's houses and doing things like the police report originally said
[48:46.320 --> 48:52.720]  oh well he doesn't deserve to die well you wait till your house gets robbed i don't care if you're
[48:52.720 --> 49:02.640]  black or you're white if i catch you in my house i'm gonna shoot you it's that simple but again
[49:02.640 --> 49:10.160]  that's the big story right now 30 million extra people are starving to death right now according
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.040]  to the un and i don't just believe their numbers i follow these that's accurate normally 10 million
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.280]  starving to death a year it's going to be three times that four times that 135 million are on the
[49:19.280 --> 49:26.240]  edge of starvation 200 plus million could starve the third world is almost completely dependent
[49:26.240 --> 49:33.840]  on the first world that's real but you don't hear the black panther party or the democratic party
[49:33.840 --> 49:38.800]  talking about that they're like oh be a hero keep locked down you want to talk about killing brown
[49:38.800 --> 49:48.320]  people in india and africa and latin america it's happening right now and so let's just bypass all this
[49:48.320 --> 49:59.520]  but when you do take millions of african migrants right off the streets of nigeria you name it and
[49:59.520 --> 50:06.560]  dump them in georgia it's not going to be pretty because in places like nigeria and places
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.600]  you either are part of a clan and a group or you starve to death or you run around rob people
[50:13.600 --> 50:19.040]  and uh i know a lot of liberals man that were liberal so they went to africa and experience
[50:19.040 --> 50:23.120]  it with themselves i'm talking about black liberals and believe me they got a nice appreciation for
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.280]  america after they went to africa go to africa see what it's like the africans hate other africans
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.520]  so much in most areas it'll make your heads man and they kill each other constantly and it's it's
[50:33.520 --> 50:39.040]  very sad but if you teleported yourself back 800 years ago a thousand years ago to england you'd
[50:39.040 --> 50:46.480]  have the britains and the scots kill each other this is what goes on and it's called the law of
[50:46.480 --> 50:53.360]  the jungle so let me do this i'm going to start the next hour and i'm going to get into what's
[50:53.360 --> 50:59.360]  coming next in the new world order and why we must not comply with any of the covet hysteria
[51:00.480 --> 51:05.360]  i got most of this right 13 weeks ago but it took us time to analyze it and study it and
[51:05.360 --> 51:14.160]  look at event 201 and look at the rockefeller foundation reports like lockstep but now about
[51:14.160 --> 51:18.640]  95 of what we thought they were doing it turned out was accurate and exactly what they wanted
[51:18.640 --> 51:24.160]  to do with the global id the force inoculations it's all happening and again i want to explain
[51:24.160 --> 51:31.360]  something this is not your normal RNA learned immunity vaccines just means put something in
[51:31.360 --> 51:36.160]  your body you know they could call cyanide a vaccine people roll their sleeve up get a shot
[51:36.160 --> 51:40.320]  and die and it's like well it's the it's the vaccine that saves the earth
[51:43.200 --> 51:46.640]  so it's all being announced and so it's critical for folks to understand
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.960]  what's coming next and if anybody knows what's coming next it's myself because i live this
[51:52.960 --> 52:03.040]  this is who i am and i've studied these people so much that i know more than most of their
[52:03.040 --> 52:07.120]  top people because most of them are just into partying and compartmentalized and they follow
[52:07.120 --> 52:12.400]  orders it's only a very select few at the top that run this thing and i've studied their
[52:12.400 --> 52:17.760]  writings and what they've said and what they've done and we know what their school of thought comes
[52:17.760 --> 52:27.120]  out of eugenics sir thomas malthus francis galtons or francis galton the robber barons the social
[52:27.120 --> 52:33.440]  darwinist and we know they're playing and that's why people go my god how does jones know all this
[52:33.440 --> 52:41.120]  he must be psychic we're all a little psychic aren't we but that's not where i get this information
[52:41.120 --> 52:46.880]  i get it through research and having the courage to admit the truth in what we're facing so
[52:48.800 --> 52:50.160]  i'm going to lay out for you
[52:53.920 --> 52:54.560]  next hour
[52:57.360 --> 53:00.960]  what's going to happen if you don't say no and where this is going to lead and i want to talk
[53:01.760 --> 53:04.960]  to the prodigal sons out there because i don't want to talk to the audience that are great
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.640]  activists that get what's happening from your own research your own discernment your own spiritual
[53:08.640 --> 53:15.120]  connection but i i do care about the lawsuit those we can still get to wake up because i want you to
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.600]  know if you're pretending like you're part of the power structure and you think going along with this
[53:19.600 --> 53:27.760]  will get you some monetary game in the short term that's not actually how this works those of you
[53:27.760 --> 53:34.560]  that serve the system now are going to be destroyed first all that previous behavior where submitting
[53:34.560 --> 53:40.000]  got you ahead that's over now now submitting is going to get you dead
[53:42.160 --> 53:45.680]  because now they're admitting oh these vaccines are actually going to hurt you
[53:45.680 --> 53:48.880]  but if you want to travel leave your house or have a job you're going to have one
[53:50.800 --> 53:58.800]  it's all being announced right now there's no way out of this but to be honest and be based in reality
[53:58.800 --> 54:06.240]  and i'm sorry quote the matrix all i'm offering is the truth nothing else
[54:06.880 --> 54:12.880]  you take the blue pill you go back into wonderland and have your soul taken and die take the red pill
[54:13.600 --> 54:21.120]  show you how deep the rabbit hole goes and believe me folks i've been way way way way down the rabbit hole
[54:21.120 --> 54:27.920]  or up the waterfalls actually what i should say but i'm going to leave that to another time
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.840]  just understand this this is a jumping off point the third dimensions a very important
[54:33.840 --> 54:40.320]  place in the universe and it's the intersection of good and evil you're at the crossroads you can
[54:40.320 --> 54:48.960]  call earth crossroads jump point the portal and you're not going to go to the next level unless
[54:48.960 --> 54:56.400]  you've been tested and god is perfect but if god was ashamed of anything it would be the fact that
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.760]  you have to be tested but that's just the way it is isn't it because giving you free will and making
[55:01.760 --> 55:07.760]  a new sentient being that has the seed of the universe and your potential to create holy universes
[55:07.760 --> 55:15.440]  yourself to be given that gift you must then be given a gift to fail and succeed i'm going to go
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.440]  to break um we are listed supported we're under the greatest attack we've ever been under you notice
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.360]  everybody else is shut down no one else has their own multimedia platform that's that's pro-human
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.160]  i it's like watching the tyranny rise like an ocean and we're a tall mountain
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.160]  now we're just a hill and now the water is lapping up we're like a lighthouse now
[55:32.160 --> 55:38.720]  on a promontory in a storm and the water is rising but when you financially support us
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.640]  and when you spread the word and when you pray for us it's like the mountain grows so even though
[55:42.640 --> 55:49.520]  the sea rises we rise above it but the the the waves are crashing and now and are actually
[55:49.520 --> 55:55.040]  foam is hitting me in the face now and others i watched beneath the waves all those that
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.600]  incrementally submitted and thought they were winners and thought they'd be you know in charge
[55:59.600 --> 56:05.040]  all those that compromise the new world order will be destroyed so i would just encourage you all

[57:53.040 --> 57:58.800]  not because of the virus but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.760]  the globe was for planning to hold america hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and
[58:03.760 --> 58:09.440]  blue states now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation

[58:57.920 --> 59:05.920]  they'll still run 50, 60, 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their
[59:05.920 --> 59:10.800]  arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened
[59:10.800 --> 59:16.880]  they fall over and they die then you go back them and haul them back in well that's what's
[59:16.880 --> 59:23.360]  going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been
[59:23.360 --> 59:28.960]  shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression
[59:28.960 --> 59:33.360]  and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million debt
[59:33.360 --> 59:38.480]  according to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[59:38.480 --> 59:42.320]  to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it was their revolution
[59:42.320 --> 59:46.080]  to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what
[59:46.080 --> 59:49.040]  Hitler did

[59:58.640 --> 1:00:04.080]  attention american slaves you are not allowed to say chinese virus and we will arrest you
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:11.280]  the local san antonio news reported the tyrannical violation of free speech like it was business as
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:17.440]  usual san antonio city council unanimously passed a so-called anti hate resolution regarding
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:25.520]  regarding covid-19 deliberate use of terms like chinese virus and kung fu virus encourages hate
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:32.240]  crimes against asians and spreads misinformation while the liberal echo chamber reverberating
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:39.120]  around the san antonio city council was oblivious to the volcanic outrage declaring as san antonio
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:46.560]  texas investigator reporter jaya vila described on twitter resolution being voted on by san antonio
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:53.760]  city council this morning labels terms quote chinese virus and quote kung fu virus as hate
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:01:01.200]  speech and all persons are encouraged to report any such anti-semitic discriminatory or racist
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:08.720]  incidents to the proper authorities for investigation anti-semitic chinese virus yeah it
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:14.480]  doesn't add up why do you keep calling this the chinese virus there are reports of dozens
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:20.720]  of incidents of bias against chinese americans in this country your own aid secretary azar he
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:26.240]  says he does not use this term he says ethnicity does not cause the virus why do you keep using
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:33.040]  this because it comes from china it's not racist at all no not at all it comes from china texas
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:39.600]  senator ted cruz lambasted the san antonio city council saying this is nuts san antonio
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:45.760]  city council behaving like a lefty college faculty lounge triggered by chick filet and the words
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:51.840]  wuhan virus if they want to investigate someone start with the new york times and cnn who both
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:59.040]  repeatedly and rightly referred to it as the chinese coronavirus the measure was passed unanimously
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:05.840]  by the san antonio city council moments after senator cruz's tweet council member mani palayas
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:13.120]  said during the voting process hate speech is more dangerous than the virus itself actually tyranny
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  is far more dangerous than the virus itself but even pointing that out may become the next
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:25.200]  criminal act as the rutherford institute discovered after defending the right for pro immigration
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:31.840]  consultant evelin signing smith who was charged with and convicted of violating an immigration
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:38.240]  statute making it a crime to encourage or induce an alien to reside in the u.s. in violation of the
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:44.800]  law on appeal she argued that she had not misled the workers and that statutes ban on encouraging
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:50.400]  another to stay in the country violates the first amendments whichever side you may stand on the
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:57.680]  issue of immigration is moot because in refusing to strike down an overly broad law criminalizing
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:03.680]  pro immigration speech the u.s. supreme court has now paved the way for the government to punish
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:10.240]  anyone engaging in so-called anti-government speech that encourages resistance to tyranny
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:15.840]  through civil disobedience the rutherford institute in conjunction with the aclu and the
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:21.680]  service employees international union filed an amicus brief in the case arguing that the
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:28.800]  statute is over broad and could serve as a model for laws used to punish anyone who urges resistance
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:33.840]  to government tyranny i'm looking for that five percent as willing to stand up we're rapidly
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:40.960]  approaching that momentum point america has not been sold out by americans america has been sold
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:47.120]  out by traders and we've sold out america in that we have a punished trader the rug is slowly
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:53.120]  being pulled out from under us is it not those with which we have entrusted with wielding the
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:59.600]  acumen of governance who are promoting their own hate speech toward the foundations of our individual
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:10.640]  freedoms display like the one that we saw at our capital is not representative of who we are in
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:16.640]  chicken there were swastikas and confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:21.440]  we're hearing a lot of reports around here and i know i've seen some stuff going on statewide
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:27.440]  about neighbors reporting on other neighbors for not following the orders uh seeing a lot of

[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:40.560]  department orders um being equated to nazism it's not a contest to see what you can get away with

[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:54.160]  bill of rights in issuing this order how do you have the power to do that that's above my peg rate

[1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:23.840]  transmission so the democratic party the un they've come out and said you know this lockdown is
[1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:28.880]  really good because it's going to kill the consumer society and the whole service economy and that's
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:35.040]  so bad for the earth so wait a minute we were told don't have industry don't have farming working
[1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:41.840]  in retail or work in service and that'd be good for the earth remember in the 80s and 90s and 2000s
[1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:51.760]  and now we're told oh no no service economy is obsolete it's non-essential and then 200 quote
[1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:57.600]  hollywood stars led by robert deniro hanoi jane and the usual suspects like madonna came out
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.560]  and now tom hanks has joined them have a video of tom hanks talking about you're the chosen ones
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.920]  that don't leave your houses and don't go to school you're the chosen ones in the reset to save the
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:18.960]  earth oh now it's about cutting the carbon they didn't choose toxic waste or genetic engineering or
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.560]  burning down the rainforests as their latest thing to try to get money and control no no
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:31.120]  it's carbon dioxide that we exhale that plants breathe part of the carbon cycle sunlight water
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:35.760]  oxygen carbon dioxide what you need for life on earth don't have one of those things bye bye
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:42.000]  carbon dioxide oxygen water sunlight well we all know water is good we all know sunlight is good
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.600]  we all know oxygen is good even the dumbest person doesn't think that's toxic so carbon dioxide
[1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:57.440]  talk the average leftist they think it's carbon monoxide i used to go out and use the technical
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:03.680]  name for uh salt sounds really toxic and i'd get leon macadoo got a guy going i'm a chemist i agree
[1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:12.800]  baby let's ban the technical name of salt that sounds poisonous so they know what they're doing
[1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:21.360]  and so they say an element for life on this earth is bad so let's let's talk about that ladies and
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:31.440]  gentlemen what is the big picture you know they had the attorney general who is known as uh being
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:40.240]  a clown but but but a very aggressive political uh communist leticia james come out a month ago and
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:46.880]  say alex jones says he has a cure and a treatment for covet 19 there's no video of me saying i have
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:54.240]  a treatment for covet 19 no video of me saying i have a cure for it but she said that as he said
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:09:01.760]  i'm a criminal because she gets her walking orders from the nih and from fauci who don't want you
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:08.800]  to have any hope and they're pissed that i'm up here saying this virus is like the common cold
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:15.520]  but it's been patented by billa melinda gates that's come out it's been prepared so they own it
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:19.040]  because they couldn't get a vaccine for the common cold but if they make a new common cold
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:24.560]  that's got some other facets to it now they can own that and control that and have new versions
[1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:28.400]  of that that come out that i believe will be more deadly in the future and i'll get into that in a
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:37.360]  moment but imagine that i'm up here saying have hope this isn't as deadly as they say and of course
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:42.800]  i've been proven right i told you 12 13 weeks ago that it's not as deadly as they say and now all
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:50.080]  the bell curves from sweden to the us show it 30 40 times not as high a death rate as they said
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:56.320]  and that's what all the graphs hell i've got a bunch of the graphs right here that's what all
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.240]  the graphs show that's what the reality shows they said five billion dead americans if you
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:03.840]  don't do what we say and never leave your house again oh then it was three million then two million
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:10.880]  then a million then 800 000 and now oh it might hit 100 000 way worse than trump fought way worse
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:18.320]  than we thought that's all over the news today oh it might be at 100 000 we can never leave our houses
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:25.280]  it's worse than we thought you're like i don't have a memory i do have a memory you said five
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:30.240]  million you said three million you said two million why have we stayed in our houses maybe
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:41.840]  a million we'd be lucky and now we learn that they plan to keep us locked down seasonally forever
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:47.520]  but that's okay because senator murphy the democrat senator that openly says i should be
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:57.440]  taking off the year he says 70 million americans died in a tweet and people thought that they would
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:04.880]  remove the tweet haven't as of showtime because that's the face of a lunatic criminal an anti american
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:10.240]  danger right there he says to save america we must remove alex jones from the air yeah
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.480]  so you can say 70 million people died hey dude 100 000 haven't died yet and they're counting every
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:29.920]  death car racks electrocution drowning cancer and even bouchie has to admit that
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:37.680]  then i got a stack of articles right here 400 workers at missouri pork plant all asymptomatic
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:41.760]  fox news none of them sick from it because the tests are fake
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:48.160]  like priant food 70 percent of workers test positive gov 19 almost all have no symptoms
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:56.640]  on and on and on and on but this guy says 70 million dead
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:05.680]  what's that 20 percent of the u.s population guys average 70 million into 350 million
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:11.840]  give me the exact number what does 70 million average into 350 millions about what our population
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:18.320]  is officially it's 333 million but we know there's a bunch of illegal aliens so much
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:26.080]  is conservative numbers 350 so again this is what we're fighting is total lies total fraud
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:32.160]  but the fraud can't survive if we're on air the fraud can't survive if you're speaking out the
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:39.680]  fraud can't live in that environment politically so the fraud the scam ambulance chaser lawyers
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:47.120]  they want you and i silenced so they can run rough shot over all of us
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:56.800]  oh but trump it's much worse than we thought it could hit 100 000 oh it's all trumps fault why
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:04.000]  why it turned out covid was worse than we thought it might be 100 000 dead and now forever anyone
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:11.120]  that ever had the flu or a cold is testing positive just like papayas and goats test positive
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:16.160]  when major biologists tested on the testing kits because they're designed as frauds and they pay
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:22.400]  off the hospital's 13 000 plus dollars to have a covid patient 39 000 a snake a tube down your throat
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:28.560]  so my mind hit it i said 20 percent you know and i don't think about it i get it right so
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:38.720]  70 million out of 350 million is 20 percent so the senator from the junior citizen the junior
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:45.520]  senator out of canada hit the one quarterbacking the lawsuits against me publicly the bunch of
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:52.240]  former federal prosecutors or for obama running it what nice people he says 20 percent of america is
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:58.960]  dead let's do the math let's do 80 000 let's round up from 78 000 i say are dead right now
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:06.800]  let's say 80 000 divided into 350 million what is that it's not even one percent ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:14.960]  let's see it doesn't matter because senator murphy said 70 million are dead and he's god
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:20.240]  so shut up america all right so let me go over the horizon with you when we come back
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:31.040]  it's 0.022857142857143 oh well it's 0.02
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:36.480]  but see it doesn't matter because you go around the general public
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:39.200]  i pay attention i heard 70 million died yeah
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.320]  i'm like hey millions are starving that's because of it i don't care about them i'm wearing a mask
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:55.760]  i'm i'm i'm a hero the news said i'm a hero i survived covid 19 like it was tom hanks is like
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.960]  you're like people that survived world war two or vietnam you're just the biggest heroes i've
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:11.600]  ever seen you pat yourself on the back just oh i got the tom hanks video it's sick because you need
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.600]  to know what heroes you are that you live through it you you live through them taking every flu
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.160]  and every pneumonia death we've got the graphs of normally happened and put it in the covid stack
[1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:28.560]  that's why they came up with a normal cold virus but engineered it so they own it so they can patent
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:33.680]  it and and then now anyone that ever has a cold is suspecting bad and you gotta have microchips
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:40.480]  and vaccines to leave your house and it's all being announced my god they're going for everything
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:48.480]  they're taking us a trillion miles if we give them an inch we say no no no submission is death
[1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:53.840]  bill gates admits the vaccine will hurt a bunch of people my god he's coming with a weapon
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.800]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:10.320]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the bill
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:17.680]  millen gates foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought off
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:23.840]  but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post human world and now that we're
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:31.280]  inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its end game submission to this is
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:38.400]  a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:45.120]  hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:51.600]  your future being poured inside out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:58.640]  of humanity for its own selfish disgusting power trip the america that we've known and loved the
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:04.080]  america that was the land of the free home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:09.440]  are doing is about domesticating us shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.480]  shortages have begun the depression is going to be long and very very serious in fact it's
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:18.880]  probably too late now to even turn back trump try to stop it but the mainstream media working
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:25.040]  with the tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else has to get prepared now do
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:29.600]  not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.240]  next six months to a year get your high quality storeable foods and in fullershore.com they're
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:40.240]  available again before a limited time the food supply is running out there are major shortages
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:46.720]  this is a globalist siege a globalist lockdown globalist terrorism but we the people the patriots
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:50.880]  have to be prepared we've already been proven right about prepping so far we'll get ready to
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:57.840]  be really proven right get your storeable foods now and in fullershore.com the panic that has been
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:05.360]  orchestrated by the global corporates media and the tricombs is going to now trigger a worldwide
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:09.680]  depression in fact we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:16.080]  world but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persist the worse it's going
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:22.960]  to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:27.120]  that's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:31.600]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:39.600]  they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:44.720]  to be able to predict things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:49.840]  and their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:55.120]  them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:19:01.040]  really happening feudalism in the ancient world from asia to europe from africa to latin america
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:06.800]  was the most common form of government you had a ruling class the nobility of the king and queen
[1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:13.600]  sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:19.120]  in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:26.160]  or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they were
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:31.360]  so busy trying to survive they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite well now all the
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:36.480]  big google owners and the rockefellers and the roth child the jeff bezos is the world they're
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:42.880]  sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:48.880]  laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the third world starving to death their religion
[1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:54.960]  is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us we must break free from these
[1:19:54.960 --> 1:20:10.880]  monsters you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:23.840]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host there is a section on the new york times now called information
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:31.760]  war oh and in it they attack a famous virologist at work with fouchy and exposed him for fraud and
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:37.040]  the whole hiv situation and drugs that actually killed people uh that he and others made a lot
[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:40.800]  of money off of that was all in the news at the time i mean but they just think we're stupid
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:45.440]  and don't have memories well they went on in those articles to say that you know she's just a
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:52.720]  absolutely uh terrible horrible person i'm a terrible horrible person and they go on to say
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:21:01.120]  hey it's just not true that vaccines can lower your immunity when you take them to other pathogens
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:10.400]  even though i've got a stack of studies here where they fact check dr judy mikovitz getting
[1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:17.360]  flu shot every year more might not be better stat news dot com all these big studies that lowers
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:23.520]  your immunity major german canadian studies study getting flu shot tears in a row may lower protection
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:33.200]  sid rep it just goes on oh but the new york times virus conspiracy theorist
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:40.320]  conspiracist like we're in a conspiracy now elevate a new champion oh oh
[1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:48.560]  oh there's the french novell prize winner covet 19 made in lab when i first reported this a month
[1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:54.720]  ago they went it's fake news then the fact checkers one actually it's true but again i didn't first
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:59.920]  say that top scientists did but they don't want to discuss because fouchy and billaboo indicates
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:05.760]  and the nih are on record when it became illegal here in 2015 to give gain of function to sars
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:11.440]  corona family viruses meaning it spreads worse spreads easier that's definitely what this virus
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:18.560]  adds is bigger legs then they would get the blame and now even newsweek reports fouchy funded
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:25.040]  controversial covet research coronavirus research they don't want you calling it coronavirus so
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:31.680]  they change it to covet 19 to confuse you and get you off the track so what's coming next
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:36.000]  ladies and gentlemen there isn't a lot of media left everything is completely censored now
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:41.520]  other than say tucker carlson on mainstream news everyone's being kicked off twitter facebook
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:47.520]  youtube it's just a reign of terror medical doctors scientists hospitals cedar side i can't
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:54.880]  cut out and say trumps right it's just total control and this is true authoritarianism
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.080]  and the fact that congress won't act because they're just conditioned to go oh it's a private
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:07.200]  company and the fact that the public doesn't even value speech shows that we're in a lot of trouble
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.920]  because now they're going to have the corporations of the blue cities and the blue counties the blue
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:17.200]  states say whether it's germany or whether it's south korea or whether it's united states the
[1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:22.160]  uk they're just going to say canada already announced they want forced inoculations as
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:27.280]  soon as the vaccine comes out even though scientists go whoa whoa whoa any vaccine can have bad
[1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:33.440]  side effects that's an rna vaccine for you a little bit of the bad thing in your body
[1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.920]  learns how to defeat it instead of having a you know the unattinuated it's still has side effects
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:44.400]  still has problems still lowers immunity in general when you learn them to be immune that way just
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:49.200]  it's a fact has side effects it's on the damn insert don't believe me go get the insert not the
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.840]  fact sheet wall greens or cvs or walmart gives you or target at the pharmacy you want the insert
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.800]  they've got laws they're introduced by the way to ban getting the insert big pharma doesn't
[1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:06.000]  want to have to have the insert anymore so they've already got the drug trials of seven different
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:18.480]  vaccines that bill them on the gates are funding alone and it's a dna vaccine that goes into your
[1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:28.800]  cell nucleus like a virus what it is actually it's an engineered virus it's live and programs
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:38.320]  your cell to accept it and then know how to defeat it i mean this is this is 21st century and in the
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:45.120]  trials it just kills the pigs the cows the rats or it does nothing i've read this look up the
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:51.840]  studies yourself it either does nothing or if it penetrates whoa baby and that's why bill gates
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:58.640]  famously let's cue that up said three weeks ago we need liability protection because if one in 10
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:05.680]  thousand gets sick it's more like one out of three we'll have 700 000 people that get sick or get hurt
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:12.880]  you know like autoimmune disorders or you know if a baby got stung by a bee a lot of times they
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:17.200]  have an autoimmune response and have convulsions become brain damage or die why would you put
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:23.360]  dozens of shots into a baby because you're trying to create an autoimmune response what do you think
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:28.960]  a bee sting is but when your baby has the convulsion in a hospital they've got to admit okay your
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:34.480]  baby's brain damage for life sorry you get a secret vaccine payout that fouchy set up in
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:41.040]  2000 in in in 1986 the vaccine damage fund that's paid out four billion dollars last time i checked
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:47.120]  in secret courts to people whose kids died or or but that's only if you have the convulsion there at
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:52.640]  the hospital if they convulse in the car the SWAT team comes because they'll be blood on the brain
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:56.880]  they'll do a CAT scan and say this child has blood on the brain you beat your baby or you beat your
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:00.960]  your 18 month old that came in for their third round of shots you're like no i didn't they're like
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:06.640]  you're going to prison grand jury and the grand jury says how Hitler and it died your ass but
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:12.640]  australia found 10 years ago in a big national study shaken baby and in sudden infant death syndrome
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:20.720]  was the vaccine so did japan and japan said stop giving it to kids under 18 months but we're not
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:28.320]  gonna stop here the vaccine makers are gonna double down with enjoyment and bill gates we have the
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:39.440]  clip ready didn't hear you over the mic say it again oh great here it is here we clearly need
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:47.520]  a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at at risk of that and doing that so
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:53.520]  that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects you know if we
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:27:03.360]  have you know one in 10 000 side effects that's you know way more 700 000 uh you know people who
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:10.400]  will suffer from that so really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:18.560]  ranges you know pregnant male female undernourished existing comorbidities it's very very hard and
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:24.960]  that actual decision of okay let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world uh governments
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:31.600]  will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:37.200]  be decided on i just showed mainstream news articles about four billion paid out to brain
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:42.960]  damage your dead kids families and recently six million regardless ill for little girls that
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:48.160]  died they were given the shot be a good girl when you're 11 get your shot attacks your ovaries
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:55.040]  attacks your brain it's a live virus so uh they're going to have real trouble covering up all the
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:59.600]  death and everything but this is about the population and they can put intrusion horses into
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:04.320]  this dna vaccine uh where there's no telling what they're going to do but you know of the history
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:10.960]  of secret experimentation that's going on against populations that it's going to be
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:18.880]  absolutely devastating and in trials uh already of covid 19 in new guinea where you get the term
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:25.360]  guinea pig no joke um they've already had mass death on the local news they come in uh they
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:30.240]  inject the children and the women and they just start convulsing and dying everywhere but that's
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:35.280]  okay because again there's too many people right and then they tell the health departments well
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:41.760]  some people do die but let's just uh you know not make a big deal out of it so i personally know
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:45.840]  people that have been sterilized by Gardasil oh and now they give it to little boys too
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:50.080]  all right we'll get an even more hardcore information straight ahead i'm sorry this is
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:53.680]  so hardcore folks you deserve to know what's coming next they're coming to kill you and your family
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:01.360]  it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:07.920]  to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:13.360]  months it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:18.640]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:25.840]  they're not going to have medical ID cards or synoculations we are now in a giant dystopia
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:32.400]  but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:37.520]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:43.120]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:48.720]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions already starved to death tens of millions
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:52.960]  more so the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling you have destroyed
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:58.640]  your lives and our lives congratulations i was talking to my wife tonight and i was saying
[1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:04.800]  our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:10.000]  before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said well yeah when i grew up in Omaha
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:14.800]  Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head
[1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:20.240]  and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole and he was holding it he
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:26.400]  walked around gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well that's
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:32.240]  what's going to happen with our economy it is in cardiac arrest this has been done by design and
[1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:37.680]  the un the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the economy
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:44.240]  closed so remember the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the un on
[1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:50.720]  bill melinda gates on obama on hillary on biden on the democrats we tried to stop it we tried to

[1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:14.960]  new product over a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:23.440]  market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:30.240]  it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo goo but it's high quality and aerosolizes it
[1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:34.800]  in a really great way i like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got
[1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:39.280]  organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but i just love it personally
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:44.080]  has something that's a moisturizer as well show this is a real innovation i don't know why others
[1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:48.720]  didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:53.920]  doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner
[1:32:53.920 --> 1:33:02.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:12.720]  i've got a tiger by the tail explain to see
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:18.000]  i won't be much when you get through with me
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:27.200]  he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas worldwide
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:36.000]  so i'm breaking down what's coming next and look i'm sorry this is a dystopia
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.360]  and i'm sorry that the soviets were an evil group of masterminds winning global domination
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:46.080]  i'm sorry the nazis were another group wanting that and i'm sorry that any culture they took over
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:50.720]  they would exterminate the useful cedars well the globalists are building a world where humans
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:55.360]  are obsolete we're allowing them to phase out everything that's pro-human everything that's
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:00.320]  manufactured by humans they're making us worthless they're training us to be a bunch of entertained
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:07.600]  evil slobs that don't care about unborn babies or third world populations so now we give up our
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:15.920]  birthright and become slaves and then become obsolete so we can be phased out
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:24.720]  they're building a dystopia for power and control when it's actually so easy to empower humanity
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:31.600]  and see us go to the stars they are a globalist virus inflicting us with failure so that they
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:36.640]  can manage us and control us it's the ultimate form of selfishness and now there's no more denial
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:40.160]  they're all over the news saying children need microchips to leave their houses
[1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:45.360]  billamon the gates do have patents and are proposing a digital ink
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:52.880]  in the vaccines before you can leave your house it's on the news and they'll come out and announce
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:59.120]  it and then come out and say oh it's not true don't listen to alex jones here's us say today you will
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:07.120]  get chipped meanwhile it's death's amount trump tries to convince americans it's safe to inch back
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:14.560]  to normal and hollywood says there is no normal it was supposed to be five million dead two million
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:26.320]  dead it's all bs everyone dying is old everyone dying already had multiple conditions how many
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:30.960]  hospital heads have to come out and tell you that but then they get banned because let me say this
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:36.720]  right now the globalists can't have all the vaccine adverse reactions when that's really
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:41.200]  what they're meant to do they can't have all the mutations and all the cancer and all the infertility
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:46.480]  and all the sterilization and all the autoimmune disorders that are on the damn inserts doing
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.960]  it to you and all the billions secretly paid out by the secret courts in europe and here
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:57.840]  here and all the government's starting to ban it overseas so they've got to have internet control
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:08.000]  i remember the old google that would put to the top everything that was most prestigious by
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  people clicking on it and it was all these studies from major scientific institutions
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.480]  most of them aren't evil they're compartmentalized saying you know canadian studies german studies
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:26.640]  sprint studies russian studies us studies brazilian studies saying we find that vaccines are giving
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:32.080]  people allergies we find vaccines are lowering fertility we find vaccines are contaminated
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.720]  with fetal material and cancer viruses remember the troops getting given the experimental anthrax
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:46.080]  shot and how many of them died and then it stopped remember all the congressional hearings
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:53.280]  remember the swine flu vaccine killing over 10 000 people back in the 70s and people remember this
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:56.960]  they remember when they got sick taking a vaccine or seeing their kid get sick
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:02.320]  and so then they see bill them on the gates in the last five years patenting all these
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.040]  coronavirus chimeras with wuhan for a vaccine they've got the ingredients now
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:17.280]  and they play all these games what's crazy is used to you could type in studies show vaccines
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:23.200]  lower immunity the next year all those are gone i spent an hour today
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:29.200]  while my children played with my wife in the pool i wanted to be out there but i had to
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:35.040]  find the articles and i went and found three big studies from just a few years ago about it lowering
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:41.680]  immunity but folks i had to go 50 pages deep i had to find old articles and link through
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:45.920]  it's all nothing but there is no side effects vaccines are perfect no one ever got hurt they're
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:50.800]  totally good it's all lies just but and all these fake doctors and their little you know lab
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:55.520]  coach when i say fake they're fake people you know in their in their little outfits telling you oh
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:59.760]  vaccines are perfect there's no side effects everything's wonderful oh my god it's the worst
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:07.200]  pandemic on earth all this emotional crap that i'll get to next segment
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:13.920]  because they can't allow you to see what's really going on but you go to a Walgreens and you tell
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:18.880]  them i want the flu shot insert not the fact sheet the insert they got to give it to you by law still
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.840]  it's like bible paper it's real thin you have to unfold it it's a little cube and you go but we've
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:30.000]  got to do a project we start a new website that goes and finds all those studies that are hidden
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.320]  that are up there for you because this is total informational suppression ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:42.640]  now here's just a compilation of a two-day event uh December 2nd and 3rd 2019 at the UN
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:47.440]  World Health Organization with their top scientists including the director of vaccines admitting
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:51.520]  they're untested they're dangerous and doctors think they're bad here's what they don't want you to see
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:58.400]  we really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:03.680]  miss communication and the miss apprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.160]  when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:14.400]  always gets blown up in the media one should be able to give a very factual account of what
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:19.040]  exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are but in most cases there's some obfuscation
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:26.000]  at that level and and therefore there's less and less trust the first accusation is it is the
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.280]  adjuvant and yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:37.360]  and many of the vaccines that we do have ranging from tetanus through to hpv require adjuvants in
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:44.240]  order for them to work when we add an adjuvant it's because it is essential we do not add adjuvants
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:50.800]  to vaccines because we want to do so but when we add them it it adds to the complexity causes
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:58.160]  every year on how do you develop vaccines how do you make vaccines and the first lesson is
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:04.480]  while you're making your vaccine if you can avoid using an adjuvant please do so it seems to back
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:08.960]  it up 10 seconds did you hear that these are directors the whole program did you hear gates
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:14.560]  earlier say ramp it up ramp it up that'll hurt young people even more they're getting you ready to
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:22.240]  die continue develop vaccines how do you make vaccines and the first lesson is while you're
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:28.240]  making your vaccine if you can avoid using an adjuvant please do so it seems to me that adjuvants
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:39.040]  multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to and that is their intention
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:47.440]  it seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many instances and therefore it seems to
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:56.240]  me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:02.880]  associated with the antigen but may not have been detected through lack of statistical power
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:08.720]  in the original study the major health concern which we are seeing are accusations of long-term
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:15.280]  long-term effects it's also the subject population that you administer the adjuvant to because we've
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:23.360]  seen data presented to us where an adjuvant a particular adjuvant added to a vaccine and
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:30.320]  the gen did really nothing when administered to a certain population and it's usually the elderly
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:37.840]  you know compared to to administering the same formulation to to younger age strata so so these
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:43.440]  are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate safety and effectiveness
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:49.600]  evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens I cast back my mind to our situation in
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:56.880]  Nigeria where at six weeks ten weeks fourteen weeks a child is being given different antigens
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:02.960]  from different companies and these vaccines have different adjuvant different preservatives and so
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:10.560]  on something crosses my mind is there possibility of these adjuvants preservatives cross-reacting
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:18.400]  amongst themselves have they ever been a study on the possibility of cross reactions from the
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:25.360]  panel members that you can share the experience with us we have a very wobbly health professional
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:32.240]  front line that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines when the front line
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:40.400]  we have hours of it at band-aid video the top side is they get into people dying from it adjuvants
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:44.800]  why do you think people are allergic to peanuts when they never word because they grew vaccines on
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:51.280]  peanuts they admit that that's just one of the things these people are killing us with enjoyment
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:53.120]  and i'm banned for warning you

[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:23.040]  show here in the final segment of the live sunday show to understand something back in december
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:30.080]  we put out large clips of the un official who vaccine summit where they admitted that vaccines
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:34.320]  are killing and hurting people and there's obfuscation that means a cover-up of it and that most
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:40.240]  doctors now know that vaccines are hurting and killing people and there's a cover-up youtube
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:46.800]  religiously vans this video that you just saw last segment even when it's just them talking and they're
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:51.360]  banning medical doctors everywhere so is twitter and facebook that are speaking out against covid-19
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:56.800]  and the lockdowns and the over hyping the deaths and putting other deaths on the list of covid-19
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:02.320]  this is a takeover and this is criminal and google and others let the truth come out about vaccines
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:06.880]  so that big pharma came to their knees in the last five years and they
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:17.520]  now have merged with them so big tech and big pharma are all merging they're all all big six
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:22.640]  tech companies really big five are merging with the big six or seven pharma companies and now
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:28.320]  they're just not letting consumers have info it is it is beyond t.s. louis's the jungle the level
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:34.080]  of abuse of the citizens the level of the abuse of of consumers and then and then remember they have
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:39.600]  the attorney general in new york wanting me criminally indicted saying i'm selling coronavirus
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.960]  cures but i never said i have a cure a treatment for coronavirus because it's big pharma selling
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:49.680]  vaccines that don't even protect you and that secret vaccine damage funds for the liability
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:54.960]  of them killing us and i just showed you all of that so here's bill gates a few clips of what he's
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:49:02.640]  been saying recently here it is a chance for us to share uh things like producing child to death and
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:09.520]  uh improving the nutrition so it's a chance for travel to africa meet with scientists we see a
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:16.580]  lot of things uh that are going very well things like producing child to death and uh improving
[1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:22.640]  the nutrition so travel to africa meet with scientists we see a lot of things that are going
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:29.200]  very well things like producing the child to death and uh improving the nutrition so
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:33.000]  It's a chance of Africa meet with scientists. We see a lot of things
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:40.380]  That are going very well things like producing childhood death and things like producing childhood death
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:45.720]  By the way, when I showed Drew one of the crew members that today you know, that's got to be a deep fake
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:48.080]  He went to the raw video of him on national TV
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:52.720]  He did say producing childhood death and we have clips him saying we need to kill old people death panels
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:57.760]  And we need to reduce the human population to 500 million. I mean and that he runs a depopulation operation
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:03.800]  You want to see all those clips? I mean he's saying it to you. There's too many people, but he's got a shot to save you
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:12.880]  Oh and his dad ran Planned Parenthood on his mom ran IBM with the IBM trust when the head of IBM was a top Nazi can't make that up
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:15.920]  These are all facts
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:20.440]  This is scientific dictatorship and we're not in the future of it
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:28.880]  Now there's a show that came out five years ago on Channel 4 in the UK. It's been bought. It's being remade right now by Amazon
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:32.680]  It's called utopia. That's about a dystopic future and in one episode
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:38.840]  They talked about a binary weapon where there's one amino acid protein in the food
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:41.920]  That then taken with what's in the vaccine
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:43.800]  Sterilizes you well
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:51.720]  It just so happens in real studies in Russia in the US and China that just GMO corn does this to the pigs
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:57.280]  They feed it to and just the GMO soybeans fed to rats was creating 100% sterilization
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:03.480]  But again, they put it out in movies so that when it really happens, you're you're just conditioned to accept it all
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.520]  Let's go ahead and roll a piece from the show utopia
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:10.400]  Was a protein that we bread into food stuffs, okay a
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:12.080]  a
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:14.080]  modification of corn
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:16.440]  We bread a corn with a softer husk
[1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:20.920]  It could be it could be broken down
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:23.880]  use in animal feeds safe farmers
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:28.240]  Billions everyone wanted it hold start like to do do
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:31.440]  It doesn't do anything
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:36.880]  Contains a modified amino acid that helps the softening process, but it's not necessary for it
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:44.440]  The amino acid subsort harmlessly into the body so you went through all that trouble to get this amino acid in food
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:49.000]  And it does nothing look. It was just a cog. I was paid
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  I was just doing what I was told
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:57.840]  Janus consists of a protein and an amino acid independently of each other the harms
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:04.240]  But when they're brought together in the subject they act as a genetic trigger that prevents chromosomal division
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:09.800]  The cell targeted can no longer replicate itself and thereby rendered useless
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:12.840]  the change is
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:14.920]  permanent and
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:17.440]  hereditary
[1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:22.320]  What cells are targeted most of control fertility Becky?
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:27.840]  The purpose of Janus sterilize
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:33.200]  The purpose of Janus sterilize the entire human race
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:40.320]  One of the born supremacy movies the origin when I forget the name of it
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:45.320]  Is very accurate and got into some really secretive research that's been going on since the 70s
[1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:48.560]  It's now public that they can have viruses
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:50.800]  They're tailored to only eat certain
[1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:58.160]  receptors in the brain and they do test on these to eat the receptors that say you have a governor where you can really bench press a
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:02.760]  Thousand pounds we can only bench press four hundred pounds or you could really squat two thousand pounds
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:08.640]  But you know you're a weightlifter you think you can't you can only squat seven hundred and so it turns so now you're superhuman
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:15.160]  Now it's not that exacting, but but they they did that on animals and things they can do it on humans where they give you a vaccine
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:18.680]  It's really a live virus that goes into the brain
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:21.920]  It's really a live virus that goes in and eat certain parts of your brain
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:27.840]  They have nanotech viruses now where they just purely design. That's what a virus is is nanotech. It's it's it's RNA
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:34.400]  It's not technically alive. It reproduces, but it's not alive in the classical sense. And so you see that in the born
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:40.960]  What's the name of the born movie? That's the prequel the point is is that that's real folks and
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:44.960]  Thirty years ago. They admit it again vaccines that control behavior
[1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:49.240]  Oh, you'll never want to use heroin again because it goes in and eats those receptors well
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:57.640]  What do you think heroin and alcohol and nicotine and cocaine and and caffeine hit different receptors because you're supposed to be able to receive that?
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:05.840]  Because when I release an incredible powerful documentary that reaches 20 million people I get an endorphin a high
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:13.520]  Because I know that I'm doing a good job for humanity and I'm designed to do that. It's called my conscience
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:20.840]  I'm following God's programming, but if they can go in and destroy those areas. It's came over that stuff. They admittedly have 30 years ago
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:23.440]  What's the name of the born movie?
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:25.560]  The born identity, that's right
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:33.000]  The born legacy so there you go ladies and gentlemen. I'm telling you this is all 2020, but the future's here. It's not evenly distributed
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:35.840]  We're really like in 2060 and
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:42.560]  They've got stuff way more advanced than the human clones and human come here as they had 40 years ago
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:45.400]  I mean Hitler was cloning rabbits in 1943
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:49.560]  The equations for atomic weapons are from Max Planck
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:55.440]  1898 we're not in Kansas. We never were and
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:55:03.120]  I want to pro human future and I want access to life extension instead our IQs are going straight down cancer's going straight up
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  Our life expectancy is going straight down
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.240]  infant mortality is exploding we're dying and
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:15.840]  We're mesmerized by the TV, but oh I saw it in a black mirror episode China
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:22.400]  Ten years ago was already beta testing social credit scores and face scanning before black mirror ever came out
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:28.680]  So people see the exact Chinese credit score. That's the exact dial and the exact system because they use the real thing
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:33.600]  Just like utopia they're telling you
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:37.920]  Because subconsciously
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:44.840]  Psychologists and psychiatrists know at the high levels not your pop psychologists and psychiatrists that if you've pre-programmed somebody and they've seen
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:49.400]  Something in the comfort of their home that a decade later when they actually see it happen
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:55.080]  They'll be comfortable with it because they were eating chips and pizza that haven't sex with their girlfriend while they learned about something horrible
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:55:57.920]  So their brain files in an area that's non-threatening
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:04.000]  That's why my dad's dad saw a lot of combat in World War two and they'd be in a movie when he was a little kid that had violence
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:11.240]  He'd say we're leaving and it wasn't because he couldn't handle violence. He'd seen a bunch of violence and starving people and arms and legs
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:13.240]  Blown off. He didn't think it was funny
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:20.000]  But when you never seen real violence and you see a bunch of simulated murder your brain starts thinking it's funny because your brain didn't pay
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.800]  Any consequence for it. So now when you're hit with the real thing, you don't know what hit you
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:32.440]  You're all dead unless you wake up to the scientific dictatorship the created Hitler. I need funding too
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:36.720]  I'm not backing down in the face of this. We knew to build this. I knew to build our own infrastructure
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.960]  I knew we'd be shut down if we couldn't hold them back and if they went into the emergence phase going out of beta into
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:43.920]  Operationals so I'm here
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:47.840]  I just want to try to turn this around if you don't share the articles and videos you're insane
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:54.240]  We're doing the best job we can any financial funding and I got great supplements and products and t-shirts and stuff that we need to fund our
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:59.520]  Operation and you should be getting swarable food for the long haul if I wasn't gonna stay on there and fight these people
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.960]  I would be bugging out moving to the most rural area to go back to subsistence farming that probably moved to West Virginia or Kauai or
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:11.400]  New Zealand under the globalist nose because that's where you'll be somewhat safe was right under wherever they're at
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:18.880]  They're already been evacuating for 20 years preparing for the mass experimentation and all these lockdowns are beta tests for when they were they released
[1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:20.880]  a real bio weapon in the future
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:26.440]  That all of you that had the vaccine binary weapon won't be able to resist. It's all binary weapons
[1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:31.860]  Info or store.com info or store.com get in there and wear your colors loud and proud
[1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:38.440]  Get a 5g kills t-shirt or a space force t-shirt or an info worst t-shirt today. Take action. This is all real
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:57.440]  I didn't make any of it up. You have been warned. You have been warned.
