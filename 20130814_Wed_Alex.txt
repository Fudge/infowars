[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:39.680]  Texas Alex Jones necessity dictates that I control myself today necessity
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.280]  dictates that I cover all this news and give you a report on what's happening but
[00:44.280 --> 00:51.600]  I don't want to just focus in on the specific little nodules of horrifying
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.960]  metastasizing gangs of different control freak groups eating out our
[00:58.960 --> 01:04.720]  substance as the Declaration of Independence bemoaned I want to talk
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.960]  about humanity in crisis I saw a study two days ago about television lowering
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.840]  IQs and motor skills in children if I be reprint that for me guys yeah they're
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.280]  turning into zombies and this is not just some accident of the industrialized
[01:21.280 --> 01:31.680]  world this has been decided to accentuate this slouch towards immorality so that
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.520]  people are more easily controlled and I know that most of you understand that
[01:36.520 --> 01:41.560]  but it was just hitting me this morning how you've got people that are hard
[01:41.560 --> 01:48.280]  working smart informed know we're in a crisis who are a minority and then you've
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.080]  got a majority that don't trust the system and know it's corrupt but just
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.240]  don't seem to care and think it's funny and have decided to roll over to die but
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.080]  just because you've probably got 60% of the population in the West that's
[02:02.080 --> 02:08.080]  decadent and and and and think it's cool to give into tyranny doesn't mean the
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.600]  rest of us then have to stand down and be run over the New World Order does not
[02:15.600 --> 02:23.480]  have a galactic license or a universal license to enslave and persecute
[02:23.480 --> 02:31.880]  goodness and so just because a lot of other people are hypnotized by evil and
[02:31.880 --> 02:37.000]  and want to bow to it does not mean that I'm going to bow to it but in the
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.860]  process we cannot tear ourselves apart I mean I get crazed ladies and gentlemen
[02:42.860 --> 02:47.480]  now because this stuff is just it's all coming true just like I said it would
[02:47.480 --> 02:50.480]  because I was reading their own documents but there's the realization of
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.600]  man they're really going to carry all this out and there is a horror to being
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.560]  right and a desperation and that's the only reason this broadcast is
[03:00.560 --> 03:06.160]  successful is because I am desperate and that truth telegraphs over to people
[03:06.160 --> 03:13.680]  that that that that I realize in a natural response how crazy this is and
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.120]  I'm able to shake some zombies out of their trance but then I realize I'm not
[03:18.120 --> 03:25.600]  upset enough like should I screw around and engage in satire and joke around a
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.680]  little bit we all need gallows humor I know it soothes my soul to do it but
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.840]  it's it's more poignant and focused and powerful when I just tell it like it is
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.440]  straight and calm to people which I can do better than anybody but I hardly ever
[03:38.440 --> 03:45.600]  do it because I'm so tortured and I know you're tortured by the over-the-top
[03:45.600 --> 03:55.400]  bizarreness of corruption and evil and how it just seeks to pull down all this
[03:55.400 --> 04:04.920]  beautiful strong and good you marvel at it like John on the island of what was it
[04:04.920 --> 04:18.680]  Patmos marveled at the beast and I have stared so long into the abyss that that
[04:18.680 --> 04:22.720]  it's like both sides are coming together and even though I oppose the system I
[04:22.720 --> 04:28.960]  know it and know it's dark logic and it's just bizarre to see the public
[04:28.960 --> 04:36.440]  operating like self-propelled stomachs mindless jellyfish two-legged bipedal
[04:36.440 --> 04:47.640]  amoebas having no idea how fantastical reality is my wife said it in such a
[04:47.640 --> 04:51.400]  crystallized way this weekend she looked out the window Friday night and we
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.160]  can see the moon to the window and the trees blowing in the wind and she said
[04:55.160 --> 05:01.760]  it's like we're on a spaceship and I said we are why does the United States
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.920]  spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do we have
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.280]  the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and
[05:11.280 --> 05:17.120]  every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat
[05:17.120 --> 05:21.800]  our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[05:21.800 --> 05:27.160]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff all of this has
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.720]  been engineered by design we can turn the tide against the eugenicist by

[09:15.440 --> 09:20.360]  technocrats we're aware of their operation we're contacting humans on a
[09:20.360 --> 09:25.180]  planetary scale that want to be free and have a future and the disease of
[09:25.180 --> 09:29.480]  liberty the virus as the globalists call it is spreading and will not be
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.800]  stopped you know ladies and gentlemen I'm going to get into all the off of the
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.560]  chart incredible news here today and we have Dr. Marcola joining us about Coca
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.600]  Cola the running print and TV ads saying there's no health dangers from
[09:43.600 --> 09:46.960]  aspartame that's in Diet Coke and thousands of other products for that
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.760]  matter and that it's actually going to make you skinny they don't care that
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.920]  there are literally scores of scientific studies out this year CBS news and
[09:56.920 --> 10:03.280]  others are reported that it destroys basically your pancreas and gives you
[10:03.280 --> 10:10.040]  diabetes and makes you obese we just type in aspartame obesity and that's been
[10:10.040 --> 10:17.160]  known forever the fattest people you see 400 500 pounders almost always have a
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.960]  diet coke in their hand or a diet Dr. Pepper
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.360]  it's amazing absolutely amazing did you know my great-great-grandfather named
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.880]  Dr. Pepper in Temple he was an advertising executive and own
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.360]  newspapers was the name William Gresham and I was a little factoid I'd forgot
[10:37.360 --> 10:46.560]  about side issue ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna get into all the news here but
[10:46.560 --> 11:01.640]  what is important for everyone to know here is that you are seeing a scientific
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.920]  technocracy and I know I say this every day but I was on ManCal show this
[11:06.920 --> 11:10.600]  morning and he's a smart guy who's asked me to quantify that you have a ruling
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.280]  globalist elite that controls Europe the United States England and most the
[11:14.280 --> 11:17.920]  world and then they're imitated by the communist Chinese and the Russians but
[11:17.920 --> 11:21.720]  they don't do it as well they want to be the new world order when they grow up to
[11:21.720 --> 11:25.680]  be big kids but to a certain extent China is actually merged with the Anglo-
[11:25.680 --> 11:28.720]  American system we've had top geopolitical analysts on to talk about
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.640]  that the Council on Foreign Relations admits that that's what's so frustrating
[11:32.640 --> 11:39.880]  is these globalists think you're so dumb they admit about 97% of what they're
[11:39.880 --> 11:49.440]  doing and they don't even really couch a lot of it infinitely veiled reports
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.960]  they put up it's not really veiled at all I mean the PNAC report put out a year
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.800]  before 9-11 rebuilding America's defenses said we need giant terror attacks
[11:58.800 --> 12:02.680]  kill around 3,000 people actually says that they even get it down to the exact
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.520]  number I don't know how they did that or just a lucky guess I don't know we need
[12:07.520 --> 12:12.800]  giant terror attacks a new Pearl Harbor whether real or manufactured to create
[12:12.800 --> 12:18.960]  this global government and basically have the technocracy take over and then
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.760]  you realize it's not like the technocracy is just going to you know
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.320]  dumb down and disenfranchise the poor third world that's that's bad enough
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.160]  because you instinctively know well if it happens to them it's gonna happen to
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.000]  me that's why you have a moral programming to have empathy it's not
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.360]  really because according to their view that you're a good loving person it's
[12:41.360 --> 12:49.360]  that in predatory species you have hard wired programming to not kill members
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.520]  of your own group to only go out and engage in predatory activity against
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.040]  designated prey animals but the globalist have designated ninety nine
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.600]  point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine we've done the math of the six thousand
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.640]  global superclass in their own numbers it was point zero zero zero zero zero
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.240]  zero zero two six not the one percent the globalist want to wipe out the two
[13:14.240 --> 13:19.680]  percent okay that's the real number that because and it used to be you know the
[13:19.680 --> 13:23.400]  ten percent just a few decades ago in the west that had the money that's all
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.600]  being dissipated transferred destroyed and when they've got that taken out
[13:28.600 --> 13:31.800]  you're just going to be worrying about getting your next meal you're going to
[13:31.800 --> 13:34.640]  be worried about getting your welfare check even if you work all day you'll
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.280]  get a supplemental check that allows you to live it's all been actuaried out this
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.840]  is collectivism and then you're never going to worry again about being up
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.720]  buddy with the system you will do whatever they say you will work in the
[13:47.720 --> 13:53.160]  robot factories on the robots that are building the robots you will work as a
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.800]  assistant to the robots in the combat field you will work as a secret police
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.440]  officer disappearing people you will do whatever because it's all set up to where
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.520]  that's the only way you can survive and they basically like a funnel shunt free
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.680]  societies into less and less free paradigms in the name of survival and
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.040]  security and then they only shunt that down into smaller and smaller funnels
[14:17.040 --> 14:23.680]  as that expands and accelerates and it is the end of humanity I mean they call
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.320]  the average professor we're going to get rid of 80% of people for the earth but
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.760]  you'll be allowed to survive and you know take part in in the new development
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.360]  of the of the super human class that'll merge with machines then you get up
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.000]  higher level they're like well actually we need to get rid of 90% or so because
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.400]  you know just any amount of humans is bad and then it can all also they could
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.320]  get into other groups later and then oppose our plan and then that would stop
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.240]  the wonderful world we're building from happening so to really it needs to be
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.720]  90% and then you get into higher-level globalist areas they go actually we
[14:54.720 --> 14:57.840]  just want a few million people and they aren't even gonna really be people we're
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.560]  gonna be living forever and you're still gonna want to have some children so
[15:01.560 --> 15:05.000]  we've done the math on that we'll repopulate up to a hundred million or
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.100]  so and stop at that point if you choose to have children as a member of the
[15:08.100 --> 15:10.960]  elite so we need to go ahead and move that down to a couple million first
[15:10.960 --> 15:17.600]  before we build the new civilization and this is in all their publications I
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.520]  mean they're going to kill almost everybody and they're just getting
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.360]  everybody drunk on dead culture drunk on being decadent nihilistic and not
[15:26.360 --> 15:31.120]  caring drunk on all the poisons the brainwaves are lowering the IQs are
[15:31.120 --> 15:34.600]  plunging the death rates are exploding I mean all the numbers are there like of
[15:34.600 --> 15:41.400]  if the Western world was a patient all the life signs are going down we're
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.600]  going into a coma and I'm sitting here along with the rest of humanity that's
[15:45.600 --> 15:49.680]  awake a little sector of the brain desperately going this isn't a dream
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.760]  folks get out of the dream get out of the trance it's like one of those dreams
[15:54.760 --> 15:58.600]  where you can't wake up and we're here saying no no this is real this isn't a
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.600]  dream you're in a hospital bed you're being bled right now and they're getting
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.920]  ready to fully gut us and take our organs basically you got to wake up and
[16:06.920 --> 16:11.040]  then there's this thought process in the group collective mind in the culture of
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.280]  well there are too many of us and we all and we do hurt the earth and you know I
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.120]  don't like poor people and I don't like the minorities and I don't and they
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.840]  don't like me either and the media places off against each other and or if
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.920]  you're a quote minority well I have the government's my friend I want the resources
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.760]  you know it's my only avenue for success I want it to be bigger and so we're all
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.640]  having this internal cultural debate with each other while we're on the bed
[16:35.640 --> 16:41.680]  having our blood drained I mean it's questionable we can even reverse what
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.280]  they've done God knows what they're putting in these vaccines what we know
[16:45.280 --> 16:51.320]  it's deadly enough hormones to reduce fertility reduce IQ sterilization
[16:51.320 --> 16:57.160]  cancer virus cancer plaques embedded triggered at hormonal decrease levels
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.200]  when you get I mean it's just all been actuaryed out I use the word actuary
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.320]  because it's all battle-planned and I'm sitting here going my god look at this
[17:04.320 --> 17:07.720]  battle-planned and you and you know they have newspapers make jokes yesterday I
[17:07.720 --> 17:12.880]  saw one Alex Jones thinks they're gonna build an off-world space station and
[17:12.880 --> 17:16.800]  then destroy the earth no I said the elite have built underground bunkers
[17:16.800 --> 17:20.680]  and facilities for when the bio weapons get out or they release them or
[17:20.680 --> 17:26.600]  whatever happens the Adam and Eve centers on record that's what Dr. Strange
[17:26.600 --> 17:32.160]  loves about 1964 I mean that's on record the U.S. has spent more money than all
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.120]  of the governments combined on COG continuity of government underground
[17:36.120 --> 17:42.440]  bases and it's for less than 1% of the population I know generals who aren't
[17:42.440 --> 17:45.680]  gonna be given access retired generals of facilities and they just know about
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.180]  them and start almost crying when you mention it everybody just wants to go
[17:50.180 --> 17:53.240]  play golf and just and just have a little bit of fun before all this
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.960]  happens who knows what's going on listen I'm not going to sit here and play
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.920]  games with these people okay I mean this is horrific what we're talking about and
[18:01.920 --> 18:06.040]  so all the other window dressing will cover it it's all important news is
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.680]  only to understand the psych warfare program going on and no one is more
[18:11.680 --> 18:15.440]  brainwashed than the people working within the system that's why they're
[18:15.440 --> 18:17.800]  the easiest to wake up you go but I thought they're the most brainwashed
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.160]  they're under the most hardcore oppression and manipulation and and
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.920]  surveillance and control and they know it's a lie and they know it's predatory
[18:26.920 --> 18:30.720]  and it doesn't make sense to them why this is happening until they hear our
[18:30.720 --> 18:34.640]  broadcast and then I tell them where the source documents are and and I don't I
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.560]  don't tell them what to think I just say hey open that door and this is what
[18:38.560 --> 18:40.960]  you're gonna find and they open it and they come back and they go it's worse
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.280]  than you said and I go I know can words describe what you've seen no they cannot
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.080]  describe we've got to warn people exactly ladies and gentlemen but our biggest
[18:50.080 --> 18:55.280]  problem is people that just say well you know humanity is done and so what
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.560]  that's just the way it is or the or the big fake Christians that just say well
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.720]  it's the end of the world tomorrow so why should we do anything well even if it
[19:02.720 --> 19:06.560]  was the Antichrist and all this stuff getting ready to happen you're not
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.000]  gonna warn people you're gonna go into a building that's a government 501c3 or
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.760]  50c8 or whatever the church is the people it's not that building you're
[19:15.760 --> 19:18.720]  gonna go in there and here's some government toady tell you do what the
[19:18.720 --> 19:24.840]  government says every sermon and by the way most these preachers these aren't
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.360]  even actively evil they are scared now and have been told do this and they're
[19:29.360 --> 19:35.000]  having weekly meetings you know with the FBI now we're all infiltrated it is it
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.400]  is a scientific takedown okay and I just want to tell the FBI and all of the

[24:10.760 --> 24:20.880]  I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.800]  the ring of fire let me finish my technocracy break down briefly and then
[24:25.800 --> 24:29.680]  when we come back I'll get into the whole divide and conquer Oprah Winfrey
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.280]  saying it's racist somebody wouldn't show her a 30 something thousand dollar
[24:33.280 --> 24:40.400]  purse the rodeo clown sensitivity training homeland security investigations of
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.680]  it now I told you that was coming this is the criminalization of free speech
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.240]  that's going on how it ties into what's happening with 19 shocking examples
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.360]  about political correctness is destroying America versus the real liberties we're
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.720]  losing and when everybody hypersensitive imagining swipes are
[24:57.720 --> 25:02.320]  obsessing over slides selectively with the federal government that's really the
[25:02.320 --> 25:07.880]  global government in acting as the arbiter but speaking of the
[25:07.880 --> 25:10.960]  technocracy you guys can search engine this I'm going to tell you to end the
[25:10.960 --> 25:18.520]  break type in the Marshall plan wired dot com and it's like a 10 11 year old
[25:18.520 --> 25:24.560]  article but it showed the then 90 year old futurist who'd been there since the
[25:24.560 --> 25:32.400]  40s the head Pentagon futurist and there it is the Marshall plan for 40 years of
[25:32.400 --> 25:37.240]  the man the Pentagon insiders calls Yoda as we're seeing the future of war from
[25:37.240 --> 25:42.760]  battlefield bots rolling off radar proof ships to GIs popping performance pills
[25:42.760 --> 25:49.400]  and that was before the war on terror now this guy is tied into another group
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.040]  of people and you might want to go read his writings from the 1950s because it's
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.680]  it's it's it's it's everything that starship troopers and all that's based
[25:57.680 --> 26:02.680]  on when you see Skynet and you see the robots and all that that's that's one
[26:02.680 --> 26:10.160]  of his plans from the 70s and most of what he talked about has now been set
[26:10.160 --> 26:15.440]  up and then they plan to set the rest of it up so let me tell you what they're
[26:15.440 --> 26:22.400]  doing now I knew this but I'm on a ski boat last night with Staff Sergeant Joe
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.960]  Biggs you know every once in a while I get some R&R so well my friends they
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.840]  took me on the boat when I was changed down there his brothers Sid and Bobby
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.520]  their dad who had a great time rope swings surfing you know I'm not good at
[26:37.520 --> 26:40.560]  it but they were doing it all great Biggs jump right on and was surfing you
[26:40.560 --> 26:46.280]  know without the rope behind the boat in the wake of it was a surfer before he
[26:46.280 --> 26:52.440]  joined the army and while we're watching Rocker nine-year-old do backflips and
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.360]  everything over and over again wakeboarding I look over to Biggs and
[26:56.360 --> 27:00.600]  I said hey did they a drug you guys because I already know everything they're
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.520]  basically doing a lot of them already had microchips a lot of them already had
[27:03.520 --> 27:09.360]  brain chips that's highly classified I had some family tell me about it about
[27:09.360 --> 27:12.760]  six years ago and then afterwards called and said do not ever talk about that
[27:12.760 --> 27:16.880]  again and I'm in a lot of trouble over even you and I didn't say who told me
[27:16.880 --> 27:21.480]  but he said it didn't matter they figured it out they got brain chips I mean
[27:21.480 --> 27:24.600]  probably 30 years they've been testing them on trips but I mean now a lot of the
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.080]  special forces people have brain chips they have chips in their eyes it's
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.280]  it's it's it's incredible ladies and gentlemen and you can go read Marshall
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.040]  talking about it 30 40 years ago but Marshall said we've got to turn them into
[27:37.040 --> 27:43.120]  biological androids the troops before we finally get rid of them and then
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.080]  bring in robots and that's why they're going to put women in now and wreck it
[27:47.080 --> 27:49.600]  all and destroy the performance just like they're bringing in government run
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.280]  health care they've got a they've got to wreck the old health care first before
[27:53.280 --> 27:58.120]  they get rid of humans entirely and by 2020 all the aircraft will be non-human
[27:58.120 --> 28:02.240]  all the combat aircraft 2025 no more humans in combat other than to have a
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.520]  few humans with attack robots at a distance just to make sure that nothing
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.600]  malfunctions and and and in the future a pilot on a plane this has already
[28:11.600 --> 28:14.680]  happened to a certain extent the pilot unions have said this will be like a
[28:14.680 --> 28:20.400]  ceremonial toilet attendant they'll just be there almost as like a PR person
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.320]  with a hat that comes and talks to people and sits there and already that's
[28:23.320 --> 28:26.120]  why they're having more crashes the pilots have said because that everything's
[28:26.120 --> 28:30.840]  remote control already autopilot taking off autopilot landing they don't know
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.320]  what to do when there's a problem or when the computer didn't foresee
[28:34.320 --> 28:42.200]  something so the point is I'm sitting there and big goes bigs goes yeah they
[28:42.200 --> 28:45.000]  have the Russian helicopters no one looked it up last night there it all
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.880]  was deliver us the drugs and we were ordered to take them he goes a lot of
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.480]  it we didn't know what it was but it was like a lot of it was Percocet and they
[28:52.480 --> 28:57.040]  were priming them all to become opium addicts when they got out and then they
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.400]  would take them off the Percocet and then everybody would want the opiate and
[29:00.400 --> 29:05.880]  they'd go well we're gonna test for Percocet but there is opium because he
[29:05.880 --> 29:08.960]  he didn't understand it I was explaining it all to him and he said the
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.680]  helicopters would land and they basically told him we don't want you to
[29:12.680 --> 29:14.920]  have any pain or feel bad what you're doing they were going into whole
[29:14.920 --> 29:19.040]  villages and you know wiping people out and stuff and so they were putting them
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.520]  on huge dosages of painkillers without even being hurt just to addick them to
[29:24.520 --> 29:28.560]  then have leverage over them now that's nothing they give the special forces
[29:28.560 --> 29:35.880]  amnesics after you know he was just a you know regular army and airborne but
[29:35.880 --> 29:40.600]  the point is is that and again I already knew more than he knew but I was
[29:40.600 --> 29:45.240]  hearing it from his perspective how they would send in the CIA doctors and just
[29:45.240 --> 29:50.040]  drug all the troops I mean that's that that's the new world order folks we're

[34:18.800 --> 34:24.360]  being being struck in the heavens as we come in like a shooting star falling to
[34:24.360 --> 34:30.920]  earth then it is worth it ladies and gentlemen we're here ladies and gentlemen

[35:36.960 --> 35:41.200]  motivated to resist tyranny that's what we need is the right combination of
[35:41.200 --> 35:44.960]  people that have general knowledge of the world who realize that they want a
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.520]  future for humanity and that and that that's what's going to fulfill you if
[35:48.520 --> 35:53.880]  people knew the way I felt if people knew what it's like to be aware and
[35:53.880 --> 35:57.960]  informed and understand the world and and to be helping humanity it is the most
[35:57.960 --> 36:05.800]  empowering fulfilling thing you can possibly imagine having all the best
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.320]  you know looking girlfriends I mean I had probably seven different dates a week
[36:10.320 --> 36:16.160]  if I wanted them you know back when I was 19 20 21 years old haven't you owned
[36:16.160 --> 36:22.480]  the cool parties you name it none of it was fulfilling because it isn't
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.080]  fulfilling fulfilling is a wife you love and children you love and you stand
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.640]  with fulfilling is building good things that help other people fulfillment is
[36:29.640 --> 36:33.400]  working hard fulfillment is being honorable and people knowing you're
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.320]  honorable that's why they always attack my honor and always say I'm the back
[36:37.320 --> 36:40.480]  stabber I'm a liar I'm corrupt I'm missing that because the system knows
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.720]  I'm for real and they're afraid other people might emulate what we've done
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.360]  not that we're perfect my work is dirty rags before the Creator my point is is
[36:50.360 --> 36:56.240]  that the idea of being honorable if it ever catches on again folks that's it
[36:56.240 --> 37:04.520]  for the New World Order we are entering the age of dishonor of betrayal of
[37:04.520 --> 37:11.080]  backstabbing of arrogant narcissism of degeneracy of sadists who enjoy
[37:11.080 --> 37:17.320]  persecuting the innocent we are entering a artificial system of less and less
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.920]  resources when we have unlimited resources with the technological systems
[37:21.920 --> 37:28.720]  that have been suppressed nearly unlimited there is a globalist
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.640]  technocratic group who has decided to create a false reality through the
[37:32.640 --> 37:39.840]  culture of death they push to become an artificial habitat for our minds to to
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.480]  have us stand down and not be part of the real world they are constructing and
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.960]  building by siphoning off our energies towards a technocratic robot automated
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.360]  system where we will no longer be needed and now the elites in the castle will
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.240]  not have their ancestral enemy of the peasants without who they disdain so
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.240]  much labor will not just be cheap human life will no longer just not be
[38:04.240 --> 38:09.040]  incredibly cheap it will be a toxic waste to be removed and they're already
[38:09.040 --> 38:14.800]  romanticizing the end of the civilization the crossover civilization and the birth
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.920]  of the new civilization and I've studied history I've studied these people they
[38:19.920 --> 38:22.480]  will not stop killing each other until they've killed every single one of
[38:22.480 --> 38:26.560]  themselves they are not going to stop it is their nature the journey is the
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.920]  destination the destination that even their high-level Luciferian adepts have
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.240]  been given is not where you're going and I know many of you say I don't care I am
[38:35.240 --> 38:39.840]  joined with it and I love the power I get out of it you don't get any power
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.680]  out of what you're doing you are a reflection of darkness a reflection of
[38:44.680 --> 38:51.680]  destruction only by turning yourself over to life and a creation and the
[38:51.680 --> 38:56.640]  creator of the creation only by submitting yourself to that only by
[38:56.640 --> 39:00.400]  asking God into your heart the real God not the one in these devil churches the
[39:00.400 --> 39:04.000]  devil's greatest work but the real God of the universe that you have a personal
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.680]  relationship and you don't need some high priest in front of you to bring you
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.720]  through that door when you have that real relationship ladies and gentlemen the
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.760]  chains are broken and the universe will begin to open up to you if you can handle
[39:17.760 --> 39:21.880]  it and there's a reason people drug themselves and get into evil because evil
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.240]  is a lot easier than being good because being good is far beyond what you've
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.640]  ever been told by the New World Order that it is it is not some shrieking
[39:30.640 --> 39:36.280]  violet coward person who's stupid and naive it is people on fire with liberty
[39:36.280 --> 39:45.760]  and power with God shining through us as in his own image sub creators now most
[39:45.760 --> 39:51.000]  people turn to evil because you can't handle being really good because let me
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.400]  tell you a little secret ladies and gentlemen God has knowledge of all this
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.720]  evil God allowed it to take place to to to have us in the gladiatorial arena
[39:59.720 --> 40:05.920]  show who we really are for eternity because a child not made to work and be
[40:05.920 --> 40:13.040]  honorable become a spoiled brat will become a demon and that's why we're
[40:13.040 --> 40:20.240]  here spiritually no doubt about it to be tested in this crucible so that the
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.920]  creator of the universe can decide if we go on to the next level and you know
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.760]  it's there and the devil worshipers and the Luciferians know it's there and
[40:28.760 --> 40:31.480]  that's why they want to try to imitate God and that's why they want to try to
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.280]  act like God and Google says their goal is to be the mind of God and to be able
[40:36.280 --> 40:41.120]  to make themselves God's and to know everything about every one so they can
[40:41.120 --> 40:48.240]  cut us off and destroy us physically this is a bunch of miscreants trying to
[40:48.240 --> 40:56.440]  play creator setting themselves up just as the devil did I mean there's the
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.440]  whole evidence of God in the devil right there look at how they manifest all
[41:00.440 --> 41:07.000]  the attributes of Satan B.L. Z. Bob shy tan Leviathan whatever name you want to
[41:07.000 --> 41:18.040]  give it all right there even if you don't believe in unseen forces in this
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.160]  universe as you look out your window at night and see the moon rising above the
[41:22.160 --> 41:29.280]  trees and distant nebulas and stars on a orbiting rock with a molten center around
[41:29.280 --> 41:36.760]  a huge star out on the edge of a galaxy staring into eternity and and and you'll
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.200]  let some some programmed trendy tell you that because you have deep connection
[41:42.200 --> 41:46.440]  to the universe and that you feel the great eternity around you that there
[41:46.440 --> 41:52.440]  is no God that there is nothing unseen that they know everything they want to
[41:52.440 --> 41:58.120]  be your priest they want to be your God they want to be your ruler they want to
[41:58.120 --> 42:04.680]  be your controller they want to take your free will they are the most
[42:04.680 --> 42:14.240]  blasphemous disgusting filthy stinking ugly just microscopic little devils
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.520]  in comparison to the creator of the universe and you worship them you bow
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.120]  to them as they attack everything good the family as they attack the woman as
[42:26.120 --> 42:30.120]  they attack the children as they attack the father as they pull down everything
[42:30.120 --> 42:36.080]  that's good because it is ugly in their eyes because it's not their creation and
[42:36.080 --> 42:39.840]  then all of their creations are ugly and twisted and aren't even creations they
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.360]  are nothing but abominations of what was already said in motion the fruits of
[42:45.360 --> 42:53.120]  the New World Order are hell and death and destruction the fruits of the New
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.800]  World Order is mass genocide not just against individuals but against
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.680]  cultures and ideas and everything that's good I did not mean to get up here
[43:01.680 --> 43:07.480]  today and start preaching it's just it is unbelievable the potential humanity
[43:07.480 --> 43:14.120]  has and I know that this is the great task we enter but it is painful to see
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.800]  so many fall it is painful to see so many who are spiritually blind it is
[43:19.800 --> 43:26.880]  painful to see so many who have no idea whose hand they have placed their trust
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.920]  the authoritarianism coming in the persecution of everything good also
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.520]  these control freaks can play God the whole world given over to the most
[43:38.520 --> 43:47.280]  craven vicious spiritually stinking wicked damned demons and by damned I
[43:47.280 --> 43:50.600]  don't mean that in the Lord's name in vain they are damned and they know it
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.600]  they are damned off from good not because God even put them there but
[43:54.600 --> 43:57.800]  because that's who they are
[44:01.560 --> 44:07.520]  I've got to get to news because I've got guests coming up document can place for
[44:07.520 --> 44:14.160]  TV viewers I want to go over some of these articles for people let's just
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.960]  finish up with the point that the media talks about how much they love the
[44:18.960 --> 44:23.360]  trips all day they are giving them drugs trying to get them addicted so that
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.600]  they can take their rights away later on record it's even in the news our
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.040]  government is not our government it grows most drugs worldwide and then

[44:38.400 --> 44:42.920]  to be men they take men that want to be men that the new order hates so much and
[44:42.920 --> 44:48.040]  they use that male energy and that courage against you to help carry out
[44:48.040 --> 44:53.200]  wickedness worldwide which then stirs up the wickedness in the Muslims as well
[44:53.200 --> 45:01.960]  so that they can have men kill each other in a bloody satanic communion they
[45:01.960 --> 45:11.120]  defile all of us with the baby stem cell additives that are in hundreds of

[55:02.640 --> 55:07.800]  coming up dr. Mercola hey coke says as per James good for you so I thought we
[55:07.800 --> 55:11.920]  actually go over all the real studies have you want to weigh 800 pounds I
[55:11.920 --> 55:17.320]  guess and you know have diabetes sure and go blind I mean yeah sure what
[55:17.320 --> 55:20.640]  alcohol does wonders for you yeah it breaks down to that at 87 degrees and
[55:20.640 --> 55:28.800]  our bodies 98.9 and then yeah 98.6 you know people very 98.7 boy I tell you
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.000]  ladies and gentlemen I'm also gonna get into the whole rodeo clown situation
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.720]  this is all about you know we can abort half the black people in this country
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.720]  and have a eugenics operation and you know take everybody's basic liberties
[55:41.720 --> 55:44.640]  and freedoms but we're gonna get you obsessed over a rodeo clown and have
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.920]  the NAACP calling for criminal investigations so I did a video yesterday
[55:48.920 --> 55:52.600]  live on the air but we have the clip of it up on info wars.com Alex Jones
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.600]  receive Obama clown sensitivity training that satire but it ties into the real
[55:58.600 --> 56:04.960]  article by Curt Nemo. NAACP attacks rodeo stunt and political satire yeah
[56:04.960 --> 56:08.960]  attacks free speech is what it's doing. Drudge report really has all the news on
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.000]  this over on their left hand side all of it together it's pretty amazing but you
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.560]  notice this is Missouri and a bunch of other states have these truth squads
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.720]  that are these tattletail squads and they tell them now this is five years
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.800]  ago I'm about to play the clip that if you hear anybody criticize the president
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.560]  call the police and I know a lot of people have a secret service visit them
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.160]  for just saying they hate Obama and again Obama's the front man of the bad
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.320]  agenda but but still folks you have a right to criticize the president you
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.240]  were born with that right it's patriotic to love your country but to fear and
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.560]  dislike your government and so I thought I'd play a short clip of the Missouri
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.240]  truth squads and by the way more newscasts came out they would actually go to
[56:48.240 --> 56:52.440]  people's houses and threaten to arrest them if they said he was a Muslim or
[56:52.440 --> 56:58.080]  wasn't born here well even if that's true or not true the point is you have a
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.720]  right to say you know Barack Obama is an Easter Bunny or the Barack Obama you
[57:03.720 --> 57:06.960]  know something was true as dad was a famous communist pornographer from
[57:06.960 --> 57:10.200]  Hawaii so they created the whole fake Kenya thing and said he was born there
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.960]  in all his own literature so we thought well you say you were born in Kenya and
[57:13.960 --> 57:17.360]  all your Harvard literature and and all your book deals but then now you say you
[57:17.360 --> 57:21.840]  aren't and your wife's on video saying you were born there but now you say you
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.560]  never said that we're crazy oh it's a bait and switch you're really the son of
[57:25.560 --> 57:31.360]  a famous communist pornographer and your mother's in the pornography publicly so
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.240]  we're look at the president's mother all bent over it's like but again that's all
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.120]  part of just breaking America down just what will we put up with it's all you
[57:39.120 --> 57:44.680]  know like wiener up there you know and the whole rise of that that that big
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.440]  debacle that's finally now shrinking thank goodness let's go ahead and go to
[57:48.440 --> 57:52.400]  this clip to remind you that this is where this comes from the NAACP calling
[57:52.400 --> 57:58.240]  for the Secret Service the bull they said we're gonna charge our precious one
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.000]  that's ripping everybody off and scamming everyone as a frontman let's go
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.900]  to this clip here it is senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking
[58:05.900 --> 58:10.640]  Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading
[58:10.640 --> 58:14.480]  television ad during the presidential campaign this was John Mills is live at
[58:14.480 --> 58:17.240]  the county election board in Maplewood he's been learning more about which
[58:17.240 --> 58:21.160]  members of law enforcement are getting involved in this John tell us more

[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:13.760]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:45.880]  Joseph Mercola is going to be joining us to break down coming up in the start of
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.880]  the next segment after we cover some other news Coke to defend safety of
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:56.480]  aspartame in new ad it'd be like a headline you know cigarette makers to
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.160]  defend safety of cigarettes in new ad I mean it's exactly parallel with that
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.200]  except for my own research and all the medical doctors and people have had on I
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:10.600]  think aspartame probably statistically may even be worse than cigarettes and of
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.040]  course it is a byproduct of a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.640]  that puts out this very sweet molecule that when it group chain of molecules
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.320]  and when it breaks down at 87 degrees turns into one part wood alcohol the
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.240]  other part basically formaldehyde so dr. Joseph Mercola one of the leading
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.160]  probably the leading health experts out there will be will be joining us coming
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:43.480]  up in the next segment and then we are also going to continue with Ben Swan
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.520]  launching his own media platform you know he was interested in coming to work
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.960]  here but I never really never got deep into that because I thought you know he
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.440]  bodies do his own thing and then down the road we can just self-promote you
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.720]  know each other because I'm into synergy and he's just such a such a great
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.240]  reporter I want to get his take on all the big scandals and things that are
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.480]  going on his Kickstarter campaign failed when I saw it that it was a million
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:13.280]  250,000 I thought it would probably fail not that you don't need that much to
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.120]  start something you need more than that to really out of the gates boom do a
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.760]  nightly internet TV show for everybody that's high quality and produced with it
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.040]  with it I mean that's that's it's just that's the problem I mean it took me a
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:36.840]  decade a decade spending almost everything I had I mean just you know
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.880]  absolutely like I didn't go out and buy a new car and I had cars that like to you
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.600]  know it was constantly breaking I finally got a newer car just got sick of
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.680]  things breaking all the time it came more of a hassle but the point is I just
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:59.000]  put I don't know 95% of the money I had coming in for a decade into you'll back
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.200]  in to the operation all the discretionary income and we've built this
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.440]  operation and I didn't mean to segue off into that it's just that I hope people
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.480]  realize that as crazy as the stuff we talk about here sounds you notice almost
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.440]  all of us now come out in the open and and and now I can even talk about things
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:23.240]  that I don't talk about as much because it just sounds so over the top that for
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.440]  30 years they've been implanting trackable microchips really longer than 30
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.080]  years in spies CIA special forces people and now they're doing all sorts of
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.920]  medical experiments on these guys they get them to sign off on and MIT admits
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:42.080]  those programs are going on with DARPA University of Texas runs some of them as
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:51.160]  well and I really got to be careful actually because they do persecute so
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.800]  many whistleblowers nowadays I don't think they want to come after me because
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.200]  they don't want to give me that much attention I'm not their target you know
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.560]  that would give me too much attention if they came and said I was released in
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.840]  classified info so much of this I learned from classified sources but a lot of
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.440]  its open source as well I could then confirm it a pieces of it open source
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:15.000]  public sector above the above the underground technological system and I
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.120]  mean that figuratively but still it's it's I don't think people are ready to
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.320]  hear at all I just I think the media would have a field day with it but let's
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:32.880]  just say this history our civilization everything you see my friends a lot of
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:40.000]  it's not as you've been told a lot of it is not as it seems and I'll just leave
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.600]  it at that we're going to come back and get into the establishment striking
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.960]  back a record plunge in the sales of things containing aspartame so their
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.320]  answer to that is to spike the entire food chain with it so that you could
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:03.440]  not escape the neurological excitotoxin chemical weapon are we choosing our own destiny or has it
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.320]  been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:11.880]  had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars have

[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.800]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.600]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it

[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:29.000]  Dr. Joseph Merkola will be joining us here in about five minutes to break
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.920]  down the big national headlines out of the Associated Press Coke to defend
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:41.560]  safety of aspartame in new ad and this is like saying Coke to defend the safety
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.120]  of cigarettes or coke to defend the safety of there's hands down no debate
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:55.800]  what aspartame does so we're going to be breaking all of that down with him and
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.200]  there's another study out here that natural news calm has we have it up on
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.240]  info wars calm that Mike Adams breaks down where mortality rate doubles for
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.800]  females eating refined white sugar lab mice study rocks soda industry so it's
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.640]  not just the aspartame but for my research and well not my research the
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.080]  research I've done on the main line research is that aspartame is even
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.680]  worse than refined sugar I just know if I let my kids eat refined sugar they
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.000]  look like they don't look as healthy for like two days there's like birthday
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.200]  parties every week and I'm like no they can't go to a birthday party once I
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.200]  come on I know we feed them organic all time but they want to see their friends
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.600]  and then for like a day they're like wiped out after it from eating the big
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.680]  piece of cake I mean if I eat a piece of cake I feel like I had like 10 shots of
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.600]  Jack Daniels the next morning I've a hangover from it literally I won't
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.000]  drink anything and I'll eat a piece of cake like oh I have a headache the next
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.720]  day I mean no wonder this is going on and then you still just do it you're
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.360]  like all here you know let my son have some ice cream last night after we went
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.840]  out water skiing and I was just why did I do that was it's a double whammy it's
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.400]  actually child abuse man I'm telling you but it's not just that it's the it's
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.640]  the highly processed stuff so no no yelling at your kid to make them be
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.960]  behave that's child abuse poisoning them that's okay the government says put them
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.920]  on Ritalin Prozac that's a good thing okay enough of that that's coming up
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.880]  with Mercola in a minute I mean this whole rodeo clown thing I'm gonna get
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.000]  two more after he leaves this Missouri has something called truth squads we
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.680]  probably need to get a whole article out on this because even though this is
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.160]  five and a half year old news this is what was involved here the tattletales
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.600]  went and called the press and then and then now the secret services involved
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.640]  because a man dressed like a clown a rodeo clown was taunting the bull and
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.840]  then the announcer was saying will that bull get him folks anybody's been to
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.680]  rodeo knows that's what you do they they say oh the bull trying to get him and
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.720]  they jump in the barrel and then the bull runs into it and you jump out of the
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:05.960]  barrel and the rodeo clowns are there to protect the bull riders when they
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.760]  fall off so they don't get stomped and killed and then it's become its own
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.560]  ex exhibition of daredevil itself kind of like running with the bulls or
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.160]  something in Spain and undoubtedly people don't like Obama trying to take
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.520]  their guns and deindustrializing the country and trying to federalize the
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.720]  farmers of course rural areas don't like Obama but it's more because of his
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.280]  policies I guarantee you we had a black president that was constitutional he
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.080]  would be worshipped at a mainly white rodeo I guarantee it but the whole point
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.840]  is is that they want to invoke racial division in divide and conquer just like
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:46.720]  Oprah Winfrey went in and said I want to see the $35,000 purse in the locked
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.040]  case that was a display and the woman said no you've got to wait she was a
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.920]  part-time and Italian employee didn't even really speak English said you got
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.720]  to wait till the manager gets here and I mean I'll assure you folks at most
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.600]  those type of places that they don't just let anybody I don't care if you're
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:10.200]  black or white come in and look at the $35,000 purse plus it just shows the
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.960]  insane decadence of Oprah Winfrey wanting a $35,000 purse and what do you
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.640]  want to bet she's got hundreds of purses hundreds of purses in her
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.320]  closets and this is a woman who lobbies for Obamacare lobbies for higher taxes
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.520]  on the middle class and then she's a globalist that meets with Bill Gates
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:32.000]  to talk about population reduction mainly in the black community she's been
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.920]  put in her media position to create racial division and Oprah Winfrey is
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:42.120]  disgusting absolutely hey Oprah why don't you do a story on 51% of blacks
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:48.200]  being aborted when the other groups aren't even in the double digits but
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.800]  now it targets blacks to get rid of them by the liberal so-called establishment
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.560]  the genesis why don't you talk about Obama doubling money for basically forced
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:02.160]  abortions in Africa oh no no killing black babies is not an issue with you
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.920]  or UN forced vaccine programs in Africa where they've caught them adding
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.800]  hormones to the tetanus shots that then sterilizes the women I guess to your view
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.480]  there are too many people no no someone not showing you a $35,000
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.680]  handbag that didn't know who you were and didn't speak English in a foreign
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.600]  country that is the big issue for you to for all of us to feel pity for you and
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.240]  your five billion dollars or six bill how much is she worth last time I checked
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:34.560]  I mean I am just sick and tired of it but they need us to worry about our
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.920]  sexual preference or our or I'm being abused how you looked at me or our don't
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.920]  say brown bag in in Seattle or you'll be fired at in any government job because
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.040]  brown bag is racist has nothing to do with that it means the paper brown bags
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.680]  everybody used to go to school they were kids or work hey I'm getting lunch
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:58.440]  today you want me to get you lunch no I'm brown bagging it oh whoa CJ whoa Chris
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.160]  all of you before a brown bagged it we got black folks Hispanics white folks
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.480]  worker you've all brown bagged it you're all racist you're all fired I'm telling
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.560]  you I'm racist to my mom I didn't know my mom was a racist my mom was what you've
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.520]  called a mainline you know real liberal kind of the Thomas Jefferson vein when
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.640]  I was growing up that it's the character people's deeds and what they stand for and
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.240]  racism is bad and let's watch kill a buckingbird on TV and I didn't know
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.560]  that she used to send me with the cheap brown bags to school with a sandwich and
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.200]  chips and and and carrot sticks my mother my mother hated black people I
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.920]  mean I just and by the way we got to get rid of the clowns red hair that's
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.880]  against redheaded folks and the red nose that's against alcoholics no no really
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.640]  they dress up like clowns because the bulls see the red and chase after him as
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.720]  all the bulls can see his black and white with some spectrum of red okay and
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.560]  so it and so it gets them all excited but the bull is racist as well it was
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.760]  gonna try to run over the old bomber clown and so don't worry he's been fired
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.720]  he's been banned he can't get a job now on the rodeo in that state and they're
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.680]  talking about nationwide bans and his arrest because we're land of the free
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.000]  home of the brave so we're gonna be getting into the truth squads we have
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.320]  the video up on info wars.com somebody ought to write an article about the
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.520]  truth squads we just have the art of the video up there but we're gonna play
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.640]  that the next hour after after we're gonna cover a lot of news with Ben
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.360]  Swan when he joins us the award-winning Edward R. Murrow winning reporter one
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.360]  two of those just a great guy to have him be an awake constitutionalist he's
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.800]  gonna be joining us to cover the entire waterfront cornucopia of issues in the
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.040]  next hour we got a lot of geopolitical issues we're gonna be getting into the
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.280]  army shooting more of the Muslim al-Qaeda brotherhood people it's just
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.160]  terrible situation in our government's backing the al-Qaeda forces I don't support
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.240]  the military shooting them either but this is all the globalist meddling
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.280]  divide and conquer full spectrum dominance stuff that caused this but
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:57.960]  that said I want to shift gears now for the balance of the hour with Dr. Joseph
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:05.960]  Mercola the leading alternative health advocate and and researcher in the
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.480]  country and he really doesn't need any introduction Mercola.com we're gonna go
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.640]  to him in just a moment but I wanted to first tell you why we got him on today
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.120]  it's so funny the synergy I said I want to get Mercola on and Chris goes it's
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.840]  funny they sent us an email saying he's available he's usually not available I
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.680]  guess this got him so upset that he can come on the show he's a very busy guy
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:32.480]  but coke to defend safety of aspartame in new ad this is associated press and
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.000]  then we have another study out mortality of rate doubles for females eating
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.560]  refined white sugar that stories up on info wars.com for Mike Adams and
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.880]  natural news so so all of this is coming out so you're you're in trouble if you
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.280]  do you're in trouble if you don't but what's amazing is they had big studies
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.480]  come out this year scientific mainline studies that aspartame's connected to
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.160]  increasing obesity and hunger everything Dr. Blalock a brain surgeons talked
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:05.160]  about here the the excitotoxin just like MSG and Dr. Mercola of course goes
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.720]  over that. He's a New York Times best-selling author Dr. Mercola also
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.560]  voted 2009 ultimate wellness game changer by the Huffington Post has been featured
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:19.240]  in Time Magazine LA Times ABC News I'm not gonna go over it all and we're
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.560]  honored to have him on with us. I tell you this is really getting out
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.280]  rages and and what does this signify because for me it means we're starting
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.800]  to have a victory that because they say our sales are plummeting so we've got
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:37.440]  to come out and say it's good for you what's really happening here. Well well
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.840]  thank you for having me Alex. Thank you sir if you bet. I think the big issue is
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.080]  is that I would agree with you that I think we are winning their sales of all
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:53.320]  sodas are down 3% and diet sodas are down 6% which is what the impetus for the
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.800]  campaign is which launches an Atlanta Constitution tomorrow and in Chicago my
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:04.320]  hometown next week. So I think it's a phenomenal sign of victory we are
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.000]  making the debt because when I have someone who's new to health and doesn't
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  understand how to apply these natural principles the very first recommendation
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.840]  I make is to stop drinking soda because Americans drink 56 gallons of soda and
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.960]  you know people intuitively know that sugar is not good for them and then
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.440]  when they see diet they think that's healthier but the sad challenge here Alex
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:34.360]  is that they should be really sued for fraud the FTC should sue these companies
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.280]  for fraud because it is not in any way shape or form of diet. They have no
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:43.040]  studies supporting that claim yet when we make a claim that even that is
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.080]  substantiated by literature you know the FDA writes letters but they have no
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.840]  support for this in fact the studies that looked at weight loss with the use
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.240]  of these diet products show that in fact that there is no weight loss if
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:00.240]  anything there's weight gain. Now you yourself as an MD is an osteopath who
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.120]  began to awaken to this decades ago how frustrating is it for you who reads the
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.680]  peer-reviewed mainline studies about coke you know aspartame making you get
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.400]  fatter it's now in tens of thousands of products people just know it's in these
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.360]  diet soft drinks so they're staying away from it. How frustrating is it to see
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:23.400]  them come out with a bald-faced lie saying that aspartame isn't bad for it
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.800]  because I'm showing Associated Press you know I'm showing articles here a CBS
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:33.440]  news where they're admitting that okay you know this stuff in studies does
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.720]  make you get fatter so I guess this is the Empire striking back. Yes as I said
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.520]  initially I think it's a really great sign that we can see that they're
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.320]  having to resort to these types of measures to exaggerate and give these
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.920]  myths truths to boost their sales I think it shows that we're winning that
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.000]  our campaigns I've been speaking about this for 17 years on the website and
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.840]  warning people about this and it's finally starting to click in you know as
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.440]  you mentioned earlier we have one of the largest natural health websites in the
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.800]  world so we have a unique position to evaluate this the search trends coming
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.880]  into our site and Alice you may not be aware of this but the number one search
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:21.880]  term that people come to our COLA.com for is the very word aspartame we have two
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.040]  of the top five articles on the internet for that and people and the reason
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:31.360]  they're doing that is because they're they know that there's something
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.200]  wrong with this this is their first step they're toe into the water for natural
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.840]  medicine so I think it's a phenomenal sign that they have to resort to these
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.400]  types of measures I'm very excited to see you. Looking at this I mean this is
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.320]  really the triumph in the last 60 70 years with all these drugs really all
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.720]  these additives they put in things to make people eat more to make them become
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.280]  addicted and then obviously the medical establishment doesn't care because it
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.880]  just brings them more patients and more treatments I mean this is just a classic
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.400]  problem reaction solution paradigm but it's got to you know really upset those
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:11.040]  that had the triumph of propaganda that that they could sell the PR that this
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.400]  stuff was safe and that now all those lies in the case of aspartame approved in
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:20.560]  what 1981 that it's beginning to all cave in. Yes as I said I think it's
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.360]  exciting and some of the reasons that for those of your listeners who may not
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.320]  be aware of some of the dangers of aspartame you know it's promoted as
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.960]  being safe because in one intuitively it makes sense because supposedly all they
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.560]  do is combine two amino acids they link them together and one is aspartic acid
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.360]  the other is phenylalanine unfortunately when it's broken down into your
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.200]  body by your body there's a there's a methyl group on the phenylalanine that's
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.480]  not there normally and that methyl groups gets converted to methanol actually
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.440]  10% of it is converted to methanol and many of you their listeners know that
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:59.040]  methanol is wood alcohol and wood alcohol of course is highly toxic and
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.120]  because it is transferred in your body and it goes to these nerves that your
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.080]  bypasses to the blood brain barrier and caught and converted to formaldehyde
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.120]  sort of a trojan horse and that formaldehyde is is really toxic to your
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:19.120]  body it has been linked to increased risk of cancers, seizures, migraines, auto
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.240]  immune disorders, headaches, it's just it's a pernicious substance that no way
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.720]  shape or form should ever be consumed by anyway there just anyone there's no
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.040]  excuse for there's no benefit to it it's all a downside. Dr. Mercola I want to
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.040]  expand on what the real studies that you have upon your site break down and try
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.040]  to give us just a ballpark how many there are because it seems like I've seen
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.840]  over the years just dozens a year it's got to be in the hundreds you know not
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.440]  just on this but on the hydrofluorosalic acid the new Harvard study last year
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.520]  that looked at 24 other studies I mean you look at this mountain of evidence
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.120]  these chemists know full well what they're doing and then the studies about
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:06.400]  degeneration of the eyes and just the connection to diabetes and I mean this
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.720]  is really incredible I think as all this comes out and as the Empire strikes
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.760]  back we should be talking about not them removing it out of the tens of
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.360]  thousands of foods they've now put it in but how about arresting some of these
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.360]  people how about investigations because I mean this is like a holocaust that's
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.080]  going on. You know it seems like tens of thousands of foods certainly but I
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.740]  think it's only about six but little over six thousand maybe seven or eight
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.240]  thousand and they increase it all the time but it's pervasive you're right
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.320]  it's in everything and if you go to the grocery store I was kind of shocked one
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.400]  day just because I was traveling I want to get some water and I said oh here's a
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.600]  flavored water I thought my friend might like this and if you read the label in
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.840]  very tiny font probably two point font is virtually unreadable because it's in
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:57.120]  white print on a clear transparent bottle it says aspartame so you know it's
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.360]  diet water essentially which is insane but that's what they're putting in just
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.080]  about everything and they've been getting away with it but you know
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.160]  as I said earlier I'm excited to see this increasing trend but you're
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.440]  right we had mentioned that we have many articles on our site every day we have a
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.760]  newsletter that has two articles every day we review hundreds of different
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.960]  articles that are published and we pick the best of the best and we do an
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.600]  expanded commentary on that and we try to present it in simple language if
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.840]  people understand and communicate some you know because these medical studies
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.440]  are really complicated and they use very sophisticated technical jargon that
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.680]  makes essentially incomprehensible so try to provide that and we got we do
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.880]  two articles a day so that's 700 articles a year we've been in our sights
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.800]  been up for 17 years so we've got thousands of studies that we document
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.040]  and we actually link back to the regular literature so someone questions what
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.600]  our conclusions are they can go back to the original study read themselves and
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.960]  make their own sure I mean years ago I'd see the number of five six thousand
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.240]  foods and recently I saw it's estimated it could be over ten thousand but I can't
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.240]  find regular gum that's you know even regular sugar that doesn't have it I
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.680]  can't almost I mean it's in everything now it is insane
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.520]  specifically I've seen the studies on the connection to what is it macular
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.720]  degeneration I mean you're the doctor the medical doctor what's going on with
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.120]  the eyes and aspartame I mean I'm no rocket scientist but everybody knows
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.360]  what alcohol makes you go blind yes there's no question I haven't seen any
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.280]  of the studies that that show a link between it but would make sense because
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.520]  you're right it's it's what I'll cause methanol and it's at 10% of the the
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.080]  product is converted to methanol and it does readily bypass the blood brain
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.680]  barrier so it gets into the brain and of course the retina is part of the brain
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.960]  so it wouldn't be surprising to see an increase in the risk of age-related
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.840]  macular degeneration which is the number one cause of blindness in the
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.080]  United States and certainly in large doses it could cause it acutely but it
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.200]  could contribute to it have taken over a long period of time well I've got a lot
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.480]  of family you name it people that work here that know all this and and you know
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.960]  hide it in their desk they're allowed to have it I mean I'm a libertarian and
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.840]  they and they know it's bad but they say listen I go into incredible withdrawals
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.760]  I know people that have been alcoholics and they say I've got to have my diet
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.800]  cooked or I have worse worse withdrawal than I had you know when I got off
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.440]  drinking these are people that have been you know who are in AA and are admitted
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.160]  alcoholics some of my know not here at the office but outside work I mean this
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.600]  is incredible I've had family that that didn't you know even drink or use drugs
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.240]  who had to basically stay in bed for several weeks a few years ago whenever
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.120]  they went off of this and we're just a wreck who was you know drinking a six
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.080]  pack of diet coke a day well dr. Mercola what's happening here with the
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.800]  addictiveness of this well certainly there's an addiction to sweets that's
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.800]  one component but there's these drinks these sweeteners are typically put in
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.800]  sodas which are loaded with caffeine which is certainly responsible for many
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.320]  of the withdrawal symptoms so you know I've seen 20 to 30,000 patients in my
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.520]  medical career so I've got a lot of feedback and from patients trying these
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.840]  approaches and one of the most useful ones in my experience is to have people
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:19.120]  because I've seen people taking two to a dozen or even two dozen cans of soda a
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.240]  day but the average person again is drinking 56 gallons of soda a year so
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.720]  the best way to start this is to go off slowly and probably if they you know the
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.480]  simple one the initial strategy is to switch from diet soda to regular soda
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.200]  because that's far safer now they're both pernicious what about stevia
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.640]  stevia is even better and there are some newer ones on the on the market now I
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.760]  forget their names but they are flavored with stevia that would be even better but
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.520]  you want to make sure if you're having withdrawal symptoms that you have some
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.320]  caffeine because you gradually have to go off of the caffeine depending on your
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.440]  dose initially it may be a few days to a few weeks to avoid the withdrawal
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.400]  symptoms which are got it got it so a lot of the withdrawals the caffeine
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.120]  combined with that so so only go off one drug at a time isn't that the big
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.120]  secret to the last hundred years of food as it went from being out of the
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.000]  farmyard out of the laboratories you had big farm with all this extra petro
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.880]  chemical stuff they wanted to be able to put this in products they knew it was
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.800]  toxic they knew it was addictive and now we're just waking up to something that's
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.120]  been going on for a very long time well as this is nothing new as you mentioned
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.880]  aspartin was approved in 81 but there's been a gradual pernicious shift of the
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:36.120]  whole connection between the food industry the drug industry and the
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:41.840]  government to serve a collusion by these big mullet chicken and all the
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.680]  other weird additives that are grandfathered in I mean how do they put
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:53.120]  a silicone derivative you know into the fluffing agent in chicken McNuggets I
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.560]  mean how do they get away with stuff like that well many of you know with
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:03.080]  these large corporations have lobbied very effectively to pass laws usually and
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.440]  you're familiar with this they typically pass them as amendments or to
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.560]  existing legislation or what appears to be a good piece of legislation and they
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.520]  just get their protection that way so they're easily slept in and they they
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.280]  manipulate the whole system to their gender so that's like vaccine makers

[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.560]  over a hundred percent a year exponentially but I see that with a lot
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.920]  of other people talking about corruption talking about health freedom talking
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.840]  about political awakening speaking out against NSA illegal spying our government
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.680]  openly funding al-Qaeda and Libya and Syria there is the great awakening
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.960]  happening the question is is it happening quick enough we're gonna go back to
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.200]  Dr. Joseph Mercola here in a minute probably the leading health advocate on
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.800]  a planetary scale there's a lot of other great people out there as well but
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:28.880]  he's definitely the number one thorn in their side he does it was such a
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.960]  credible way you know I'm I do a lot of credible reporting have great
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:37.160]  reporters as well but I also tend to rabble rouse get upset and so I wake
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.960]  up different people as well I mean it's just all of us taking action are gonna
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.160]  bring down this system so if you're a listener out there and you don't like
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.880]  the tyranny that's happening but don't think you're the best spoken person or
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.320]  don't have all the answers doesn't matter pick your issues get involved and
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.520]  that will frustrate the corrupt forces out there all that evil men and
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.360]  tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing so we're gonna
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.640]  go back to Dr. Mercola and get into some of the other big health news that's
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.680]  front and center on his radar and then we're gonna go to some of your some of
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.040]  your phone calls I'm gonna talk about some of the GMO news that's taking place
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.280]  Europe some of the big companies are abandoning GMO pushes over there but
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:19.840]  not here America is like the dumping ground for these companies to get away
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.280]  with anything I want to talk to Dr. Mercola about that but briefly I'm gonna
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.480]  say about some of the amazing sponsors that make this broadcast possible

[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:59.160]  number one thing I think you can do past getting off soda like Dr. McCulloch has
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.400]  said is filter your water and I've done the research we carry the best gravity
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.080]  fed filters out there the Pro Pure discounted with promo code water at
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.640]  infowarstore.com and your purchase there also supports the broadcast but we
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.600]  have a lot of other great filtration systems that I think are excellent as
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  well in different price ranges but the Pro Pure and its whole family and the
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.480]  Pro One systems are simply amazing that's what I use what my family uses
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.080]  what I use in my RV when I'm on the road again that is infowarstore.com or
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.560]  infowarshop.com or call 888-253-3139 I want to thank all of you that are
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.280]  supporters of the broadcast we shouldn't do it without you okay Dr. McCulloch I
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.720]  want to go to phone calls here so people can bring up some questions they have for
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.720]  you one of the leading experts out there as a medical doctor that does the
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.680]  research and exposes this but first off what are some other big things that are
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:57.880]  front and center outside of Coke who helped get aspartame launched in 1981
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.440]  them coming out and saying hey this isn't bad for you it's like the cigarette
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.080]  company saying cigarettes aren't bad for you what else is really big and really
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:12.080]  hot right now on your radar well one of our biggest projects of course is the
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:17.480]  health liberty which is lines with your mission to and in an arena we're really
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:22.280]  focused on labeling genetically modified foods and you know I was one of the
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:26.040]  leading supporters or financial contributors for the campaign in
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:34.040]  California and last November prop 37 and we lost only a few percent but the
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.040]  reality is I think that we lost even though we lost the battle I think we
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.840]  won the war we that all the activity and thank you for your support in that
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:47.400]  process Alex because there was so much media that that around that we actually
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.360]  gained tens of millions of dollars of media exposure which which awakened
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.000]  people to this issue and we that awakening really catalyzed an interest
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.720]  and we are going to defeat them on this and that the current one the next big
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.280]  vote on this will be in Washington in November of this year which that will
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:15.480]  from everything we know at this point is every strong probability of winning so
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.800]  it's very exciting to see that we're making progress in this area and really
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.320]  starting the beginning of the end of the control of the seeds that Monsanto has
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.920]  over the world. I saw an article one of our writers did on
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.280]  prisonplanet.com today it's not on info wars for some reason that's why it's
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.800]  important to visit both sites folks because some news is different on each
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:42.120]  side it's not just a mirror where in Europe they are announcing was I think
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:46.080]  was four big companies big food companies from the US were announcing
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.560]  they're going to drop pushing GMO over there but are going to still going to
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.680]  target us with it I mean it seems like we are having victories across the board
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:59.760]  the problem is they don't stop at least here why are we so captured in the
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:07.120]  United States well it's largely because of the the economy here we have there's
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:11.480]  such large collusion between these industries and the government I mean
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.280]  there's a if you look at we've done grass before our site you could just type
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.560]  it in on our website to find the specifics but there's large numbers of
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.320]  individuals who have either previously worked for Monsanto or even currently
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:28.600]  employed for them that have this revolving door where they go directly
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.400]  from Monsanto into the government and head of large federal regulatory
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.160]  agencies like Michael Taylor and who is holds a big role in the regulatory
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.200]  process in the USDA and and essentially they control that whole federal system
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:50.960]  that prevents the process from really being done effectively but you know we
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.920]  we've we have direct democracy still in this country which is phenomenal and
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.040]  there's some work around for this and we can educate people and and we can we can
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.440]  let them know since you get to the point where if it's labeled then we'll get to
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.440]  the position that they have in Europe because Europe never passed any laws
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.520]  against GMOs they're not banned or forbidden there essentially they are
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.880]  required to be labeled and because most people refuse to to purchase
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.920]  genetically modified foods that's that that's going to be sufficient to
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.760]  essentially ban them because there's not a market for them and and people vote
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.600]  with their pocket books and we're seeing that here there's been an enormous
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.520]  increase we've been in discussions with some of the major executives of Whole
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.720]  Foods and they noticed as a result of November campaign a doubling to tripling
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.200]  of the purchase of organic foods so that motivated them to be to take an even
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.000]  more aggressive role in this and you know we're very excited and happy to be
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.200]  working with Whole Foods to to have this and they actually committed to banning
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.680]  any selling any GMOs within the next five years and the reason that takes took
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.520]  so long to do that is because the when you sell meats it's there's you have to
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:59.880]  go all the way through the supply chain so it takes years to essentially get that
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.760]  to the point where they're having to feed and everything could be certified so
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.520]  many of their foods will be done before that but it's very exciting to see see
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:12.240]  large one of the largest food distributors in the United States of Whole
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.880]  Foods on processed foods would be Whole Foods and we're glad to have them on
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.720]  board that will be working with them. It's amazing I mean it gives me hope that
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.280]  because the facts in the end they say a lie goes around halfway around the world
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:34.720]  before a truth puts its shoes on and walks out the front door but over time
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:43.000]  though the truth will defeat the lies but what do you expect the establishment
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.800]  to do to counteract what InfoWars.com is doing what Mercola.com is
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.240]  doing what NaturalNews.com and just the hundreds of other great sites that are
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.480]  out there and organizations what are they going to do as exponentially we
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.120]  become more popular and trusted they become more and more unpopular all the
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.080]  statistics the numbers show this mainstream media is dying or dead
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.480]  alternative media is exploding all we do is go to the real studies that are
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:16.080]  already out there in point amount I mean how how do you expect this this this
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:21.440]  these final battles to play out and how do you expect them to strike back well
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.600]  we don't have to expect all I have to do is observe you know in my case
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.760]  specifically I've been targeted by the FDA the FTC the Better Business Bureau
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.000]  the and the state relico board so if all come after me as a result of
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.280]  opposition that an exposure that I've been been promoting for these companies
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.240]  and these are very large multinational corporations tens of billions of dollars
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.680]  and assets at a minimum for most of them and you know they're not going to go
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:52.640]  down easily so you know they're gonna I've actually got power points of some
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:58.720]  of the biotechnology conferences where you know I've got a like almost an arrow
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.880]  on my back or a bulls on my back along with along with about a half a dozen
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:08.720]  others who they're targeting us specifically and and then on a general
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.520]  process there are clearly going to fight back in the courts there they they are
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:17.400]  when we succeed in getting these lost past they are going to appeal them to
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:25.200]  the to the appropriate appeal appeal judiciary agencies and that you know so
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.720]  we're anticipating that we've you know we we have long-term plans in place to
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.760]  counteract that so you know they're gonna they're gonna try every trick in
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.360]  the book so it's no question about by the way you don't whine about this but
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.080]  but people need to understand that when we have champions of truth like Dr.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.560]  Mercola that through his network gave millions of dollars to the campaign that
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.080]  I believe there was election fraud involved in but just that fight educated
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:55.440]  people in the outrage if I don't get to know if it's a GMO I don't get to know
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.480]  if it's not organic you don't want me to know milk doesn't have hormones in it
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.720]  that are artificial so my daughter's nine feet tall or whatever it makes
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.800]  sarcastic or girls want a puberty at seven or my boy you know never matures I
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.320]  mean you don't want me to know I mean at a fundamental level the injustice like
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.680]  telling Rosa Parks you couldn't sit at the front of the bus is so palpable but
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.800]  folks have to understand Mercola is at the tip of the spear in this avenue like
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.120]  I'm at the tip of the spear on the NSA and the police state and a lot of other
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.720]  issues you can't just say oh you know we're glad you're out there folks we
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:34.760]  need your support this is not a game I mean we're taking on the biggest juggernauts
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.200]  in the world the good news is 15 years ago if you said a you know they made
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.680]  Agent Orange hurt people they'd sue you even though that was on record Monsanto
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.760]  did it they would do it as a slap suit now there's so many people fighting them
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.720]  and others that they can't get us all and here's the answer all of us have to
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.640]  stand up all of us have to speak out all of us have to get aggressive but
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.160]  realize that tactics beating them but they'll still try to cut off the biggest
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.720]  head of the Hydra of Liberty like Dr. Mercola so support Dr. Mercola and he
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.160]  didn't know I do this today but I mean we got to hang together hang separate
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.760]  folks this is this is a big deal here yeah I couldn't agree more Alex and I
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:15.800]  realized that many years ago that we have to work collectively and that was
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.960]  the beautiful thing about the GMO project is that it really brought all
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.920]  these despair groups people were on the left people on the right people in the
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.800]  center fighting for the same cause and that was one of the reasons why we're
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:30.000]  so successful because it really it really caused people to bind together
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.600]  and I think I couldn't agree with you more I think that's really part of the
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.320]  solution and that's why they want to divide and conquer us on all these
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.600]  football issues about oh you should be able to pick what bathroom you want to
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.800]  go in and you and men should be able to play on women's sports teams and then
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:48.640]  and and all this it's all these fake rights which which which are a

[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.280]  calls here with dr. McCullough to take your your questions they're all over the
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:16.840]  map Sean and Canada is calling in he has a question on aspartame go ahead go ahead
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.640]  Sean you're on the air with dr. Joseph McCullough thank you very much Alex
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.120]  said hello dr. McCullough thanks much for your work I wanted to ask you I have
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.680]  some I've quite a few friends and acquaintances who consider themselves the
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.360]  you know learned types educated and I want to ask you your opinion what in
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.280]  your opinion is the most alarming and well proven side effect of aspartame in
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:45.360]  a diet and and further how has the industry countered the earlier studies
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.760]  that took um aspartame in its derivatives off the market decades ago
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.920]  earlier studies with like recess monkeys that showed grand mal seizures and
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.720]  brain lesions how is that kind of faded into the background where these days if
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.800]  you look up aspartame the worst you seem to get in terms of critique is talk
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.480]  about increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and weight gain which of
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.760]  course is serious but not nearly as serious as the as the earlier
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.400]  revelations so yeah what is the bombing it killed recess monkeys in their first
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.880]  studies back in the 70s I don't mean to interrupt him it's just funny in their
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.040]  press release in the AP they say and we're going to spell the rumor that it
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.520]  makes you gain weight when it's on record dr. McCullough well thank you for
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.640]  your question Sean I believe the most potent weapon we have with respect to
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.840]  studies is a study that was published in 2012 it was actually a human study that
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.000]  showed that there was an increase but the use of aspartame was an increased
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.600]  link in leukemia non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma in men so and they
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.200]  actually ABC contact to me when this study was published and they didn't
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.760]  understand why there was a difference in men and we knew the answer to that
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.480]  because there is an enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which actually breaks down
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:08.600]  the methanol and that's more active in women that is in men so that was
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:13.280]  responsible for the increase but part of the your other and let's see there was
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.520]  part of the other question was some of the other reasons well if you look at
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.120]  the bulk of the evidence most of these studies that are published you have to
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.320]  look at who funds the studies most of the almost every time you're going to
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:35.200]  find a conclusion that is favorable to the aspartame industry it is public it
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:39.520]  is funded by the makers and the manufacturers and if you look at the
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:46.320]  ones that are objective and there's there's no industry support to it they
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.840]  will find over 90 90% of those studies are finding sure I've looked at the
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.200]  Searle studies before Monsanto bottom and you know all these other companies
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.160]  since it's been it's a patent's gone up and it's it's been an open for
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.320]  everybody and and I remember they took the dead monkeys out of the study and
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.680]  then used the living monkeys to say it was safe I mean they just play
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.120]  incredible games because they have their people in all the regulatory positions
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.080]  yeah and just get back to that human study that was done to show the increased
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.440]  risk of cancer that study was a long-term study was actually done over 22
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.160]  years and it was led by a physician who was on the Department of Medicine of
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:28.680]  Brigham and women's Harvard Medical School so it was not an insignificant
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:33.200]  study and that's that's you know that's what's wrong with the leukemia I mean
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:37.720]  it only kills you but it does cause a lot of other problems of autoimmune
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.680]  disease and many people have developed for multiple sclerosis well what about
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.840]  anecdotal everybody I know that gets off of it has a whole bunch of illnesses go
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.920]  away I mean it's it's not been able to sleep skin problems eye problems

[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.800]  few final calls let's talk to Julie in California quick comment or question for
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:30.680]  Dr. Mercola. Hi doctor my dad was diagnosed back in the early 90s with
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.480]  macular degeneration both he and my mom were very very big drinkers of coke of
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:42.040]  diet coke and in 2003 my mom was diagnosed with a very rare form of
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.600]  renal cancer in fact the University of Pennsylvania oncologist that she was
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:52.760]  going to didn't even know a kind of renal cancer it was my father in 2003 was
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.320]  also diagnosed with colon cancer I lost them both within eight months of one
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.200]  another and I'd like to know in your opinion would you think that aspartame
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.920]  could have been contributing cause of that thank you man sorry for your loss
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:10.160]  it's thank you for your question I am certain it didn't help it's hard to say
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.840]  definitively without reviewing more details what the specifics were but
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.440]  most likely was a contributing factor would be my guess but it does bring up
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.840]  a good point for those who do have you know me your parents have passed away
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:26.480]  unfortunately but for those who are still alive and have these problems there
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.720]  are two simple measures that you can do for these for the macular degeneration
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.280]  there is a supplement a very potent antioxidant called astaxanthin
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.680]  astaxanthin it's a derivative of algae is the most potent antioxidant we know of
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.240]  and there's some studies that show really clearly a benefit a huge benefit in
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:48.840]  the treatment and prevention of macular degeneration with respect to the
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.520]  treatment of cancer there are some simply profoundly powerful strategies you
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.000]  can do with your diet and I've interviewed a Harvard researcher and
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.280]  someone from the University of Florida Medical School and both of those
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.360]  interviews on my site is called the ketogenic diet where essentially you
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:13.520]  limit your foods to high amounts of high-quality fats not vegetable oils that
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.600]  are high high no makings that's on record is increased longevity what I've
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.000]  seen it in rats it doubles their lifespan stuff it's just amazing but
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.600]  especially if you have cancer and cancers is affecting firstly one of two
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.440]  people on the planet at least in the United States rather so it's if you
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:33.480]  don't have it someone you know is going to have it this is amazing with any other
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.480]  treatment you want to use so amazing let's let's jam in one more here well
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:41.440]  I'll tell you we got to move quick Richard in Washington you're on the air go
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:47.120]  ahead yeah thank you very much Alex yeah quick question thank you only about a
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:53.680]  minute the doctor said we're no longer high in insulin and I no longer have
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:59.160]  diabetes do I have diabetes still for the rest of my life doctor yes just like
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:03.400]  me I have diabetes to all my relatives that so the best you can hope to do
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.160]  is control it which is great because the treatment for diabetes is actually the
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.880]  best treatment for the reversal of almost every is that we know so yes stay
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.360]  away from the sugar a lot lots of high-quality fat and that's the best
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:20.080]  way to do it all right hope that answers your questions appreciate your call sir

[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:02.640]  ordinance would criminalize displaying toy guns in a threatening manner criminal
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:07.920]  to have kids run around with toy guns they bang bang this is so incredible you
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.880]  know rodeo clowns that make fun of Obama here comes a secret service I mean it is
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:18.000]  just a bunch of authoritarians and now Nemo just walked in during the break with
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.960]  a new American article says Snowden says NSA targeting journalist critical of
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.120]  government of course that's all come out and now Snowden's pointing out that it
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.840]  was really bad who do you think the criminal establishment is going to
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:34.600]  target of course they're going to use spying data to try to stop the press from
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.000]  breaking stories of corruption of course they're going to use it to submit the
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.640]  criminal takeover of course they're going to use it to harass the media of
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.640]  course what do you why do you think every authoritarian regime does this and
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.280]  why it's so bad and then I see some of the idiot public we've talked to an
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  Austin oh it makes me feel safe oh you feel safe huh you feel safe and every
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:02.880]  authoritarian regime you idiot the big banks get away it's in the news every
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:07.160]  day now oh documents released they took trillions in homes they didn't own they
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:12.840]  were paid for totally yeah they're like judge houses paid for I'm sorry they
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.240]  say they've got a deed I don't even need to look at it
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:22.200]  wills Fargo Bank of America the house is yours and if you don't like it we got
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:27.040]  armed troops outside they're called paramilitary police the house is ours
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:30.880]  lady and your pension funds are there's two cops they're already got getting
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.720]  ready them they've already started taking all the police's pension funds but
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:36.800]  a lot of you cops don't care as long as you can shove around some little people
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.160]  that's what you're really looking for in life drink some diet coke take some
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.880]  vaccines government loves you live forever sweetie let's talk to John in
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:49.240]  Texas sorry to have time to talk to Mercola he had to go but what's your
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.720]  point about bio photons will that be like jellyfish that glow in the dark or
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.840]  glow worms or a lightning bugs what's going on I sure it's the coldest so long
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.800]  because he's written a lot of articles on bio photons and perhaps I should take
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.240]  that point for later we can talk about I want to hear about bio photons sorry
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.880]  didn't get to you but tell me about bio photons I want to know if Dr. McCullough
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.240]  agreed with Dr. Gabriel Cousins when I interviewed Dr. Cousins about 10 years
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:23.280]  ago he wrote an article on economic globalism and Dr. Cousins also studies
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.560]  the research of Dr. Fritz Hopper pop just like Dr. McCullough and I asked Dr.
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.840]  Cousins if he thought that if everyone had an adequate bio photon level that we
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.240]  could defeat the globalist and he said yes we did he did and the quote that I
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.280]  wanted to share before you you comment on my my comment is a quote by Lenin
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:48.520]  which I think you're gonna love he said socialized medicine is the keystone to
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:53.520]  the arc of the social estate and basically what that means is that every
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.400]  thing in our society of any significance centers around the fact that we're sick
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.000]  as a species and what the sickness we have is we don't have enough by photons
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.520]  that's why we're suffering as a species and Dr. McCullough could have
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.920]  expounded on this because he's written many articles on this okay I'll explain
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.080]  to me about bio photons the electrochemical interactions of the
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:16.240]  human body what what what me specifically give me some details it's
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.400]  our body sense bio photons all you have the phallide energy that all living
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.320]  systems store in the nucleus of their cells and then every cell uses those that
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.840]  coherence all I energy to communicate to everything else it's our spidey sense
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:33.400]  and we're destroying our spidey sense by doing certain things well I know this
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:37.760]  everything the globalists are doing is to suppress the human mind and the
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:43.720]  emission of bio photons is technically a type of bioluminescence but the later
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:47.520]  term is generally reserved for higher luminescence but I guess you're saying
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.600]  that we have this going on at another level but are quantifying in a sixth
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.760]  sense I don't know I should have brought up bio photons and I would want to hear
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:59.760]  medical doctors take on that stay with us

[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:42.040]  Egyptian security forces today moved to oust pro moracy supporters from to sit

[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.200]  scores dead at hundreds injured in Cairo the Egyptian president has announced
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:57.400]  a month-long state of emergency well folks since 1933 we've been under a
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:00.560]  state of emergency that's been a little bit softer that they've used to erode
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.640]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution the War Powers Act signed by Franklin
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:09.400]  Delano Roosevelt after a few years of the great depression the great foreign
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:14.520]  banking takeover but but more and more that's how they say the NSA spies on
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.320]  us in violation of the Fourth Amendment is is oh well it's an emergency or a
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.760]  spy on the press and persecute the press well it's an emergency and now it's
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:29.720]  coming out in the news Snowden saying what's already known that fish women see
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:34.000]  that the Sun comes up in the morning in the east and sets in the west that the
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.560]  Easter Bunny isn't real that oh my goodness that it's already been confirmed
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.200]  for stone even came out that they're targeting the press and people critical
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:47.920]  of government policies with the NSA who would have thought that that's
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.600]  authoritarianism that's tyranny that's terrible you mean they're gonna
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:59.000]  illegally spy and then use it to keep corrupt systems in power no you mean
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.800]  they're gonna use that data for globalist corporations that control the
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.640]  government to shut down their competition no you mean the mainstream
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.280]  media is gonna use it to be able to get key intel and spin the news and shut
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:18.200]  down alternative media no every government that acts like this when it
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.960]  ends in just millions dead black uniforms surveillance people being
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.000]  disappeared the middle of the night we know where this goes we know how this
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.240]  movie ends how the book ends is not a good thing they say each generation has
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.960]  to go through its own crisis but then they have these these these generations
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.480]  every three or four that go through hell and folks we're lined up for that
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:43.520]  right now and I suggest that we we get off the bus get off the train they can
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:48.000]  drop us off right here you drop us off back in America not not in the middle of
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.200]  an Orwellian technocracy that's out of control and they're just bombarding us
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:58.240]  and there's all these studies Harvard studies about yes aspartame gives you
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:02.680]  leukemia aspartame makes you go blind with macular degeneration aspartame
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.840]  killed the monkeys in the test aspartame's highly addictive and then
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.720]  coke's coming out going it doesn't make you fat in matter of his all the studies
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:12.800]  oh it didn't matter it's it's safe we say so just like every year before the
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:19.200]  school starts they come out and say ladies and gentlemen it is the law to
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.560]  take shots and there's no side effects I mean I read those news articles every
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.120]  year going don't listen to the kooks that say it can make you go blind or get
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:32.000]  narcolepsy or have convulsions or there are no side effects other than it hurt
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.240]  in your arm when the needle goes in that's a quote I was at the Fort Worth
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:39.720]  Star Telegram I think I ran with that I mean I could just I mean I read that on
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:43.080]  air last year like 10 times because it was like there is you just read the
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:48.280]  insert it says might kill you might make you go blind might make you have an
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:53.840]  autoimmune disorder it's you can go to the CDC and read on every vaccine the
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:58.280]  hundreds of things it can do to you hey what's wrong about dying what's wrong
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:03.480]  about getting cancer their answer is hey kooks shut up weirdo there's no
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:09.120]  problem with vaccines it's a why they discredited the medical doctor that for
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:12.640]  minglin that exposed it then you go read and none of that was even true it was
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:16.120]  all the big hoax why they might come out tomorrow and go we've discredited at the
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.920]  Sun it controls climate on the earth oh I'm sorry the UN four years ago had a
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:26.040]  vote to say the Sun doesn't affect climate I forgot they already did that
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.960]  I mean maybe they can have a vote and suspend gravity here on terra firma this
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:37.920]  is the type of total assault on reality that's going on and many people are just
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.000]  going I know it's corrupt there's nothing we can do but still others are
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.840]  saying oh no it's it's not that bad it's for own good but many others are
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:51.400]  punching out of the system and as the old kleptocratic dinosaur
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:58.640]  prostitute parrot media the parrot press as they in every metric you've seen the
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:03.200]  news just you know but almost a lower approval rating than Congress with 10
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:07.000]  percent I mean they're burning down and their answer is we'll have state runs
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:12.840]  CIA Pentagon direct psyops in your town paying off local bloggers or shutting
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.680]  them down that's all being announced so get this through your head folks if
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:22.400]  you're a new listener that's been announced it's been announced that
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.920]  they're coming after everybody now that doesn't scare me that means they're
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.640]  having to take the gloves off come right out in the open and in the New
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:32.960]  World Order couldn't hold Afghanistan to get the opium out against you know a
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.720]  few hundred thousand fighters over there if we just physically speak out against
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:40.640]  it physically non-violently put our weight against it it's over for this
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.960]  system and the best we can hope for is like the USSR that the New World Order
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.960]  that runs America collapses and they plan on collapsing us anyway into a
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.600]  21 and then using that collapse as a way to reengineer society with imposing as
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:57.920]  the savior no they need to collapse we need to reinstate the Bill of Rights
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:02.360]  and Constitution and we need to start arresting one way or another just put
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.000]  that idea out because it will then manifest politically if people get it
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:10.840]  no no this is criminal they admit fake terror alerts now we told you that last
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:14.400]  week now they're admitted to be fake everything we've told you coming through
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:16.520]  you know I mentioned this all the time that we're going to our guests for the
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.720]  balance of the hour about the articles all the time were thousands of foster
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.520]  kids are missing in Florida many of the small children they end up in Saudi
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:30.560]  Arabia and Thailand and stuff flown out by the big aircraft owned by the banks
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:34.440]  the same ones that ship the drugs around and I saw this again today missing
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:39.800]  78 children from Oklahoma Department of Human Services custody I mean they're
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.640]  seven times more likely just department numbers to abuse kids in their custody
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:47.000]  than anybody else that is government but we we need to take kids for no reason
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.640]  and give them to them it's amazing so that's the type of stuff that's going on
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:57.560]  the types of things that are happening the incredible Orwellian attack on free
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:01.560]  speech we have an article on info wars.com 19 shocking examples of a
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:06.400]  political correctness is destroying America but now we go to a real
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:11.480]  journalist Swan has won both the Edward R. Murrow Award and the Lone Star Emmy
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:15.360]  Awards he is specialized in covering the 2012 GOP presidential primaries he's
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.640]  gotten a lot of hard questions into Obama and others that became

[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.400]  a master's in humanities from California State University and he's had the
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.480]  hit show reality check there with Fox and then of course he got out of that on
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:33.920]  his own accord because they wanted to control what he was saying and doing
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:39.640]  Ben Swan.com you can find all of that stuff at Twitter too at Ben Swan and

[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.240]  our power plants I'm competing with the people trying to put deadly vaccines in
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:03.560]  kids I'm competing with the mega banks getting 85 billion dollars a month of our
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:08.680]  money to destroy our economy I'm competing with the collectivist and the
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.760]  crony capitalists that control them and thank God there's a Ben Swan or a Matt
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:19.440]  Drudge or Ron Paul or Ted Cruz thank God there's a Kurt Nemo or a Paul Watson

[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:30.280]  there's a Jacari Jackson thank God we need more real alternative grassroots
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:33.920]  media that does it professionally not less Ben Swan we're going to break in a
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:37.360]  minute thank you for coming on with us but there's so much to talk about front
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.160]  and center what do you make of the state of the media wars and our whole
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.880]  society and how everything you and I have talked about is now almost becoming
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.640]  passé it's just like the floodgates have opened on all the corruption well I
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:52.760]  think you have to take a lot of credit for how much of that corruption is
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.840]  coming to the surface look at the end of the day alternative media you're naming
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:00.480]  these names right now but alternative media is the driving force and exposing
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:04.040]  all of this and Alex you're at the front of that certainly you have to look at
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:08.480]  info wars and say look at the impact that info wars has had on the mainstream
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:12.720]  news cycle I mean you guys have forced the mainstream to talk about issues that
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.280]  they were never going to talk about a good example of that is the ammo stock
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.480]  piling by DHS that was a story that was never going to break you guys broke it
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.800]  a year before it was ever mainstream and and continue to hammer on it and hammer
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:27.720]  on it and finally it comes out you know that oh yeah well in fact this is
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:31.720]  happening and fox starts talking about it cbs starts talking about it and then
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:34.960]  it kind of grows from there so I think what we've seen is a paradigm shift now
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:39.200]  where alternative media is actually driving the investigative reporting and
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:43.760]  driving the conversation and mainstream just trying to catch up and by the way
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:49.080]  we're not blowing smoke here or power trips actually great responsibility for
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.720]  all the alternative real media the new media the independent media everything
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.240]  we cover two or three days later is mainstream news and a lot of times
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:00.760]  they're even forced to go with our quote angle we try to go with the truth
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:05.200]  and thanks to drudgereport.com like the nitrous oxide has really helped launch
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:08.760]  us we do not have enough thanks to you know to them but I've talked to their
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.920]  folks they're like well you cover really important news is real stuff so we carry
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:15.200]  it we just carry whatever we think is really important and people need to know
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.560]  and I think the self-preservation instinct ban is starting to kick in
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.560]  that's why you're seeing such a rebellion against tyranny oh I agree and I
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.840]  think for the most part a lot of the mainstream apparatus doesn't understand
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:29.920]  what you're doing they don't understand info wars they don't understand the
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:32.840]  stories you cover and so it's such a foreign concept it's like well what is
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.680]  he talking about and then it's like but we've got to talk about it because people
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:40.800]  are listening absolutely now I'm gonna try to shut up when we come back and
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:44.480]  just go through whatever you think's most important in the news for a segment
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:48.320]  then Ben I want to get into a bunch of stories out there and get your take on
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:51.960]  them and also talk about the new media operation you're launching and how folks

[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.520]  4 to 6 central I'm your host Alex Jones look at this story up on infowars.com
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:18.960]  Julie Wilson wrote about it it is a national news story right now teenager
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:24.120]  denied heart transplant over history of non-compliance added to wait list low
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.920]  grades in school and brushes with the law initially kept teenager off heart
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:32.480]  transplant list don't you love it when the bioethicist decide you know what
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:36.920]  you've done in your life show what you get I mean they want to run our lives
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:41.280]  bottom line ladies and gentlemen going back to reporter Ben Swan who left his
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:46.400]  very popular Fox gig because he wanted I guess it's been undisclosed but wanted
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:50.160]  to not be controlled I think you said it was they wanted you to cover local
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.280]  stuff and not national even though national is local but now you're doing
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:58.120]  your own media thing we're gonna get to that in the next segment but out of all
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:02.200]  the stuff going on out there what do you think is most important in the news
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:07.600]  right now the NSA the persecution of the press with the IRS I mean how much is
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:11.760]  it gonna take till this changes what else is front and center for you or I'm
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.000]  just guessing is it those topics well I think those topics are important I think
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.080]  they all kind of had the same root issue to them so when we talk about the NSA
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.360]  when we talk about the IRS and what's going on there the fact that you know
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:28.160]  we just reported this past week that with the IRS the woman in charge of all
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.920]  these agents who were targeting conservative groups was promoted and
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:36.400]  and again you know we we work to break down that left-right paradigm you've
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:40.640]  got Republican members of Congress who are not holding that particular person
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:43.760]  accountable she was the person overseeing the entire office in Cincinnati
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:47.040]  she's not been held accountable you have on the left they're not holding anyone
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:50.720]  accountable and so it's all political games and and no one's actually working
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.000]  to resolve any of these issues the NSA things obviously very important I think
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.400]  what we're seeing out of that though that is especially important is the fact
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.920]  that right now despite all the claims about Edward Snowden being a traitor
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.400]  to the country and the claims that are made that he somehow betrayed the nation
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:12.160]  we are now seeing the effect of what he did by revealing this information to the
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:17.280]  American public the change in terms of of the public demanding that action be
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.080]  taken hopefully the American public won't back down or slow down on that and
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:24.680]  again I think you've got it you've got a credit alternative media with pushing
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:27.520]  that that narrative forward because mainstream media didn't want to talk
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.800]  about this other than to talk about the Snowden issue himself and how bad he
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.680]  was and to question him personally and his motivations it's alternative media
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:42.400]  that has really been at the forefront of saying wait a minute Snowden may be in
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.240]  your opinion a traitor but the fact is he's a whistleblower under law and this
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.480]  is what the NSA is doing that's all alternative media that did not come from
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.760]  the networks let me go back to that question that you get a chance to answer
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.200]  one to break how do you see it playing out right now as the establishment
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:04.320]  implodes their answer is just a power grab what does your gut tell you is it's
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:09.120]  going to be like saying five years well a lot of that I think depends on how
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:13.800]  Americans respond to the claims that are going to be made over internet piracy
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.600]  bills and intellectual property bills and so if we get bills like SISBA being
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.800]  pushed through and SOPA and PIPA the design behind those bills as your
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:26.680]  listeners know it has nothing to do with intellectual property at all it has
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.520]  everything to do with eliminating competition because major corporate
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.720]  media want to be able to say well look if we can accuse bloggers and writers and
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:41.480]  smaller news entities of copyright infringement we can shut down their
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:44.520]  sites and that's the goal the goal is to say we've got to eliminate competition
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:48.560]  they already do that I had them declare they own my voice with it would be made
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.120]  up till I threaten to sue people and delete hundreds of videos I mean they're
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:55.360]  doing and they do this to little people especially because they can't fight back
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.360]  that's right we're releasing a piece for our first full disclosure that we we've
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:04.520]  put out since we started this project it'll be released next Monday but the
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:10.240]  piece is about the fact that the NSA in fact is using copyright law or claims I
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:15.120]  should say copyright claims to actually shut down t-shirt makers who are making
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.760]  fun of the NSA and then they're squashing that freedom of speech claiming
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.560]  copyrighted well so this hasn't broke yet man that's amazing no it hasn't
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:26.400]  there will be the first ones to break it we're putting this out for people to
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.680]  hear and it's it is it's an amazing story when you get into what the NSA is
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.360]  claiming and this is why it's so important Alex as you know it's not an
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.520]  issue of whether or not law is on the side of those making these claims they
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.520]  simply make the claims and then use muscle to force their way to control
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.920]  that's right like they claim you're a murderer so you go to jail no trial and
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:50.760]  they said at the UN and at Davos they as you've said here I think some of the
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:53.960]  audits may not understand this so we should probably spell it out they're
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:58.040]  going to use fake claims to shut down all the free web and here's the NSA and
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:02.520]  cyber security with what you're saying already trying it in fact I've heard
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:05.880]  Homeland Security threaten people and they tried to get a law pass two years
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.680]  ago where you can't even show their symbol in a parody so they are attacking
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:15.280]  our speech and that by the way that the parody issue is one that's very clear
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:22.800]  under law parodies are a form of fair use and yet the NSA DHS they don't have
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:26.440]  to be able to go to court and fight for this and that's the issue if they're
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:30.600]  really gonna fight this it goes to a court and that's where the legal fight
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:33.240]  takes place and that's not what they're doing what they don't know they want laws
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.720]  where they can just make a claim and your side's gone forever well look I've
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:41.120]  got articles here where they're saying arrest the guy for the rodeo mask of
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:45.000]  Obama I mean folks these people are coming for our liberty they're

[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.240]  make you aware of other folks that are out there fighting tyranny not not like
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:04.360]  he needs a lot of help from us Ben Swann again incredibly popular TV show
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:08.160]  that was becoming a national phenomenon when the local Fox affiliate said no
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:12.440]  more and and that's how they came to me when I had the number one show in
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:17.600]  Austin on FM in that time slot they said no more politics we'll even pay you
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.040]  more money no more and I said I don't have any passion to talk about
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.440]  relationships and sports I said you're joking and they said no or you're fired
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:31.560]  so it's like a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs like I told the Afghans
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:36.120]  and I said well and I didn't really be awesome but I said I didn't rob O Sierra
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.520]  but I said I'll try tell me specifically but I don't this is popular
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.520]  you're making money I'm not even paid that much I'm telling the truth because
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:48.080]  we were getting national attention him back in 1999 and they fired me so so I've
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.640]  been where Ben Swann is when they come in and say you're gonna cover local stuff
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.360]  and not get on people's nerves you know we're getting all sorts of phone calls
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:59.720]  up here and of course later I learned that the feds had given them a visit and
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:03.280]  stuff and see that's how the intimidation works in America get a federal
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:09.800]  phone call feds visit you know the you know the bosses up and Scranton you
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.160]  know Ohio or whatever it is and then they come down to find out what's going on
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:17.320]  with this guy I mean they didn't like me talking about stuff going on here in
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.240]  Texas and then I already started though a little syndicated show out of my house
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.200]  so when they said you're fired get out of here they had new management get out
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:28.760]  of here you you you you you know you crazy person I just said well I've
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:32.360]  already got a show I'll be alright they said no you don't haha you're done in
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:36.120]  the media that they really were like having a victory and trying to dance on
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:42.840]  my my journalistic and media life and I don't savor a lot of things I don't
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:47.600]  even savor that because it makes me sick for those people of how small they were
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:50.640]  and how they all later got fired never read they're all bunch of joke you know
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:56.760]  failures pretty much now it's sad for them that that people really get in to
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.760]  being worldly failures and they love seeing other people who have pure
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.440]  hearts or pure hearts than they fail and then I know you've been friendly towards
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.800]  Fox when you left but I mean you struck out on your own here and let's talk
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:11.760]  about your media operation then I want to get into some of the other big news
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:14.920]  stories that are out there in the attacks on free press and get back into
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:18.240]  this big breaking story on Monday perhaps you can give us a few tidbits now
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:21.960]  and we'll do a story that points towards it on Monday and you know maybe
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:26.840]  even the the mighty drudge report might pick it up who knows but sounds pretty
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:29.760]  newsworthy to me buddy and of course you've been on drugs on their big sites
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.840]  many times but I'm kind of perseverating here tell us about your media
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:38.920]  operation and how people can find out more about that and help breathe even
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:44.120]  more life into it well one of the things that we decided to do it's called the
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:47.400]  truth in media project and the idea was that we were gonna start creating a
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:50.680]  similar to what we did with reality check create these five six minute long
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.760]  videos that explain to people you know a lot of what's going on the mainstream
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:58.040]  media won't cover now I'll tell you Alex things have changed over the last few
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:01.240]  weeks as we started to build this project out and one of the things that we
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.680]  started to do now is see the need and the value in being able to create some
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.320]  high-end quality video content just to give to alternative media sites and the
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:14.800]  reason for that is because as you know you know one of the games that's being
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:19.960]  played with this whole idea of of the intellectual property rights and these
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.440]  bills that we've been talking about like SISPA is that if you use a clip from
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:26.880]  someone show even though it's fair use if you use a clip out there you use some
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:30.480]  video on your website your site's gonna get shut down that's the idea behind it
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:33.400]  so what we want to do is kind of fill a void there and say you know what let's
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:36.640]  create this content and let's just let's just give it away so all these
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:39.960]  alternative media sites and we've been setting up with a lot of them is to say
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:43.120]  you know what you guys can just have it just don't edit it apart don't cut it
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:46.640]  down don't you know take license and say well we'll run this little piece of the
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:49.640]  things are out of context but it's you know we're gonna give it away for free
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.840]  and that's been kind of the idea over the last few weeks as we've been building
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:56.080]  this up so we're really excited about that you know everything that we have we
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:59.000]  love to give to you guys over at info wars and say if you want to use it great
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  if not you know that's fine too no no we're gonna use it absolutely great
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.080]  plan you know we talked about the software too and I think you're doing
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:11.400]  the right thing I instinctively always said everything I've put out is is
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.160]  copyright you may still retain the copyright so they can't change it or
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:19.160]  alter it or twist it or then say okay now we own it you don't you have to
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:22.800]  retrain something as you're doing but as long as it's not taken out of context
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.400]  and it's for nonprofit educational purposes or even fair use clearly by
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:31.840]  the guidelines that are everybody knows then you can use everything we've done
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.040]  and that has been one reason we've been so successful as well yeah absolutely I
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.880]  think you know I really respect the fact that you're a guy who obviously you
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:44.760]  you've built up a media empire of your own but but I've never seen you
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:48.120]  competitive with other people and I've always seen you working to build up
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:50.880]  other people and that's fantastic and that's what we want to do too we want
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:54.680]  to build up other sites who say listen we're video poor right now we don't have
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:58.080]  the ability to create this stuff we're creating stuff in Chicago we're shooting
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.880]  it it's it's the stuff that we're putting out I mean candidly it's better
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:05.200]  than what a lot of networks are putting out and so we're very excited about the
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.000]  quality of what we're about to put out but then we say look so that how do we
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.200]  use this how is it most beneficial to people will we get it out to the public
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:15.720]  we share it we we give it away for free we place it on streaming sites but we
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:19.640]  don't see it as a hey you know this has been stuff and Ben's got to make his
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:23.080]  stuff so that he can build up his kind of empire over here it's not that at all
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:26.840]  and I know you understand that that philosophy but that's essentially what
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:30.560]  we're trying to do is we're trying to augment where there's a lot of bloggers
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:33.000]  out there there's a lot of writers there's a lot of people putting out good
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.280]  content how do we augment the video side of it where so far it's been kind of a
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:41.880]  struggle especially for smaller sites where video as you know is expensive to
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:45.280]  produce well that's our plan that's why I've hired a bunch of reporters we're
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.440]  almost done with our studio looking at the different satellite uplinks and in
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:51.880]  all of it and we're just gonna put it basically free to air even to the
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.280]  establishment media and they're gonna end up using a lot of what we develop
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:58.160]  we're actually developing reporter contacts and people that just want to
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:02.240]  get their info out who then will upload to us stuff that they've authorized us
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:05.280]  to use will put their side as consideration as well on there and
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:10.040]  that's actually my plan is to not just share our info but to become a nexus
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.280]  point to then magnify what everybody else is doing because that's what I'm
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:19.560]  looking for is that is to destroy the globalist I want my freedom back I want
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.040]  to dig these globalist out of their rat holes who are openly persecuting I mean
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:28.240]  it came out today with Snowden going oh yeah no they target the press to know
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.880]  what the press is gonna do well that's already come out I mean we have them
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.480]  illegally spying on us and to frustrate the press and sitting the IRS after
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:39.160]  pro-life groups saying you can't protest dead children I mean this is a
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:44.480]  authoritarianism right and the answer is is to just have everybody I mean even
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.560]  if you don't have a lot of skills start your own weekly YouTube blog where you
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:53.160]  talk about stuff start a newsletter start a local paper go get a local weekend
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:57.880]  radio show go do an access show everybody has got to do something now
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:02.520]  right well and as as more voices come out you know all of a sudden the stuff
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:06.520]  that right now people would call fringe is no longer fringe it becomes mainstream
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:09.720]  and as we've been talking about mainstream starts chasing that because
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:13.120]  they rise there's a huge audience for it and it's not an audience because you're
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:16.000]  building off sensationalism it's an audience because you're building off
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.520]  truth and when there's a lack or an absence of truth in mainstream people
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:23.880]  are going to find it they're going to seek it out and so we've seen that and
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:27.920]  we see this happening even with you know this latest attempt by the Senate
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.400]  Diane Feinstein trying to redefine you know who is really a journalist and if
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:35.800]  you don't work for a paid organization if you don't work for a corporation then
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:39.280]  suddenly you're no longer a journalist and not protected under shield laws I
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.400]  mean that is something that every American should be aware of because what
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:46.520]  you're essentially saying is we will decide who was a journalist therefore
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:51.720]  who gets protection oh yeah oh yeah I find stein is jump the shark here saying
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:55.760]  you got to be salaried by a corporate entity or you're not a journalist I
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:00.640]  mean that is outrageous it is it's absolutely outrageous and she claims
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:03.200]  you know this is because of the shield loss and we have to be able to define
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:07.480]  who the journalists are well why because the shield law is set up so that when a
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.480]  whistleblower comes to you and says here's what's going on in this
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:14.320]  government agency if you as a journalist are able to talk to them and
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:17.560]  you're able to protect your source she doesn't want you to be able to protect
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.840]  your source but she wants is for you to have to go to the New York Times as a
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:24.800]  whistleblower and say to them hey I have a story I want to tell number one they
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:29.560]  either refuse to tell your story or two they use their sources back at the DoD
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:33.280]  or Homeland Security or whoever and they say to them oh by the way that this
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:37.720]  guy is about to blow the whistle on you guys oh yeah it's on record that it just
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.600]  is all run by the CIA folks I mean Greenwald had to go over to the Guardian
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:45.280]  to get his stuff out and they're infiltrated as well I'm not saying
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:49.040]  Greenwald is but I mean it's on record that when you go to the New York Times
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:53.960]  or CBS or NBC or these guys that they're simply handing it off to the
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:59.600]  government and it's simply amazing that they're doing this but I don't see any
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:03.720]  way they're going to be able to stop us no matter how much cyber because they
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.080]  admit cybersecurity has been built to shut down the free web it's been built to
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:12.400]  end the free press Greenwald came out and said we've been reading over in a
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:18.880]  say documents a few days ago and and it's incredible it's meant to shut down
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:22.320]  the free press and in the internet as we know it and bring in a sanitized
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:26.680]  control one that's what internet who's always been about for 15 years that the
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.840]  group's been meeting with academia the the European and US Defense departments
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.080]  it's the takeover they're not gonna allow us to operate and challenge their
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:41.320]  lies so they're gonna try to shut us down folks this is a war they they
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:46.280]  obsess over drudge report.com that they don't control they obsess over info
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:51.040]  wars.com that they don't control they obsess well the answer is realize
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:55.240]  they're in an offense against us because our offense is winning and intensify our
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:01.120]  war just go completely ape in the info war and to cry it all because everything
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:05.320]  MSNBC does and they're an open White House organ is they try to define what's
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:09.400]  acceptable what's not who should cover what who should do what they're always
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:13.600]  lecturing other media lecturing libertarian Republicans oh Alex Jones is
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:17.560]  evil don't listen to him because the stuff continues to come out and be real
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:21.720]  and be serious and cause them problems or don't go to drugs don't go to these
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:25.840]  other sides they're doing this because they're weak ladies and gentlemen the
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.960]  answer is do the opposite of whatever they say because every I mean look I
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:33.200]  intellectually know that nine times out of ten the opposite of what they say is
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.200]  true but just as an action whatever they want don't do it whatever they say look
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:43.040]  into it it's a lie realize they're not just propagandist they are criminal
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:47.160]  enemies I'm sorry I'm ranting no no I you're making a good point though that
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.680]  in look just take for instance what John Kerry just said it to the State
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:56.000]  Department he was speaking about the internet and he said that the internet
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.760]  has made it much more difficult to govern than it in the other time in
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.600]  history and when he was explaining his remarks he actually says that during the
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:09.600]  Cold War it was a lot easier because of the way that that communist countries
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:14.280]  were controlling information and he says and then at the end of the Cold War it
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:17.680]  became much more difficult and then came along he says a little thing called the
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:21.200]  internet and it's made it very very difficult to govern well what he's not
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:26.240]  saying govern he's saying control it's very difficult our lives tell us what to
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.680]  do they meant to build it as a worldwide wiretap that was really its name the
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:34.960]  nickname at DARPE as you know and now we're using the worldwide wiretap to
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.800]  take them down we're using it as we're taking it over and flipping the script
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:43.760]  against them and I'm telling you they're scared now and they should be
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:48.200]  you know well absolutely and I think as we continue to watch the response from
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:50.840]  people and again this is what's so important watch the response of the
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:57.080]  public the public was not did not buy into the NSA is okay the NSA protected
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:00.440]  us from 50 terror attacks that we can't tell you about and we refuse to give
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:04.880]  information to Congress about you know the the NSA was able to spot this
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:09.320]  supposed terror threat against embassies around the world the other day
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.400]  no one's buying this and so I think what you're seeing now is this kind of this
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:18.640]  critical moment where the NSA scandal may be as we look back on it in history
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.480]  the moment when the American public stop believing the narrative coming from
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:27.120]  corporate media stop believing the narrative coming from politicians and
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.860]  started listening to those alternative voices and the alternative became the
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:35.560]  mainstream and if the people just go hey I can make up my own mind
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:39.280]  historically I can check into what I want then it's over because they're not
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:42.560]  even just listening to us they're listening to common sense and that's
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.560]  the big issue here believe though the burden of proof on guys like you and
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:52.240]  me is substantially higher than it is on mainstream we have to be able to back
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:55.240]  up every single thing that we say because we're going to go through the
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.000]  shredder if we don't well yeah but it's like coke saying that the expert team
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.040]  has no bad health effects when there's Harvard studies Princeton you know I mean
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:07.360]  there's no debating it and the stuff makes you fat and then they're saying
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:11.480]  really doesn't make you fat I mean they're just losing all credibility now
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.280]  because they think the old lies still works and it may work on people that are
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:18.720]  like jellyfish but it doesn't work on a larger and larger segment of the
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.320]  population we're going to break I got to come back and ask you to give us
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:26.840]  tidbits that the NSA is coming after people now because I know if you say
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:31.120]  this you've got the report you say it's coming out Monday via copyright and I'm
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:34.800]  guessing is it for the symbol of the NSA I mean they're saying you can't even
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:38.600]  talk about them basically essentially yeah I give you some more when we come
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:41.280]  back from the break yeah I mean the New York Stock Exchange told us you're not
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.960]  even allowed to aim a camera at our building and of course I know in law
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.880]  that's not true I'm news gathering it's it's it's a public interest I'm allowed
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:53.400]  to show their building but they go no we have copyright now they're saying the
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:57.680]  name you can't even say it I'll say it all I want New York Stock Exchange are a
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:01.040]  bunch of swiveling crooks owned by foreign banks sucking the country dry
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:05.320]  amino acids are the building blocks of proteins amino acids have to be delivered
[02:51:05.320 --> 02:51:08.640]  to your body in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:12.560]  create new proteins in your body just like a brick layer cannot use bent or
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:16.880]  twisted bricks to build a brick wall so too your body cannot use bent or twisted
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:21.040]  amino acids to build new proteins giving your body an undamaged amino acid
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:25.320]  food can make a huge difference in your health one-world-way is an undamaged
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:30.280]  amino acid food unlike any other you see heating bends and twists amino acids

[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:15.480]  your mind on a lighter note if you're a radio listener you should know that Ben
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:20.920]  Swan looks like the long-lost twin brother of Ryan Seacrest but I guess
[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:24.920]  Ryan Seacrest is like the evil worldly twin and then you've got Ben Swan the
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:31.280]  patriotic liberty-loving person I'm sorry Ben because the guys pointed this out
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:33.640]  because I didn't really know who Ryan Seacrest is I've heard the name I know
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:37.320]  he does you know like the DJ stuff on TV and radio but have you been compared to
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:42.160]  Ryan Seacrest before Ryan Seacrest many many times I'm like the poor man's
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:49.720]  version of Ryan Seacrest oh my goodness oh boy man so much is going on tell us
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:54.560]  about the NSA story I mean as much as you can sure listen the bottom line here
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:00.280]  is it's a guy who has a t-shirt company it's a he's not a big player he creates
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:04.480]  a lot of different designs that you know kind of poke fun at the police state and
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:09.840]  he designs a couple with NSA logos on them and if they're clearly parodies
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.160]  what we're gonna show you in the story exactly what the design looks like we're
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.920]  gonna break down for you exactly how it works under rule of law in disguise
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:20.880]  totally covered there's no question about it but the NSA doesn't contact him
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:25.240]  directly just contacts all the sites where he's posting his merchandise and
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:29.640]  getting those companies to pull the merchandise down claiming it's copyright
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:32.880]  infringement and this goes back to what we were talking about that the NSA
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:36.920]  doesn't have to be able to go to court and say look judge here's what we believe
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:40.920]  is copyright infringement we believe that he's he's you know infringing on our
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:44.800]  logo the judge would look at it and say it's a parody you don't have a case they
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.040]  don't have to do that and plus plus for those that don't know it's a government
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:52.000]  taxpayer-funded deal they have basically no rights unless you were trying to
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  impersonate and then that's a felony I mean this is just outrageous and they
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  admit that's what syspa and sopa is about that's and that's absolutely what
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.320]  it's about and so the but that's what it's so important for people to
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:06.640]  understand it this isn't about a t-shirt company this is about testing the
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:10.400]  waters to say how are we going to make sure that we don't we don't even have
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.440]  to prove anything under rule of law we're simply going to hammer the small guy
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:18.080]  we're gonna take away his right to be able to talk about us we're gonna take
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.320]  away everyone's right to talk about us that's what the issue is here you just
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:25.040]  hit the nail on the head right there so many people that don't get it go I don't
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:28.320]  care if they shut down cold power plants I don't own that I don't care if they
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:32.000]  shut down that guy's t-shirt company if they can shut down power plants our
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  power prices all go up if they can and then ship our jobs to China if they can
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.200]  shut down somebody when it's open parody and free speech we all lose it I mean
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:44.120]  people just need to get folks that when they screw somebody else you're getting
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:48.160]  it to I mean what that that's a basic instinct of a free people can you speak
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:52.520]  to that well I know and I think that what the other point there is that you
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:56.120]  better understand that they don't care about the t-shirt company either when
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:59.160]  the NSA comes after the guy with the t-shirt company they don't care about
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.600]  that they care about taking steps because remember this that under our
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:06.600]  judicial system they're trying to block her free speech and shut down
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:09.880]  political dissent which they've been doing with the press their criminals
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:13.320]  don't worry but remember under the judicial system that we have
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:16.920]  judges don't look at the Constitution the Supreme Court doesn't look at the
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:21.200]  Constitution they look at precedent and so when when they go in and take away
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:24.640]  some guys right to free speech in a t-shirt company the judge in the next
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:28.440]  case doesn't look at the Constitution they look at precedent and say well they
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:31.440]  took away the t-shirt companies guys right so I guess they can do it here too
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:35.040]  that's how the system is being played out now so you better care about the
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:39.240]  t-shirt company not for the reason that you might have a financial or vested
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:43.240]  interest in his company but that you have a vested interest in your own right
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:46.920]  that's it I'm coming out with a shirt that says NSA with her symbol and then
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:52.360]  Nazi Soviet assault I mean I'll do whatever I want unbelievable and you
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:56.120]  have and you have that would be a parody under rule of law that's a parody
[02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:59.560]  it's a little bit different than satire which there's some you know legal
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:02.200]  issues there but clearly what you're talking about is a parody as long as
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:06.880]  you take their logo their image and make fun of it then you're guaranteed
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:11.640]  protection under law but not guaranteed under this current political climate
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:16.600]  unbelievable and they're they're now being caught harassing media trying to
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:21.240]  control things doh why do government spy on people this is and then doing fake
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:24.920]  terror alerts which they now got caught were fake terror alerts but that's back
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:29.280]  of the newspaper but it's not back in the newspaper at your website or at my

[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:17.120]  and Alex Jones to receive Obama clown sensitivity training that's a joke
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.720]  satire video but it's pretty popular we got about four minutes left I want to
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:24.880]  give you the floor here to get into other issues things you think should be
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:29.120]  transmitted to the audience out there Ben Schwann well I think one of the things
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:31.840]  that we are trying to do with this project and that we've been looking
[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:37.200]  into it there is such a problem in this country and I know you talk about this a
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:41.760]  lot Alex of crony capitalism and so one of the things we're really trying to
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:44.480]  break through with this project is to help people understand the difference
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:49.560]  between free market freedom individual liberty and capitalism and the current
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:52.760]  system we have which is a crony capitalist system some people call it
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:57.040]  fascism this collusion between government and corporations in order to
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:00.160]  control the outcome of things and so that's one of the things that we're
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:03.600]  hitting on pretty hard with this project and we're looking at but I think
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:06.760]  there are a lot of things happening right now as you kind of look around the
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:10.040]  country and there's some things happening obviously you have big firms like
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.240]  Monsanto and we're doing some stuff with that but even some of the things that
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:18.000]  Apple is now working on it should be disconcerting to people to see again
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:22.840]  the collusion between government and corporations in order to create these
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:27.720]  these desired outcomes and ultimately none of it is done with an interest in
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:32.120]  your freedom your liberty and your rights as an American citizen and I think
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:35.480]  we're watching that all of that slip away so through all these headlines that
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:39.400]  we see over and over and over I think we keep getting back to the same central
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.360]  themes and that's where I really hope that people are catching on there's a
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.800]  theme to all of this so the story of the day may change but the theme doesn't
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:53.160]  the the particular headline might change but the root of the problem doesn't and
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:56.880]  so hopefully we're gonna get it with other folks like you continue to break
[03:02:56.880 --> 03:03:00.960]  through that look at this headline the Missouri State Commission has ordered
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:05.400]  that old rodeo clowns undergo sensitivity training so Stephen Corbair can
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:09.360]  make fun of the president but they can go pick on one group and now say you
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:13.920] 've all got to go pay I looked it up it's like $500 in that state to go be taught
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:20.480]  how to be a good communist or none of you can work I mean this is just so screwed
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:24.000]  up it's so Soviet it's not even politically correct even though that's a
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.600]  Soviet term these are authoritarian's how about the government go through
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:32.680]  Constitution training how about that well absolutely look in and at the end of
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:37.880]  the day the host and the announcer for the rodeo have both resigned their
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:41.800]  positions and they're both out of jobs now in relation to this and here comes
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.680]  the secret service I mean this is crazy yeah they're called secret service
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:51.120]  needs to look into whether or not you're making fun of the cloud mask and meanwhile
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.840]  all our liberties are being destroyed I mean it's just unbelievable well it
[03:03:54.840 --> 03:03:58.920]  was the most unbelievable thing about that is the fact that a rodeo clown in
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:03.320]  Missouri can get this kind of attention it's it's such a non-story and yet it
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:07.440]  is like sucking up all the oxygen from all these different spaces and I don't
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:10.800]  mind the government funding al-qaeda and fake terror alerts did you hear a guy had
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:14.800]  a mask on and a bull chasing that's what they do the bulls chase the clowns I
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:19.400]  mean obviously it's anti-Obama we hate this new world order puppet yeah yeah
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:23.520]  well and the thing is as you said it almost becomes a rodeo of its own it's
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:26.960]  like the rodeo clown now is the story of the rodeo clown and everyone's looking
