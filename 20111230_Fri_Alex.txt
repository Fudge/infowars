[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:23.120]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.120 --> 00:40.400]  well it's my final radio transmission of big 2011 and we descend into 2012 I don't
[00:40.400 --> 00:45.720]  buy it all the Mayan calendar mumbo jumbo but the globalist in the UN
[00:45.720 --> 00:51.480]  certainly do the occultists that run this planet and they are just skittering
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.320]  around trying to get their world police state and massive World War 3 blood
[00:56.320 --> 01:05.920]  letting extravaganza fiasco lined up for everyone and we've got quite the
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.600]  transmission lined up for you know for the first I don't know 13 years or so of
[01:10.600 --> 01:17.080]  my radio broadcast or 14 years I did three hours every day and then for a
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.000]  couple years I'd went to four hours and so a lot of stations are programmed to
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.920]  pick up the full four hours and some days I do the fourth hour most days I
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.680]  don't but today I will be doing the fourth hour and for stations to go off at
[01:28.680 --> 01:34.000]  the third hour that's fine it's always archived at prisonplanet.tv and
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.480]  infowars.com with the free audio podcast right there but we do have a big
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.480]  broadcast lined up for you today and it will be the last radio show of 2011
[01:45.480 --> 01:52.080]  obviously because tomorrow is the big run up to New Year's Eve and then on
[01:52.080 --> 02:01.360]  Sunday why it'll be January 1st 2012 so quite interesting to have have that
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.360]  approaching us before we know it'll be 2013 and according to the mainstream
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.720]  media we won't be here anymore you know what I'm making a New Year's resolution
[02:11.720 --> 02:16.800]  that I'm not going to use the term mainstream media I've had that beaten
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.120]  into my head over the years we all have and it's become a term that means
[02:21.120 --> 02:28.000]  discredited that means simpering that means deceptive that means that it is
[02:28.000 --> 02:38.360]  bought and paid for but it's not mainstream media it is zombie brainwashing
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.320]  transmissions it is the system that attempts to keep people in their
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.200]  cultural psychological spiritual trance state that the general public that's
[02:50.200 --> 02:53.760]  not fully awakened as in now the public has woken up the fact the government's
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.920]  run by a bunch of lion criminals and that's in all the polls and statistics
[02:57.920 --> 03:04.720]  but the people have no idea on average just how rancid this rabbit hole is
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.360]  they're just smelling around the hole the entrance and smell those stench of
[03:10.360 --> 03:17.800]  rotten meat and hear the the howls of pain down the verminous verminous
[03:17.800 --> 03:28.040]  entrance the verminous viperous cavernous opening but if you try to plumb the
[03:28.040 --> 03:33.240]  depths of it it is bottomless because evil is bottomless in its inventiveness
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.440]  and it's endless grasping for more carnage more pain more destruction in
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.200]  its attacks on everything good and decent and it is the naivete of those of us
[03:43.200 --> 03:46.720]  that are good that allows this great evil to grow or an exponential growth
[03:46.720 --> 03:52.080]  curve okay I'm gonna stop preaching it's just when you behold the beast you
[03:52.080 --> 03:58.240]  you're in wonderment just as I guess one of the prophets was on the Isle of
[03:58.240 --> 04:05.880]  Patmos John the Revelator was in awe and marveled at the beast and let me tell
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.720]  you if you even see one one millionth of the New World Order for your own eyes
[04:10.720 --> 04:15.400]  you will be in wonderment as well I guess you'd be in wonderment if you
[04:15.400 --> 04:21.160]  watched a baby a newborn baby fed into a blender it's it's that doesn't quite
[04:21.160 --> 04:29.480]  capture it but it gives you the subtle hint you're the first trappings of a
[04:29.480 --> 04:38.560]  scent we're gonna break we come back we'll tell you who's up today on the
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.920]  transmission oh it's a big broadcast today not one not two not three not four
[04:44.920 --> 04:54.640]  but five guest and your phone calls and the remnant of the so-called mainstream
[04:54.640 --> 05:01.960]  media's attack on myself and Ron Paul slime ball mr. Matthews ease the t-rex
[05:01.960 --> 05:24.240]  of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[05:24.240 --> 05:31.280]  well we were just watching Fox News and there we got multiple TVs on
[05:31.280 --> 05:37.600]  monitoring the dinosaur mind control media and we were able to DVR Ron Paul
[05:37.600 --> 05:43.320]  signing info wars.com t-shirt and we just showed you some of that and if
[05:43.320 --> 05:47.360]  you're a new radio listener and you're going you just showed us that wow radio
[05:47.360 --> 05:52.760]  with pictures yes that's what the 21st century is and I've been doing this for
[05:52.760 --> 05:57.920]  16 years or more but now you see every other radio talk show host moving in
[05:57.920 --> 06:03.120]  that direction not just with with a document cam or a studio cam but with
[06:03.120 --> 06:10.440]  multiple five-camera shoots media feeds in to track it in real time all of it
[06:10.440 --> 06:15.560]  right here in studio guest you name it that is what we have pioneered here at
[06:15.560 --> 06:22.120]  info wars.com so if you are a radio listener on XM or AM or FM out there
[06:22.120 --> 06:28.240]  or shortwave you can always go to prisonplanet.tv and and actually watch
[06:28.240 --> 06:35.260]  the three-hour radio show as well and this will be the last radio show of
[06:35.260 --> 06:41.240]  2011 and so it's quite a whopper I'm doing a fourth hour today that'll be
[06:41.240 --> 06:47.320]  prisonplanet.tv and internet only I know actually it's on the
[06:47.320 --> 06:53.000]  satellites of some stations do carry the fourth hour actually but we'll be
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.560]  doing a full four hours today and then I'll do my final media operation of
[06:58.560 --> 07:03.320]  2011 the info wars nightly news this evening we have Ray McGovern former
[07:03.320 --> 07:08.240]  top CIA analyst and morning briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert
[07:08.240 --> 07:12.520]  Walker Bush on a breakdown of what's happening with Iran and the Strait of
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.960]  Hormuz drills they're doing in the US aircraft carrier a day and a half ago
[07:15.960 --> 07:20.880]  that went through the middle of their drills in a big provocation and the
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.160]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of course coming on a week ago and saying
[07:24.160 --> 07:28.360]  that we're ready to attack Iran and probably will the council on farm
[07:28.360 --> 07:32.640]  relations a week ago officially with a headline time to attack Iran that's the
[07:32.640 --> 07:39.720]  headline Israel's saying they're ready and it's on it's on and of course the
[07:39.720 --> 07:44.080]  establishment will undoubtedly stage some domestic terror attacks and use that
[07:44.080 --> 07:48.280]  to then have the TSA activate on the streets which they're already beta
[07:48.280 --> 07:53.320]  testing and the hands are going in the pants and again to explain what's
[07:53.320 --> 07:57.520]  happening with all of this the global megabanks that are setting up the new
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.320]  world order world government system in their own documents that are public are
[08:01.320 --> 08:05.560]  waging war against all nation states against the family against farmers
[08:05.560 --> 08:10.400]  against Amish against sovereign countries against anything that hasn't
[08:10.400 --> 08:15.000]  been taken over by them it's a total domination corporate takeover model of
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.640]  the species of the genetic code of the environment GMO forced inoculations it
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.320]  is total scientific tyranny in their own words that's what they call it a
[08:26.320 --> 08:29.320]  scientific dictatorship in their own UN documents club of Rome that we've
[08:29.320 --> 08:34.840]  covered here at nauseam this is what you're dealing with absolute total
[08:34.840 --> 08:40.280]  rewriting of the planet of life of the family the end of humanity as we know
[08:40.280 --> 08:46.160]  it that's the new world order it's a bold goal but the British royalty and
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.280]  others 160 years ago went to the top professors in England we cover it in
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.040]  endgame and said we have a global empire show us how to scientifically
[08:55.040 --> 09:00.240]  deconstruct humanity so it's impossible to resist and the establishment said
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.440]  well we're gonna study that for you scientific system and they wrote
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.200]  hundreds and hundreds of books on it and that is the system we now live under
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.520]  and we're very deep into it and somebody like Ron Paul comes along and says the
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.240]  emperors not wearing any clothes like in the emperors new clothes a parable it's
[09:17.240 --> 09:20.040]  a three-year-old you know points out and says the emperors wearing no clothes
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.240]  but no one else wanted to admit he was running around in parades in his
[09:24.240 --> 09:28.080]  underwear that's simplifying the parable if you don't know it go look it up it
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.800]  will describe what we're dealing with and they howl with anger and say it is
[09:32.800 --> 09:39.120]  insane and that you know Ron Paul is just a horrible demon who is so extreme
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.120]  but the truth is the people running our government I saw an RT interview a few
[09:43.120 --> 09:48.760]  days ago with Richard Pearl saying yes we're getting ready to attack Iran one
[09:48.760 --> 09:52.560]  of the main architects of the Iraq war this is a guy who's even been in the
[09:52.560 --> 09:57.520]  New York Times they've reported comes up to good-looking women at DC cocktail
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.400]  parties and I mean he looks like a 400 pound demon with giant black circles
[10:04.400 --> 10:11.600]  around his eyes he talks with a lisping bad guy voice he is he is everything
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.600]  that evil is a big demonic wimp and he comes up to good-looking women and goes
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.880]  from woman to woman and says I devastated Iraq I've killed me you know I
[10:20.880 --> 10:25.920]  basically have killed millions I'm powerful and the women almost vomit on
[10:25.920 --> 10:28.440]  him even though they're you know sycophantic globalists they understand
[10:28.440 --> 10:35.000]  this is disgusting this is a big nerdly obese wimp who couldn't fight his way
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.040]  out of a invisible bag you know non-existent paper bag he couldn't
[10:40.040 --> 10:46.160]  have when a fight with with the atmosphere you know with a vapor and he
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.960]  walks up bragging about how he's got power and kills people I mean this is
[10:50.960 --> 10:58.080]  what good people's weakness has created fat weak disgusting demonic blobs who
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.680]  looks like a over-gorge of vampire that's like eating 5,000 children or
[11:02.680 --> 11:08.240]  something and and and and and loves his own voice and has that same dick cheney
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.320]  you know affected voice like it's all real calculated and thought out no you
[11:14.320 --> 11:18.600]  got a bunch of spiritually blind people and you're not powerful because you can
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.360]  lead them over the edge of a cliff boy ok I see you I see how pathetically weak
[11:24.360 --> 11:29.000]  you are and I see Chris Matthews and how pathetically weak you are and when
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.760]  Chris Matthews talked about yours truly you could see the fear in his eyes they
[11:35.760 --> 11:41.680]  are scared you know why because they got one that can see they got one that
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.120]  doesn't care about their torture squads and their death squads who isn't afraid
[11:46.120 --> 11:51.760]  of them and who is just standing right in their face I'm not up here bragging
[11:51.760 --> 11:56.040]  beating my chest saying bring it on I'm not saying bring it on I'm bringing it
[11:56.040 --> 12:03.120]  to you okay I'm committed I got my helmet on I got my breastplate on I got my
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.600]  sword and I'm coming at you and I'm not gonna stop I'm committed you know why
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.040]  because it's a good feeling my soul when I'm not fearful my soul when I'm
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.520]  focused and committed for all the innocence that you you maggots have fed
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.400]  on my soul says good job and the universe looks at me and says yes and I
[12:24.400 --> 12:29.520]  can feel that connection and that's what it's all about is the choice I've made
[12:29.520 --> 12:33.080]  and by the way folks if you think you're on the side of good you think you've
[12:33.080 --> 12:40.240]  made that choice if you are not compelled possessed driven to fight evil
[12:40.240 --> 12:46.960]  and corruption and when you do wrong if your conscience doesn't doesn't anguish
[12:46.960 --> 12:52.000]  you then you are not living in the light I'm gonna stop preaching right there
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.280]  just in these times it just it comes down to good and evil it comes down to
[12:56.280 --> 13:02.360]  good and evil it comes down to good and evil and recognizing evil the devil's
[13:02.360 --> 13:08.160]  greatest trip and trick was convincing the world he didn't exist and even if
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.040]  you don't believe in a physical spiritual entity the point is that's how
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.720]  evil operates that's how psychopaths operate wearing their suits and ties
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.120]  driving their conservative cars you know good at talking to the cops good at
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.080]  talking to their neighbors silver tongue but they're devils yeah I got wise as
[13:27.080 --> 13:34.760]  Elvis said you're a devil in disguise oh oh yes you are and I am coming at you
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.960]  coming at you coming at you coming straight on and I am here to get others
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.920]  to stand up and to wake up and to activate and come straight on for you
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.440]  now I'm gonna get into the incredible record gun sales I'm gonna get into the
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.400]  amazing Iran news we've got Gerald Salente coming on again to give us he
[13:53.400 --> 13:57.440]  didn't finish all his trends for 2012 Lindsey Williams coming back on with his
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.240]  trends for 2012 and to take your phone calls Bob Chapman will have open phones
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.000]  for that I go into fourth hour Gary Franchi who's running that great TV ad
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.960]  showing the black fellow that the racist at the hospital wouldn't take care of
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.160]  him at Ron Paul would and and then and then wave the bill so just by the way
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.960]  out of folks that know Ron Paul that's what he did he would volunteer about a
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.280]  third of his time like you're supposed to at at charity hospitals by the way my
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.120]  dad always has done that and then others don't do what they're supposed to so he's
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.200]  always mobbed by people wanting free dentistry but that's what you're supposed
[14:31.200 --> 14:35.680]  to do when you sign up as a as a as a physician and that's what Ron Paul says
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.040]  well that's what we do in some cases you know especially work for a company that
[14:40.040 --> 14:43.720]  doesn't even allow you to discount it down to 100% because there's labs and
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.360]  equipment cost and instrument cost and got to pay your employees my dad
[14:47.360 --> 14:50.160]  constantly I shouldn't say this on air because then more people come you know
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.720]  would actually just in many times is paid for people's health care you know
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.920]  actually gone even further but that's what Ron Paul was well known for working
[14:58.920 --> 15:06.440]  for two dollars a day in a charity hospital two dollars a day and then
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.600]  separately having his own practice okay that's what humanity is about and we've
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.960]  got franchise coming on about that with a super pack and I know a lot of our
[15:14.960 --> 15:18.000]  listeners have supported it but when we come back I'm going to play the
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.840]  sniveling creature I almost wish he had the light of burning enjoyment of what
[15:24.840 --> 15:29.180]  he's doing it's almost more creepy that you can see that that Matthews is this
[15:29.180 --> 15:35.280]  empty teleprompter reading Democratic Party operative husk who is just part of
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.680]  the system and is scared and going along with it most these people are just
[15:39.680 --> 15:46.880]  ghoul golem like slaves to the evil I can't imagine how hellish their lives
[15:46.880 --> 15:53.040]  must be I cannot imagine what it's like to be on your back a hundred percent to
[15:53.040 --> 16:03.440]  every form of evil I mean Chris Matthews is is is is just such a truly
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.520]  psychically and spiritually crippled person he's a mess there are people like
[16:09.520 --> 16:16.920]  like Pearl who enjoy the evil and are gorged on it and I can hate them because
[16:16.920 --> 16:21.000]  they're just a pure demonic creature but when you look at Matthews he's this
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.720]  person who you know once had some humanity and you can see the humanity
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.160]  twisted through him and you can it's just like a wreck it's like a burnout
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.400]  old classic car you know that like rats are nesting in or something it's it's
[16:37.400 --> 16:44.600]  it's it's unbelievable so we're going to play him and he goes to this lazy-eyed
[16:44.600 --> 16:52.240]  dim-witted twit with the appeal to authority and ask is Alex Jones and
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.960]  Ron Paul credible what they're saying I mean it is pathetic how how weak they
[16:57.960 --> 17:15.320]  are I mean these people are sick okay I normally wouldn't even get into what
[17:15.320 --> 17:23.720]  old dinosaur propaganda arms zombie programming media engages in it's not
[17:23.720 --> 17:29.280]  mainstream media for years they've had tiny audiences in full wars.com alone is
[17:29.280 --> 17:33.880]  it's roughly 15 times the visitors you can go to Alexa.com or Google Analytics
[17:33.880 --> 17:38.840]  that MSNBC.com does their top shows might have a couple hundred thousand
[17:38.840 --> 17:45.200]  viewers they are a joke they are a joke this show has 3 million a day I've got
[17:45.200 --> 17:51.680]  films online with 35 40 million views but when he goes to Iowa for his little
[17:51.680 --> 17:58.240]  meeting Chris Matthews there's all these Iowans well-meaning people they're like
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.440]  it's exciting and clapping oh my gosh they're in a little cafe with Chris
[18:03.440 --> 18:10.360]  Matthews it's so amazing I mean they could be on some local radio show and
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.320]  probably have more listeners but they're all there they're on national TV so it's
[18:15.320 --> 18:21.160]  the ghost of what it was to be on television and say the 70s where you
[18:21.160 --> 18:26.640]  had three networks and there were probably 40 million people watching the
[18:26.640 --> 18:32.120]  nightly news and you notice it was the same script on every channel all
[18:32.120 --> 18:38.520]  Department of Defense brainwashing Pentagon anti-American below me the
[18:38.520 --> 18:43.360]  foreign banks took us over a long time ago all these wars are about destroying
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.960]  America destroying Iran destroying all these countries the bankers sit above
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.880]  it and play us off against each other and Matthews knows that he was a top
[18:52.880 --> 18:59.240]  advisor to Jimmy Carter Matthews knows all of this is pure bull he knows he's
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.320]  there sniping at a good man like Ron Paul so they imply he's a big racist all
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.200]  day and then they shift into what about the extremism and he talks to the
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.840]  Republican Party chairman there who actually overall seemed pretty fair and
[19:10.840 --> 19:13.760]  said I don't think it's cookie to like Ron Paul you know people have their
[19:13.760 --> 19:20.720]  right to like him if they do but then he has this other media pundit there with
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.520]  one of the so-called MSM groups and you just look at her and I'm not trying to
[19:25.520 --> 19:31.680]  be mean to her but I mean I wonder if she knows how to tire shoelaces and he
[19:31.680 --> 19:34.800]  and then Matthews asked her in this appeal to authority as they all prop
[19:34.800 --> 19:38.920]  each other up with their little dwindling tiny remnant audiences the shadow
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.000]  of what they were well is it credible that he's saying that it's baloney the
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.280]  whole Iranian plot on the Alex Jones show and she's like I don't know if it
[19:48.280 --> 19:54.280]  is now what's funny is in our article about this we have Chris Matthews
[19:54.280 --> 19:57.920]  attempts to destroy Ron Paul's campaign devotes large portion of program to
[19:57.920 --> 20:02.520]  latest smear attempt you know they act like we're crazy to say that was staged
[20:02.520 --> 20:09.280]  with the Iranian car salesman but then we have under it the New York Times saying
[20:09.280 --> 20:14.560]  no one was buying it here it is New York Times US challenge to explain
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.080]  accusations of Iranian plot in the face of skepticism and it goes through all
[20:18.080 --> 20:21.920]  these Bush Clinton officials saying it's bull it goes through I mean Anthony
[20:21.920 --> 20:25.080]  Schaefer Colonel Schaefer talk of the FBI they said it was made up and it
[20:25.080 --> 20:31.000]  turned out it was made up again verified reality and they say who is Ron Paul
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.200]  this is crazy so let's go ahead and go to a small clip of them trying to
[20:36.200 --> 20:41.720]  control reality and dictate to you from their perch that they control reality
[20:41.720 --> 20:46.880]  and if they say black as white it is because Chris control freak chicken
[20:46.880 --> 20:51.560]  neck Matthews said so here it is difficulty of course he would
[20:51.560 --> 20:54.960]  with the young people would they still say well maybe there is something to
[20:54.960 --> 20:57.720]  these theories I don't think they're paying close attention to that thing but
[20:57.720 --> 21:02.400]  also with their five days left until the caucuses when Herman Cain was being
[21:02.400 --> 21:06.120]  targeted for the allegations of sexual harassment it took a month for him to
[21:06.120 --> 21:09.840]  fall down in the polls and get out of the race really a five days left you
[21:09.840 --> 21:13.880]  think bad news about a cat he can't in a short term bring him down well in this
[21:13.880 --> 21:17.000]  point we're talking about Rick Perry changing his position on abortion and
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.400]  talking about whether or not Romney can now win Iowa all these other things that
[21:20.400 --> 21:23.240]  are happening these dynamics the last few days I don't think let's go to some
[21:23.240 --> 21:26.360]  evidence here drawn Paul has never endorsed the 9-11 truth or move it
[21:26.360 --> 21:30.240]  explicitly but when offered the chance to repudiate those theories the ones like
[21:30.240 --> 21:32.960]  the White House had something to do with blowing up the World Trade Centers
[21:32.960 --> 21:36.760]  here's what he said let's watch as he responds when confronted with a question
[21:36.760 --> 22:03.640]  about 9-11 Ron Paul's also a repeat guest on the radio show of Alex Jones now
[22:03.640 --> 22:06.880]  who has suggested the United States government was involved in 9-11 attacks
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.560]  earlier this month Ron Paul discussed with Jones the recent plot allegedly by
[22:11.560 --> 22:15.760]  Iranian operatives to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington Paul called
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.600]  the whole story that they were out to get the Saudi ambassador a propaganda
[22:20.600 --> 22:27.240]  stunt let's listen to the two of them Alex Jones and Ron Paul there was a so
[22:27.240 --> 22:33.920]  called attempt to kill the Saudi or the Iranian ambassador you know that kind of
[22:33.920 --> 22:37.360]  stuff it just way too much even mainstream media had to admit that was
[22:37.360 --> 22:41.600]  totally phony and a pretext to attack Iran
[22:41.600 --> 22:59.360]  2011 more than any other year has been when the new world-ordered global
[22:59.360 --> 23:05.040]  technocrats came out in the open thousands of articles literally in the
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.040]  last year I mean hundreds and hundreds a week where they just say yes there's a
[23:09.040 --> 23:12.760]  private corporate world government kind of like the Economist magazine last month
[23:12.760 --> 23:16.880]  we showed it to you here on air and read the quotes where they said I gotta dig
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.400]  that back out I know it was in here in fact here it is right here still haven't
[23:21.400 --> 23:29.360]  got it out of the office here's the issue of the Economist comes out weekly
[23:29.360 --> 23:36.600]  this was the November 19th the 25th edition and in here they say yeah
[23:36.600 --> 23:41.600]  technocracy it was run by the communists and others but that's basically what we
[23:41.600 --> 23:48.480]  need and they know best and this is what we're gonna have to do in Europe and
[23:48.480 --> 23:52.080]  the US and worldwide governments are just gonna have to be rubber stamps to
[23:52.080 --> 23:56.640]  the experts of the the experts that just so happened to be control freak
[23:56.640 --> 24:02.360]  finance oligarch Ponzi scheme creators who rationalize all their destructive
[24:02.360 --> 24:09.800]  activity through a cosmology of social Darwinistic eugenics I mean that's
[24:09.800 --> 24:15.280]  that's what they're into it's a cosmology of psychopaths sadist and an
[24:15.280 --> 24:20.640]  army of sociopaths that work for them you're like oh don't say it's that bad
[24:20.640 --> 24:24.400]  have you ever read a history book I mean do you know what happened the last
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.160]  century governments killed over 200 million people government is the number
[24:28.160 --> 24:35.720]  one cause of death of unnatural death I mean it's second tonight it's right
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.360]  there with automobiles but you know we die because we like to drive and I
[24:39.360 --> 24:47.240]  understand it life's about a risk-taking but government killing you killing you
[24:47.240 --> 24:52.360]  working you to death in a slave camp that is a bona fide fact and the founding
[24:52.360 --> 24:55.280]  fathers warned us about government being the most dangerous thing for
[24:55.280 --> 24:58.640]  special interest to get control of it because then you don't have to make a
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.760]  better car engine or come out with a better book or a better philosophy or a
[25:02.760 --> 25:07.640]  better baseball or a better mousetrap no you just run the government you run
[25:07.640 --> 25:12.640]  everything this is high-tech tyranny with super fancy public relations but the
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.200]  public relations is wearing thin so now in 2011 they passed in DAA and they
[25:18.200 --> 25:20.840]  said yeah there's a world government privately run we're getting rid of
[25:20.840 --> 25:24.400]  freedom and yeah we'll secretly arrest citizens if we want and yeah we are
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.480]  setting up checkpoints everywhere and yeah we are gonna probably have a bank
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.520]  holiday and in the future and devalue the dollar that couple days ago we read
[25:33.520 --> 25:37.640]  from Bernanke speeches where he said he will devalue the dollar and then
[25:37.640 --> 25:40.880]  separately he has his talking heads saying we're not devaluing but when he
[25:40.880 --> 25:45.240]  actually goes and talks to the economist he tells the truth on c-span like real
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.440]  people you know you know out there in the street aren't watching that so they
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.440]  have the stuff they put on ABC and Fox News and then they that's that's pure
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.000]  bull and they have when they're actually talking to each other at meetings
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.920]  they'll even put it on TV knowing maybe 50,000 people are watching it and so what
[26:02.920 --> 26:06.960]  they won't understand what they're hearing this is what's crazy about what
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.680]  we're talking about now coming up at the Gerald Salente leaves us here in just
[26:10.680 --> 26:15.040]  about 30 minutes Iran is launching the seventh day of its naval drills with
[26:15.040 --> 26:22.480]  hella-born operations gun sales hit all-time records 1,534,000 FBI
[26:22.480 --> 26:29.520]  checks for gun sales they sold 500 plus thousand a six-day period and in a
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.440]  survey they said because they're worried about civil unrest and a collapsing
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.520]  government the American people folks know the government's criminal and it's
[26:37.520 --> 26:40.720]  not going to get away with its martial law scenario we're gonna talk about that
[26:40.720 --> 26:48.320]  too but joining us is Gerald Salente of TrendsResearch.com to go over his 12
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.280]  trends of 2012 coming up because he only got to a few of them I'd like him to
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.760]  start over and go through those with us today TrendsResearch.com Gerald thanks
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.880]  for joining us today always my pleasure Alex and just to let you know I've
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.880]  turned down a number of requests for interviews on the major media on TV
[27:08.880 --> 27:15.000]  because I just don't want to associate with them anymore and so I much rather
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.840]  be on with you and others like you and so that was that's part of my New Year's
[27:19.840 --> 27:25.720]  resolution and they keep calling me up and asking me to come on and I just tell
[27:25.720 --> 27:29.840]  them I'm busy I'm not coming on and that that's the end of it I'm not going to be
[27:29.840 --> 27:36.680]  a part of that that scam anymore and it just it's not it doesn't do me it
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.800]  doesn't do anybody any good even though it's very beneficial financially for me
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.040]  to do it it's just not worth it and I'd rather be on with you who tells it like
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.480]  it is it makes it so clear and put your neck on the line because this thing is
[27:53.480 --> 27:59.640]  going down and there are very few people like yourself that are willing to
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.120]  really tell the truth about how bad it really is and then people like myself
[28:05.120 --> 28:11.960]  who do trend forecasting to say how bad it's going to get well yes sir and and
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.600]  again we appreciate you people need to appreciate Ron Paul yourself myself and
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.440]  others who are willing to state the obvious fact because because it's only
[28:21.440 --> 28:24.160]  going to make things worse if we don't face the hard facts but I think you've
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.560]  hit on something central here Gerald and I'd like you to expand on this and then
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.840]  get into your trends for 2012 and the report that you're sharing with us here
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.880]  today looking at the so-called mainstream media I am going to stop using
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.720]  that term in 2012 because as you've claimed their prostitutes and they are
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.800]  bought and paid for and their audiences are dwindling because people are
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.000]  becoming aware of this and I think ostracizing them is something I do a
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.640]  lot now when they call me occasionally to come on I just don't even return their
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.920]  calls in many cases because they really are a joke and it's time that that MSM
[28:57.920 --> 29:03.920]  label go away and they really are prostitutes that's all they are and look
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.840]  look at look at what happened with the National Defense Authorization Act it
[29:08.840 --> 29:14.160]  barely got any coverage at all and by the way in this new trends journal the
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.280]  one coming out the top trends of 2012 as you well know we're talking about safe
[29:19.280 --> 29:24.000]  havens and people have been keep coming to me so how about Argentina how about
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  Argentina I said you know I was down there about a year and a half ago and
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.040]  it it's not the right place anything could change at any time and I have
[29:32.040 --> 29:36.240]  really a history of clamping down on people but a lot of people are still
[29:36.240 --> 29:41.220]  going down there well guess what they just came out with two days ago they
[29:41.220 --> 29:47.580]  passed a law that copies the National Defense Authorization Act and then
[29:47.580 --> 29:53.680]  trumps it do you remember my story of telling you about my last episode and
[29:53.680 --> 29:59.920]  trying to get my money out of the bank with HSBC yes sir well now in Argentina
[29:59.920 --> 30:07.720]  you could get 15 years in jail for taking your money out of the bank if they
[30:07.720 --> 30:13.840]  don't like the way you're taking it out you can get 15 years in jail now in
[30:13.840 --> 30:21.760]  Argentina for protesting against the government what I'm saying is Alex it's
[30:21.760 --> 30:30.160]  clamping down all over the world in Hungary democracy is shot they have
[30:30.160 --> 30:34.840]  this government in there in the last several weeks they've been jamming
[30:34.840 --> 30:41.240]  through legislation that's cutting out other opposition media it's putting
[30:41.240 --> 30:48.760]  clamps on people's dissent it's going on worldwide and the reason it's clamping
[30:48.760 --> 30:57.760]  down as they've done with here in the good old USA is because they know that
[30:57.760 --> 31:03.340]  the financial Ponzi scheme is collapsing and they are going to do
[31:03.340 --> 31:10.240]  everything they can to quell dissent you're right Gerald and people always
[31:10.240 --> 31:13.000]  say you know let's get out of the country my wife has said that before she's
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.120]  very intelligent and I understand the instinct CNN and others other globalist
[31:18.120 --> 31:22.680]  outlets have reported that there are record numbers people leaving but the
[31:22.680 --> 31:27.880]  issue is this is a global corporate kleptocrat model there's global
[31:27.880 --> 31:32.400]  standardization and as you pointed out the exact same stuff's being done in
[31:32.400 --> 31:39.400]  Eastern Europe in in in Costa Rica in Central America in Australia in Germany
[31:39.400 --> 31:44.960]  in England it's all carbon copy and there's the headline New Argentine law
[31:44.960 --> 31:49.560]  adopted broad the definition of terrorism including taking your money out of
[31:49.560 --> 31:55.720]  the bank so that's it I mean worldwide authoritarianism is here because the
[31:55.720 --> 32:01.000]  very same financial crooks are running it and so we got to stand and fight
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.160]  basically yes and let's say again we call them by their proper name the money
[32:06.160 --> 32:12.280]  changers that's all they are and as a matter of fact there's another wonderful
[32:12.280 --> 32:18.040]  little article you should Google up on Bloomberg about how they call the people
[32:18.040 --> 32:25.440]  that dissent against the very greedy taking all the money and remember that
[32:25.440 --> 32:31.920]  we have a income disparity here that rivals that of Iran and China's and
[32:31.920 --> 32:37.920]  Bahui and I'm not making that up that's according to the CIA fact book and then
[32:37.920 --> 32:41.400]  fake conservative spin it like oh well that's free market there's no reason
[32:41.400 --> 32:44.720]  people should be mad they're so poor no there's no reason all the jobs were
[32:44.720 --> 32:47.760]  shipped to China there's no reason meanwhile it's these guys are getting
[32:47.760 --> 32:52.560]  rich off corporate welfare but you'll never hear the pimps posing as
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.760]  conservatives on radio who are attacking Ron Paul admit that to their
[32:56.760 --> 33:03.640]  audience right so if you Google up this you'll see that people like Jamie
[33:03.640 --> 33:10.520]  Diamond and this guy Marcus who created Walmart and not Walmart excuse me home
[33:10.520 --> 33:16.480]  depot home depot loads aren't they wonderful they put all of the people
[33:16.480 --> 33:22.160]  that used to own hardware stores out of business because they know how to do the
[33:22.160 --> 33:28.480]  big deals he says that people like you and I or others that complain about this
[33:28.480 --> 33:35.840]  do you know who we are we're imbeciles that's right they create jobs you have
[33:35.840 --> 33:43.080]  these jerks that are saying things in this article in Bloomberg that when
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.920]  they call us imbeciles like this one guy I think his name is Cooperman or
[33:46.920 --> 33:52.720]  something a hedge fund guy and he says don't these people understand we make
[33:52.720 --> 33:57.320]  it possible so they could stock the shelves with Christmas stuff now you
[33:57.320 --> 34:03.200]  don't you're a hedge fund guy you're a gambler and the gambling club is very
[34:03.200 --> 34:08.720]  tight and you're all doing deals with each other so let's make this really
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.440]  clear you're not the best in the brightest you're high-stakes gamblers
[34:14.440 --> 34:22.520]  that'll screw your mother to make money because mr. Cooperman or mr. Marcus or
[34:22.520 --> 34:29.000]  Jamie Diamond you're a you're just like John Corzine and that's you're a bunch
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.440]  of MF money junkies and you'll want it all just like any heroin addict so I
[34:36.440 --> 34:43.280]  suggest you look up that article and as we go into the new year we have to put
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.920]  the proper name on these people as you said their prostitutes in the media
[34:48.920 --> 34:56.040]  their money changes and loan sharks they are not bankers yeah a banker is
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.480]  somebody who actually loans you some money at a low reasonable rate in your
[34:59.480 --> 35:03.040]  town to build something but the megabanks on record are trying to shut
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.520]  down all the small banks and credit unions they're trying to mop up any
[35:06.520 --> 35:10.280]  competition but Gerald expanding on your trends I want to start getting into the
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.760]  12 you know recapping some of the first we covered and get into the six or so we
[35:13.760 --> 35:16.880]  did in the other day that's why you're back here where this breaking this down
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.680]  but here's seeing in gun sales at record levels according to FBI background
[35:22.680 --> 35:28.680]  checks and it says that one million five hundred and thirty four thousand four
[35:28.680 --> 35:31.680]  hundred and thirteen but they have actuaries that that's just for the FBI
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.360]  background check so they estimate more than two million guns were sold in
[35:36.360 --> 35:40.120]  December an all-time record breaking previous records and they've done
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.640]  surveys here asking people why they bought or buying guns and they say they
[35:44.640 --> 35:48.920]  believe there's going to be a collapse and that they don't trust the government
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.440]  look folks it's another illusion when we say nobody's waking up or my neighbors
[35:54.440 --> 36:00.520]  laugh at me you may have some you know an adult brainwashed neighbor who buys
[36:00.520 --> 36:04.560]  into this but they are the minority most people just don't trust their neighbors
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.360]  so they act dumb most people okay and most police I talked to and most military
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.280]  and look at how they give most of my wrong poll that's proof right there
[36:13.280 --> 36:19.800]  politically in the campaign are totally waking up Gerald what's your view on just
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.320]  the absolute breakneck arming that the American people are doing well first of
[36:25.320 --> 36:29.360]  all as you were talking about government before and summing it up you know John
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.960]  Anthony US do I work with my colleague for over 30 years he summed it up very
[36:34.960 --> 36:42.840]  well he said government is nothing more than 24-7 extortion that's all it is so
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.280]  as you're reading the report about the people buying guns it's our third trend
[36:48.280 --> 36:55.320]  it's called climax time in 2012 many of the long simmering socio-economic and
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.920]  geopolitical trends that we have forecast and tracked will come to a climax
[37:00.920 --> 37:07.040]  some will arrive with a big bang and others less dramatically but no less
[37:07.040 --> 37:13.640]  consequently so the people in their gut they know it's collapsing and they're
[37:13.640 --> 37:20.400]  taking preparations for the worst and the worst is coming upon us well let's
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.200]  start at the beginning let's race through the 12 trends here Gerald well the
[37:24.200 --> 37:29.440]  first one of course is economic martial law I'm warning people as I've said I
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.440]  can't be having difficulty getting my money out of the bank and people are
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.280]  emailing me every day and telling me of their problems as well so again I don't
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.280]  give financial advice you know my motto think for yourself all I'm saying is
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.240]  that the whole European system is collapsing we saw that phony bond sale
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.200]  the other day the last two days in Italy here the ECB dumps 600 billion
[37:54.200 --> 38:00.040]  dollars into the bank so they could buy bonds and so this is collapsing I believe
[38:00.040 --> 38:04.760]  they're going to call an economic martial law the second trend battlefield
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.880]  America as you well know and have been well talking about and and and you're
[38:09.880 --> 38:16.280]  doing a great job with your with your writers in detailing what the National
[38:16.280 --> 38:20.760]  Defense Authorization Act is the battlefield America is being put in
[38:20.760 --> 38:26.320]  place I believe to take care of the economic martial law because there's
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.440]  going to just imagine if the nation shuts down the chaos that we're going to
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.600]  see and from the from the martial law the economic martial law and so things
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.680]  are being put in place which brings me to the third trend which is climax this
[38:41.680 --> 38:46.240]  is the year it all starts falling apart there are no green shoots there are is
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.240]  no recovery as you pointed out those phony little numbers they throw out there
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.160]  you know like like housing starts you know oh yeah they're they're they're they're
[38:56.160 --> 39:02.160]  up a little bit and but the whole thing is really going down housing prices have
[39:02.160 --> 39:08.880]  fallen worse than they have during the Great Depression what more do people
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.640]  have to know and it's not only in the US it's everywhere and those bubbles now
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.200]  that they created in other countries to try to prop it up those real estate
[39:19.200 --> 39:25.200]  bubbles they're collapsing as well the next trend you talked about it a bit
[39:25.200 --> 39:32.600]  and it's the technocrat takeover and again it's it's fascism the merger of
[39:32.600 --> 39:38.680]  state and corporate powers let's stop calling them technocrats who's in
[39:38.680 --> 39:46.600]  Italy Mario three cod Monty who's over in Greece Greece the cradle of
[39:46.600 --> 39:54.000]  democracy here's to you democracy we just put in a technocrat Papa Deimos
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.160]  where's he from oh this cat actually he did a stick with the Federal Reserve you
[39:59.160 --> 40:05.160]  mean mr. Salenti both of those guys are bankers that's right the money changes
[40:05.160 --> 40:10.920]  have taken over the temple the temple in Athens the temple in Rome and of course
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.520]  the temple in Berlin in Paris the US everywhere it's not a technocratic
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.720]  takeover it's the end of the far democracy that they've tried to tell us
[40:23.720 --> 40:31.800]  that we have and it's fascism capicia let's call it what it is Mario Monty
[40:31.800 --> 40:37.160]  you should know it's happening everywhere right stay there more
[40:37.160 --> 40:41.680]  trends straight ahead Gerald Salenti will be right back
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.640]  don't forget my friends you can go to trends research commons subscribe to
[41:01.640 --> 41:05.680]  get the trend alerts and also the quarterly journals in valuable in-depth
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.560]  analysis and information and don't forget we're gonna go ahead and run it a bit
[41:09.560 --> 41:14.640]  into the new year here all 18 of my films on DVD over 70% off the Alex
[41:14.640 --> 41:19.520]  Jones everything special 99 95 and the profit we do make goes into this news
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.400]  operation that is the real true media in the face of the globalist we also have
[41:24.400 --> 41:27.920]  a 15-day free trial we've instituted again because it was so popular for
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.320]  folks that want to see the nightly news and more prison planet dot TV or in
[41:31.320 --> 41:35.960]  FullWarsNews.com okay Gerald racing here we haven't even gotten into the trends
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.160]  yet that you didn't cover when you're on last time so please continue the next
[41:40.160 --> 41:46.680]  big one is repatriate repatriate the only way things are going to come back to
[41:46.680 --> 41:51.800]  the way this country used to be and at one time and I'm old enough to remember
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.960]  and many people are when people could have a job and live a comfortable
[41:56.960 --> 42:04.680]  middle-class life is when manufacturing and the core of engineering and
[42:04.680 --> 42:11.640]  service sectors in the most highest levels were in America with 312
[42:11.640 --> 42:18.240]  million people strong it's time we bring the manufacturing back and deal with
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.680]  each other do business with each other rather than doing it with the Chinese
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.640]  with the Indonesians with the Vietnamese and the rest so the repatriate
[42:29.640 --> 42:36.120]  repatriate trend is the other side of globalization it's already beginning to
[42:36.120 --> 42:42.440]  happen with the awakening of buying local so what we're saying is now is the
[42:42.440 --> 42:50.000]  time to start reversing this made in USA is going to be big business for
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.440]  anybody that understands it a next trend that they all tie together by the way
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.840]  you can look around the world it's not only in the United States there's talk
[43:00.840 --> 43:06.680]  of the breakup of the European Union India is splintering into many different
[43:06.680 --> 43:13.800]  parts Spain continues the the secessionist movements you're seeing it
[43:13.800 --> 43:19.000]  happening worldwide in places that you never thought it would happen before
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.840]  Brussels Belgium you go down the list we believe and you said it before when you
[43:26.840 --> 43:33.640]  were talking about the economist piece about how the techno crats can tell us
[43:33.640 --> 43:43.440]  what we should do it's big brothers you USSR Soviet Union mentality and what
[43:43.440 --> 43:51.000]  happens with it it starts to break up secessionism movement worldwide in the
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.600]  United States is going to start gaining strength in 2012 the reason why it
[43:58.600 --> 44:04.760]  died it was picking up steam under the Bush administration is because when
[44:04.760 --> 44:08.280]  people were tired with Bush remember Bush got boot off the stage on
[44:08.280 --> 44:14.360]  Ignorgeration Day is because they got condense of believing that the way in the
[44:14.360 --> 44:24.560]  words of Obama he was going to heal the nation and repair the world but he was
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.800]  bought and paid for by the very same interest that admit they're setting up
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.800]  an authoritarian system that's what's amazing about all these articles exactly
[44:33.800 --> 44:39.280]  so now go brings us to the next trend and I briefly touched upon it before
[44:39.280 --> 44:45.280]  safe havens you know I tell the story I used to go out this wonderful French
[44:45.280 --> 44:50.000]  woman and they came from a very very well-to-do Parisian family her aunt
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.400]  used to teach at Tufts University and her aunt was 14 years old when the
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.320]  Germans marched into Paris and I said to a martin I said you know you came from
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.760]  such a and I flew in family her grand her father won the Legion of Honor you
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.040]  know this is the kind of family it is I said you must have known that the
[45:10.040 --> 45:14.720]  Germans were coming they should tell me the story of how we're stay there we
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.240]  got to hear it after this one minute break Gerald Salante always riveting as
[45:18.240 --> 45:30.880]  our guest big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[45:30.880 --> 45:38.920]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[45:38.920 --> 45:45.000]  Austin Texas Alex Jones alright final segment with Gerald Salante he was
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.160]  getting into his well-to-do French girlfriend years ago and he was
[45:51.160 --> 45:54.520]  saying he was talking to I guess he was saying the mother one of the family was
[45:54.520 --> 45:58.000]  alive when the Nazis came you know didn't you know they were coming please
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.980]  continue where you left off Gerald yes I remember this is about the safe haven
[46:01.980 --> 46:06.840]  trend and and so she told me she said she remembers her mother you know this
[46:06.840 --> 46:11.400]  is my my girlfriend's grandmother walking into the Metro and the German
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.880]  soldiers grabbing her and putting her to one side and grabbing the next person
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.960]  and putting into the other and they had 15 people and they mowed down the 15
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.880]  people on the right and her mother survived and that was because the
[46:26.880 --> 46:31.920]  resistance killed a German soldier the night before for every one person that
[46:31.920 --> 46:37.040]  the resistance were killing the Germans were killing 15 I said why didn't you
[46:37.040 --> 46:43.200]  leave you must have known they were coming and she said to me Gerald the
[46:43.200 --> 46:49.520]  people that thought they had too much to leave behind stayed behind so when we
[46:49.520 --> 46:55.600]  talk about safe havens if this country continues to go in the direction that
[46:55.600 --> 47:02.880]  it's going in it may not be safe to live here anymore what is worth more your
[47:02.880 --> 47:09.040]  financial and material possession or your life or your freedom or your life so
[47:09.040 --> 47:15.480]  that's the other trend so we listed what we believe to be the number of good
[47:15.480 --> 47:20.160]  solid safe haven opportunity well so you're fine you're actually now saying
[47:20.160 --> 47:25.120]  the US people may need to evacuate even though other places are bad and you're
[47:25.120 --> 47:28.240]  saying well what have you back in the new year to list some of the places you're
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.040]  saying are safe but they're in your big report but but or safer what are a few
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.760]  of them well one of them is Norway that's a that's a pretty solid one they
[47:37.760 --> 47:43.840]  still have their own currency and they very rich and they have the people are
[47:43.840 --> 47:49.520]  quite free in a lot of ways that's pretty high on the list the other one you
[47:49.520 --> 47:53.880]  know is that you know people ask us about South America it could go either way
[47:53.880 --> 47:59.640]  but for the time being an easy place to get into and again one of the
[47:59.640 --> 48:03.480]  recommendations that we make is people right away they're ready to buy
[48:03.480 --> 48:09.640]  something don't buy anything don't know that go there check the place out
[48:09.640 --> 48:16.600]  or a guy or a guy is pretty solid right now it's pretty easy to get into and it
[48:16.600 --> 48:22.800]  has a lot of wealth flowing into it from Brazil and from Argentina so those are
[48:22.800 --> 48:28.320]  just two of the several that we list the next one of course is and you're
[48:28.320 --> 48:34.520]  well familiar with this big brother internet this could be a year when it
[48:34.520 --> 48:40.440]  determines whether or not we will truly ever have any kind of internet freedom
[48:40.440 --> 48:45.680]  because just like they passed the National Defense Authorization Act you
[48:45.680 --> 48:50.760]  know the new acts that are coming into place that may close down internet
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.360]  freedom and again these trends can be reversed just as I mentioned the
[48:56.360 --> 49:03.480]  repatriate repatriate trend we don't have to become a nation and continue to
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.880]  sink lower yeah into people that are clerks and cashiers so we have the will
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.120]  to change participating in the big mega box stores stop participating in new
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.320]  world order establishment systems wake up warn others we can turn it around yes
[49:21.320 --> 49:27.360]  absolutely I mean who's to say that these that these people as you call them and
[49:27.360 --> 49:33.160]  I call me psychopaths and sociopaths should be telling us what to do and that's
[49:33.160 --> 49:39.560]  part of the next one by the way going out in style you go back to the 1930 let
[49:39.560 --> 49:42.040]  me stop you're right there here's the problem I've got a guest coming up I
[49:42.040 --> 49:45.800]  know you've got to go but last time we didn't get to all of these we've got to
[49:45.800 --> 49:48.300]  go to break you do four or five minutes on the other side just to finish the
[49:48.300 --> 49:53.040]  trends sure can okay guys let Lindsay Williams apologize tell him we're just
[49:53.040 --> 49:56.360]  gonna call him in five six minutes when I come back with Gerald having kind of
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.240]  run back into these others real fast we haven't gotten to of course it's all
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.800]  broken down to tail at trends research comm and we have a lot of similar
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.520]  analysis but his is more in depth on each particular topic at info wars comm
[50:08.520 --> 50:12.040]  and prison planet dot TV so we'll be right back after this quick break but
[50:12.040 --> 50:16.480]  this is reality I mean we've got really sick criminals running things we've got
[50:16.480 --> 50:23.320]  to learn to say no no this is communications radio network proudly
[50:23.320 --> 50:29.800]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind well
[50:29.800 --> 50:35.160]  we're finding out who's who in the so-called conservative and libertarian
[50:35.160 --> 50:40.560]  movement people are coming out of the woodwork attacking Ron Paul right now
[50:40.560 --> 50:44.200]  and I've got a Mitt Romney article in fact you guys get it off the printer for
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.200]  me I forgot to get it in here now the Washington Post where they say it's
[50:48.200 --> 50:54.640]  Mitt Romney's job now there it is to derail Ron Paul Romney cast Ron Paul as
[50:54.640 --> 50:59.040]  a fringe candidate says he's working hard to derail the Texas congressman well
[50:59.040 --> 51:02.520]  I thought nobody liked him I thought he couldn't win I thought he was a fringe
[51:02.520 --> 51:08.120]  candidate but you've got to work hard to derail him because you're discredited
[51:08.120 --> 51:14.160]  you're for abortion open borders carbon taxes and wrote Obamacare this is
[51:14.160 --> 51:19.560]  all on record and you're just like Duke Enrich look he's in fifth place now Ron
[51:19.560 --> 51:24.800]  Paul is numero no he's rising in all the states he's either in first second or
[51:24.800 --> 51:31.720]  third place so that mind control mantra that he couldn't win is now failing I
[51:31.720 --> 51:34.920]  wanted to get Gerald Solente take on that briefly and then hit the four or five
[51:34.920 --> 51:38.780]  other trends he didn't get to out of his 12 trends again Gerald Solente top
[51:38.780 --> 51:42.160]  trans forecasters are guests and for the rest of the hour Lindsay Williams who's
[51:42.160 --> 51:47.120]  just always has amazing information and and we'll do part two of an interview we
[51:47.120 --> 51:50.000]  started earlier in the week and we'll open the phones up again for your
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.320]  questions for Lindsay Williams because they were really excellent questions and
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.600]  I wanted to get to more of those but briefly does he isn't Ron Paul's rise
[51:57.600 --> 52:01.360]  another illustration of people really getting fed up and the fact that so
[52:01.360 --> 52:06.240]  called MSM the dinosaur prostitutes aren't in control anymore and are
[52:06.240 --> 52:09.960]  getting more and more desperate absolutely pick up the toilet paper of
[52:09.960 --> 52:15.320]  record in New York Times I believe it was December 5th 19th front page story
[52:15.320 --> 52:22.000]  Mittens Romney all over the place on on Christmas Day front page Mittens Romney
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.680]  all over the place on Wednesday front page Mittens Romney all over the place
[52:27.680 --> 52:34.760]  open it up yesterday Mittens all over the place only time they talk about Ron
[52:34.760 --> 52:41.000]  Paul is in a negative light listen to what fat boy Gingrich said about people
[52:41.000 --> 52:48.760]  like myself that support Ryan Ron Paul no decent American would support his
[52:48.760 --> 52:56.080]  policy call me tell me I'm not a decent American neuter we could have it out man
[52:56.080 --> 53:01.840]  to man and look at that little weenie up there over in New Hampshire the guy who
[53:01.840 --> 53:07.440]  runs that read that newspaper the the Herald in a new man she called Ron Paul
[53:07.440 --> 53:14.840]  dangerous yeah yeah no and anybody that supports them we're lunatic fringe let
[53:14.840 --> 53:19.280]  that little weenie come and call me a lunatic friend hold on Gerald that's
[53:19.280 --> 53:23.560]  exactly you're right that's what Mitt Romney saying he's saying the front

[53:41.680 --> 53:47.960]  American wouldn't support Ron Paul who ordained this fat boy the
[53:47.960 --> 53:53.960]  arbiter of whose decent this guy that's screwing around as his wife's dying in
[53:53.960 --> 54:01.200]  the hospital one after another and he's saying we're indecent and again this

[54:05.680 --> 54:12.280]  newspaper out there says only the lunatic fringe supports Ron Paul who are
[54:12.280 --> 54:17.800]  these people and the toilet paper of record the same thing read their
[54:17.800 --> 54:24.680]  editorials you know what they call Ron Paul's ideas claptrap ideas oh listen

[54:28.920 --> 54:34.480]  a new talking point he Ron Paul may still win Iowa because his people are
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.160]  cult members and won't listen to us and our reasoning with them no people know
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.960]  you're a pack of scumbags bought and paid for by the megabanks that gutted and
[54:43.960 --> 54:49.600]  destroyed this country we know you're a bunch of Tory redcoat supporters punks
[54:49.600 --> 54:53.800]  and if Ron Paul doesn't want win this time it doesn't matter our power is
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.920]  rising the people don't buy your lies anymore scum that's right which brings
[54:59.920 --> 55:06.400]  us to the other trend if Ron Paul doesn't make it but understand what you
[55:06.400 --> 55:11.400]  got out there folks the Gambino's and the Bananos the Republicans and the
[55:11.400 --> 55:17.320]  Democrats direct democracy now.org we have to take the power put it back
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.080]  into the hands of the people and all those trolls out there that say oh then

[55:34.880 --> 55:40.800]  again they all tie together going out in style people need to rebuild their
[55:40.800 --> 55:46.520]  self-respect you look at the 30s the worst oppression up until now look at
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.760]  the stylus nation had look what we were building look at the way people were

[56:06.560 --> 56:12.840]  we're saying is step up to style because it builds self-respect when you have
[56:12.840 --> 56:21.480]  self-respect you don't take crap from neuter Gingrich Mittens Romney or reg owner

[58:43.800 --> 58:49.080]  listen to the buzzwords that the elite have given me within the past two weeks
[58:49.080 --> 58:56.720]  time if you do you will be able to spare yourself major heartache in 2012 there
[58:56.720 --> 59:02.080]  is no question whatsoever that 2012 will be the most dawdling and unusual and
[59:02.080 --> 59:08.080]  eventful year in 2000 years I said that three months ago when we first came out
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.920]  with 2012 the beginning of the end now since I was given this information just
[59:12.920 --> 59:18.280]  days ago about the currency devaluation I want to give you the buzzwords
[59:18.280 --> 59:23.960]  right from Mr. Bernanke's speech then I'd like to go into the five points he
[59:23.960 --> 59:29.080]  said I'll do all this if I can between now and the end of this half hour and
[59:29.080 --> 59:34.840]  then please folks I want to tell you what to do about this you see there are
[59:34.840 --> 59:41.520]  elite who are old the people I knew 35 years ago when I was invited to be the
[59:41.520 --> 59:45.800]  chaplain to the elite of the world and lived with these people set across the
[59:45.800 --> 59:49.880]  dinner table with them lived in the same dorms with them for three years have
[59:49.880 --> 59:54.520]  kept in touch with them over these years they're in their 70s and 80s now and
[59:54.520 --> 59:59.560]  old men are talking because they've got a conscience regardless of who they are
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.960]  when they face their maker they know they're going to face it all right here
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:10.600]  we go just within a matter of days ago the elite is basically said to me go to
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.480]  a certain place chaplain and you will know what is about to happen that first
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.360]  fall I want to punctuate this by saying they did not give me a date I didn't
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:25.800]  say what is going to happen in January or February it is going to happen mark my
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.600]  words it's already been said I want to give you that buzzwords please take this
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.920]  down I hope you have pencils and paper again today because I'm going to give
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.960]  you facts that you can go on the internet and find them for yourself they
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:47.960]  said go to November the 21st 2002 look at the remarks of then governor Ben
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.520]  Bernacki he today is chairman of the Federal Reserve back then he was a
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.040]  governor of the Federal Reserve one of many and they said look at the speech
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.280]  that he gave at the National Economics Club in Washington DC on November the
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:09.320]  21st 2002 and you will know what is going to take place and they didn't say
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:15.840]  2012 but I think I can surmise for reading between the lines that this is
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.640]  going to happen and it's not going to be too long off and you must make
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.440]  preparation their buzzwords here they are first of all there is going to be a
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.880]  currency devaluation you can depend on it as much as you can depend on the sun
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.360]  coming up this morning and the moon being up tonight it is going to happen
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.200]  what does a currency devaluation mean all right first of all let me give you
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.960]  this statement you need to get this one first then I'll give you that buzzwords
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:51.280]  whenever a nation finds itself in an insurmountable physical debt hole there
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.520]  are essentially two ways to fix the problem number one and on one hand they
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.520]  can cut back on expenditures secondly raise taxes or they can do the other the
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.760]  alternative to cutting back on expenditures or raising taxes is they
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.280]  can devalue their currency now we know that the super committee in Washington
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.840]  did nothing to cut back on expenditures in fact it was a utter joke watching a
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.800]  play up there like children raise taxes they can't do it the rich nobody else
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.520]  they can't seem to raise taxes on anybody but they want to talk about cutting
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.360]  them now since those two things have not been done and will not be done and they
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.680]  never intended for those things to be done because behind closed doors they
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.000]  had planned a currency devaluation in the first place and they knew none of
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.640]  those things who want to take place they paid off all of Washington DC with
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.600]  maybe the exception of Ron Paul on the other hand what can they do devalue the
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.360]  currency let me read it to you right from Ben Bernanke's own words in his
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.160]  speech it is worth noting that there have been times when exchange rate policy
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.960]  has been effective weapon a striking example from the US history is
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:12.000]  Franklin Roosevelt's 40 folks are you hearing the buzzwords he used the word
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.520]  first of all exchange there is going to be a devaluation he said secondly they
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.320]  give some out of the devaluation folks you've got to listen to this a striking
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.080]  example from US history is Franklin Roosevelt's 40% devaluation of the
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:38.400]  dollar against gold in 1933 and 34 that one Senate is one of the okay the buzzwords
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.760]  first of all there's going to be a devaluation of the currency 40% let's
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:48.360]  just get to it you've got say $10,000 in the bank and it's Friday afternoon and
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.720]  you've been given no word whatsoever is going to happen on Monday well I
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.560]  guarantee you you will not know in advance what's going to happen it's
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:01.000]  going to take place more than likely over a long holiday or a weekend and when
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.720]  you wake up on Monday morning and get ready to go and see how much money you've
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.680]  got in your bank account in your checking account in your business account
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.760]  whatever it may be it is going to be cut by 40% that means if you had $10,000 in
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.240]  that account on Friday you will have somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,000
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.240]  only in that account on Monday morning the currency will be devalued at 40%
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.840]  now let me show you how they're going to do it he used the example of Franklin
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.280]  Dell and Roosevelt in 1933 and 34 what did Franklin Roosevelt do in 33 and 4
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.600]  remember these people tell you something please go and listen to the
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:47.320]  folks I beg of you they give me these things I think because they're old men
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.840]  and they want to clear their conscience he said in 1933-44 what did Franklin
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.040]  Dell and Roosevelt do he said bring in to the years going back in those days a
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.920]  man would carry around a $20 gold piece in his pocket which today you'll pay
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.880]  $14,500 for and they used it to buy groceries and other things and he said
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.400]  bring in your $20 gold pieces it is your duty as an American to help build up
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.160]  the treasure of the United States of America go back and look and see what
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.720]  Franklin Roosevelt did he said bring in your $20 gold pieces I will give you a
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.920]  piece of paper representing $20 it was a gold certificate you don't have them
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.080]  today you've got Federal Reserve notes today he actually gave them gold
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.960]  certificates and said you can take it back to the bank and get $20 the
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.280]  scoundrel the liar he knew it had already been planned behind closed doors
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.160]  I've been told this that he knew that within a few months time he was going
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:53.400]  to take the price of gold from $20 an ounce to $35 look in the history go
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.520]  prove this for yourself you don't have to take my word for it no the elitist
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.160]  that have just talked to me recently you're going to face it soon you better
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:06.640]  get ready for it he took it from $20 a few months later without any wanting
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:13.280]  nothing was said automatically he said we're going to $35 for gold figure it
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:20.320]  from 20 to 35 is 40% what did he do the gold pieces that they had turned in for
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.240]  $20 they could go back to the bank and get $20 for it they could not get 35 and
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.440]  when they went back to say you scoundrel you have written me off for 40% he
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:36.480]  devalued the currency this time they'll merely take the Federal Reserve note and
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.240]  where it's worth a certain amount on Friday afternoon it'll be worth another
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.600]  amount on Monday morning and you're going to have a 40% devaluation it is
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.120]  coming now what can you do about it there's really only one thing and Mr.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.120]  Fromm told me this many years ago and I didn't understand what he was saying he
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.960]  said to me one day he said chaplain if it's written on a piece of paper it's
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.280]  worth the paper it's written on Alex you've heard me say that over your show
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.600]  over and over and over I did not know what Mr. Fromm was saying to me at the
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:13.000]  time and he basically was saying chaplain if it is not tangible it's no
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.320]  good you realize that piece of paper has got to be turned into something if you
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:24.200]  don't get out of paper IRAs 401ks your retirement funds you can't depend on
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.560]  Social Security you know the amount that you'll be getting will be worth 40%
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.640]  less the next morning after the devaluation and you think that you
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.200]  can live on it you're having trouble living on it now just wait until then
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:43.200]  you've got to get out of paper before the devaluation takes place what do you
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.080]  do it's very simple as simple as one two three do you realize that the next
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:54.000]  morning after the currency devaluation that gold is going to be worth 40% more
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.520]  than it was the day that you bought it now I know I do not sell gold until you
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.920]  couldn't buy an ounce from me if you tried Alex can tell you where to go for
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.280]  that GCN can tell you where to go all I'm telling you is the facts that have
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:13.280]  been given to me you must get out of paper of every kind immediately because
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.920]  it is going to be worth 40% less but the gold is going to go up 40% I
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.280]  guarantee you with an amount of up days after the devaluation okay Lindsey
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.840]  Lindsey let me just give the number guys we're gonna take calls when come back and
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.880]  I skipped that last network break 800 259 92 31 to get people's take on this
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:37.640]  now Gerald Salento who I respect and his analysis has been spot on it has made
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.220]  the point I know you've made the point that we have gotten reprieves the elite
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:47.000]  has backed off a few times and that's actually come out from Jim Tucker sources
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.680]  mirroring what you'd already reported and that they are concerned and we had
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.280]  over 2 million guns sold so far in the month of December an all-time record
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:07.200]  500 plus thousand of those CNN reports were sold just in the six days before
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.760]  Christmas and so this and there was a survey every time I know about this I
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.240]  was listening to Fox News radio driving in this morning they were reporting on
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.160]  a survey I pulled up the CNN report on it but they were saying in the survey
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.320]  people said because they're worried about civil unrest and that they don't
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:29.040]  trust the government I mean this is mainstream news now this is being
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.080]  reported I mean I heard it on 590 a.m. I went and pulled it up here CNN that's
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.000]  got to shake up the elite because I mean I can't tell you how many veterans I
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  know some of them are young some of them are old and they're not looking for
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.520]  trouble but they're not going to be pushed around like this is Russia or
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.240]  something I mean I don't okay they've trained the police military to take on
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.160]  quote veterans and conservatives and libertarians and we've gotten the
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:59.680]  manuals on that this isn't gonna fly there's something bottom line from your
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.200]  research there are ways to turn this around or are we going into a zone
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.720]  where nothing's gonna turn it around well they're positively always to turn
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.680]  around and I've expressed this to you over the past many years I've been on
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.960]  your show Alex I told you that when I live with these people I've said it to
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.160]  audience over and over when I lived with these the elite for three years time I
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.440]  mean I sat across the dinner table from living the dorms with them talk to them
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.320]  one-on-one they were not in my church I was on their oil field and there's only
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.080]  one thing on the face of this earth that the elite are scared off that this
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:33.160]  doesn't come from what you hear or read about in the book I lived it the only
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.480]  one thing that the elite is scared off they are scared to death of the masses
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.640]  waking up that is the only thing bothers them money doesn't bother them they have
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.520]  the control of it Congress they could care less they control them the president
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.160]  he's under that total control and that's why they spend all day ridiculing
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.640]  people that say common sense things and that's why it looks so silly now as they
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.600]  defend all this evil because they're desperately trying to keep people dumb
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.960]  down and now people don't trust them but the final domino pastor and for my
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.840]  research is people still think we're the minority Lindsey I'm out there people
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.560]  recognize me so I get interaction that folks regular folks don't get people are
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.680]  awake my friend they are awake and they're waking up faster every day and
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.560]  their masses waking up out there and the dead come on folks you you've got to
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.280]  immediately you can't wait till tomorrow morning to make preparation the day
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.000]  after the currency change over you are going to see every gun store in America
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.960]  wiped out in 24 hours time you know just last hour I realized over the years
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.720]  I've expended most my ammo I am gonna go tomorrow I shouldn't even say this on
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.320]  air because I read the record cities Austin for gun sales I'm gonna go buy a
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.800]  mass load of ammo myself tomorrow Wow all right Lindsey stay there it's crazy I
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.080]  hope all this doesn't happen but it's it's going from a possibility to a
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.720]  probability now the wake-up may be big enough to back off the system but they've
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.440]  done a lot of bold stuff I'm not sure and they want to start this war with Iran
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.760]  it'll be a good political diversion forum we'll be right back with your calls
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:15.720]  when the Williams our guest tell me who's that right and genre a lady tell me
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:23.200]  who's that right in genre a lady tell me who's that right in genre a ladyipping
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:31.040]  wrote the book of the seven sea who's that right in genre later tell me who's
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.040]  Who's that writing, John the Revelator?
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.040]  Well, who's that writing, John the Revelator?
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.040]  Wrote the book of the Seven Seas.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.040]  You know, God walked down in the cool of the day,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.040]  called Adam by his name,
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:57.040]  and he refused to answer because he's naked and ashamed.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.040]  Who's that writing, John the Revelator?
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.040]  Who's that writing, John the Revelator?
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.040]  Who's that writing, John the Revelator?
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  Well, there's Sunhouse, that's some old-time blues for you there.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.040]  Wrote the book of the Seven Seas.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040]  You know, God walked down in the cool of the day,
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040]  certainly a crazy time to be alive.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040]  There's no doubt evil is rising,
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.040]  but for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040]  Alright, Lindsey Williams is here,
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.040]  and he is here to take your calls.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.040]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.040]  I'm doing a fourth hour today.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.040]  The next hour, we'll take calls for your financial questions,
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.040]  geopolitical questions for myself, or Bob Chapman.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.040]  As we got Lindsey on a little bit late, I skipped a break,
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.040]  and we're going to have him five minutes to the next hour,
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040]  then Bob Chapman will join us.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.040]  And I'm doing a fourth hour today with Max Kaiser,
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.040]  and we've got Gary Franchi, who says an amazing TV ad running,
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.040]  exposing those of us that know Ron Paul already know.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.040]  He's obsessed with individualism and not religion or color or any of that.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.040]  And that's why he's against all these wars
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.040]  and against mandatory drug sentencing and the rest of it.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.040]  And that's why the system hates him.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  So we're going to be talking to Franchi coming up
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.040]  and playing that ad here as well.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.040]  But Lindsey Williams is our guest right now.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.040]  Lindsey, let's go to the phone calls here.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.040]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.040]  Frank, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040]  Yeah, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.040]  I live in a city comparable to Austin, Texas, there,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  here in North Carolina.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.040]  And I am noticing an increase like, you know,
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.040]  and Ron Paul supporters being outspoken
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.040]  and calling into radio shows.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.040]  And it's really, it's encouraging to see
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.040]  that he's starting to get subtraction.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040]  Oh, we're getting reports all over the country
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.040]  of people out with signs on the streets.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.040]  I mean, look, the system knows he's the front runner
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.040]  and they're scared.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.040]  And that's why I know I'm interrupting you
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.040]  to forget your question.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  But first they said hackers were going to attack.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.040]  And then I said, watch, they'll make the counting secret.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.040]  And now the RNC is taking it to tally it
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040]  at a secret location and it's making the tallying
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.040]  at the local area secret.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.040]  So there's no doubt they're telling you
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.040]  Ron V's down the lead so they can say
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040]  Ron Paul's seventh place or something.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.040]  I mean, they'll do third place or something.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.040]  They're getting ready to do what they do as criminals.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040]  And these are criminals.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.040]  These are criminals that lie about WMDs, you name it,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040]  that have the federal government sticking their hands down
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.040]  your wife's pants to train you, you're a slave.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040]  They are hardcore criminals.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040]  I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.040]  Yeah, but other than, you know, some outspokenness,
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.040]  some activism on the, you know, the local 50,000 watt station,
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.040]  Alex, I'm not seeing any sign of any awakening
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.040]  at all around here.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.040]  I mean, the people are complete zombies.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.040]  They have no clue what's going on.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  As far as I can see, now maybe they're just
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.040]  being quiet about it.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.040]  Well, look, let me explain this to you.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.040]  Let me explain this to you.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.040]  I am very well known now.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.040]  I'm in some well-known movies.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040]  Never tried to be in movies.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.040]  Rick Glickler, nice guy, called up, put me in a few movies.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040]  I have been all over national TV.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040]  I have millions of radio listeners.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.040]  Our YouTube channels have over 300 million views.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.040]  So hundreds of millions of people worldwide know who I am.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.040]  So I get to have experiences other people don't
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.040]  because people recognize me.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.040]  They know me.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  So they'll talk to me and I can go out on the street now
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040]  and every third person stops and shakes my hand.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.040]  So there are a lot of people awake.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.040]  There are also a lot of people who don't feel like
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.040]  they have any power and are just thinking about
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.040]  their car payment and getting home and, you know,
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.040]  they're hungry and their bosses mean to them.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.040]  But there's always people who don't count
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.040]  and who are on the sidelines because they don't want to count
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.040]  or don't think they count.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040]  But it was 5% won the war against the British.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.040]  We got way more than 5%.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.040]  Lindsey Williams, what's your take on this?
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.040]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.040]  In fact, you remember back last May, I came on your show
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.040]  and I said, price of gasoline or price of crude oil
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040]  is going to $150 a barrel.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.040]  You remember I came back later and said, uh-uh, the elite.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.040]  In fact, I told them the elite is on the phone.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  I said, you really hurt my credibility.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040]  You told me it was going to $150 a barrel.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.040]  Now you're telling me that you're going to hold off
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.040]  for the rest of the summer.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.040]  I said, what's going on?
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.040]  Well, when I got down to the base of it, I found out
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.040]  they had to back off. They didn't have any choice.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.040]  You fill up that SUV for $200 a barrel.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.040]  People begin to wake up.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.040]  And as a result, they backed off on the price for a while
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.040]  just to keep you out of the loop.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.040]  They don't want you to know what's going on.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.040]  They don't want you to get excited.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.040]  They want to do everything in their power.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.040]  And then I came back on and I said, you're going to keep
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.040]  the price of gasoline right about where it is
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.040]  for the next number of months
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.040]  because the elite had to back off too many of you
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.040]  were waking up. You're right, Alex.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040]  They are waking up in mass out there.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040]  But this is going to shake them to the core
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.040]  when you have the devaluation.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.040]  I'm quite sure.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.040]  Yes, sir. And again, the caller, you know,
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.040]  chin up, my friend, but I want to give you my word.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.040]  I don't come on the air
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.040]  and give you pepper alleys
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.040]  and tell you that people are waking up
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.040]  to make you feel good.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040]  This is not campfire stories, okay?
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040]  And if you heard my show 10 years ago,
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040]  you didn't hear me talking about a big wake-up.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.040]  I was, you know, saying, my gosh,
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.040]  people are going to come a wake-up.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.040]  And just as an individual,
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.040]  dedicating myself to truth and liberty,
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.040]  I have reached thousands of times the people
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.040]  I ever imagined I would.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.040]  I just couldn't sit by and watch this happening.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.040]  So I thought, well, I'll start fighting
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.040]  and there's others out there fighting.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.040]  And so,
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.040]  look, I don't want to get into this again,
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.040]  but 20 years ago, Ron Paul couldn't get a single cosponsor
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040]  to audit the Fed. It passed the House this year.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.040]  They killed it in the Senate.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040]  But we'll do even better.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.040]  Four years ago, Ron Paul didn't get a fraction of the support.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.040]  Look where he is now. Too bad he's going to be probably
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040]  a little too old next, go around if he doesn't win this time.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.040]  But the ideas are there.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040]  I've talked to Jim Tucker. I've talked to Esplan,
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.040]  people that do have Bilderberg Group sources
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.040]  that have proven stunningly accurate
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  just as Williams has.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.040]  And I mean, I was told, yeah, Obama's going to be here
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040]  by Tucker. And then two hours later,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.040]  here comes the motorcade into the Virginia Hotel
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040]  while the mainstream media says nobody knows
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040]  where Obama and Hillary went.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.040]  They shook the media and there they are.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.040]  I mean, that's how powerful Tucker's sources are.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.040]  And too bad he's getting really old.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.040]  But the point is,
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.040]  is that all of this is happening,
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.040]  all of this is going on.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.040]  And in those meetings,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.040]  and I'm talking about Bilderberg in 2006,
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.040]  they were talking about Ron Paul in the official meeting.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040]  And they were talking about him even more
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.040]  this year in Switzerland.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040]  And yep, yes, who else they talk about?
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040]  Lindsey, they talk about this radio show.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040]  I've not just been told that from you.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  I've been told that by others.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040]  I mean, they are scared and they better be.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040]  They're a bunch of criminals, Lindsey.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.040]  Well, Alex, not only do they know about your radio show,
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.040]  I told you this back about a year ago.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.040]  I said, Alex, you are in that crosshairs
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.040]  because some of them had said something to me.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040]  And then I didn't say it to you,
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040]  but I'll say it to you now.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.040]  I talked to your producer a while back off the air
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.040]  when he asked me to be on one of your shows.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.040]  And I said, they know Alex Jones' personal home phone number.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.040]  And he said, where in the world do you get that?
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.040]  I said, from them.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.040]  And they know exactly what you're doing, Alex.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.040]  And they're scared to death
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  because you are one of the greatest voices out there.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.040]  GCN radio is blasting it everywhere.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040]  People are waking up by the millions.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.040]  Last summer we took a trip from here to Oregon
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.040]  and back, and I'd go to one place,
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.040]  and I didn't even want to be known.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.040]  I went to a convention someplace,
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.040]  and I didn't even want to be known.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.040]  I said, let me sit in the back.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.040]  I don't even want to be up on the platform.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.040]  It wasn't 24 hours before they had a crowd of people
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040]  that wanted to hear what I had to say.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.040]  Alex, you're right. They're waking up.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.040]  They know you're out there.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.040]  But that's why they haven't killed us yet
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.040]  because there's Ron Paul, there's Lindsey Williams,
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.040]  there's Bob Chapman,
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.040]  there's thousands of prominent people now.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.040]  A lot of people out there get into this patriot stuff
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.040]  for some of the right reasons,
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.040]  but they get competitive and want to be big stars.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.040]  Folks, being big in this
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.040]  means you are in the crosshairs walking point.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040]  I am so happy
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]  when other people are prominent.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.040]  So happy when people get more attention than I do.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.040]  I wish Glenn Beck was totally for real.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.040]  He has gone the right direction in many ways
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.040]  because I don't have a death wish.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040]  And the only reason they haven't killed us,
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.040]  they would 30, 40 years ago.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.040]  They killed a lot of people.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040]  It's because back then they were trying to keep it down.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.040]  They failed keeping this down.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.040]  Now if they kill us, it highlights,
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.040]  it underlines everything we've said.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.040]  But it doesn't mean that we're still not in danger.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.040]  It is your prayers.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.040]  Folks, remember, God is real
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.040]  and is in control.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.040]  Lindsey, what's your take on why we're still alive?
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040]  You're exactly right, but I'm going to go a step further.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040]  Why have these elitists
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.040]  just within the past few months time
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.040]  started giving me more outstanding information
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.040]  than they ever gave me
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.040]  when Ken Fromm was alive.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.040]  There's a reason why.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040]  There are a few of these people
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.040]  who are old and decrepit in their 70s
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040]  and 80s who themselves are concerned.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.040]  And when I talk to them on the phone
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.040]  and when I get emails from them,
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.040]  Alex, I am amazed
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.040]  there are some of the retired elitists today
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.040]  that are in some ways
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040]  thinking like you.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.040]  And I think to the point that they say,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.040]  as Ken Fromm said to me a few years ago,
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.040]  Lindsey, I'm too old to care. Just go ahead and give them everything.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.040]  But you have got to know
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.040]  what you're facing in 2012.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.040]  Exactly. Let me stop you there.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.040]  I want to go back to calls. This is so powerful, Lindsey.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.040]  Look,
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040]  being in the elite from my historical research
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040]  is like a prison.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.040]  A lot of these people, that's what Dr. Lebo,
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040]  who I know has treated some heads of state,
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.040]  one head of state told her,
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040]  I don't like this New World Order.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.040]  I don't like the population reduction.
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.040]  I don't like what we're doing, but I can't get out of it.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.040]  It's like the mafia or the CIA
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.040]  give the whistleblowers and the insiders
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.040]  who aren't
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.040]  pure evil a chance to repent.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.040]  And when we see that historically,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.040]  we see it in the Bible.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.040]  We're powerful wicked people who aren't totally wicked.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.040]  Repent. We see it in pop culture.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.040]  Darth Vader repents.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.040]  And again, people are like, oh, now you're using fiction.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.040]  The point is, that's a pop culture example.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.040]  There are many people
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040]  that now as this New World Order gets closer and closer,
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.040]  a lot of the elitists
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.040]  are compartmentalized themselves.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.040]  They were told this world government
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.040]  was to help people.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.040]  Now they know it's not Lindsay.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.040]  Once they get to the age
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.040]  of the elitists that I knew back 35 years ago,
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040]  these people themselves
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.040]  are very concerned.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.040]  And you're right, Alex, they are stepping out
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.040]  and themselves saying things
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.040]  and then they'll turn around and
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.040]  okay, let me put to this.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.040]  I can't go too far on the air.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.040]  Please forgive me of certain things I can't say.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.040]  But they'll turn around and say, Lindsay,
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.040]  go here and look for this.
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.040]  And Lindsay, Kaplan, go over there and look
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.040]  and you'll find the answer to this.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.040]  And then they'll have somebody else to call me on the phone
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.040]  like they did the other day. Somebody sent me an email
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.040]  that they had told them, I think they told them,
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.040]  at least to send it to me.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.040]  And whenever I got the information,
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040]  exactly where it came from,
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.040]  they didn't want it to come from their computer.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.040]  Alex, these people themselves,
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.040]  the older ones who are from
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.040]  the generation, time or two back,
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.040]  they're getting concerned themselves
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040]  and they've told me everything
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.040]  that is going to happen in 2012
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.040]  and we put it in this
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.040]  new DVD series, 2012
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.040]  the beginning of the end
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.040]  and you've got to know what to do.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.040]  You don't have to worry about
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.040]  the currency devaluation
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.040]  if you have taken the call.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.040]  No, you're right. In fact, people can find that
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.040]  at ProposyClub.com. Let's go back to the calls
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.040]  before you leave. I'm going to dig out that number.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.040]  We're going to give it out, Lindsay. Let's go to,
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.040]  because I'm hogging all the time here saying
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.040]  Iron Head in Washington.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.040]  Hello there again. I don't believe it twice
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.040]  in one month. I feel like this is better
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.040]  than 72 Virgins.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.040]  Anyway, a quick
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040]  spiritual comment.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040]  Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  and the sea, for the beast has been cast down
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.040]  knowing he has, but a short
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.040]  time. I think both of you guys
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.040]  will agree that this is a spiritual battle
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.040]  and that's why so many around us refuse
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.040]  to wake up because they don't have the spiritual
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.040]  determination. Now, that's it. The devil sends
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.040]  the beast with wrath because he knows
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.040]  the time is short and I'd sit in Sunday school
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.040]  and, you know, read that when I was a kid
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.040]  and wouldn't really pay attention to it, but now I study
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  these evil people, whether you believe in God
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.040]  or not, they run around ravinously
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.040]  killing, stealing, and destroying
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.040]  because that's their nature.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.040]  People go, well, why does a serial killer do this?
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.040]  Because they like it.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.040]  They're compelled to do it. Lindsay
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.040]  comments on what Iron Head said.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040]  The devil is on the rampage. You're exactly
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.040]  right. You hit the nail on the head.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  He knows his time is short and he's
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.040]  taking advantage of everything he can do with
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.040]  the new world order,
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040]  new young elitist
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.040]  and the old ones, Alex,
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.040]  as I've expressed before, the ones
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.040]  giving me information now, are
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.040]  becoming very concerned even
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.040]  themselves. You're just exactly right. Satan's
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.040]  on the rampage. I mean, look at the
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.040]  bioweapons. Look at all the stuff they've developed.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.040]  They're not in control of all of
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.040]  this. Why would they develop the super
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.040]  weapons they've created? Because there's
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040]  a dark force behind it that wants to
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.040]  blow this planet up, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040]  because that entity hates God's
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.040]  creation. You love the creation?
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.040]  That's just a manifestation of
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.040]  the Creator. I'm not going to start
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.040]  preaching here. This is real. Iron Head,
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  anything else? Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.040]  What I really wanted to get to, and this is a crux of the matter,
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.040]  most people, I've never heard
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.040]  of any of your great associates such as people I know
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.040]  like Bob Chapman or anybody talk about
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.040]  position limits. Most people who
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.040]  own gold and silver do not
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.040]  understand that gold and tax, chase,
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.040]  aka all of them, do not have position
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]  limits. As long as they have
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.040]  computers, they can run the trade any way they
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.040]  want. No, that's how they keep the price down,
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.040]  but now physical really costs more
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.040]  than what the paper says. So
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.040]  again, it's cooked.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.040]  It's cooked.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.040]  What was your final point on that?
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.040]  Okay, let me finish
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.040]  this point. What has to be understood
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.040]  by people owning gold and silver? They can run
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.040]  the price of gold and silver down to zero
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.040]  and they're going to do that without a doubt.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.040]  They're going to run it to zero. Most people
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.040]  who do not understand the markets have never traded
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.040]  contracts like I have for 20 years. They
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.040]  do not understand that you can take this thing to zero.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040]  They will sell into a failing market
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.040]  and that's why the concept of free gold
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:30.040]  has to be understood by everybody on this
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.040]  planet and that's what I want Lindsay to address
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.040]  with next time or anytime he talks
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.040]  to Mr. L.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.040]  We have to get everybody to understand that do
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040]  not sell into a failing market because they can
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.040]  drive it to zero and then the weak hands
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.040]  will not know what's going on.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.040]  Well no, they could manipulate a really big
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.040]  drop, but when they do something fake like that
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.040]  it'll bounce straight
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040]  back up even more with more force from my research.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.040]  So yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.040]  If they do a panic or something which they could
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.040]  pull, absolutely.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.040]  I mean, you know, they've done this
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.040]  a bunch though, not to the extent you're talking
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.040]  about. I appreciate your call. Let's go to another one here.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.040]  Let's talk to
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.040]  Michael in Florida. You're on the
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.040]  air with Lindsay Williams.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  Hi, it's Michelle, but that's okay.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040]  I'm sorry. I'm dumb.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  It does say Michelle right there, but I do this
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.040]  thing where Michelle looks like Michael across
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.040]  the room. Go ahead. That's okay.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040]  I have three quick questions, but I just want to make
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040]  a statement. I live in Florida, but we have
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.040]  a place in Ohio and there
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.040]  are people awake and we're in rural
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.040]  areas in both places and
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  there's a place in Cincinnati. This lady came
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.040]  to church and I just knew she was
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.040]  awake anyway.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.040]  She said they have big meeting groups
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.040]  there that they're all planning for what's
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  going to happen and they're all making moves
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.040]  into strategic places
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.040]  out in the rural areas out there.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.040]  So here and there. Listen,
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.040]  I'm going to hold you over because I want to get
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.040]  your full question, but let me just tell you now.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.040]  I have gone to like children's parties
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:56.040]  with my children in
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.040]  different small towns and it's scientists
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.040]  and doctors and retired
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.040]  FBI agents and biochemists
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.040]  just everywhere and
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.040]  sometimes they don't even know who I am, but they're
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.040]  saying, do you know about the global takeover
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.040]  plan? We're preparing for it. Do you know about
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.040]  the bio weapons they've got? I mean, it's like
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.040]  they know. The higher educated
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.040]  people get, the more
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.040]  they are. They know because
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.040]  they're in the system and they're
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.040]  seeing it. Lindsay, take us out to break with
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.040]  what I just covered. Yeah,
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.040]  you're exactly right, Alex. They are waking up.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.040]  They're waking up in mass and
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.040]  I don't know where to walk and say, I'm also
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.040]  I've been a minister of the gospel
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.040]  for 55 years. I'm in my 70s
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.040]  but just as active as I was when I was
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.040]  back in my 50s and I am
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.040]  seeing for the first time in the past six months
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.040]  a number of churches and it called me
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.040]  and said the next time you come out with any
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.040]  DVD series or anything that we can put in
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.040]  our that we can show to our church
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.040]  send it to me. There are
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.040]  for the first time, Alex, in
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.040]  35 years that I've been out here
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.040]  trying to beat the bushes and tell the truth.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.040]  We actually have a series
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.040]  of churches now who are
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.040]  asking me for information on a
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040]  every few day basis. Exactly. Okay,
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.040]  stay there. I'm going to come back to you, Michelle, in Florida.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.040]  Stay with us.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.040]  Music
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.040]  Music
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.040]  Music
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.040]  Music
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.040]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.040]  Music
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.040]  Run on for a long time.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.040]  You can run on
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.040]  for a long time.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.040]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.040]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.040]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.040]  Sooner or later you've got to cut you down.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.040]  Sooner or later you've got to
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.040]  cut you down.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.040]  Go tell that
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.040]  Once the globalists are identified
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.040]  they've got to move with hardcore
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.040]  tyranny which they're now trying to sell
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.040]  and I think it's going over like a lead balloon.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.040]  Does it matter though?
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.040]  They're still going to run the bulldozer right over us
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.040]  because they don't have
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.040]  a choice. So get ready for impact
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.040]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.040]  Lindsay Williams, our guest this segment, the next
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.040]  and Bob Chapman joins us. Calls will continue
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.040]  here. We're doing a fourth special hour
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.040]  today with several guests including Max Kaiser
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.040]  and Gary Franchi.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.040]  Going back to Michelle in Florida, go ahead
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.040]  and ask your questions, Michelle.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.040]  Real quick, most the number one question
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.040]  I get from other Christians are
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.040]  what do the globalists have planned
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.040]  with these FEMA camps? A lot of them are
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.040]  thinking they're going to be sent to these
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.040]  camps. The next one is silver
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.040]  as good as gold to have and should
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.040]  we be hiding our food guns
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.040]  and ammo somewhere in our house?
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:32.040]  Is that for me or Lindsay?
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.040]  Both of you either or.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.040]  Let me just briefly give you my answer
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.040]  and then we'll get Lindsay's and I appreciate your call.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040]  Look, they're not going to say
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.040]  Alex Jones goes to a FEMA camp today.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.040]  As things collapse,
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.040]  they'll put the poor people in there
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.040]  and of course they're going to have to be enrolled
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.040]  for their safety and then there are
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.040]  facilities for the extremist.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.040]  I've been to the drills, we've got the training manuals.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.040]  This is public.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.040]  We know how the FEMA camps are rolled out.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.040]  It's in the emergency centers establishment act.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.040]  It just documents
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.040]  and calls for further funding of what's already there.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.040]  So you see all these
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.040]  leaders in Illinois saying we want troops
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.040]  on the streets in New Orleans
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.040]  and Louisiana calling for it.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.040]  It's called for by the local
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.040]  operatives.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040]  Like oh, vampire, please come in.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.040]  They beguiled you
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.040]  with this. Lindsay Williams.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.040]  I have tried to get the elite
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.040]  on this subject because the FEMA camps
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040]  numbers of times you've heard me say this on your
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.040]  show before Alex and they refuse
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.040]  to answer any of my questions.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.040]  When I asked something of these people
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.040]  and back even when Mr. Brown was alive
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.040]  and he didn't want to answer,
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.040]  he just positively was very curt sometimes
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.040]  and would say, no, let's don't talk about that.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.040]  I'm going to talk about one thing though
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.040]  and I must be very empathic about this
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.040]  despite what the previous call
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040]  has said.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.040]  You remember when I came on your program
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.040]  and I said, Alex,
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.040]  I've just been told by, and I didn't name
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.040]  him then Mr. Brown, and that's who did it.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.040]  He said, price of crude oil is going from
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.040]  $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.040]  People said I was crazy. I was
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.040]  laughed at. But it did do it in the next
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.040]  six months. When it happened,
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040]  you said I was a profit. Now I'm coming back
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.040]  to give you this one right now also.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.040]  Mr. Brown said, I will currency.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.040]  I will currency. He stressed so much
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040]  what their currency is.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.040]  Their currency is gold and silver.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.040]  Never in the history of the world
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040]  looked this up for yourself.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040]  I must be very positive about this
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.040]  because of what they told me.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.040]  Never in the history of the world has
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.040]  gold and silver ever gone to zero.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.040]  You show me anytime from Adam
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  until today that the one thing
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040]  that God-
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.040]  Sure, well, it's even in industrial metals used
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040]  everywhere. I'm not saying I agree with the guy
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.040]  they can sure manipulate it up and down.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.040]  But every time they artificially manipulate down
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040]  it only makes it bounce back up.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.040]  But specifically about hiding guns
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.040]  gold, silver, yes
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.040]  it is good to do that.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.040]  It certainly is good to do that.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.040]  I'll be honest with you one thing. If you hide
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.040]  your paper currency, your Federal Reserve
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.040]  notes between your mattress
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.040]  after the day after the devaluation
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.040]  it's going to be worth 40% less than what
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.040]  it is what it was on Friday
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.040]  when they closed the banks. But if you've got
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.040]  gold and silver hide hidden someplace
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.040]  around the house there, I guarantee you
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.040]  you mock my words, you're going to call me a
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.040]  prophet after it happens and wish to goodness
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.040]  you'd listen to what the elite have told me.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.040]  I'm just telling you what they've told me folks
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.040]  that's all I can do. It will be
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.040]  worth 40% more than it was
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.040]  on Friday when the banks closed after
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.040]  the devaluation and you cannot
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.040]  depend on it unless it is tangible.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  All right
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.040]  back in one minute. We're going to do five more minutes with
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.040]  Lindsay Williams and we're going to hurry through some quick
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.040]  questions from Sean
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.040]  and Roy and Justin
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.040]  and Mark and others but just we'll get your question
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.040]  and get a quick answer from Lindsay
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:35:14.040]  on the other side while they're right back.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.040]  Final segment
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.040]  with Lindsay Williams
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.040]  I want to
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  I want to go to calls just in a quick answer
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.040]  what about your elitist sources
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  priming the pump of good info
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  to sucker punch everybody
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.040]  down the road with disinfo
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.040]  I mean you ever worried about that
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.040]  Lindsay?
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.040]  I would be if it had ever happened
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.040]  in 35 years time. Now keep in mind
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.040]  the one person right now that
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.040]  gives me more information than anything else
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.040]  has been a very close personal
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.040]  friend and ally his entire family
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.040]  his wife his children
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.040]  all of them I know personally I've been with
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.040]  them I've been in their home
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.040]  never in one time in 35 years
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.040]  have they given me any
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.040]  disinformation and they're not
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.040]  going to start now I'll tell you why
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.040]  because they're in their 70s
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  and 80s these people are
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.040]  they know they're facing eternity
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.040]  they know they're going to have to deal with it. Now I hear what you're saying great answer
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.040]  I believe you let's go to
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.040]  Roy in New York you're on the air go ahead
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.040]  Hello Roy come on down
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.040]  Alex Lindsay can you hear me? Yes we can
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.040]  I'm calling deep within the confines
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.040]  FEMA region too and
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.040]  I wanted to say Lindsay
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.040]  not to be discouraged a lot of people
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.040]  are awake and even though some
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.040]  aren't Christians they are deeply
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.040]  spiritual and I'm one of them and I do
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.040]  have a standing relationship
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.040]  with my creator but
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.040]  evil will never
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.040]  fail not in this lifetime
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.040]  or any lifetime coming after us
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.040]  so people need to be fearful
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.040]  they need to be confident they need
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.040]  to wake people up around them and do everything
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.040]  they can get storeable food get ammo
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.040]  get all those things but more importantly
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.040]  wake up and reach out to people
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.040]  and follow people say Alex
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  you're real paranoid no I'm not
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.040]  I'm aware of history and I'm out there
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.040]  out front I know we can
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.040]  beat these people Roy do you have any questions for
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.040]  Lindsay
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.040]  no I'm just happy to hear Lindsay Williams back
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  on your show every time he does I tune in
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.040]  and I thank you both for your work well thank you Roy
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.040]  let's go to Justin in Minnesota you're on
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.040]  the air with Lindsay Williams you got a question
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  yes I do
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.040]  basically I'm a
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.040]  Catholic and
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.040]  my church has pretty much
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  been I don't know it seems like
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:30.040]  playing the New World Game
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.040]  asking for World Band and whatnot
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.040]  I just like to ask Lindsay
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.040]  one thing what he thinks about
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.040]  the hierarchy of the church
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.040]  because I have
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.040]  tons of people in my community
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.040]  in my church community who are awake
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.040]  but are afraid to speak out because
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.040]  of group consensus about
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.040]  you know the Vatican asking for a World Bank
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.040]  and yeah what about
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.040]  the Vatican calling for a World Bank
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.040]  and all this stuff Lindsay
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.040]  you know the elite have never been willing to talk
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.040]  to me about certain things and one of them
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.040]  is the Vatican now I have personal
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.040]  opinions but those don't
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.040]  weigh at all because you can't
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.040]  depend on what I think in my mind
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.040]  but whenever these people get me something I'll say
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.040]  they have never been willing to go into the
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  subject of the Vatican
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.040]  anything else you'd like to add
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.040]  there sir
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.040]  yes actually I have some
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.040]  two really important comments
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.040]  to make because I've waited
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.040]  so long to get on the show
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.040]  I'd like to point out that
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.040]  MIT's OpenCourseWare
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040]  they're teaching things like how to stage a
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.040]  revolution and
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.040]  the quote underneath the heading is from
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.040]  Mao Zedong
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.040]  dated 1927 and the funny
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.040]  thing or sad thing I should say
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  is it says how to stage a revolution
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.040]  and it shows
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.040]  four men to the left with a flag
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.040]  and three men
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.040]  and a guillotine to the right
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040]  yeah let me stop you send me that
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.040]  email that right now to showtipsandinfowars.com
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  I have that in the article
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.040]  the Egyptians have arrested a bunch
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.040]  of state department front liberal
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.040]  groups who claim they want democracy
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.040]  but everywhere they go they try to bring
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040]  tyranny and the government
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040]  the illegitimate government is creating
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.040]  its own little commissariat
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040]  you know enforcer
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.040]  system for their fake revolution
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040]  and it's totally seditious
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.040]  and evil but
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.040]  where do people find that from the
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  because I know the universities are training for
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.040]  against the freedom
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  an engine of pure evil but
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040]  how do you find that
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040]  you go to
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.040]  ocw.mit.edu
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.040]  and go under the humanities
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040]  social studies
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.040]  look under the heading history
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.040]  and I mean this is full coursework
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040]  so this is their whole
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  send it to me right now
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:15.040]  music
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.040]  alright we are doing a fourth hour
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.040]  of special transmission today
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.040]  coming up at the start of the next hour
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  Gary Franchi
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.040]  who runs a big Ron Paul super pack
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.040]  of Restore the Republic is another one of the grips he created
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040]  really kicked things off
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040]  of course working with Aaron Russo does a great job
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040]  he has
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.040]  put out a bunch of really well produced
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.040]  TV ads
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040]  that are as good as anything I've seen the actual
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040]  campaign put out
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040]  so it just shows the power of the grassroots
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.040]  he's going to be joining us
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.040]  then to look at some breaking
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  economic news that Max Kaiser says he's
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.040]  breaking here
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.040]  he'll be on with this in the last 30 minutes
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.040]  you're like last 30 minutes yes we're doing a fourth hour
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.040]  today
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  but people like Barbara are listening on
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.040]  1630am KKGM
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.040]  we're going to get to you this hour
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.040]  you may have called in to talk to Williams
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.040]  but we couldn't get to everybody so you'll get to ask your question
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.040]  myself Bob Chapman
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  you name it Robert Justin Barbara Mark
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040]  Sean
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040]  first up when we do go to the calls
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040]  coming up but during this hour
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.040]  too with Bob we can go over a lot of different
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  news and get Bob's take on it
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.040]  and your take as well but I promise
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.040]  we'll start going to your calls
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  at
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040]  24 after we'll go to them very quickly
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.040]  and interspersed
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  news with that
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.040]  again if you missed
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  what Lindsay Williams was covering if you want to get his DVD set
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  breaking all this down it's prophecyclub.com
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.040]  or 888-799-6111
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.040]  also
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040]  if you want to support what we're doing
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040]  you can go to infowars.com
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040]  and get all 18 of my films
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  police state 4
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.040]  the rise of FEMA
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  that looks completely crazy if you're watching us on the internet
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  because they keep showing video shots
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040]  if you're on the radio you can't see it obviously
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040]  of
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  the Cobra staff
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040]  by the way that makes me think
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040]  of we're going to Bob Ehrman
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.040]  that makes me think of the report
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.040]  that was in the news
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.040]  of the guy getting arrested at the airport
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  for the cane knife
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040]  and Rob Dew who was
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  visiting in-laws I guess
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.040]  in South Carolina
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.040]  he came in today
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.040]  and he goes yeah I saw that I have
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.040]  video of it
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040]  of a kind of
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  hip-hop dressed guy
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  who tried to go through with a cane
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.040]  with a knife in it and he got through the first
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  time through the TSA
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.040]  and then went outside to smoke a cigarette
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040]  and came back in and that's what
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.040]  Rob Dew actually caught on tape so we're going to play that
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040]  on the nightly news tonight
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.040]  and do a blurb at infowars.com
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.040]  that's the subject but
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.040]  I just digressed completely because
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.040]  they cut to a shot over there
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.040]  of
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.040]  my 18 films I don't think that's all of them there
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.040]  that you get for 70 plus percent off
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040]  for the everything special
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.040]  and it's a great way to wake your friends and family up
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040]  and support our transmission
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.040]  and you can see this this is a
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.040]  Cobra Commander staff
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040]  because I've joked around and talked about our government
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.040]  behaving like the villainous Cobra Commander
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.040]  someone mailed me
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.040]  a complete Cobra Commander
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.040]  mask
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.040]  suit the problem is
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040]  is that it looks like it's for a child
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.040]  so obviously I can't put it on
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.040]  or a teenager
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.040]  but we have the entire
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.040]  Cobra Commander get up now here at the office
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.040]  it came in on Monday
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040]  and this stuff has been laying around
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.040]  in here since I've been you know had it
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.040]  and the crew keeps
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.040]  cutting to it with no description
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.040]  of why and I saw some
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.040]  comment on the web of what they're secretly
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.040]  showing Cobra subliminally
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040]  now it's not subliminally I'm holding a Cobra
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040]  staff here in my hand
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.040]  hail Cobra
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.040]  everyone will now accept
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040]  global new world order currency
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.040]  world government is good
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.040]  of course the same voice of Cobra Commander
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.040]  is also the voice of Starscream
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.040]  I'm gonna be the leader
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.040]  Megatron not you
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.040]  okay we've got to have some
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040]  comic relief here
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040]  at the end of the show
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  and if you didn't watch the Transformers
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040]  back in the 1980s
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.040]  well then you don't know what I'm talking about
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040]  I can actually
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040]  do a
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.040]  I can actually do a
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.040]  Optimus Prime voice did you know that
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.040]  they guys should do it right now for people I can actually
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.040]  do it almost perfectly almost like a John Wayne
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.040]  voice
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.040]  if you haven't heard the Optimus Prime
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.040]  voice it's almost the Optimus Prime voice
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.040]  in those
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.040]  demos I run wicking folks up saying
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.040]  we take the info war now to the next level
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.040]  but I've got to you know kind of focus to get into
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.040]  that mode
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.040]  do what
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.040]  okay
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.040]  okay they were just saying that Chapman's probably
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040]  pouring himself another martini
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.040]  but Chapman doesn't drink
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.040]  that's a joke ladies and gentlemen
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.040]  I apologize to Bob Chapman
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040]  the point is if you want to support us we got
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.040]  15 day free trials
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.040]  at prisonplanet.tv right now to try out the
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.040]  news and all the rest of it
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.040]  and if you do get the everything special we do
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.040]  include a citizen rule book that's
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.040]  contraband pro-america anti-terrinary
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.040]  literature and the
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.040]  Cobra commander golden staff is
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.040]  not included
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.040]  I'm sorry but it's not included
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.040]  but info wars bumper stickers are
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040]  Bob Chapman can you believe that 2011
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.040]  has almost elapsed
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040]  yes I can
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.040]  because I'm getting older and I can feel it
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.040]  I tell you I always
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:37.040]  heard in my grandparent people talk about how
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.040]  time speeds up but now it's
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.040]  yeah I don't think it's just that I'm
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.040]  getting older I think the world is speeding
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.040]  up Bob
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.040]  it's like rocket time
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.040]  you know you just pull one
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.040]  page after another off
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040]  the calendar and you said
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040]  where did it all go
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.040]  I'll cover commander took it over
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.040]  probably
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.040]  our ruling class
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.040]  is is like a cartoon
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.040]  villain I mean aren't they Bob
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040]  they certainly
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:09.040]  are but
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.040]  it's not cartoon unfortunately
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.040]  I give you a good example
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040]  the coverage in Europe
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.040]  is about 30 35 percent
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.040]  in the United States it's not
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040]  existent I'm talking
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040]  about the
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.040]  European Union
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.040]  and the European
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.040]  Eurozone
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.040]  and their problems financially
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.040]  you have six nations
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.040]  who are underwater and you've got all sorts
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.040]  of rules that prohibit
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.040]  the
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.040]  funnel of
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.040]  funneling of money into one project or another
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.040]  whether it's a bank
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.040]  or a country
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.040]  or an industry
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.040]  or a whole country itself
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.040]  what has happened
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.040]  and the people don't understand this and this is
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.040]  what I'm explaining it
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.040]  through swap agreements
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.040]  the
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040]  Federal Reserve
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.040]  has given the
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.040]  European Central Bank
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.040]  a trillion dollar line of credit
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.040]  now
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.040]  they did it through a swap
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.040]  because technically
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.040]  it's not alone
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.040]  if you notice two weeks ago
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.040]  Mr. Bernanke says well we can't give them alone
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.040]  because that would be
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.040]  against the regulations
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.040]  if you sum up and Bernanke got caught
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040]  lying they are giving loans to the European
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.040]  banks at zero percent
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.040]  but this is how they're doing it
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.040]  and they don't explain it
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.040]  in full
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.040]  so the money gets transferred
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.040]  in a swap agreement dollars
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.040]  to the European Central Bank which in turn
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.040]  digitally returns them
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.040]  Euros
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.040]  so that means that
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.040]  they're not borrowing money
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040]  in the European Central Bank
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]  from local entities
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  they're getting a loan
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.040]  from the Federal Reserve
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.040]  so they circumvent the law as well
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.040]  now
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.040]  Germany made a secret
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.040]  although legal
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.040]  contribution if you may
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.040]  to the European Central Bank
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.040]  about two weeks ago they didn't tell anybody about
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.040]  and so
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.040]  between the two of them they get
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.040]  1.6 trillion dollars of which
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.040]  523 banks
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.040]  have already taken in almost 600 billion
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040]  and they trade around
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:29.040]  and they send the money back to the European
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.040]  Central Bank and say would you hold as far
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:33.040]  as until we need it
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.040]  the main thing they're going to do with that money
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.040]  is to
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.040]  roll the debt that they've got out there
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.040]  and some of
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.040]  it's colossal that
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.040]  it's too much to go into in
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.040]  this segment of the program
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.040]  but I remember you three four years ago saying the Euro
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.040]  wouldn't blow and nobody was saying that
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.040]  they were certainly doing it
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.040]  now I understand you want to get into all the technicals of this
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.040]  and it's interesting Bob but separately
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.040]  well go ahead and finish your point
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  but I want to get into Ron Paul
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.040]  the point is the US
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.040]  is financing
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.040]  the European Central Bank
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.040]  which is financing Europe
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.040]  and the
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.040]  the pogenitor of the funds
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.040]  is the Federal Reserve
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.040]  they're lying to us again
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.040]  and they're going to cut it at big time this time
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040]  go ahead
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040]  as you said before
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.040]  it's going to be before
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.040]  anybody ask for
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  an audit
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.040]  this is going to be news
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.040]  throughout the news world
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.040]  and sooner or later it's going to
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  permeate everybody
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.040]  like they hid the last 16.1
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.040]  trillion that they did
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.040]  well this is only one trillion and one of the things about
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.040]  that money that's there
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.040]  they can multiply that
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040]  one and be prudent
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.040]  in lending under the fractional system
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.040]  of course the average bank
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.040]  now is hung out about 35 to 1
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.040]  so I just wanted to make those points clear
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.040]  because that's where the money's coming from
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.040]  and it's very inflationary
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040]  very inflationary
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.040]  and so when are you expecting
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.040]  the inflation to really become
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.040]  noticeable in places other than commodities
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.040]  I think you probably see it
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.040]  in the second and third
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.040]  and fourth quarters
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.040]  it all depends on how quickly
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.040]  they use the money and what they use it for
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.040]  and at the same time we get QE3
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.040]  going they're just not telling you about it
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.040]  in the United States
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  and they've been buying
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.040]  toxic waste and mortgages
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]  from the banks
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.040]  and not telling anybody
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.040]  and those figures will show up later when they show
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040]  their mortgage numbers
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.040]  which are 1.4 trillion
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040]  the last time I looked
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.040]  you see how much they added to it
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040]  and that gives the banks money
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.040]  which the bank then take the money
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  and buy treasury and agency bonds
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.040]  and then they take the remainder of the money
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.040]  at 9 or 35 to 1
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  to go in a stock market to push it up
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.040]  and that is
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.040]  undoubtedly going to start pushing inflation up
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  that's right
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.040]  and so we have all of these things
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.040]  going on both sides of the table here
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.040]  and
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.040]  they've got to be able to keep this system going
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.040]  for a minimum of the year
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.040]  the only fly I see in the ointment in Europe
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.040]  is will
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.040]  Greece go bankrupt
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.040]  and I think the chance is 50-50
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.040]  and I had some
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.040]  conversations on banking
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.040]  with people
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.040]  in France yesterday
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.040]  and I'm going to be talking to them again
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.040]  but they've got a serious problem there as well
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.040]  they're going to get downgraded at least once
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040]  and maybe twice
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040]  Alright Bob
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  I want to get into the Ron Paul demonization campaign
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.040]  and then the calls
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.040]  but I blew 5 minutes talking about
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.040]  Cobra Commander
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.040]  Alright we'll be right back stay with us
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.040]  By the way Rob Dew the director
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.040]  of the Nightly News was in here during the break
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.040]  on my computer
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.040]  pulling it up for me that it's already online
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.040]  at infowars.com
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.040]  and in fact with Knife Cane Arrest at DFW airport
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.040]  that's a good headline
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.040]  we're going to change it to exclusive video
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  of Knife Cane Arrest
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.040]  exclusive video of Knife Cane Arrest
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  and
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.040]  that way that totally describes it
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.040]  and the guys are being mean
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.040]  he didn't know he was on camera concentrating
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.040]  so they're putting it on TV if you're watching that
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.040]  that's the kind of thing Jaren and Chris do in there
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:31.040]  they're like two gremlins
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.040]  going back to Bob Chapman
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.040]  what do you make of tens of thousands
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:37.040]  of years over 20 years
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.040]  20 plus year old stuff
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.040]  less than 10 lines as Ron Paul's pointed out
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.040]  of you know mildly
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.040]  disparaging stuff against you know
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.040]  inner city gangbanger types
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  and Ron Paul's always been
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.040]  on record who he is, what he supports
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.040]  what he stands for I happen to know
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.040]  all the real Ron Paul lore
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.040]  I've been working for you know two dollars a day
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.040]  at charity hospitals on purpose to help people
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.040]  Mr. Goodie Tushes
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.040]  you know Mr. Dudley Dewright is the truth
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.040]  about Ron Paul
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.040]  I mean you watch footage of him 30 years ago on TV
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.040]  he's the same really smart kind of
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  hokey nice guy
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:13.040]  and they're just running with this
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.040]  battering it and battering it
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.040]  and battering it Bob Chapman
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.040]  I want to get your comment on that I want to play this
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.040]  this ad here in a moment
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  well I think it's to be expected
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  we have
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  for once in a long time
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.040]  a real contender
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.040]  who understands all the problems
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  knows how to fix them
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.040]  and who
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.040]  if elected will
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  knock the people behind the scenes
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.040]  right out of the box because
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  he'll take down the federal reserve system
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.040]  and the president's working
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  group on financial markets
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.040]  and those are the two keys
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.040]  to keep them in control
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.040]  and so this is big time stuff
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  they're going to do everything
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  including making up
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.040]  as the program goes on
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.040]  the election
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.040]  nomination goes on
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.040]  it's going to get worse and worse
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.040]  they will create things that never existed before
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.040]  these people are desperate
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.040]  well it's like
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.040]  when they dressed up as hayseeds
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.040]  saying racist things claiming they supported
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.040]  Ron Paul and then said he kidnapped
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.040]  women I mean there's it's going to get
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.040]  crazy but the fact is
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.040]  we know the establishments bought and paid for
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  we know they're corrupt they're all saying
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.040]  Ron Paul's bad because he's so good
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  let's go to this clip
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  and I'm going to get Francione and ask where he found this guy
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:33.040]  down in south Texas
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.040]  where the
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.040]  black fellow with his white wife couldn't get any
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.040]  care
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.040]  and then all of a sudden Ron Paul came in
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:43.040]  and took care of him and then said forget the bill
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.040]  but that's pretty much standard procedure for Ron Paul
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  from what I've heard from his patients and others
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.040]  and from his neighbors of years by the way
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:51.040]  so let's go ahead and go to this clip
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.040]  it was
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  between 1972
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.040]  and 73
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.040]  but it was still a lot of prejudice
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:05.040]  around this area
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.040]  my wife was sick
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:09.040]  and I was trying to get some attention
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.040]  for her
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  nobody came to check
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.040]  they just left her there
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.040]  well I believe I was left there because
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  of the difference
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  between me being black
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.040]  and her being white
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  and every time I would say something
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.040]  to her head and nose
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.040]  she would get pretty upset
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.040]  and then she finally called
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040]  the free police department
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.040]  and said I was harassing her
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.040]  and I mean
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.040]  I didn't know anything to do
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.040]  well then Ron Paul
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:43.040]  come to my rescue
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.040]  he just stepped in
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.040]  and went to work with my wife
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.040]  and after
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.040]  he seen her
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.040]  I'd say no more than 10 minutes later
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.040]  she had a stillborn
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.040]  boy child
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  and he said
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.040]  as far as the bill he would take care of everything
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.040]  which he did
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.040]  I never got a bill from the hospital or anything
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.040]  and he was a doctor
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.040]  of medicine and that's what he was doing
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.040]  was practicing medicine and it didn't matter
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  who and what
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  and why he was doing it
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.040]  because he
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  think of one human being
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:21.040]  just as much as another
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.040]  he's just an honest
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  man and that's
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:27.040]  something we need now
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.040]  in this day and time
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.040]  it's a lot of politics
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.040]  and no honesty
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.040]  when you have honesty
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.040]  people will try to do anything
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.040]  to blot you out
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.040]  and that's what they
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  will try to do to him
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.040]  because he will be honest
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.040]  and they need more like him
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.040]  yeah that's right
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.040]  Ron Paul is not for financing forced abortions
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.040]  in China or
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.040]  they tell women they've basically got to have them to get
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.040]  any form of assistance in Africa
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.040]  Ron Paul is of course against mandatory sentencing
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.040]  which is designed to put
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.040]  mainly black males in prison
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.040]  he's given all these speeches, explain that
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.040]  and of course
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.040]  Mr. Williams, James Williams
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.040]  on the commercial understands that
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:15.040]  we'll get Bob Chapman's take on this
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.040]  go to your phone calls
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.040]  get more into the hit piece by Slimeball
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.040]  Chris Matthews host of
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.040]  Global of Slimeball
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.040]  on the hardly viewed
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.040]  ghost-like MSNBC
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.040]  a shadow of its former
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.040]  skinny
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.040]  hardly viewed self
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  so it's a shadow of a shadow
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040]  of a shadow's reflection
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.040]  we'll be right back as the
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.040]  mainline media
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.040]  it's Alex Jones
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:15.040]  yeah governors we don't need any
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.040]  stinking governors or legislatures
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:19.040]  we just have FEMA regions and
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.040]  10 governors and the Pentagon's
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.040]  over it and oh yeah
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.040]  you guys were worried about us using the military against you
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.040]  we are going to
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.040]  by the way we produced a video
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.040]  that took us 4 or 5 days to put together
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.040]  and then I premiered it here
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.040]  yesterday at this time in the third hour
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:39.040]  and since then it's rolled off
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.040]  the front page of infowars.com
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.040]  but if you just type in
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.040]  slow kill holocaust
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:47.040]  you'll find the video
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:49.040]  just put it into a search engine slow kill
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:51.040]  holocaust
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.040]  proof the government is killing you
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.040]  and get the video
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.040]  and send it out to everyone you know because
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.040]  we have the Planned Parenthood
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.040]  documents and other information
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.040]  where they say we're
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.040]  going to break up the family we're going to encourage homosexuality
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.040]  so people don't have children
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.040]  and we're going to put
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.040]  chemicals in the food and water to sterilize you
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.040]  and confuse your sexuality
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.040]  and this is all part of
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.040]  why the public
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.040]  even if you're a wake up
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.040]  a lot of people can't get motivated or angry
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.040]  because you're being given
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.040]  all sorts of toxic chemicals that are known
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.040]  to reduce aggression
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.040]  to lower IQ
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.040]  and it's very very nasty
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.040]  and this is only a 15 minute video
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.040]  it covers a tiny part of it
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.040]  and you'll think man this is overkill there's like
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.040]  50 different documents and articles
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.040]  it's nothing okay
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.040]  it's nothing that's the problem
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.040]  it's so much bigger
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.040]  the world's so much larger
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.040]  people say the world's getting smaller
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.040]  to use that figurative term it's really getting bigger
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.040]  and there's more information
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.040]  more things more things going on
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.040]  more facts to know
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:59.040]  and in that complexity
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.040]  evil can hide itself
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.040]  and now it's not even
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.040]  hiding itself evil is out in the open
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:07.040]  declaring everything good
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.040]  as bad
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:11.040]  by the way
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.040]  if you want to get a copy of the international

[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:51.040]  I grabbed a couple yard signs
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.040]  bring back to my condo

[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.040]  they were giving me the thumbs up
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.040]  and then I parked
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.040]  I live in a place called Lake Point Tower
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.040]  it's where Axelrod lives
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.040]  that's Sherry Blake used to live
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.040]  very very liberal

[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.040]  building
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.040]  I walked down the block
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.040]  from where I parked my car
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  people were pulling over and stopping
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  Paul signs so people are awake
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.040]  no no Ron Paul as he said
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.040]  is the focal point
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.040]  of the revolution the counter-revolution
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.040]  against the global banker collectivist
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.040]  and they're attempted to humanize
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.040]  and make us all dependent
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.040]  and so when loser draw we win by Ron Paul
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.040]  running so even if they cheat
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.040]  even pull out all the stops we still
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.040]  win but it's a bigger win
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.040]  that for the first time the corporate
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.040]  dinosaur zombie controller
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.040]  media is attacking
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.040]  somebody and it's actually making their
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:53.040]  pull numbers go up so Ron Paul I would
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:55.040]  add is in physical danger
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.040]  no doubts people should pray for him
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.040]  but what you pointed out is a great way
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.040]  people can experience what I've experienced
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.040]  without being well known
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.040]  I'm well known now
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:07.040]  from radio, TV, internet
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.040]  and so if I go down the street every third
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.040]  person or at a restaurant
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.040]  or whatever comes over and is a listener
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:15.040]  and I can be in the third world
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.040]  I can be in Europe and this happens
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.040]  very intensely now
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.040]  I can be in Canada and it happens
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.040]  I can be in Florida you know New York
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:25.040]  wherever and it's growing and that
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:27.040]  is a focal point of how many people
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:29.040]  are away it's not like oh great people recognize
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.040]  me it's actually kind of creepy because
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.040]  you know enemies can recognize you too that happens
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.040]  occasionally but the point is
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.040]  is that if you wear an info wars.com
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.040]  shirt or you wear a Ron Paul shirt
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.040]  or you have a Ron Paul sign
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.040]  you're going to find out
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:45.040]  that my gosh Ron Paul is
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.040]  the absolute front runner not just
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.040]  in some polls they've been suppressing
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.040]  it and when they do talk about him it's
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.040]  negative it shows
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:55.040]  let me get comments from Bob Chapman on what
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:57.040]  he just said
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.040]  well I think
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:01.040]  the underlying
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:03.040]  thought process is
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.040]  we've got to have change and who's
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:07.040]  the guy that's telling the truth it's Ron Paul
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.040]  and so he's the one
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.040]  that they're going to be drawn to
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.040]  I'm hearing out of Iowa
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.040]  that he's got 50% of the vote
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.040]  I'm also hearing
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.040]  that the Republican committee
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.040]  has moved
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.040]  is going to move the balance
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.040]  to a safer place because
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:27.040]  there are people who are about
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.040]  who might try to
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.040]  introduce the things oh no that's
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.040]  Washington Post with a straight face
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:35.040]  oh that's going to be secret what each
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.040]  precinct votes and it's going to go to a
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.040]  secret area now through your
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.040]  safety because the hackers threaten
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.040]  sure they did another false
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:45.040]  flag do you smell a giant
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:47.040]  stinking rat
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.040]  absolutely but they're trying
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.040]  to get away with it and it'll be
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.040]  interesting to see what
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.040]  there's such a group of crooks such
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:57.040]  a group of corrupt blobs such
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:59.040]  filth such criminals
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.040]  such scombob and
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.040]  people can't believe they're listening
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.040]  yeah I know they are these are
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.040]  the folks later more
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.040]  stuff's going to come out not just government drug
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.040]  dealing and money laundering and killing
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.040]  and white slavery and torture
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.040]  you've been fighting these people 50 years
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:19.040]  Bob undoubtedly it's gotten worse because
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.040]  there's this paradigm and corruption as you know
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.040]  that the most corrupt in any group
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.040]  will then lead the pack and then the
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.040]  next most corrupt will then
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.040]  double down and so evil always
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.040]  intensifies that's the thing
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.040]  what's your take on that statement
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.040]  that's perfect and that
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.040]  means that we can never
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.040]  stop
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.040]  even if we get Ron Paul elected
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.040]  and reverse all kinds of laws
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.040]  over the next eight nine years
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.040]  we still have to be
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.040]  vigilant every single
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:51.040]  second of the day because we've seen
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:53.040]  what's happened in history
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.040]  you know you let your guard down
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.040]  and your duck soup
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:59.040]  well said anything else you'd like to add
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.040]  the caller from
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.040]  Alex I'm the one that called and told you about
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.040]  Obama's birth certificate I guess that was
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.040]  half right you know he had one
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.040]  but they were I heard he was in a race
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:13.040]  on the Super Bowl the same people
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.040]  were telling me that they told me this
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.040]  from July their projections
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.040]  internal White House projections are
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.040]  that it's going to be a broken primary
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.040]  for the Republican Party
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:25.040]  if you guys can speak on that
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.040]  they think that Ron Paul has enough
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:29.040]  delegates he's not going to win
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.040]  but nobody else will
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.040]  is that a victory and
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.040]  you comment more on that
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.040]  well the Republicans are getting everybody ready for a broker
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:39.040]  because
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.040]  you know the Paulites as the establishment
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.040]  dinosaur liars
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:45.040]  call them are going to be there
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:47.040]  at the delegate level
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.040]  but you did call a few months before
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.040]  and so they're going to release the birth certificate
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.040]  in a big stunt and then it didn't happen
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:55.040]  when you said it happened but it did happen as
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:57.040]  a big stunt so I appreciate
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:59.040]  that information what's
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:03.040]  your take on a broker convention Bob Chapman
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.040]  possible but there's going to be an awful lot of
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:07.040]  irate people and
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.040]  for our side it's going to accomplish nothing
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.040]  which means that Ron Paul is going to have
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.040]  to run on another ticket
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.040]  he's got to run on
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:17.040]  some ticket
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.040]  well I agree you know he's been trying to
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.040]  on the surface say he probably won't run
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.040]  third party but the doors open
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:25.040]  he has to just to inject real issues
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:27.040]  let's go ahead now and talk
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:29.040]  to Mark and then Barbara and others
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.040]  Mark you're on the air from Texas
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:33.040]  go ahead
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:35.040]  taking my call I've been trying to get
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:37.040]  online for years
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:39.040]  I've got two quick points
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.040]  to kind of freak me out yesterday
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:43.040]  the first time with you the first
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:45.040]  day this week you had Lindsay Williams on
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  I went to go
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.040]  find the speech myself and also
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.040]  like you were saying I went to go check on
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.040]  ammunition and perishables
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:55.040]  and all of a sudden
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:57.040]  about an hour later I had a knock on my door
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.040]  and it was an AT&T
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:01.040]  person
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.040]  it was kind of
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.040]  weird because I tried to get AT&T
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.040]  that cable you verse
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.040]  a while back ago and got denied for it
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.040]  so I was like okay that's not a big deal
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.040]  don't need it anyway but then all of a sudden
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.040]  this guy popped up and he was an AT&T
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.040]  supposedly got
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:19.040]  he had a paper badge and immediately
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:21.040]  I looked because he was trying to ask my wife
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:23.040]  questions and I looked at his badge to make sure he was
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:25.040]  legit it was a paper badge
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:27.040]  like somebody you could print off in your house
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.040]  he had expired
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:31.040]  on the 31st of this
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:33.040]  month and he had
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:35.040]  I was just very observant
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.040]  just from listening to your show
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.040]  I was trying to watch everything he was
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.040]  doing he had a packet
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.040]  and the packet was split up into
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:45.040]  different reasons and
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:47.040]  had everybody's information
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:49.040]  and I immediately went to my head
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:51.040]  I was like one of these people who listened to Alex Jones
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:53.040]  in there
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:55.040]  there's some kind of way they know
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:57.040]  and he was asking how many people were in my house
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.040]  how many TVs we had
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:01.040]  and it was
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.040]  crazy and the one thing that gave him away
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.040]  was the fact that when he called
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:07.040]  back to his
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.040]  central location
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  he was speaking in military terms
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.040]  so he was saying echo and Romeo
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.040]  instead of saying
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.040]  sometimes they do that
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.040]  but listen
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.040]  you can just type in phone company
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.040]  spying on people
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  cable company they now get them all organized
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:27.040]  and have them
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.040]  realtors all the time
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.040]  police get called if you have
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:33.040]  reloading equipment
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.040]  if there's plates in your thing
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.040]  you wonder why the CPS comes and takes your kids
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:39.040]  and you bring in service people
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.040]  into your house that's why it's good to go with
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:43.040]  small companies or good old boys you know
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:45.040]  and they are literal
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.040]  government spies they're trying to turn
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:49.040]  America into the Soviet Union
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:51.040]  basically again this is a
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  conscious totally wicked agenda
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.040]  and they've got all the
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:57.040]  service clerks spying on you
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:59.040]  and the rental car people and the hotel people
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:01.040]  and they get off on it
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.040]  they get off on spying on you
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:05.040]  and treating you like you're a crook
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.040]  because they work for narcotics, trafficking
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.040]  money wandering, child kidnapping
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  murderers the government
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:13.040]  is run by pure evil
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.040]  at the top and they're turning
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.040]  everyone into their little
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.040]  Renfield servants
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.040]  and so how did this creepy story
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:23.040]  end Mark?
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:25.040]  After a while
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.040]  he called in he had this fake badge number
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.040]  and he got kind of nervous because his badge number wouldn't
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.040]  work when he was calling in so I just
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.040]  played along with the game and tried to order
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:35.040]  the service with him to see if he could actually
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.040]  get the service carried on in my house
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:39.040]  he started fumbling over his words
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:41.040]  it's kind of like he already knew
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  that I had tried this before and it didn't work
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.040]  and he knew he was going to get
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:47.040]  well there's another thing that could be happening
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:49.040]  there's a lot of general criminals
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.040]  posing as service people as well
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.040]  and he could have been casing you out but I appreciate your call
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.040]  so how did it end?
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:57.040]  He finally
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:59.040]  caught wind, I got to talking
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.040]  and I actually started talking about this show
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.040]  and talking about how things are going on in the world
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:05.040]  it kind of freaked him out and he kind of harry up
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.040]  and tried to end his
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.040]  I was about to say sometimes their agents
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.040]  are sub minions and they want you to know
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.040]  the government like it's going to intimidate you
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.040]  and as soon as you let them know you're not afraid
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.040]  they hate it, they literally drink
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:19.040]  the fear, appreciate your call
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.040]  Bob Chapman your take on this
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.040]  I think we can trace this back
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.040]  to the end
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.040]  of the
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.040]  demarcation between East and West Germany
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.040]  and Marcus Wolf being
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.040]  invited to the United States
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.040]  along with the people who worked in Stasi
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.040]  to tell you how they control people
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:39.040]  they had the most
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.040]  sophisticated operation in the Soviet Union
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.040]  and
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.040]  so this is where all of these
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:47.040]  kinds of ideas came
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.040]  from and how they were refined
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  and then passed on
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.040]  to the United States
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.040]  government.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.040]  But more importantly and I agree with you
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.040]  it's about a chilling effect where they
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.040]  now they want you to know they'll arrest you for no reason
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.040]  they want you to know they're spying
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:05.040]  good you little crooks, good I'm glad you're scum
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.040]  I don't have anything to hide you filth
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.040]  you do and and that's
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:11.040]  the attitude they're doing this to create a chilling effect
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:13.040]  Barbara in Texas
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.040]  listening on 16 30 a.m.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.040]  out of Dallas KKGM go ahead
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.040]  Barbara you're on the air
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.040]  Hi Alex I'm an old woman but
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.040]  I've been getting woke up
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.040]  by the Southwest Radio Church
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.040]  in Oklahoma for 65
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.040]  oh I've been a guest on that they're great people
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:31.040]  yes and
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:33.040]  what I wanted to know was
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:35.040]  where
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.040]  can get a radio log
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.040]  of you
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.040]  and then what they said
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:43.040]  on Southwest Radio today
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:45.040]  was that now the law
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.040]  has been put in place yet our
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.040]  military can stautomize
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:51.040]  and they can do bestiality stuff
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.040]  yeah by the way
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  I didn't read the whole NDAA
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.040]  of thousands of pages but I scanned over the sections
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.040]  and I saw Ron Paul talking about and stuff and read it
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.040]  and I heard it's got bestiality
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  in it and I was like come on
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:05.040]  and I went and pulled it up
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.040]  control F on the computer
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:09.040]  you know for keywords search bestiality
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:11.040]  and it says the military can take pigs
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.040]  cows whatever they want
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.040]  right into the barracks guys
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:17.040]  pull in NDAA legalizes
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.040]  bestiality you cannot make this up
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.040]  I mean it's always
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.040]  that's what I know it says they're now going to have
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  pigs on base and and
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.040]  goats and stuff I mean
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:29.040]  it said the troops now
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.040]  like instead of like just showing
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.040]  two women kissing on the cover of a magazine
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.040]  they're not going to be met by like a cow
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.040]  or something when you get off the ship
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.040]  Bob Chapman your take on that I'm not kidding
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.040]  it doesn't get any weirder than that
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.040]  I'm telling ya
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.040]  that's that is
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.040]  unbelievable
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.040]  and by the way as for radio log man
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040]  we probably should have every show available
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.040]  on DVD or something for sale but we just never did it
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.040]  all the archives are online
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  saved
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.040]  and if you can get friends and family that are savvy
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.040]  on computers I'm not very savvy
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.040]  they can download it
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.040]  and put it on disk or whatever for you
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.040]  but by radio
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:09.040]  log what specifically do you mean
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.040]  I want to know what stations
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.040]  I can find you on when I go across the country
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:15.040]  oh you're talking about an affiliate list
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:17.040]  yes that's it
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.040]  GCNLive.com
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:21.040]  thank you so much God bless ya
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.040]  yeah there's Texas GOP vote
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.040]  is talking about it Texas Senators vote
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:27.040]  to legalize sex with animals
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.040]  and National Defense Authorization Act
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.040]  so they found a Texas article
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.040]  just type in
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.040]  NDAA B.C. Allity
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:37.040]  you'll get like AP Reuters
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.040]  Bob who can
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:41.040]  make this up
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:43.040]  it is
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:45.040]  beyond anything I ever thought would happen
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.040]  I knew of the rampant
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:49.040]  pedophilia that had gone on
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:51.040]  for the last hundred years
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.040]  that was recordable
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.040]  but bringing animals into the act
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:57.040]  is a
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:59.040]  I don't know what's behind that
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.040]  I shouldn't laugh but pretty soon
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:03.040]  you'll get arrested like in Europe
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.040]  and criticize groups
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.040]  you'll go to a party or you'll go out
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:09.040]  and there'll be someone there like with their monkey
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.040]  or their pig dressed up
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:13.040]  and there'll be wedding services
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.040]  no I'm not kidding their groups calling for that Bob
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.040]  oh my gosh
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:19.040]  somebody shows up
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.040]  get married to their donkey
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.040]  I mean what
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.040]  there's no end to this
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:27.040]  oh man
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:29.040]  okay I shouldn't
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.040]  we'll be right back with more of your call

[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:37.040]  and if your local Ham & FM doesn't cover it
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:39.040]  it'll be on the audio streams at info wars.com
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:41.040]  but this is key coming up with Gary Francian
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:47.040]  music
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:49.040]  yeah this hadn't been
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.040]  a big media issue
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:53.040]  but I have seen in the news and during the break
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:55.040]  I looked it up
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:57.040]  at White House press briefing
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:59.040]  reporter asked if Obama approves of bestiality
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:01.040]  because it's in
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.040]  the new national defense authorization act
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.040]  and here's the report
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.040]  to the two Texas
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.040]  senators voted for it
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:11.040]  I mean well you can't be politically incorrect
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.040]  here's the Indiana express
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:17.040]  news reporting SPCA
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:19.040]  reports alleged bestiality with dogs
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.040]  well you're being bestiophobic
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.040]  you're just not open minded
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:27.040]  okay I just
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:29.040]  this is unbelievable yes senate defense
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.040]  bill
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:33.040]  removes military ban
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:35.040]  on sodomy and bestiality that's off life
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:37.040]  site
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:39.040]  here's a Washington Post article
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.040]  about it and they report it
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.040]  like it's kind of cool
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  hey this is trendy
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.040]  when I talk about trendiness folks
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.040]  they sell it's not trendy
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.040]  to like Ron Paul he's a cuckoo
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:53.040]  it's not trendy to be into freedom
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.040]  hey look at these guys they don't want troops on the streets
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  they're crazy
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040]  meanwhile a couple years ago they're crazy
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.040]  they think we want to put troops on the streets
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:03.040]  now we are but they're still crazy
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.040]  and the general public
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.040]  just kind of buys into all this stuff
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:09.040]  those that aren't awake
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:11.040]  we've got Gary Franchi
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.040]  coming up here
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.040]  I'm going to do a special year in
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.040]  top 10 news stories from our perspective
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.040]  not on the nightly news and a lot more
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:21.040]  Ray McGovern's joining us but we do have a whole other hour coming up
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.040]  as we talk about
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.040]  Ron Paul and a bunch of other issues I haven't gotten to yet
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.040]  but
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.040]  I want to go back to the calls
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:31.040]  in this little short segment the next with Bob Chapman
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.040]  before he's got to
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:35.040]  leave us
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.040]  but let's go ahead and go to some more calls here
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.040]  but I mean just briefly going back to this Bob
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.040]  more and more
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:43.040]  I feel like I'm in a twilight zone episode
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.040]  don't you feel like that?
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:47.040]  I really do
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:49.040]  and it's things I never expected
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:51.040]  I didn't think that
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:53.040]  that kind of agenda would be
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:55.040]  important but the way they've shaped
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:57.040]  this whole thing
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.040]  it's the total disruption
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:01.040]  I mean you brought it up earlier
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:03.040]  with the acceptance of
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:05.040]  homosexuality
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:07.040]  and to keep the birth rate down
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.040]  and things like that so
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.040]  it figures if you're not doing it
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:13.040]  human to human
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.040]  maybe you should go off
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:17.040]  and do things with animals
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.040]  and so I guess it does
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.040]  conform to today's
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.040]  thinking
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.040]  in their part but I would have
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:27.040]  never thought that they would get into that
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:29.040]  well
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.040]  all I can say is
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.040]  that things are definitely going insane
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.040]  Robert in Texas you're on the air
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.040]  with extremists who think that the military
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.040]  should not have pigs on board aircraft carriers
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.040]  for the captain's pleasure
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.040]  Robert you're on the air go ahead
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:45.040]  well I guess I'm one of those extremists too
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:47.040]  I'll try to make this quick
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.040]  yeah when you see a squirrel
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.040]  in a tree you don't get excited
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.040]  you are a bad person
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:55.040]  or watch Animal Planet
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.040]  in the middle of the night
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:59.040]  by yourself with a box of tissues
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.040]  anyway
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:03.040]  I shouldn't have gone there
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:05.040]  I'm sorry
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:07.040]  anyway real quick
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:09.040]  the Mark Levin show got blitzed by
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.040]  Ron Paul supporters
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.040]  last night
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.040]  the video is up on funkmaster5.com
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:17.040]  or the YouTube channel funkmaster5
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:19.040]  who got blitzed
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:21.040]  the Mark Levin show
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:23.040]  and it was one caller
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.040]  and then two callers later
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.040]  called in and just pummeled them
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.040]  with facts and information
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:31.040]  he tried to call the fact that Ron Paul
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.040]  has the most military support out of all the candidates
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.040]  a myth
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:37.040]  and after the first caller called in
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.040]  I called in myself
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.040]  and named four sources
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.040]  that are credible sources for that
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.040]  but even Bloomberg admitted that
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:47.040]  and said it was a horrible thing
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:49.040]  he has more support from government workers
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.040]  than any other candidate
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.040]  well we flattened this guy
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:55.040]  the neocon guy on there
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:57.040]  and we absolutely pummeled them
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.040]  it's on funkmaster5 if you want to
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:01.040]  that's what I can't believe about these shows
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.040]  they claim all day they're trying to keep us safe
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.040]  from the muslim dreaded threat
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.040]  but meanwhile you got a better chance to die
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.040]  from champagne corks than some crazy
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:11.040]  jihadi blowing you up
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:13.040]  and then I talked to these neocons
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:15.040]  when they lecture me
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.040]  so I tell them hey the government's funding
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.040]  Al Qaeda and Libya and they go so what
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:25.040]  it holds water
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.040]  alright we're now into hour number
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.040]  four today
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:35.040]  of special four hour transmission
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.040]  because it is the final radio show
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.040]  of 2011 Bob Chapman with us for a few more minutes
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:41.040]  funkmaster5 just called in
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.040]  a great activist who's a lot done calling into
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:45.040]  a kind of a
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.040]  fake alternative media
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:49.040]  neocon shows
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.040]  who poses the alternative
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.040]  to the mind control media
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:55.040]  the zombie control
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.040]  media that's losing so much power
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:59.040]  but I was joking around with the guys
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.040]  but it's not funny you know when I was a teenager
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:03.040]  I had pinups of Heather Locklear
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:05.040]  and swimsuits hanging up in my room
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:07.040]  but I guess in the news system
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:09.040]  now that the Pentagon with the NDAA
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:11.040]  I never even mentioned this because it was so crazy
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:13.040]  but it's in the news says they can have beastiality
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.040]  and the troops can have
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:17.040]  a farm animal or turtle or whatever they wish it to
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.040]  they have a private
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.040]  home off base
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.040]  I guess now the pinups on base will be like
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:25.040]  of cows, giraffes, turkeys
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.040]  slugs
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.040]  I mean I don't know
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:31.040]  I mean this is the total dehumanization
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.040]  this is about dehumanizing us
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.040]  Bob why do you think the ruling class
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:37.040]  is so screwed up
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:39.040]  I think when they try everything
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.040]  they go to whatever limits
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:45.040]  and go as a human being
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.040]  whether it's high or low
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:49.040]  this case it's low
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.040]  and it's just
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.040]  astounding and
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.040]  it happens in other areas
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.040]  not just in this one where
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:59.040]  people want to
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.040]  become deeply involved in things
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:03.040]  that they never really would for the experience
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:05.040]  thereof. Well let's expand on that
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:07.040]  so in World War II the troops shouldn't have had
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.040]  you know pinup girls of
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:11.040]  beautiful women that's obviously attractive
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.040]  they should have like a possum or something on the side
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.040]  probably
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:17.040]  in fact this weekend what I'm going to do
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:19.040]  is re-read Animal Farm
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.040]  oh my gosh
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:23.040]  Bob you're oh my gosh
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:25.040]  this is unbelievable
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:27.040]  I've been in
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.040]  I'll tell you one thing every program I'm on
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.040]  I'm going to mention this so there's going to be
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:33.040]  a lot of people who know about it
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.040]  it's insane I mean I pulled up
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.040]  the main articles and
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.040]  again no longer will it be Marilyn Monroe
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:41.040]  is looking attractive they're going to
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:43.040]  teach us not to be extreme
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.040]  Marilyn Monroe bad pig with
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:47.040]  lipstick on that's the new chic
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:49.040]  and see I'm not trendy folks just give me Marilyn Monroe
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:51.040]  all day
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.040]  Ivan in New York you're on the air go ahead
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.040]  welcome. Hey Alex
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:57.040]  Hey buddy. Pleasure
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:59.040]  I'm
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:01.040]  from the army branch
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:03.040]  up here in New York Armory
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:05.040]  we were stationed in our Huntington Station
[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:07.040]  and
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:09.040]  they were giving us a normal drill
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:11.040]  we go out in the 10 drill every month
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.040]  and the drill was
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.040]  labeled urban warfare
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:17.040]  now when we were clearing the buildings
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:19.040]  they had this
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.040]  this dummy that looked like
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:23.040]  resembled a US citizen a normal urban citizen
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.040]  which I found kind of weird
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:27.040]  you know I asked who and what are we
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:29.040]  trying to kill you know
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:31.040]  and I questioned my sergeant
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.040]  and I was actually kicked out of
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.040]  drill for questioning him
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.040]  so are you in regular
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:39.040]  army or national guard?
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:41.040]  No I'm in regular army.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:43.040]  You're in big army and you've done a drill
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:45.040]  I'm surprised the dummy didn't have
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:47.040]  a John Deere hat on
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:49.040]  or a hay seat outfit because that's who
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.040]  they practice against
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.040]  and so you guys are now doing urban
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.040]  warfare drills. Yeah I mean
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.040]  and not one street which I found kind of
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:59.040]  you know weird in general
[02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:01.040]  and
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:03.040]  being the fact that most of us in Armory
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.040]  were part with sergeant and we're not going
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.040]  to drills anymore from the infantry
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.040]  division. I love them bravo as my
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.040]  most you know I decided to cancel
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  drills and I'm not attending at all anymore
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:15.040]  you know it's ridiculous that they're training us
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:17.040]  to attack the American civilians. Well I'll tell you
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.040]  what Bob's got to go and Gary Franchi's
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:21.040]  coming up and I'd like to give you the floor and we come back
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.040]  for a couple minutes to tell the whole story
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:25.040]  Ivan so stay there
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:27.040]  Bob taking us out here
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.040]  hopefully I'll see you back here next week Lord Willings
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.040]  we say every week nothing's for sure
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.040]  briefly what's your comment on what he just said
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:37.040]  it's to be expected
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.040]  it will continue and probably
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.040]  in a greater way
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.040]  now that they got the legislation where the president
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:45.040]  can have anybody picked up
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.040]  and you're going to see more and more of it
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:49.040]  and all I can say to
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.040]  our brothers in the military
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.040]  and I'm a veteran
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.040]  is to
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.040]  listen to what they have to say and
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:59.040]  don't use what they're doing
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.040]  because it'll cost you your life
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.040]  alright Bob we'll talk to you next week thank you
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.040]  Bob
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.040]  alright Ivan I'm going to come back to you I want you to start over
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:09.040]  tell the whole story and we'll go to Gary Franchi
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:11.040]  and then more calls
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.040]  wow just think of all the callers I never get to
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:15.040]  with all the stories I've got to tell
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:17.040]  and look now this isn't even speculation
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.040]  it's admitted they're training the military
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:29.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:31.040]  you want answers?
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:33.040]  well so does he
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:39.040]  and now live from Austin Texas
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:51.040]  Alex Jones
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:53.040]  alright the founder and head of revolution pack
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:55.040]  he also heads up restore the republic
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:57.040]  Gary Franchi's going to be with us in a couple of minutes
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:59.040]  but Ivan we don't screen calls
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:01.040]  but when you got something like this
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:03.040]  please volunteer it to us
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.040]  so we can get to you earlier
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:07.040]  Ivan is in New York
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.040]  he's in the army
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  and he's saying just recently
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.040]  they tried to have him do drills
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.040]  of basically taking on the American people
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:17.040]  which is admitted I've been to these drills
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:19.040]  it's in the news they admit their quote
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  training to pull triggers the American people
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:23.040]  stars and stripes magazine
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.040]  that's in the brigade homeland
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:27.040]  starts its tour article
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:29.040]  you just type that in you'll be able to pull it up
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.040]  but to have
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.040]  him question it and be kicked out of drill
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:35.040]  and now he's saying
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:37.040]  a bunch of his unit are saying no
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.040]  and he's giving out names I guess
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:41.040]  Ivan go ahead and give us in a few minutes
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:43.040]  here we appreciate you standing up the constitution
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.040]  give us the full
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:47.040]  synopsis
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:49.040]  recap it where this was
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:51.040]  when this happened
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:53.040]  and how many people are refusing to go along with this
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.040]  well our unit
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:57.040]  consists of about I would say 150 people
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.040]  we were informed to go in
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:03.040]  and continue with the training
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.040]  and I refused I told my guys
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.040]  you know this is against the constitution
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:09.040]  well we'll be even trained
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.040]  to take firearms from civilians in general
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:13.040]  and
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:15.040]  this is what I would say that
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.040]  you know and I regret joining the military for this
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.040]  is that if we have a voice
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:21.040]  we are told to shut up and follow commands
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.040]  now most of my unit
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.040]  I mean is questioning everything
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:27.040]  and then we decide not to attend drills in general
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:29.040]  you know we think that
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.040]  people should have the rights
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:33.040]  the constitutional rights
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  and the military can go to hell
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:37.040]  for I don't know I'm not going to listen to no command
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:39.040]  no high command
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:41.040]  and if they ever implement martial law
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:43.040]  and try to tell me to go out there and shoot civilians
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:45.040]  I have one thing coming for them
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:47.040]  it's ridiculous
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:49.040]  and I'm ashamed
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.040]  I'm ashamed to be an American citizen at the moment
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:55.040]  wow what else happened
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.040]  well afterwards
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:59.040]  I was
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.040]  escorted by MP military police
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:03.040]  and I was told to get out of the post
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.040]  and I was like all right
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:07.040]  I'll leave and I took my bag and I left
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  and I told my drill sergeant
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:11.040]  and I'm not going to attend drill anymore
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:13.040]  also one of my friends came back
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:15.040]  from peluja and bagged that
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.040]  and he's sick
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:19.040]  he's sick
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.040]  he's losing his hair
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.040]  a lot of other things and this guy is a health freak
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:25.040]  so
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:27.040]  I'm scared of my government right now at the moment
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.040]  you know
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.040]  well I'm sorry
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:33.040]  this is happening can you send us an email
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:35.040]  with any of your other associates
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:37.040]  or people we can talk to
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:39.040]  to maybe get some press on this
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:41.040]  because where is this going now
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:43.040]  I mean when were you kicked off the base
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:45.040]  well I was kicked off we went to a Huntington
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.040]  Huntington station
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:49.040]  and they have routine drills
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:51.040]  every month Huntington Fort Dix
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:53.040]  basically
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:55.040]  the eastern region has monthly drills
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:57.040]  and
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:59.040]  we're now being trained to attack civilians
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:01.040]  and most of us
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:03.040]  are not complying with their orders
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:05.040]  so somebody who
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:07.040]  doesn't comply with their orders
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:09.040]  a soldier that does not comply with their orders
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.040]  will be kicked off the base
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:13.040]  but
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:15.040]  but I mean you're kicked off the base
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:17.040]  you're not court-martialed you don't get in trouble
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.040]  no no you kicked off the base
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:21.040]  in general just kicked off the base
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:23.040]  you know I've seen a lot of that in the news
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:25.040]  because they don't want to get reports of it going
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:27.040]  so they basically make you go AWOL
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:29.040]  yeah basically
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:31.040]  you can say that
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.040]  I was also talking to most of my other guys
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:35.040]  in the unit we do hear you
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:37.040]  we do appreciate what you're doing at the moment
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:39.040]  and we thank you for the truth
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.040]  well thank you sir can you send us
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:43.040]  any information
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.040]  or your contact
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:47.040]  just send it to tips
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:49.040]  the show tips at infowars.com
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.040]  and I would like to talk to you
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.040]  and other
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.040]  members of your unit
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:57.040]  and perhaps get a report on this
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:29:59.040]  because
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.040]  are they specifically training you
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:03.040]  how do you know this is for domestic operations
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:05.040]  well
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:07.040]  the dummies
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.040]  we were breaching a building
[02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:11.040]  and we're told to clear the building
[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:13.040]  and it's a routine training drill
[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:15.040]  and the dummies
[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:17.040]  were dressed like regular civilians
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.040]  with regular jeans, clothes
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:21.040]  you know one of them had
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:23.040]  a bandana, an American bandana
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:25.040]  and I was like what the hell is going on here
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.040]  and to the right I looked at the guys
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:29.040]  and I said are you serious
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:31.040]  are we going to go through with this crap
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.040]  or are we going to just say no more
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.040]  alright incredible information
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:37.040]  God bless you my friend I appreciate
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.040]  Ivan calling into the show
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:41.040]  and stay in contact with us
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.040]  send us an email with more information
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:45.040]  thank you that is really frightening information
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.040]  but I can pull up right now
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.040]  explore scouts
[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:51.040]  trained to take on terrorists
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.040]  and more from three years ago
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:55.040]  and it's got a whole bunch of photos
[02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:57.040]  and the first line says
[02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:59.040]  they're training to take on
[02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:01.040]  disgruntled vets and kill them
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.040]  and it shows them
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:05.040]  practicing to kill good old boys basically
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:07.040]  and then I've got the training manuals
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:09.040]  where it says the number one enemy of America
[02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:11.040]  is veterans
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.040]  we're the folks that broke that
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:15.040]  everybody knows about it
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:17.040]  you can just type in homeland security documents
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:19.040]  says veterans number one threat
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:21.040]  it's not al-qaeda
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:23.040]  I saw a report with delta airlines
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.040]  and there were some guys in their
[02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:27.040]  muslim garb a number one of their real muslim terrorists
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:29.040]  they're going to be dressed in blue jeans folks
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.040]  and people got so scared of them
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:33.040]  because they were men wearing
[02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:35.040]  middle eastern outfits that they freaked out
[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.040]  and the pilot wouldn't fly everyone was
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.040]  rolling around in convulsions of fear
[02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:41.040]  this is so ridiculous
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.040]  you should be afraid of the big
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:45.040]  corrupt government afraid of doing nothing
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:47.040]  now shifting gears for the balance of the
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:49.040]  next 20 minutes is Gary
[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:51.040]  francy
[02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:53.040]  who heads up revolution pack and he's
[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:55.040]  always doing
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:57.040]  new great work in the fight for Ron
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:59.040]  Paul and I just want to know
[02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.040]  in the case of James Williams
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.040]  who's in the piece from south Texas
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:05.040]  on the coast where Ron Paul was a physician for many years
[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.040]  how on earth did you guys
[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:09.040]  find James Williams
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:11.040]  because this is certainly
[02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:13.040]  got the media covering it
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:15.040]  and pretty upset because it humanizes
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:17.040]  Ron Paul
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:19.040]  Alex thanks for having me on the show
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:21.040]  yeah James Williams you know he's like a needle
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:23.040]  in a haystack
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:25.040]  you know Alex Ron Paul is delivered
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:27.040]  over 4,000 babies
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:29.040]  in his medical career
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.040]  so you know there's plenty of stories
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.040]  more just like this
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:35.040]  and because
[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:37.040]  the revolution pack has
[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:39.040]  people who
[02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:41.040]  used to work in the 2008 campaign
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:43.040]  people who have always been
[02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:45.040]  very close to Ron Paul
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:47.040]  they have an institutional knowledge
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:49.040]  of past campaign tactics
[02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:51.040]  as well as
[02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:53.040]  the people that have been close to Ron
[02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:55.040]  and
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:57.040]  through our sources within the pack
[02:32:57.040 --> 02:32:59.040]  we found James
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.040]  and he said he would come through
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:03.040]  and perform the interview for us and help us
[02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:05.040]  get his story out
[02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:07.040]  well
[02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.040]  and you sure got some good producers
[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:11.040]  all these ads look like
[02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:13.040]  million dollar ads you're producing
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:15.040]  just an amazing job Gary
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:17.040]  thanks Alex that ad
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:19.040]  was shot last
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:21.040]  Monday
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:23.040]  in Jamestown
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:25.040]  in the congressional district of Ron Paul
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:27.040]  our crew flew out
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:29.040]  they flew out to Houston
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:31.040]  they flew out Sunday
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:33.040]  shot the ad on Monday
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:35.040]  we got two more videos that are going to be coming out
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:37.040]  in this Ron Paul series
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:39.040]  that talk about Ron Paul the man
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.040]  and of course this one with James Williams
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.040]  talks about the compassion
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:45.040]  of Ron Paul
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:47.040]  so that video was shot Monday
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.040]  and our producing team
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:51.040]  put the video together through the holiday weekend
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:53.040]  because we knew that this
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:55.040]  message needed to be heard
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.040]  and we fine
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:33:59.040]  tuned it
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:01.040]  in the past couple days we released it and now it has over
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.040]  250,000 views
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:05.040]  it's really stifling a lot of the arguments
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:07.040]  that the media is trying
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:09.040]  to pin on Ron Paul
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:11.040]  of course you know we see the claims that he's
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:13.040]  some sort of a racist and a bigot
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.040]  and let's just be clear this video
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:17.040]  is not specifically designed to address that
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:19.040]  it's one video in a series
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.040]  that addresses the Ron Paul the man
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:23.040]  but we're already getting reports
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:25.040]  from people on the ground
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:27.040]  who
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.040]  they're talking to individuals
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:31.040]  they're trying to convert people to Ron Paul
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:33.040]  as a racist
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.040]  well then they go ahead they pull this video up
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:37.040]  on their laptop or their iPhone
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.040]  and they say take a second to watch this video
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:41.040]  and this video completely disarms the argument
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:43.040]  so we have an initiative right now
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:45.040]  we're trying to raise funds to get this
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:47.040]  broadcast on national television
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.040]  and just
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:51.040]  get the message out get James Story to the American people
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.040]  we're going to broadcast it right now to 3 million people
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:55.040]  go ahead and play the ad
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:57.040]  here it is
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.040]  it was
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:01.040]  between
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.040]  1972
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.040]  and 73
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:07.040]  but it was still a lot of prejudice
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:09.040]  around this area
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  my wife was sick
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:13.040]  and I was trying to get some attention
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:15.040]  for her
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:17.040]  nobody came to check
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:19.040]  they just left her there
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.040]  well I believe I was left there
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:23.040]  because of the difference
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.040]  me being black and her being
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:27.040]  being white
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:29.040]  every time I would say something to her
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.040]  he didn't notice that she would get
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:33.040]  pretty upset
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:35.040]  and then she finally called
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.040]  a free poor police department
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:39.040]  and said I was harassing her
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:41.040]  and
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:43.040]  I mean I didn't know anything to do
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:45.040]  well then Ron Paul
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:47.040]  come to my rescue
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.040]  he just stepped in
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:51.040]  and went to work with my wife
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.040]  and after
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:55.040]  seeing her
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.040]  I'd say no more than 10 minutes later
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  she had
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:01.040]  a stillborn boy child
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.040]  and he said
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.040]  as far as the bill he would take care of everything
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:07.040]  which he did
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:09.040]  I never got a bill from the hospital or anything
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.040]  and he was a doctor
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:13.040]  of medicine and that's what he was doing
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:15.040]  was practicing medicine and it didn't matter
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:17.040]  who and what
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.040]  and why he was doing it
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:21.040]  because he think of
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.040]  one human being just as much as
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:25.040]  another
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:27.040]  he's just an honest man
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:29.040]  and that's
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  something we need now
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:33.040]  in this day and time
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:35.040]  it's a lot of politics
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:37.040]  and no honesty
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.040]  when you have honesty well
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.040]  people will try to do anything
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.040]  to blot you out
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:45.040]  and that's what they
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.040]  will try to do to him
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.040]  is blot him out because
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:51.040]  he's honest
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.040]  and they need more like him
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.040]  alright we're going to be back with Gary Franchi
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:57.040]  there's another video where Ron Paul
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.040]  this morning on talk radio responded
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:01.040]  to the ad and he had some tears in his eyes
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:03.040]  we'll talk to Gary Franchi on the other side
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:05.040]  of revolution pack and we'll give you that
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:07.040]  website if you want to get involved in supporting this
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  I tell you Gary is really doing
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  impressive work and we can do
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.040]  exactly what the globalists do but we use the truth
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:15.040]  not lies we can kick there
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.040]  you know what
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.040]  stand up and give him a fight
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:23.040]  how did you uh... that's a long time ago
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:25.040]  I'm super
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:27.040]  I just saw this
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:29.040]  a little while ago it wasn't put out by our campaign
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:31.040]  it was put out by that
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:33.040]  the super pack types up that are separated
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:35.040]  from the campaign I'm amazed
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:37.040]  how they found that if you would have asked me
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:39.040]  to go back and find somebody
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:41.040]  like that I wouldn't know but
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:43.040]  to me I don't remember it I don't recall it
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:45.040]  because it was one of
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:47.040]  just the way we practice medicine
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.040]  you know in a way at least I practice medicine
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.040]  it was incredibly important to that guy
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:53.040]  it was a non-event
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.040]  in the sense that
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:57.040]  that is what I thought my responsibilities were
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:03.040]  and then Paul continues
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.040]  the video is up at infowars.com
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:07.040]  talking about you know sometimes
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.040]  he wonders why did I ever sign on to this to be attacked
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.040]  but then he realizes
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.040]  that the truth will out the truth will always
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.040]  come out perhaps
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.040]  we'll play that when we come back to the next segment
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.040]  Gary I got you on late today I got to get you back
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:21.040]  on next week but super job
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.040]  uh... with what you're doing
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:25.040]  uh... and uh...
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:27.040]  I can't wait I mean give us
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:29.040]  an idea of some of the other surprises
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:31.040]  coming out the next videos
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:33.040]  well you know when you go down
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:35.040]  to congressman Paul's congressional
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.040]  district there are so many people
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:39.040]  that have been touched by Paul
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:41.040]  and we've spoken to people that have
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.040]  worked very closely with him in the
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:45.040]  in the medical field uh... we spoke to
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:47.040]  veterans and uh... we've
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:49.040]  just got some compelling human interest
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:51.040]  stories that uh... the american people
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:53.040]  uh... are really going to relate
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.040]  to when they see these videos
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.040]  well I've talked to his family and people
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  who don't want to brag about him publicly
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.040]  and I've also talked living here in Texas to people
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  that have been medically touched by him
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:05.040]  he would always volunteer part of the week
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:07.040]  at the horrible charity hospitals
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  and stuff not as some goody douchey
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:11.040]  he believed in not having big government so
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:13.040]  uh... people that are strong
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.040]  are supposed to help the week he would go down
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.040]  and work basically for free at the charity hospitals
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:19.040]  well you know you might just
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.040]  see something like that coming out pretty soon
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.040]  and the thing is is that
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.040]  Ron Paul doesn't brag about himself but
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.040]  the revolution pack will brag
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:29.040]  about Ron Paul he's a great man
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:31.040]  and we want to see him in the White House and we're going to do everything we can
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.040]  to make sure that that happens Alex
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:35.040]  and Gary folks can give
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:37.040]  uh... unlimited to these uh...
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.040]  revolution packs
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.040]  I mean uh... you've got a great name for the pack
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:43.040]  uh... and uh... so if people go donate
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  you'll be able to run this two minute commercial
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:47.040]  uh... on television to counter these people
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:49.040]  and uh... I mean
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:51.040]  even if you only get one one hundred to the donations
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:53.040]  the big mega banks give people like
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:55.040]  Mittens Romney uh...
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.040]  or uh... scum like neutered
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:39:59.040]  Gennrich uh... a grain of truth
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:01.040]  shatters a mountain of lies
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:03.040]  well Alex
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:05.040]  when we release the video we've already received
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.040]  close to forty thousand dollars in donations
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.040]  to support it
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.040]  and people can go to revolutionpack.com
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:13.040]  there's a ticker that they can keep track of
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:15.040]  uh... the support that we're getting
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:17.040]  and it's it's overwhelming Alex
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:19.040]  it's overwhelming and that's that's true
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.040]  uh... unlimited donations so we can accept
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:23.040]  ten thousand fifty thousand
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:25.040]  even a million dollars uh... to
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:27.040]  to air a
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.040]  a sixty second version of what you're seeing
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:31.040]  in the two minute version
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.040]  well incredible so
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:35.040]  we see the next ads coming out because he needs
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.040]  all the help he can get now and obviously
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.040]  it's being seen millions of times online
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:41.040]  going super viral
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:43.040]  uh... and it's important for people
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:45.040]  whether it's your videos or our videos
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:47.040]  or other real
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.040]  media countering the decepticon
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:51.040]  media it is so important
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:53.040]  that people pass these videos on to others
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:55.040]  uh...
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.040]  again when are we going to see the next videos come out
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:59.040]  I'm going to talk to my producer today
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:01.040]  we've been just reeling with the responses
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:03.040]  uh... Reuters just called
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.040]  they want to talk to James Williams
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.040]  uh... the media has been communicating with us
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:09.040]  uh... the supporters
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:11.040]  out there are sending us emails
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:13.040]  uh... you know why they want to talk to James Williams
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:15.040]  they want to somehow twist it
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:17.040]  and attack it or something
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:19.040]  yeah and we're being very sensitive on
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:21.040]  how we distribute James's content
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:23.040]  James seems like a pretty smart guy
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:25.040]  he might not want to talk to the
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:27.040]  by the way I want to get James on this show
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:29.040]  how do we do that Gary I'm going to ask you that off air
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.040]  um... have your producer email me
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.040]  and uh... we'll we'll get that uh...
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:34.040]  connected for you
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:36.040]  yeah well let's just get him on sunday or monday
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:38.040]  let's just uh... or let's
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:40.040]  do an interview today on the nightly news
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.040]  I mean I think it's important before they go
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:44.040]  because they'll go interview him for two hours
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:46.040]  and cut it together to make him look bad
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:48.040]  I mean these are wicked devils we know that
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:50.040]  absolutely and uh... yeah
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:52.040]  just have jaren shoot me an email we'll make sure
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:54.040]  that connection takes place and uh...
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:56.040]  see if we can establish an interview for you
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:58.040]  yeah that's good only because
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.040]  or you guys need to do an extended one right now
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:02.040]  because you know that extended one
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:04.040]  the first extended one to go out there is going to go viral
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:06.040]  versus
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:08.040]  letting them get the first extended
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.040]  interview, edit it, butcher it
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:12.040]  uh... and then try to misrepresent
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:14.040]  because I mean again we're dealing with criminals here
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:16.040]  well look what they did to Ron Paul
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:18.040]  uh... in that CNN clip
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:20.040]  where they claimed that he stormed off
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:22.040]  the interview when you watch the uncut
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:24.040]  version he clearly didn't
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:26.040]  well she also goes back on CNN and says
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.040]  well you saw it he never answered the question
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:30.040]  they edited it he answers it three times
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:32.040]  and this is okay
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:34.040]  I gotta go thanks that's the ten minutes
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:36.040]  and then they cut it before that
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:38.040]  and then never show him answer the question
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:40.040]  CNN thinks their viewers
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:42.040]  are idiots they hate you
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:44.040]  they disrespect you they think you're a joke
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.040]  they love manipulating you
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:48.040]  they count on you being ignorant
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:50.040]  alright gary let me come out there
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:52.040]  and talk to you during the break we got max kaiser coming up
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:54.040]  but yeah in fact I meant to try to work with you today
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:56.040]  to get him on while
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.040]  while we did this show today but there's no time like the
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.040]  presence we might need to go ahead
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:02.040]  and just get his phone number right now
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:04.040]  and do this on the nightly news this evening
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:06.040]  we'll be right hell I'm in Texas I could go down there
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:26.040]  we'll be right back stay with us
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:38.040]  you know I haven't done the standard
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:40.040]  ten top stories of the year but we like
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:42.040]  to do the ten stories we think are really
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.040]  the most important to give our perspective
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:46.040]  on the nightly news this evening
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.040]  I will be doing that seven o'clock central
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:52.040]  if you're not a prison planet dot tv
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:54.040]  subscriber we do have a 15 day free trial
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.040]  running right now and when you
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:58.040]  do become a member it supports the broadcast
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:00.040]  the crew
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:02.040]  we are about to put the ads out there
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:04.040]  to hire some more reporters
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:06.040]  some more editors
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:08.040]  if I could find somebody
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:10.040]  I like to find somebody to host the nightly news
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  a few times a week we have Aaron
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:14.040]  we have Paul Watson we have do doing it
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:16.040]  they do a great job but I'd like to expand it
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:18.040]  and have more than one show
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:20.040]  and we've already are getting the equipment
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:22.040]  thanks to your support to do
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:24.040]  the uploading and the satellite uplink
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:26.040]  stuff but then I've got a discipline the show down to an hour
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:28.040]  we're going to do a 30 minute show
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:30.040]  but it looks like it's going to be an hour every day
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:32.040]  and so we beta tested all that
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:34.040]  for delivery of different satellite
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:36.040]  systems and for some people still
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:38.040]  living in the matrix to get their news
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:40.040]  from mainline satellite or cable
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  so we're definitely expanding
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:44.040]  when the Austin police chief was here
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  he hadn't been here in about a year and a half
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:48.040]  he saw we've expanded over to the other side
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.040]  to about 15,000 almost
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:52.040]  16,000 square feet
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:54.040]  and he's like man looks like you're getting ready to launch an offensive
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:56.040]  and I said you're absolutely right
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:58.040]  to defend the republic and we're just
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:00.040]  one little operation here
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  I mean you saw what Gary French he's doing
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.040]  I mean I remember meeting him in 2006
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.040]  in Chicago
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.040]  and he had he was just getting
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:10.040]  involved at a 9-11
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:12.040]  truth conference he had
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:14.040]  no website no organization
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.040]  no nothing and now he reaches millions
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:18.040]  of people a week with his weekly
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:20.040]  TV show and restore the republic
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:22.040]  and all that again
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:24.040]  he was a he was
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:26.040]  a lost prevention guy at a shopping mall
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:30.040]  just like I was a guy going to community college
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.040]  and didn't like the new world order
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:34.040]  and being taught anti-american garbage
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.040]  and I went over to UT
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:40.040]  to sit in on classes to see if I wanted to pay
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:42.040]  to go there
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:44.040]  and because I was an A student
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:46.040]  could easily get in there and
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:48.040]  it was just all baloney
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.040]  because I've read so many history books on my own
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:52.040]  I'd studied so much on my own
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:54.040]  I wasn't that informed then but compared to the general
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:56.040]  public extremely informed that's what's scary
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.040]  about it I said I'm just going to
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:00.040]  go do an access TV show and start my own media operation
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.040]  boom 17 years later
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:04.040]  here we are it shows the
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:06.040]  power of the individual
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:08.040]  there are people out there listening
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:10.040]  right now that if you
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.040]  decided to take action to dedicate yourself
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:14.040]  to reaching people
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:16.040]  you could dwarf what I've done
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:18.040]  in the next five years
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:20.040]  but you've got to start the journey
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  of a thousand miles with the single
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:24.040]  step
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:26.040]  none of us are perfect none of us have all the answers
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:28.040]  but you've got to take action
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:30.040]  and you've got to keep doing it over and over
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:32.040]  again and if you have
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:34.040]  talent and hard work and everybody's
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:36.040]  got talent in one way or another we all
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:38.040]  have our own gifts and you keep doing it for the
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:40.040]  right reasons build it and they will
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:42.040]  come and that's what it comes
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:44.040]  down to and so
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:46.040]  I want to encourage everybody
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:48.040]  to start a newsletter
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:50.040]  to make documentaries to
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:52.040]  I mean now the technology
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:54.040]  we're going to Max Kaiser that I had
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:56.040]  in 1995
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:58.040]  three-quarter inch tape decks
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:00.040]  a hundred
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:02.040]  dollar used VHS camera
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:04.040]  out there doing my own interviews
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:06.040]  on the street out there exposing corruption
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:08.040]  out there defending the second amendment
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:10.040]  if I had if I
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  was starting now with all the technology
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:14.040]  and all the computers and the
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.040]  cheapness of it all what we could
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.040]  do
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:20.040]  think of what you can do we need
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:22.040]  good people to just
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:24.040]  tackle your own little area of
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:26.040]  corruption just get in its
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:28.040]  face many
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:30.040]  times just getting in its face
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:32.040]  will make it go so wild it'll
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  blow itself up
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:36.040]  evil is easy to defeat
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:38.040]  if you'll just get in the ring with it
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.040]  now
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:42.040]  it might mean you are destroyed
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:44.040]  that happens sometimes not very often
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:46.040]  but let's just say the worst happens
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:48.040]  in your defeat
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:50.040]  always brings massive
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:52.040]  defeat to the enemy on the next
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:54.040]  round by others that see
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  that example just laws of the universe
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.040]  the bigger the sacrifice
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:00.040]  the bigger the result you're going to have
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:02.040]  and
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:04.040]  I'm not saying that's going to happen to you
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:06.040]  chances are nothing's going to
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:08.040]  happen to you or good things are going
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:10.040]  to happen to you
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:12.040]  you've got to be willing
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:14.040]  to get past the fear and take action
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:16.040]  now we're going to end this year's
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:18.040]  radio with Max Kaiser lives over
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:20.040]  in Paris American broadcaster
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:22.040]  filmmaker he's got shows on RT
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.040]  press TV BBC syndicated
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:26.040]  radio
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:28.040]  maxkeiser.com is his website and
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:30.040]  he was of course before he retired a
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:32.040]  successful stockbroker inventor of a
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:34.040]  virtual trading systems used on many
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:36.040]  stock markets today
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:38.040]  and he joins us with some breaking news
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:40.040]  and analysis here at year end
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:42.040]  as we take
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  the plunge and cry havoc
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.040]  and enter the vaunted 2012
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.040]  Max Kaiser good to have you here with us
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:50.040]  hey Alex it's great to
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:52.040]  be with you I'm actually in
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:54.040]  Barcelona Spain I'm sorry that's right
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:56.040]  you told us that five times and of course
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  I got it wrong you're in Barcelona Spain today
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:00.040]  yeah very sunny
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:02.040]  so Stacy and I came down here for a few days
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:04.040]  to catch some sun very hard
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:06.040]  days work for you now continuing
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:08.040]  sir with your analysis
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:10.040]  what do you make of what's going on in the world
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.040]  well
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.040]  a couple of trends that I wanted to bring to
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.040]  your attention we've been talking about on your show for
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:18.040]  a couple of years that are now coming to fruition
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  one is that starting
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:22.040]  in January of next year
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:24.040]  in Chicago there's a new exchange
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:26.040]  that's been approved called NADX
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:28.040]  N-A-D-E-X
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:30.040]  markets trade and political predictions you've
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:32.040]  said this forever here it is from
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:34.040]  USA Today
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:36.040]  yeah so people are going to start to trade
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:38.040]  politicians
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:40.040]  that ask securities
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:42.040]  and the reason this is important is because of course
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:44.040]  all securities markets are manipulated for example
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:46.040]  the in-trade market
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:48.040]  in Dublin has Mitt Romney
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:50.040]  with a 75% probability
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:52.040]  of winning the republican
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:54.040]  nomination and that creates a fake
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:56.040]  feedback loop obviously
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:58.040]  and allows them to gain it and pump
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:00.040]  value into it which is basically
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:02.040]  another fraud
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.040]  exactly right and now this is going to become
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:06.040]  a much bigger market because
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:08.040]  this new CFTC
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.040]  regulated NADX
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:12.040]  in Chicago will be a multi hundred billion
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:14.040]  dollar market we already know
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:16.040]  that is fraud back
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:18.040]  in the 2008 campaign John McCain
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:20.040]  was manipulating the in-trade
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:22.040]  contract in Dublin in his favor
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.040]  and then they'll say we've got to have Mitt Romney
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:26.040]  or whoever be elected because hundreds of billions
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:28.040]  are invested it's too big to fail
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:30.040]  so now everybody's got a domino
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  effect or snowball
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:34.040]  pile on to whoever the scammers
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:36.040]  say that's like 10 years ago
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:38.040]  when they said they were going to trade on terror
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:40.040]  attacks well of course then they get to stage
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:42.040]  them themselves
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:44.040]  well that's another point the terror attacks
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:46.040]  was the policy analysis
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:48.040]  market that John poindexter
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:50.040]  the Pentagon was trying to put in place
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:52.040]  based on my technology the
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:54.040]  virtual specialist technology
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:56.040]  they had such an outcry against it
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:58.040]  that they banned it now
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:00.040]  flash forward a couple of years
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:02.040]  and canter Fitzgerald
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:04.040]  who bought my technology they
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:06.040]  tried to launch canter exchange
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:08.040]  to trade box office features
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:10.040]  but the motion picture association
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:12.040]  America got
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:14.040]  the Congress to ban
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:16.040]  the concept of box office futures exchange
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:18.040]  because they had a lot of emails
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:20.040]  from people who were threatening
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:22.040]  to injure or
[02:51:22.040 --> 02:51:24.040]  to kill talent
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:26.040]  that was trading on the box office futures exchange
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:28.040]  and so the MPAA
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:30.040]  to defend their constituency
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:32.040]  of stars in Hollywood got
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:34.040]  one mafia figured out
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:36.040]  the bigger mafia was going to use this to take them over
[02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:38.040]  right but
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:40.040]  what's funny is that there's no such protection
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:42.040]  for American politicians
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:44.040]  so the assassination risk is quite high
[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:46.040]  people who are short
[02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:48.040]  politicians will want to
[02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:50.040]  you know do injury to them
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:52.040]  to make money on this new Nadex market
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:54.040]  but it was considered
[02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:56.040]  not much of a problem as a Hollywood star
[02:51:56.040 --> 02:51:58.040]  being injured so it shows
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:00.040]  you where America's values are
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:02.040]  you know Gwyneth Paltrow deserves more protection
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:04.040]  than the president of the United States
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:06.040]  clearly because
[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.040]  our own troops breathing DU
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:10.040]  because they're the real enemy they want them to go kill
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:12.040]  people but then they know the troops
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:14.040]  and the actuaries are going to wake up and be a threat to the tyrants
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:16.040]  and so they're glad that they're using
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:18.040]  DU as a soft kill weapon
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:20.040]  that will get rid of them later
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:22.040]  so this will put a price on
[02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:24.040]  all the politicians head
[02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:26.040]  and so this is what's going to
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:28.040]  start up in January and people
[02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:30.040]  and when you come to the next election cycle
[02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:32.040]  because it'll be obvious
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:34.040]  that there's massive fraud
[02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:36.040]  in terms of the misuse of these
[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:38.040]  new securities markets brought to you by the same people
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:40.040]  who are
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:42.040]  not regulated or anything going on
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:44.040]  and this is pure betting just like
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:46.040]  who's going to win the Redskins, the Cowboys
[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:48.040]  the 49ers or the Steelers
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:50.040]  I mean this is just pure gambling
[02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:52.040]  well gambling
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:54.040]  plus derivative markets so you'll be able to leverage
[02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:56.040]  your bet you know if you put on a million
[02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:58.040]  dollar bet you can leverage
[02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:00.040]  that to 10 million or 100 million dollars
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:02.040]  and they run the government so it's too big to fail so it's gambling
[02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:04.040]  with our money and our future
[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:06.040]  yeah and then
[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:08.040]  when the next election is determined that it was completely fraudulent
[02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:10.040]  they'll say we can't investigate
[02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:12.040]  because it'll be a systemic risk to the
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:14.040]  banking system because these Wall Street banks
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:16.040]  have hundreds of billions of dollars
[02:53:16.040 --> 02:53:18.040]  tied into political futures derivatives
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:20.040]  now the derivatives fraud paradigm
[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:22.040]  is invading reality
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:24.040]  and waging war against it
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:26.040]  right and it's now in the
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:28.040]  very machinations of
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:30.040]  the voting and political system
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:32.040]  the democratic systems of America have been
[02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:34.040]  securitized, financialized and turned into
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:36.040]  derivatives and this is all starting up in January
[02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:38.040]  it's a huge
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:40.040]  multi-billion dollar trading platform
[02:53:40.040 --> 02:53:42.040]  in Chicago
[02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:44.040]  I should say not regulated by the CFTC
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:46.040]  and the CME
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:48.040]  the same people who completely missed the
[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:50.040]  MF Global scandal and all the other scandals that came before it
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:52.040]  and this is really
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:54.040]  combining the two worst elements of
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:56.040]  American society, Grafton Washington
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:53:58.040]  and fraud on Wall Street
[02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:00.040]  by the way when you say miss it most the regulators
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:02.040]  just now come out actually got money
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:04.040]  in the pocket from MF Global
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:06.040]  I mean they missed it
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:08.040]  like somebody walking up and punching in the nose
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:10.040]  missed it they know exactly what they're doing
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:12.040]  it's just they're getting so bold now Max
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:14.040]  right
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:16.040]  they're totally conflicted
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:18.040]  absolutely correct
[02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:20.040]  they're pocketing
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:22.040]  because inside information as we recently
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:24.040]  discovered or has been talked about
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:26.040]  in Washington is actually legal
[02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:28.040]  for Congress to trade on material
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:30.040]  inside information in the
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:32.040]  stock market now they'll be able to trade
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:34.040]  on information about themselves
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:36.040]  so Rick Perry could start a rumor
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:38.040]  that he's
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:40.040]  suddenly turned homosexual
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:42.040]  and short himself on the exchange
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:44.040]  and make money on his own false
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:46.040]  rumor and then use that
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:48.040]  proceeds to finance his reelection
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:50.040]  his election campaign as long as there's any
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:52.040]  it's that will invest in it and but they
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:54.040]  don't care because they tell you you're investing in a regular
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:56.040]  pension but really it's being
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:58.040]  leveraged and sold into derivatives
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:00.040]  they've collectively
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.040]  gone insane Max I think this has got to
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:04.040]  implode sometime
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.040]  well they're finding new ways
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:08.040]  to get deeper into
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:10.040]  the daily lives of the average
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:12.040]  American who is now going
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:14.040]  to be confronted with a decision
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.040]  to make when they go to the polling station
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:18.040]  do they vote their pocketbook as they've been
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:20.040]  speculating for the past 12 months
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.040]  in the derivatives political
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:24.040]  futures markets or do they vote
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:26.040]  their conscience and what we've
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:28.040]  discovered is that more and more people because
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:30.040]  they're so far in debt of course
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:32.040]  they're going to vote their pocketbook as a way to get
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:34.040]  out of debt and this is yet another way
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:36.040]  to separate America from its
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:38.040]  identity as something relating
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:40.040]  to the Constitution and again it's
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:42.040]  all done through fractional
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:44.040]  or fiat money changing
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:46.040]  and so the system can create
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:48.040]  just all this fake garbage
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:50.040]  but then get people tied to it so they'll sell
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:52.040]  out their own mother because their entire
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:54.040]  future is tied to the fraud
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:56.040]  you gotta admit it's a genius plan Max
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:58.040]  well I invented it of course it's
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:00.040]  ingenious it's all based on my technology
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:02.040]  the virtual specialist technology pat number
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:04.040]  5950176
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:06.040]  filed and patented in 1996
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:08.040]  and of course now
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:10.040]  my other company the Hollywood Stock Exchange
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:12.040]  is going public
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  for a hundred million dollars
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:16.040]  in the next few weeks
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:18.040]  so it'll give you an idea of what's the technology
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:20.040]  is worth they're now based in Las Vegas
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  so they're going to start trading
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.040]  a whole betting scam
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:26.040]  based on
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:28.040]  a pure betting of Vegas
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:30.040]  style on that technology
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:32.040]  and that's going to be going forward
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:34.040]  and now in the next few weeks as well
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  so the casino
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:38.040]  gulag model
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:40.040]  that I've been talking about for a couple years
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:42.040]  is coming into fruition on the political front
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:44.040]  the entertainment front the gambling front
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:46.040]  because Obama has let it be known
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:48.040]  that he now favors passage
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:50.040]  of bill that will allow
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:52.040]  online gambling that's the big one
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:54.040]  as far as I can see it because this will mean
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:56.040]  that all these people
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:58.040]  glued to their iPhones and iPads
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:00.040]  and online farm bills
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:02.040]  simulated gaming platforms
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:04.040]  will be gambling now with real money
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:06.040]  and this will be the only job
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:08.040]  left in America
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:10.040]  and they don't tell you now when your kids download
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:12.040]  some video games and there's some extra creds
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:14.040]  you got to pay that that's gambling
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.040]  and your child is being taught by the global mafia
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:18.040]  how to gamble they don't tell you that
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:20.040]  it's totally trendy
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:22.040]  it's so cool
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.040]  well not only that but our most students
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.040]  in the UK paying off their student debts
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:28.040]  they're going into prostitution
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:30.040]  yeah I saw that in the BBC and the media is like
[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  this is good
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:34.040]  little Jenny's 21 and she had
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:36.040]  turned six or seven tricks a night
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:38.040]  and it's wonderful
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:40.040]  gambling prostitution and drugs
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:42.040]  mostly it's legal drugs because
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:44.040]  while the latest generation of mood altering
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:46.040]  happy pills etc
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:48.040]  is legalized drugs so you've got
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:50.040]  drugs gambling and prostitution
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:52.040]  the three pillars of the global economy
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:54.040]  now
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:56.040]  brought to you these are the
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:57:58.040]  social gaming platforms
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:00.040]  new online gambling
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:02.040]  but it is like a little red devil
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.040]  in an actual pajamas
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:06.040]  is running this because it's so ridiculously
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:08.040]  destructive and evil
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:10.040]  and almost cartoonishly bad
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:12.040]  I mean take the NDAA
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:14.040]  somebody called in and mentioned this
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:16.040]  and asked if it was true and I'd seen it
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:18.040]  a month ago you know two weeks ago I'd seen
[02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:20.040]  an AP Reuters minor footnote
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:22.040]  that oh by the way the military is going to allow
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:24.040]  the troops to bring their donkey
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:26.040]  their pig whatever as long as it's their own private house
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:28.040]  off base you can marry pigs whatever
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:30.040]  in the military now
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:32.040]  turkeys possums and the
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:34.040]  republican leadership voted for beastiality
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.040]  I mean my point is it's like
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:38.040]  cuckoo land or something
[02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:40.040]  it's like
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:42.040]  it can't get any crazier but it does
[02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:44.040]  max what is going on
[02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:46.040]  I mean now you're not conservative
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:48.040]  like Senator Graham if you're not for
[02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:50.040]  you know marrying possums
[02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:52.040]  well here Donald Rumsfeld
[02:58:52.040 --> 02:58:54.040]  fell in love with one of his horses so they
[02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:56.040]  went ahead and they tried to pass this law
[02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:58.040]  to cover for his beastiality
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:00.040]  and that's what's the whole back story there
[02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:02.040]  are you kidding?
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:04.040]  yes
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:06.040]  well I'm not kidding did you see where the
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:08.040]  NDAA legalizes beastiality
[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:10.040]  yeah no I did see that
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:12.040]  and I'm not exactly sure
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  why they felt it needed to legalize
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:16.040]  the military
[02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:18.040]  having sex with goats in Afghanistan
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:20.040]  except maybe there's some
[02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:22.040]  industry that's about to
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:24.040]  start up in those regions
[02:59:24.040 --> 02:59:26.040]  that we're not quite familiar with
[02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:28.040]  I know that
[02:59:28.040 --> 02:59:30.040]  I mean you can really go
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:32.040]  to town with this and make a lot of
[02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:34.040]  well that could be political correctness training
[02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:36.040]  like they'll teach 8 year olds
[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:38.040]  now I guess in class they already teach
[02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:40.040]  some stuff similar to that so I guess
[02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:42.040]  well we're being bigoted right now
[02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:44.040]  yeah
[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:46.040]  it's a remarkable
[02:59:46.040 --> 02:59:48.040]  story that they felt that it was
[02:59:48.040 --> 02:59:50.040]  necessary to allow the military
[02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:52.040]  to legally
[02:59:52.040 --> 02:59:54.040]  have sex with animals
[02:59:54.040 --> 02:59:56.040]  but I'm not sure exactly what the president
[02:59:56.040 --> 02:59:58.040]  was I'm like
[02:59:58.040 --> 03:00:00.040]  Bob Chapman on this I'm a bit gobsmacked
[03:00:00.040 --> 03:00:02.040]  and startled it's hard to even know how to respond
[03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:04.040]  I'm really flattered you actually
[03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:06.040]  listen to the show Max
[03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:08.040]  alright well let's continue
[03:00:08.040 --> 03:00:10.040]  what do you see coming up in the rest of the year
[03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:12.040]  because I see these articles here
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:14.040]  and how did you
[03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:16.040]  tell this to Cantor but then not ever get
[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:18.040]  paid anything because here it is on record
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:20.040]  these are your inventions so I guess
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:22.040]  that's just they're allowed to have that I guess
[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:24.040]  well they did they engaged
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:26.040]  in an illegal third party
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:28.040]  transaction
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:30.040]  which what happened was basically
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:32.040]  one of my board members
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:34.040]  a guy by the name of Woody Knight
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:36.040]  Howard Woody Knight
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:38.040]  he was loaned $2 million from Cantor
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:40.040]  to invest in
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:42.040]  Hollywood Stock Exchange a preferred issue
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:44.040]  which gave him voting control
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:46.040]  without telling the board that he was doing this
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:48.040]  at the same time
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:50.040]  he was arranging to sell the stock
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:52.040]  in the company as a swap
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.040]  that was arranged so illegal
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:56.040]  it's a fraudulent conveyance
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:58.040]  so he committed massive securities fraud
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:00.040]  well you need to then if that's if you believe
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:02.040]  that's the case you need to do something about it Max
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:04.040]  let's come back get more what you see coming up in the new year
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:06.040]  we'll be right back last radio
[03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:12.040]  show of the year folks 2012 up next
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:14.040]  the Genesis communications radio
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:16.040]  network proudly presents
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:18.040]  the Alex Jones show
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:20.040]  because there's a war on
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:22.040]  for your mind
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:26.040]  alright ladies and gentlemen
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:28.040]  we are back live final second
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:30.040]  this special four-hour transmission
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:32.040]  it's been the last radio show of 2011
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:34.040]  wow that'll take some getting used to
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:36.040]  2012
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:38.040]  and looks like that year is shaping up to be crazy
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:40.040]  they've got the chairman of the joint chiefs
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:42.040]  the head of the Israeli military
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:44.040]  saying they're getting ready to attack Iran
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:46.040]  we've got record gun sales
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:48.040]  all sorts of other bedlam
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:50.040]  but in closing Max Kaiser
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:52.040]  quickly there's any trends you see
[03:01:52.040 --> 03:01:54.040]  in 2012 and what do you make
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:56.040]  of just the all-out hysteria
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:01:58.040]  as the so-called mainstream media
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:00.040]  runs out of bullets
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:02.040]  and is having trouble slowing
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:04.040]  Ron Paul
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:08.040]  yeah they can't seem
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:10.040]  to stop the
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:12.040]  Ron Paul momentum at this point
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:14.040]  but they're going to pull out
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:16.040]  all the stops and they're going to
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  try everything they possibly can
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:20.040]  to stop the Ron Paul express
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:22.040]  from continuing
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:24.040]  and so it'll be quite interesting
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:26.040]  I'd love to see Ron Paul get the nomination
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:28.040]  and then debate
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:30.040]  Barack Obama because I think
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:32.040]  he would be the one guy
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:34.040]  to expose Barack Obama
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:36.040]  as an utter fraud
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:38.040]  and a mere puppet of the banksters
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:40.040]  and because he's just a very
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:42.040]  plain-spoken smart guy
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.040]  who would appeal
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:46.040]  to anybody who's
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:48.040]  interested in
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:50.040]  social justice and some kind
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:52.040]  of return to
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  values as expressed in
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:56.040]  the Constitution
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:58.040]  but he doesn't want to bomb all the brown people
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:00.040]  and turn it into a glass parking lot
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:02.040]  he's racist
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:04.040]  well yeah you know the thing is
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:06.040]  that
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:08.040]  that seems like a very thin
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:10.040]  gruel from
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:12.040]  his opponents to dredge up some
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:14.040]  third-party tangential
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:16.040]  you know bigoted remark
[03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:18.040]  that was made out of context
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:20.040]  I mean that's a quite, that's a Hail Mary past
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:22.040]  you know to try to smear Ron Paul
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:24.040]  well newsletters were the internet of the day
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:26.040]  at one time at the peak of this
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:28.040]  Ron Paul newsletters per week
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:30.040]  I mean people were reading these like newspapers
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:32.040]  it was a giant business and political
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:34.040]  and most of these were the supplements
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:36.040]  there's only nine of them
[03:03:36.040 --> 03:03:38.040]  they were the supplement promo
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.040]  letters sent out by a company
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.040]  hard to promote it the media knows that
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:44.040]  that's why they're discredited scum
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:46.040]  well that's also rather
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:48.040]  duplicitous because
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:50.040]  what do you have now you have people like Michelle Bachman
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:52.040]  you know making incredible
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:54.040]  racist comments about Arabs
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:56.040]  making racist comments
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:58.040]  about Arabs today is
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:00.040]  considered to be
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:02.040]  du regour you know it's like oh this is
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:04.040]  perfectly acceptable
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:06.040]  it's just that America's tastes
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:08.040]  in the racism
[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:10.040]  has changed which is not to say that
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:12.040]  there's any connection at all
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:14.040]  to be made with the
[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:16.040]  what was going on 20 years ago in the
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  Paul camp but you know America
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:20.040]  you know going back to the American Indians
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:22.040]  and the slavery days up to
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:24.040]  present day is built on
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:26.040]  racism that's what the America stands
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:28.040]  for to the rest of the world I mean I live
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:30.040]  outside of America and the first thing
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:32.040]  people think of when they think of America is
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:34.040]  racist country that commit
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:36.040]  genocide not once but twice
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:38.040]  with the American Indian
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:40.040]  and then the slave trade so
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:42.040]  it's not like this is new for the American
[03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:44.040]  people now they want to commit genocide in the
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:46.040]  Middle East with their with their friends
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:48.040]  and their well now we're in the NDAA though
[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:50.040]  there's always every culture's always wants to
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:52.040]  grab some group that it's okay to basically
[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:54.040]  hunt I mean humans are such
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:56.040]  predators will engage in predator
[03:04:56.040 --> 03:04:58.040]  or preditate upon ourselves that's a human
[03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:00.040]  trait but you're right the United States
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:02.040]  certainly has its
[03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:04.040]  history of that and now the
[03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:06.040]  NDAA I mean look at that Max
[03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:08.040]  everything we talked about now happening
[03:05:08.040 --> 03:05:10.040]  will secretly arrest you the military
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:12.040]  will come after you I mean that's what
[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:14.040]  every third world nation falls to Max
[03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:16.040]  well as I've been saying
[03:05:16.040 --> 03:05:18.040]  on your show for a few years you know
[03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:20.040]  there's two choice fight or flee
[03:05:20.040 --> 03:05:22.040]  for personally I took I made the choice
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:24.040]  of fleeing you know I'm not living
[03:05:24.040 --> 03:05:26.040]  we're out of time great job
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:28.040]  look forward to talking to you in the new year
[03:05:28.040 --> 03:05:30.040]  God bless there goes Max Kaiser by the way
