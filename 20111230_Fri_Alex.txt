[00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.153]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:09.894]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:13.035]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.237]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:21.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:35.371]  Well, it's my final radio transmission of Big 2011.
[00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:39.259]  And we descend into 2012.
[00:00:39.259 --> 00:01:02.786]  I don't buy into all the Mayan calendar mumbo-jumbo, but the globalists in the UN certainly do, the occultists that run this planet, and they are just skittering around trying to get their world police state and massive World War III bloodletting extravaganza fiasco lined up for everyone.
[00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:07.500]  And we've got quite the transmission lined up for you.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.887]  You know, for the first, I don't know, 13 years or so of my radio broadcast, or 14 years, I did three hours every day.
[00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:19.549]  And then for a couple years I went to four hours.
[00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.573]  And so a lot of stations are programmed to pick up the full four hours, and some days I do the fourth hour, most days I don't.
[00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:26.095]  But today I will be doing the fourth hour.
[00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:31.199]  And for stations that go off at the third hour, that's fine.
[00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:38.602]  It's always archived at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com with the free audio podcast right there.
[00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:51.768]  But we do have a big broadcast lined up for you today, and it will be the last radio show of 2011, obviously, because tomorrow is the big run-up to New Year's Eve.
[00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:54.849]  And then on Sunday, why, it'll be January 1st, 2012.
[00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:08.598]  So quite interesting to have that approaching us before we know it'll be 2013 and according to the mainstream media we won't be here anymore.
[00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:09.418]  You know what?
[00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:15.919]  I'm making a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to use the term mainstream media.
[00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:21.821]  I've had that beaten into my head over the years, we all have, and it's become a term that means discredited,
[00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:31.671]  That means simpering, that means deceptive, that means that it is bought and paid for.
[00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.333]  But it's not mainstream media.
[00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:41.138]  It is zombie brainwashing transmissions.
[00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:47.763]  It is the system that attempts to keep people in their cultural, psychological, spiritual trance state.
[00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:51.746]  That the general public that's not fully awakened is in.
[00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:56.351]  Now the public has woken up the fact the government's run by a bunch of lying criminals.
[00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:02.237]  And that's in all the polls and statistics, but the people have no idea on average just how rancid
[00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:05.735]  This rabbit hole is.
[00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:19.302]  They're just smelling around the hole, the entrance, and smell the stench of rotten meat and hear the howls of pain down the verminous entrance.
[00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:24.905]  The verminous, viperous, cavernous opening.
[00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:41.389]  But if you try to plumb the depths of it, it is bottomless, because evil is bottomless in its inventiveness and its endless grasping for more carnage, more pain, more destruction, and its attacks on everything good and decent.
[00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.632]  And it is the naivete of those of us that are good that allows this great evil to grow at an exponential growth curve.
[00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:48.873]  Okay, I'm gonna stop preaching.
[00:03:48.873 --> 00:03:54.276]  It's just, when you behold the beast, you're in wonderment, just as
[00:03:56.391 --> 00:04:00.754]  I guess one of the prophets was on the Isle of Patmos.
[00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:05.338]  John the Revelator was in awe and marveled at the beast.
[00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:14.204]  And let me tell you, if you even see one one-millionth of the New World Order for your own eyes, you will be in wonderment as well.
[00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:20.509]  I guess you'd be in wonderment if you watched a baby, a newborn baby fed into a blender.
[00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.692]  That doesn't quite capture it, but it gives you
[00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:34.346]  The subtle hint, the first trappings of a scent.
[00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:34.906]  We're going to break.
[00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:40.287]  When we come back, we'll tell you who's up today on the transmission.
[00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:42.587]  Oh, it's a big broadcast today.
[00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:49.689]  Not one, not two, not three, not four, but five guests and your phone calls and the
[00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:00.923]  Remnant of the so-called mainstream media's attack on myself and Ron Paul, Slimeball, Mr. Matthews.
[00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:03.707]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:06.491]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:43.105]  Well, we were just watching Fox News, and there we've got multiple TVs on, monitoring the dinosaur mind control media, and we were able to DVR Ron Paul signing a InfoWars.com t-shirt, and we just showed you some of that.
[00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:46.648]  And if you're a new radio listener, and you're going, you just showed us that?
[00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:48.369]  Wow, radio with pictures.
[00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:49.130]  Yes, that's what
[00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:09.041]  The 21st century is, and I've been doing this for 16 years or more, but now you see every other radio talk show host moving in that direction, not just with a document cam or a studio cam, but with multiple five-camera shoots, media feeds in to track it in real time.
[00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:13.142]  All of it right here, in-studio guests, you name it.
[00:06:13.142 --> 00:06:16.823]  That is what we have pioneered here at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:16.823 --> 00:06:33.209]  So if you are a radio listener on XM, or AM, or FM, out there, or shortwave, you can always go to PrisonPlanet.tv and actually watch the three-hour radio show as well.
[00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.409]  And this will be the last radio show of 2011.
[00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:38.853]  And so it's quite a whopper.
[00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:46.399]  I'm doing a fourth hour today that'll be PrisonPlanet.TV and internet only.
[00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:52.083]  I know actually it's on the satellite so some stations do carry the fourth hour actually.
[00:06:52.083 --> 00:07:01.850]  But we'll be doing a full four hours today and then I'll do my final media operation of 2011, the InfoWars Nightly News this evening.
[00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:24.230]  We have Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst and morning briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush on a breakdown of what's happening with Iran and the Strait of Hormuz drills they're doing and the US aircraft carrier a day and a half ago that went through the middle of their drills in a big provocation and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of course coming on a week ago and saying
[00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:32.373]  That we're ready to attack Iran and probably will the Council on Foreign Relations a week ago Officially with the headline time to attack Iran.
[00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:36.915]  That's the headline Israel saying they're ready and it's on
[00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:52.145]  It's on, and of course the establishment will undoubtedly stage some domestic terror attacks and use that to then have the TSA activate on the streets, which they're already beta testing, and the hands are going in the pants.
[00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:54.687]  And again, to explain what's happening with all of this,
[00:07:55.267 --> 00:08:12.161]  The global megabanks that are setting up the New World Order world government system in their own documents that are public are waging war against all nation states, against the family, against farmers, against Amish, against sovereign countries, against anything that hasn't been taken over by them.
[00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:18.926]  It's a total domination corporate takeover model of the species, of the genetic code, of the environment.
[00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:25.693]  GMO, forced inoculations, it is total scientific tyranny in their own words.
[00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:31.519]  That's what they call it, a scientific dictatorship in their own UN Documents Club of Rome that we've covered here at Nauseam.
[00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.200]  This is what you're dealing with.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.788]  Absolute, total rewriting of the planet, of life, of the family, the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.409]  That's the new world order.
[00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.511]  It's a bold goal.
[00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:59.303]  But the British Royalty and others, 160 years ago, went to the top professors in England, we cover it in Endgame, and said, we have a global empire, show us how to scientifically deconstruct humanity so it's impossible to resist.
[00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.946]  And the establishment said, well, we're going to study that for you.
[00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:04.067]  Scientific system.
[00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:09.853]  And they wrote hundreds and hundreds of books on it, and that is the system we now live under, and we're very deep into it.
[00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:14.581]  And somebody like Ron Paul comes along and says the Emperor's not wearing any clothes.
[00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:20.566]  Like in the Emperor's New Clothes parable, it's a three-year-old, you know, points out and says the Emperor's wearing no clothes.
[00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:25.330]  But no one else wanted to admit he was running around in parades in his underwear.
[00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.591]  That's simplifying the parable.
[00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.253]  If you don't know it, go look it up.
[00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:29.914]  It'll describe what we're dealing with.
[00:09:29.914 --> 00:09:33.357]  And they howl with anger and say it is insane.
[00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:39.506]  And that, you know, Ron Paul is just a horrible demon who is so extreme.
[00:09:39.506 --> 00:09:50.379]  But the truth is, the people running our government... I saw an RT interview a few days ago with Richard Perl saying, yes, we're getting ready to attack Iran, one of the main architects of the Iraq War.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:05.529]  This is a guy who's even been in the New York Times, they've reported, comes up to good-looking women at DC cocktail parties, and I mean, he looks like a 400-pound demon with giant black circles around his eyes.
[00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:10.272]  He talks with a lisping, bad-guy voice.
[00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:13.555]  He is everything that evil is, a big, demonic wimp.
[00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:19.867]  And he comes up to good-looking women and goes from woman to woman and says, I devastated Iraq.
[00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:20.910]  I've killed millions.
[00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.673]  I basically have killed millions.
[00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:23.335]  I'm powerful.
[00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:29.801]  And the women almost vomit on him, even though they're sycophantic globalists, they understand this is disgusting.
[00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:39.667]  This is a big, nerdly, obese wimp who couldn't fight his way out of an invisible bag, a non-existent paper bag.
[00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:44.691]  He couldn't win a fight with the atmosphere, you know, with a vapor.
[00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:49.847]  And he walks up bragging about how he's got power and kills people.
[00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:53.708]  I mean, this is what good people's weakness has created.
[00:10:53.708 --> 00:11:13.432]  Fat, weak, disgusting, demonic blobs who looks like a over-gorged vampire that's like eaten 5,000 children or something and loves his own voice and has that same Dick Cheney, you know, affected voice like it's all real calculated and thought out.
[00:11:13.432 --> 00:11:13.632]  No!
[00:11:14.252 --> 00:11:20.255]  You got a bunch of spiritually blind people and you're not powerful because you can lead them over the edge of a cliff, boy.
[00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:21.815]  Okay?
[00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:22.616]  I see you.
[00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:25.397]  I see how pathetically weak you are.
[00:11:25.397 --> 00:11:28.498]  And I see Chris Matthews and how pathetically weak you are.
[00:11:28.498 --> 00:11:35.681]  And when Chris Matthews talked about yours truly, you could see the fear in his eyes.
[00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.122]  They are scared.
[00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:38.616]  You know why?
[00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:40.998]  Because they got one that can see.
[00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:50.687]  They got one that doesn't care about their torture squads and their death squads, who isn't afraid of them, and who is just standing right in their face.
[00:11:50.687 --> 00:11:53.630]  I'm not up here bragging, beating my chest, saying bring it on.
[00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.391]  I'm not saying bring it on.
[00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.614]  I'm bringing it to you!
[00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:58.034]  Okay?
[00:11:58.034 --> 00:11:58.755]  I'm committed!
[00:12:00.089 --> 00:12:04.932]  I got my helmet on, I got my breastplate on, I got my sword, and I'm coming at you.
[00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:06.573]  And I'm not gonna stop.
[00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:07.233]  I'm committed.
[00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:07.854]  You know why?
[00:12:07.854 --> 00:12:10.035]  Because it's a good feeling.
[00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:20.142]  My soul, when I'm not fearful, my soul, when I'm focused and committed for all the innocence that you maggots have fed on, my soul says, good job!
[00:12:20.142 --> 00:12:23.203]  And the universe looks at me and says, yes!
[00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:30.368]  And I can feel that connection, and that's what it's all about, is the choice I've made.
[00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:48.899]  And by the way, folks, if you think you're on the side of good, you think you've made that choice, if you are not compelled, possessed, driven to fight evil and corruption, and when you do wrong, if your conscience doesn't anguish you, then you are not
[00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:50.842]  Living in the light.
[00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:52.285]  I'm going to stop preaching right there.
[00:12:52.285 --> 00:12:55.589]  Just in these times, it just, it comes down to good and evil.
[00:12:55.589 --> 00:12:57.011]  It comes down to good and evil.
[00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:01.879]  It comes down to good and evil and recognizing evil.
[00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:03.040]  The devil's greatest trip.
[00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:07.597]  And Trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[00:13:07.597 --> 00:13:13.923]  And even if you don't believe in a physical, spiritual entity, the point is that's how evil operates.
[00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:15.605]  That's how psychopaths operate.
[00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:24.634]  Wearing their suits and ties, driving their conservative cars, you know, good at talking to the cops, good at talking to their neighbors, silver tongued, but they're devils!
[00:13:25.814 --> 00:13:28.297]  Yeah, I got wise, as Elvis said.
[00:13:28.297 --> 00:13:30.980]  You're a devil in disguise.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.902]  Oh, oh yes you are.
[00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:35.425]  And I am coming at you.
[00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:36.586]  Coming at you.
[00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:37.227]  Coming at you.
[00:13:37.227 --> 00:13:38.828]  Coming straight on.
[00:13:38.828 --> 00:13:43.374]  And I am here to get others to stand up and to wake up and to activate and come straight on for you.
[00:13:43.374 --> 00:13:43.534]  Now,
[00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:48.864]  I'm going to get into the incredible record gun sales.
[00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:50.767]  I'm going to get into the amazing Iran news.
[00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:54.971]  We've got Gerald Salente coming on again to give us, he didn't finish all his trends for 2012.
[00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:59.957]  Lindsey Williams coming back on with his trends for 2012 and to take your phone calls.
[00:13:59.957 --> 00:14:02.841]  Bob Chapman will have open phones for that and I go into fourth hour.
[00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:03.582]  Gary Franchi.
[00:14:04.122 --> 00:14:13.088]  Who's running that great TV ad showing the black fella that the racist at the hospital wouldn't take care of him, but Ron Paul would and then and then waive the bill.
[00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:15.750]  So just by the way, out of folks that know Ron Paul, that's what he did.
[00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:21.814]  He would volunteer about a third of his time like you're supposed to at charity hospitals.
[00:14:21.814 --> 00:14:24.356]  By the way, my dad always has done that.
[00:14:24.356 --> 00:14:25.877]  And then others don't do what they're supposed to.
[00:14:25.877 --> 00:14:29.999]  So he's always mobbed by people wanting free dentistry.
[00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:32.901]  But that's what you're supposed to do when you sign up as a physician.
[00:14:34.002 --> 00:14:34.087]  Yeah.
[00:14:34.648 --> 00:14:35.149]  I don't know.
[00:15:06.223 --> 00:15:09.328]  And then separately having his own practice.
[00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:11.151]  Okay, that's what humanity is about.
[00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:14.416]  And we've got Franchi coming on about that with a super PAC.
[00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:16.219]  And I know a lot of our listeners have supported it.
[00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:20.065]  But when we come back, I'm going to play the sniveling creature.
[00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:25.577]  I almost wish he had the light of burning enjoyment of what he's doing.
[00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:38.566]  It's almost more creepy that you can see that Matthews is this empty teleprompter reading Democratic Party operative husk who is just part of the system and is scared and going along with it.
[00:15:38.566 --> 00:15:44.169]  Most of these people are just ghoul, golem-like slaves to the evil.
[00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:47.392]  I can't imagine how hellish their lives must be.
[00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:55.955]  I cannot imagine what it's like to be on your back 100% to every form of evil.
[00:15:55.955 --> 00:16:07.300]  I mean, Chris Matthews is just such a truly psychically and spiritually crippled person.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.660]  He's a mess.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:15.363]  There are people like Pearl who enjoy the evil and are gorged on it, and I can hate them.
[00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:19.318]  Because they're just a pure demonic creature.
[00:16:19.318 --> 00:16:26.805]  But when you look at Matthews, he's this person who you know once had some humanity, and you can see the humanity twisted through him.
[00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:28.667]  And you can, it's just like a wreck.
[00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:38.017]  It's like a burnout old classic car, you know, that like rats are nesting in or something.
[00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:38.758]  It's unbelievable.
[00:16:39.862 --> 00:16:54.346]  So we're going to play him, and he goes to this lazy-eyed, dim-witted twit with the appeal to authority and asks, is Alex Jones and Ron Paul credible, what they're saying.
[00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:58.287]  I mean, it is pathetic how weak they are.
[00:16:58.287 --> 00:16:59.788]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:17:11.104 --> 00:17:11.493]  Okay!
[00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:23.473]  I normally wouldn't even get into what old dinosaur propaganda arm zombie programming media engages in.
[00:17:23.473 --> 00:17:25.114]  It's not mainstream media.
[00:17:25.114 --> 00:17:27.075]  For years, they've had tiny audiences.
[00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:31.878]  Infowars.com alone is roughly 15 times the visitors.
[00:17:31.878 --> 00:17:36.920]  You can go to Alexa.com or Google Analytics that MSNBC.com does.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.382]  Their top shows might have a couple hundred thousand viewers.
[00:17:39.382 --> 00:17:40.723]  They are a joke!
[00:17:41.423 --> 00:17:42.083]  They are a joke.
[00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.985]  This show has 3 million a day.
[00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:48.866]  I've got films online with 35, 40 million views.
[00:17:48.866 --> 00:18:00.252]  But, when he goes to Iowa for his little meeting, Chris Matthews, there's all these Iowans, well-meaning people, they're like, it's exciting and clapping.
[00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:05.214]  Oh my gosh, they're in a little cafe with Chris Matthews!
[00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:06.935]  It's so amazing!
[00:18:08.243 --> 00:18:12.347]  I mean, they could be on some local radio show and probably have more listeners.
[00:18:12.347 --> 00:18:13.608]  But they're all there.
[00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:15.029]  They're on national TV.
[00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:27.821]  So it's the ghost of what it was to be on television in, say, the 70s, where you had three networks and there were probably 40 million people watching the nightly news.
[00:18:27.821 --> 00:18:30.243]  And you notice it was the same script on every channel.
[00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:38.467]  All Department of Defense, brainwashing, Pentagon, anti-American, baloney.
[00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:41.688]  The foreign banks took us over a long time ago.
[00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:46.929]  All these wars are about destroying America, destroying Iran, destroying all these countries.
[00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:50.630]  The bankers sit above it and play us off against each other.
[00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.250]  And Matthews knows that.
[00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.231]  He was a top advisor to Jimmy Carter.
[00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:58.667]  Matthews knows all of this is pure bull.
[00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.748]  He knows he's there sniping at a good man like Ron Paul.
[00:19:01.748 --> 00:19:06.029]  So they imply he's a big racist all day, then they shift into, what about the extremism?
[00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:12.951]  And he talks to the Republican Party chairman there, who actually overall seemed pretty fair and said, I don't think it's kooky to like Ron Paul.
[00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.892]  You know, people have their right to like him if they do.
[00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:30.012]  But then he has this other media pundit there with one of the so-called MSM groups and you just look at her and I'm not trying to be mean to her but I mean I wonder if she knows how to tie her shoelaces.
[00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:46.289]  And then Matthews asked her in this appeal to authority, as they all prop each other up with their little dwindling, tiny remnant audiences, the shadow of what they were, well, is it credible that he's saying that it's baloney, the whole Iranian plot on the Alex Jones Show?
[00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:50.491]  And she's like, I don't know if it is.
[00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:58.793]  Now, what's funny is, in our article about this, we have Chris Matthews attempts to destroy Ron Paul's campaign, devotes large portion of program to latest smear attempt,
[00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:03.934]  You know, they act like we're crazy to say that was staged with the Iranian car salesman.
[00:20:06.323 --> 00:20:11.507]  But then we have under it the New York Times saying no one was buying it.
[00:20:11.507 --> 00:20:13.229]  Here it is, New York Times.
[00:20:13.229 --> 00:20:13.709]  U.S.
[00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:17.492]  challenged to explain accusations of Iranian plot in the face of skepticism.
[00:20:17.492 --> 00:20:20.695]  And it goes through all these Bush-Clinton officials saying it's bull.
[00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:23.897]  It goes through, I mean, Anthony Schafer, Colonel Schafer talked to the FBI.
[00:20:23.897 --> 00:20:24.938]  They said it was made up.
[00:20:24.938 --> 00:20:26.720]  And it turned out it was made up.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.462]  Again, verified reality.
[00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:31.964]  And they say, ooh, Ron Paul, this is crazy.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:42.487]  So let's go ahead and go to a small clip of them trying to control reality and dictate to you from their perch that they control reality.
[00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:48.772]  And if they say black is white, it is because Chris control freak chicken neck Matthews said so.
[00:20:48.772 --> 00:20:49.153]  Here it is.
[00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:50.409]  Difficulty?
[00:20:50.409 --> 00:20:51.350]  Of course he would.
[00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.732]  Erin, what about with the young people?
[00:20:52.732 --> 00:20:55.674]  Would they still say, well maybe there is something to these theories?
[00:20:55.674 --> 00:21:00.939]  I don't think they're paying close attention to that thing, but also, look, there are five days left until the caucuses.
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:08.006]  When Herman Cain was being targeted for the allegations of sexual harassment, it took a month for him to fall down in the polls and get out of the race.
[00:21:08.006 --> 00:21:09.668]  We only have five days left.
[00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:13.131]  So you think bad news about a candidate can't, in the short term, bring him down?
[00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:19.655]  Well, in this point we're talking about Rick Perry changing his position on abortion and talking about whether or not Romney can now win Iowa.
[00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:22.317]  All these other things that are happening, these dynamics, the last few days.
[00:21:22.317 --> 00:21:23.258]  I don't think it's going to matter.
[00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:23.978]  Let's get some evidence here.
[00:21:23.978 --> 00:21:33.985]  Ron Paul has never endorsed the 9-11 Truth Remover explicitly, but when offered the chance to repudiate those theories, the ones like the White House had something to do with blowing up the World Trade Centers, here's what he said.
[00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:37.988]  Let's watch as he responds when confronted with a question about 9-11.
[00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:46.934]  Because I can't handle the controversy.
[00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:51.937]  I have the Federal Reserve to deal with.
[00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:58.642]  Because, you know, I just have too many things on my plate.
[00:22:00.228 --> 00:22:07.432]  Ron Paul is also a repeat guest on the radio show of Alex Jones, now who has suggested the United States government was involved in 9-11 attacks.
[00:22:07.432 --> 00:22:15.317]  Earlier this month, Ron Paul discussed with Jones the recent plot, allegedly by Iranian operatives to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington.
[00:22:15.317 --> 00:22:21.380]  Paul called the whole story that they were out to get the Saudi ambassador a propaganda stunt.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.342]  Let's listen to the two of them, Alex Jones and Ron Paul.
[00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:31.903]  There was this so-called attempt to kill the Iranian ambassador.
[00:22:31.903 --> 00:22:35.684]  That kind of stuff is just way too much.
[00:22:35.684 --> 00:22:51.869]  Even mainstream media had to admit that was totally phony and a pretext to attack Iran.
[00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:53.650]  You know, I've got to say, 2011,
[00:22:55.948 --> 00:23:01.989]  More than any other year has been when the New World Order global technocrats came out in the open.
[00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:18.453]  Thousands of articles, literally, in the last year, I mean hundreds and hundreds a week, where they just say, yes, there's a private corporate world government, kind of like The Economist magazine last month, we showed it to you here on air, and read the quotes where they said, I gotta dig that back out, I know it was in here.
[00:23:18.453 --> 00:23:20.974]  In fact, here it is right here.
[00:23:20.974 --> 00:23:22.274]  Still haven't got it out of the office.
[00:23:24.054 --> 00:23:28.016]  Here's the issue of The Economist.
[00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:29.416]  It comes out weekly.
[00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:33.618]  This was the November 19th to the 25th edition.
[00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:42.121]  And in here they say, yeah, technocracy was run by the communists and others, but that's basically what we need.
[00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:48.984]  And they know best, and this is what we're going to have to do in Europe and the U.S.
[00:23:48.984 --> 00:23:50.105]  and worldwide.
[00:23:50.105 --> 00:23:52.986]  Governments are just going to have to be rubber stamps to the experts.
[00:23:54.036 --> 00:24:09.480]  Oh, the experts that just so happen to be control freak finance oligarch Ponzi scheme creators who rationalize all their destructive activity through a cosmology of social Darwinistic eugenics?
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.920]  I mean, that's what they're into.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:19.122]  It's a cosmology of psychopaths, sadists, and an army of sociopaths that work for them.
[00:24:19.122 --> 00:24:20.783]  You're like, oh, don't say it's that bad.
[00:24:20.783 --> 00:24:22.143]  Have you ever read a history book?
[00:24:23.322 --> 00:24:24.803]  I mean, do you know what happened in the last century?
[00:24:24.803 --> 00:24:27.006]  Government's killed over 200 million people.
[00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:33.352]  Government is the number one cause of death, of unnatural death.
[00:24:33.352 --> 00:24:35.414]  I mean, it's second to none.
[00:24:35.414 --> 00:24:37.216]  It's right there with automobiles.
[00:24:37.216 --> 00:24:39.919]  But, you know, we die because we like to drive, and I understand it.
[00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.500]  Life's about a risk-taking.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.723]  But government killing you
[00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:47.925]  Killing you!
[00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:50.030]  Working you to death in a slave camp!
[00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:56.724]  That is a bonafide fact and the Founding Fathers warned us about government being the most dangerous thing for special interests to get control of it.
[00:24:57.773 --> 00:25:06.179]  Because then you don't have to make a better car engine, or come out with a better book, or a better philosophy, or a better baseball, or a better mousetrap.
[00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:08.441]  No, you just run the government, you run everything.
[00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:12.364]  This is high-tech tyranny with super fancy public relations.
[00:25:12.364 --> 00:25:14.685]  But the public relations is wearing thin.
[00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:25.934]  So now in 2011, they passed NDAA, and they said, yeah, there's a world government, privately run, we're getting rid of freedom, and yeah, we'll secretly arrest citizens if we want, and yeah, we are setting up checkpoints everywhere.
[00:25:26.514 --> 00:25:32.577]  And yeah, we are going to probably have a bank holiday in the future and devalue the dollar.
[00:25:32.577 --> 00:25:36.179]  A couple days ago we read from Bernanke's speech where he said he will devalue the dollar.
[00:25:37.438 --> 00:25:40.660]  And then separately, he has his talking head saying, we're not devaluing.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:50.226]  But when he actually goes and talks to The Economist, he tells the truth on C-SPAN, like real people, you know, out there on the street aren't watching that.
[00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:54.850]  So they have the stuff they put on ABC and Fox News, and then they, that's pure bull.
[00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:02.355]  And then they have, when they're actually talking to each other, at meetings, they'll even put it on TV, knowing maybe 50,000 people are watching it.
[00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:04.356]  And so what, they won't understand what they're hearing.
[00:26:05.882 --> 00:26:07.523]  This is what's crazy about what we're talking about.
[00:26:07.523 --> 00:26:17.249]  Now, coming up after Gerald Cilente leaves us here in just about 30 minutes, Iran is launching the seventh day of its naval drills with Helleborn operations.
[00:26:17.249 --> 00:26:19.931]  Gun sales hit all-time records.
[00:26:19.931 --> 00:26:24.794]  1,534,000 FBI checks for gun sales.
[00:26:24.794 --> 00:26:29.297]  They sold 500-plus thousand in a six-day period.
[00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:33.900]  And in a survey, they said because they're worried about civil unrest and a collapsing government.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.321]  The American people, folks, know the government's criminal.
[00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:39.903]  And it's not going to get away with this martial law scenario.
[00:26:39.903 --> 00:26:41.483]  We're going to talk about that, too.
[00:26:41.483 --> 00:26:49.247]  But joining us is Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com to go over his 12 trends of 2012 coming up.
[00:26:51.728 --> 00:26:56.811]  Because you only got to a few of them, I'd like you to start over and go through those with us today.
[00:26:56.811 --> 00:26:58.252]  TrendsResearch.com.
[00:26:58.252 --> 00:27:00.014]  Gerald, thanks for joining us today.
[00:27:00.014 --> 00:27:01.274]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[00:27:01.274 --> 00:27:13.042]  And just to let you know, I've turned down a number of requests for interviews on the major media, on TV, because I just don't want to associate with them anymore.
[00:27:13.042 --> 00:27:17.085]  And so I'd much rather be on with you and others like you.
[00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:20.946]  And so that's part of my New Year's resolution.
[00:27:20.946 --> 00:27:29.029]  They keep calling me up and asking me to come on, and I just tell them I'm busy, I'm not coming on, and that's the end of it.
[00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:34.692]  I'm not going to be a part of that scam anymore, and it's just not...
[00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:39.294]  It doesn't do me, it doesn't do anybody any good.
[00:27:39.294 --> 00:27:44.976]  Even though it's very beneficial financially for me to do it, it's just not worth it.
[00:27:44.976 --> 00:28:03.285]  And I'd rather be on with you, who tells it like it is, and makes it so clear, and put your neck on the line, because this thing is going down, and there are very few people like yourself, that are willing to really tell the truth about how bad it really is,
[00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:10.709]  And then people like myself who do trend forecasting to say how bad it's going to get.
[00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:11.589]  Well, yes, sir.
[00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.891]  And again, we appreciate you.
[00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:23.656]  People need to appreciate Ron Paul, yourself, myself, and others who are willing to state the obvious fact because it's only going to make things worse if we don't face the hard facts.
[00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:26.178]  But I think you've hit on something central here, Gerald.
[00:28:26.178 --> 00:28:29.479]  And I'd like you to expand on this and then get into your trends for 2012 and the report.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.021]  I think?
[00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:51.840]  It's something I do a lot now when they call me occasionally to come on.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:29:01.904]  I just don't even return their calls in many cases because they really are a joke and it's time that that MSM label go away and they really are prostitutes.
[00:29:01.904 --> 00:29:02.864]  That's all they are.
[00:29:02.864 --> 00:29:08.846]  And look at what happened with the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:29:08.846 --> 00:29:10.947]  It barely got any coverage at all.
[00:29:11.647 --> 00:29:20.409]  And by the way, in this new trends journal, the one coming out, the top trends of 2012, as you well know, we're talking about safe havens.
[00:29:20.409 --> 00:29:23.689]  And people have been, keep coming to me and say, how about Argentina?
[00:29:23.689 --> 00:29:25.389]  How about Argentina?
[00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:29.850]  I said, you know, I was down there about a year and a half ago, and it's not the right place.
[00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.810]  Anything could change at any time.
[00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:37.431]  And I have really a history of clamping down on people, but a lot of people are still going down there.
[00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:40.372]  Well, guess what they just came out with two days ago?
[00:29:41.132 --> 00:29:49.298]  They passed a law that copies the National Defense Authorization Act and then trumps it.
[00:29:49.298 --> 00:29:56.744]  Do you remember my story of telling you about my last episode and trying to get my money out of the bank with HSBC?
[00:29:56.744 --> 00:29:57.644]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:57.644 --> 00:29:59.466]  Well, now in Argentina...
[00:30:00.836 --> 00:30:10.864]  You could get 15 years in jail for taking your money out of the bank if they don't like the way you're taking it out.
[00:30:10.864 --> 00:30:18.991]  You can get 15 years in jail now in Argentina for protesting against the government.
[00:30:18.991 --> 00:30:25.477]  What I'm saying is, Alex, it's clamping down all over the world.
[00:30:25.477 --> 00:30:28.840]  In Hungary, democracy is shut.
[00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:33.933]  They have this government in there in the last several weeks.
[00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:40.795]  They've been jamming through legislation that's cutting out other opposition media.
[00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:43.756]  It's putting clamps on people's dissent.
[00:30:43.756 --> 00:30:46.636]  It's going on worldwide.
[00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:55.559]  And the reason it's clamping down, as they've done with here in the good old U.S.S.A., is because
[00:30:56.639 --> 00:31:06.672]  They know that the financial Ponzi scheme is collapsing, and they are going to do everything they can to quell dissent.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.603]  You're right, Gerald, and people always say, you know, let's get out of the country.
[00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:12.864]  My wife has said that before.
[00:31:12.864 --> 00:31:16.327]  She's very intelligent, and I understand the instinct.
[00:31:16.327 --> 00:31:22.452]  CNN and others, other globalist outlets have reported that there are record numbers of people leaving.
[00:31:22.452 --> 00:31:27.196]  But the issue is, this is a global corporate kleptocrat model.
[00:31:27.196 --> 00:31:29.097]  There's global standardization.
[00:31:29.097 --> 00:31:32.080]  And as you pointed out, the exact same stuff's being done.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.542]  In Eastern Europe, in Costa Rica, in Central America, in Australia, in Germany, in England.
[00:31:40.542 --> 00:31:42.643]  It's all carbon copy.
[00:31:42.643 --> 00:31:50.185]  And there's the headline, new Argentine law adopted, broad definition of terrorism, including taking your money out of the bank.
[00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:51.146]  So that's it.
[00:31:51.146 --> 00:31:59.548]  I mean, worldwide authoritarianism is here because the very same financial crooks are running it.
[00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:01.569]  And so we got to stand and fight, basically.
[00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:05.847]  Yes, and let's again, we'll call them by their proper name.
[00:32:05.847 --> 00:32:07.728]  The Money Changers.
[00:32:07.728 --> 00:32:09.768]  That's all they are.
[00:32:09.768 --> 00:32:24.373]  And as a matter of fact, there's another wonderful little article you should Google up on Bloomberg about how they call the people that dissent against the very greedy taking all the money, and remember,
[00:32:25.313 --> 00:32:32.938]  That we have a income disparity here that rivals that of Iran and China, Zimbabwe.
[00:32:32.938 --> 00:32:34.880]  And I'm not making that up.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.781]  That's according to the CIA fact book.
[00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:40.964]  And then fake conservatives spin it like, oh, well that's free market.
[00:32:40.964 --> 00:32:42.985]  There's no reason people should be mad they're so poor.
[00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:45.448]  No, there's no reason all the jobs were shipped to China.
[00:32:45.448 --> 00:32:46.370]  There's no reason.
[00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:57.267]  Meanwhile, these guys are getting rich off corporate welfare, but you'll never hear the pimps posing as conservatives on radio who are attacking Ron Paul admit that to their audience.
[00:32:57.998 --> 00:32:58.758]  Right.
[00:32:58.758 --> 00:33:09.060]  So if you Google up this, you'll see that people like Jamie Dimon and this guy Marcus, who created Walmart.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.581]  Not Walmart, excuse me, Home Depot.
[00:33:11.581 --> 00:33:14.821]  Home Depot, Lowe's, aren't they wonderful?
[00:33:14.821 --> 00:33:22.983]  They put all of the people that used to own hardware stores out of business because they know how to do the big deals.
[00:33:23.343 --> 00:33:30.671]  He says that people like you and I or others that complain about this, do you know who we are?
[00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:32.333]  We're imbeciles.
[00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:33.635]  That's right.
[00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:35.517]  They create jobs.
[00:33:35.517 --> 00:33:37.179]  You have these jerks.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:52.351]  That are saying things in this article in Bloomberg that, when they call us imbeciles, like this one guy, I think his name is Cooperman or something, a hedge fund guy, and he says, don't these people understand?
[00:33:52.351 --> 00:33:56.434]  We make it possible so they could stock the shelves with Christmas stuff.
[00:33:56.954 --> 00:33:58.095]  No, you don't.
[00:33:58.095 --> 00:33:59.617]  You're a hedge fund guy.
[00:33:59.617 --> 00:34:01.319]  You're a gambler.
[00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:06.966]  And the gambling club is very tight and you're all doing deals with each other.
[00:34:06.966 --> 00:34:10.029]  So let's make this really clear.
[00:34:10.029 --> 00:34:12.472]  You're not the best and the brightest.
[00:34:12.472 --> 00:34:14.875]  You're high stakes gamblers.
[00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:16.797]  That'll screw your mother.
[00:34:17.518 --> 00:34:28.468]  To make money because Mr. Cooperman or Mr. Marcus or Jamie Dimon, you're just like John Corzine, MF.
[00:34:28.468 --> 00:34:33.212]  You're a bunch of MF money junkies and you want it all.
[00:34:33.652 --> 00:34:36.053]  Just like any heroin addict.
[00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:45.957]  So I suggest you look up that article, and as we go into the new year, we have to put the proper name on these people.
[00:34:45.957 --> 00:34:52.080]  As you said, they're prostitutes in the media, they're money changers and loan sharks.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.701]  They are not bankers!
[00:34:55.356 --> 00:35:05.382]  Yeah, a banker is somebody who actually loans you some money at a low, reasonable rate in your town to build something, but the megabanks on record are trying to shut down all the small banks and credit unions.
[00:35:05.382 --> 00:35:07.283]  They're trying to mop up any competition.
[00:35:07.283 --> 00:35:14.468]  But, Gerald, expanding on your trends, I want to start getting into the 12, you know, recapping some of the first we covered and get into the six or so we didn't the other day.
[00:35:14.468 --> 00:35:16.989]  That's why you're back here with us, breaking this down.
[00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:17.469]  But here's CNN.
[00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:41.128]  Gun sales at record levels, according to FBI background checks, and it says that 1,534,413, but they have actuaries, that's just for the FBI background check, so they estimate more than 2 million guns were sold in December, an all-time record breaking previous records, and they've done surveys here
[00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:49.356]  Asking people why they are buying guns and they say they believe there's going to be a collapse and that they don't trust the government.
[00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:55.261]  Look, folks, it's another illusion when we say nobody's waking up or my neighbors laugh at me.
[00:35:55.261 --> 00:36:02.187]  You may have some, you know, addled, brainwashed neighbor who buys into this, but they are the minority.
[00:36:02.187 --> 00:36:05.951]  Most people just don't trust their neighbors so they act dumb.
[00:36:05.951 --> 00:36:06.711]  Most people
[00:36:07.512 --> 00:36:14.037]  Okay, and most police I've talked to, and most military, and look at how they give most of their money to Ron Paul, that's proof right there.
[00:36:14.037 --> 00:36:18.781]  Politically, in the campaign, are totally waking up, Gerald.
[00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:24.165]  What's your view on just the absolute breakneck arming that the American people are doing?
[00:36:24.687 --> 00:36:35.975]  Well, first of all, as you were talking about government before and summing it up, John Anthony West, who I work with, my colleague for over 30 years, he summed it up very well.
[00:36:35.975 --> 00:36:41.318]  He said, government is nothing more than 24-7 extortion.
[00:36:41.318 --> 00:36:42.739]  That's all it is.
[00:36:42.739 --> 00:36:49.003]  So as you're reading the report about the people buying guns, it's our third trend.
[00:36:49.003 --> 00:36:50.725]  It's called climax time.
[00:36:51.445 --> 00:37:01.834]  In 2012, many of the long-simmering socioeconomic and geopolitical trends that we have forecast and tracked will come to a climax.
[00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:08.780]  Some will arrive with a big bang, and others less dramatically, but no less consequentially.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:16.667]  So, the people in their gut, they know it's collapsing, and they're taking preparations for the worst.
[00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.409]  And the worst is coming upon us.
[00:37:20.128 --> 00:37:21.189]  Well, let's start at the beginning.
[00:37:21.189 --> 00:37:23.952]  Let's race through the 12 trends here, Gerald.
[00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:27.375]  Well, the first one, of course, is economic martial law.
[00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:32.721]  I'm warning people that, as I've said, I can't be having difficulty getting my money out of the bank.
[00:37:32.721 --> 00:37:37.545]  And people are emailing me every day and telling me of their problems as well.
[00:37:37.545 --> 00:37:39.948]  So again, I don't give financial advice.
[00:37:39.948 --> 00:37:41.690]  You know my motto, think for yourself.
[00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:46.532]  All I'm saying is that the whole European system is collapsing.
[00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:51.774]  We saw that phony bond sale the other day, the last two days in Italy.
[00:37:51.774 --> 00:37:57.977]  Here the ECB dumped $600 billion into the banks so they could buy bonds.
[00:37:57.977 --> 00:37:59.637]  So this is collapsing.
[00:37:59.637 --> 00:38:02.778]  I believe they're going to call an economic martial law.
[00:38:02.778 --> 00:38:03.639]  The second trend
[00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:24.949]  Battlefield America, as you well know and have been well talking about, and you're doing a great job with your writers in detailing what the National Defense Authorization Act is, the Battlefield America is being put in place, I believe, to take care of the economic martial law
[00:38:25.709 --> 00:38:32.412]  Because there's going, just imagine if the nation shuts down, the chaos that we're going to see.
[00:38:32.412 --> 00:38:36.034]  And from the, from the martial law, the economic martial law.
[00:38:36.034 --> 00:38:41.076]  And so things are being put in place, which brings me to the third trend, which is climax.
[00:38:41.636 --> 00:38:44.380]  This is the year it all starts falling apart.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.742]  There are no green shoots.
[00:38:45.742 --> 00:38:47.745]  There is no recovery.
[00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:54.495]  As you pointed out, those phony little numbers they throw out there, you know, like housing starts, you know.
[00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:57.179]  Oh yeah, they're up a little bit.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.561]  The whole thing is really going down.
[00:39:00.561 --> 00:39:07.744]  Housing prices have fallen worse than they have during the Great Depression.
[00:39:07.744 --> 00:39:09.964]  What more do people have to know?
[00:39:09.964 --> 00:39:13.326]  And it's not only in the U.S., it's everywhere.
[00:39:13.326 --> 00:39:21.669]  And those bubbles now that they created in other countries to try to prop it up, those real estate bubbles, they're collapsing as well.
[00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:28.446]  The next trend, you talked about it a bit, and it's the technocrat takeover.
[00:39:28.446 --> 00:39:31.967]  And again, it's fascism.
[00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:34.568]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[00:39:34.568 --> 00:39:38.209]  Let's stop calling them technocrats.
[00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.830]  Who's in Italy?
[00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.231]  Mario Tricodmonte.
[00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:44.832]  Who's over in Greece?
[00:39:44.832 --> 00:39:45.693]  Greece!
[00:39:45.693 --> 00:39:48.135]  The cradle of democracy!
[00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:50.456]  Here's to you, democracy!
[00:39:50.456 --> 00:39:53.118]  We just put in a technocrat!
[00:39:53.118 --> 00:39:54.179]  Papademos!
[00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:55.419]  Where's he from?
[00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:59.082]  Oh, this cat actually, he did a stint with the Federal Reserve!
[00:39:59.082 --> 00:40:00.443]  You mean Mr. Solenti?
[00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:02.844]  Both of those guys are bankers?
[00:40:02.844 --> 00:40:03.605]  That's right!
[00:40:04.045 --> 00:40:07.346]  The money changers have taken over the temple!
[00:40:07.346 --> 00:40:15.629]  The temple in Athens, the temple in Rome, and of course the temple in Berlin, in Paris, the US, everywhere!
[00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:26.733]  It's not a technocratic takeover, it's the end of the far democracy that they've tried to tell us that we have, and it's fascism!
[00:40:27.273 --> 00:40:28.573]  Capisce?
[00:40:28.573 --> 00:40:32.374]  Let's call it what it is, Mario Monti.
[00:40:32.374 --> 00:40:34.175]  You should know.
[00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:36.095]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:40:36.095 --> 00:40:36.575]  You're right.
[00:40:36.575 --> 00:40:37.035]  Stay there.
[00:40:37.035 --> 00:40:38.115]  More trends straight ahead.
[00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:39.156]  Gerald Celente.
[00:40:39.156 --> 00:40:39.736]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:58.235 --> 00:41:07.866]  Don't forget, my friends, you can go to TrendsResearch.com and subscribe to get the trend alerts and also the quarterly journals and valuable in-depth analysis and information.
[00:41:07.866 --> 00:41:11.190]  And don't forget, we're going to go ahead and run it a bit into the new year here.
[00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.674]  All 18 of my films on DVD, over 70% off the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[00:41:17.416 --> 00:41:24.040]  99.95 and the profit we do make goes into this news operation that is the real, true media in the face of the globalists.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.742]  We also have a 15-day free trial.
[00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:29.924]  We've instituted it again because it was so popular for folks that want to see the nightly news and more.
[00:41:29.924 --> 00:41:32.726]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:41:32.726 --> 00:41:34.508]  Okay, Gerald Racing here.
[00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:38.991]  We haven't even gotten into the trends yet that you didn't cover when you were on last time, so please continue.
[00:41:39.807 --> 00:41:43.910]  The next big one is repatriate, repatriate.
[00:41:43.910 --> 00:42:09.547]  The only way things are going to come back to the way this country used to be, and at one time, and I'm old enough to remember, and many people are, when people could have a job and live a comfortable, middle-class life, is when manufacturing and the core of engineering and service sectors in the most highest levels were in America.
[00:42:10.087 --> 00:42:14.268]  We're 312 million people strong.
[00:42:14.268 --> 00:42:27.813]  It's time we bring the manufacturing back and deal with each other, do business with each other, rather than doing it with the Chinese, with the Indonesians, with the Vietnamese, and the rest.
[00:42:28.473 --> 00:42:34.535]  So the repatriate-repatriate trend is the other side of globalization.
[00:42:34.535 --> 00:42:40.316]  It's already beginning to happen with the awakening of buying local.
[00:42:40.316 --> 00:42:45.897]  So what we're saying is now is the time to start reversing this.
[00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:52.619]  Made in USA is going to be big business for anybody that understands it.
[00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:55.540]  The next trend, and they all tie together by the way,
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.840]  You can look around the world.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.361]  It's not only in the United States.
[00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:04.162]  There's talk of the breakup of the European Union.
[00:43:04.162 --> 00:43:08.142]  India is splintering into many different parts.
[00:43:08.142 --> 00:43:12.883]  Spain continues the secessionist movements.
[00:43:12.883 --> 00:43:19.505]  You're seeing it happening worldwide in places that you never thought it would happen before.
[00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:19.745]  Belgium.
[00:43:21.738 --> 00:43:23.720]  You go down the list.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:36.609]  We believe, and you said it before when you were talking about the Economist piece, about how the technocrats can tell us what we should do.
[00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:43.154]  It's big brother USSR, Soviet Union mentality.
[00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:45.076]  And what happens with it?
[00:43:45.076 --> 00:43:46.477]  It starts to break up.
[00:43:47.077 --> 00:43:57.443]  Secessionism movement worldwide in the United States is going to start gaining strength in 2012.
[00:43:57.443 --> 00:44:02.926]  The reason why it died, it was picking up steam under the Bush administration.
[00:44:03.986 --> 00:44:24.250]  Is because when people were tired with Bush, remember Bush got booed off the stage on Inauguration Day, is because they got conned into believing that in the words of Obama, he was going to heal the nation and repair the world.
[00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:30.251]  But he was bought and paid for by the very same interests that admit they're setting up an authoritarian system.
[00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:32.131]  That's what's amazing about all these articles.
[00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:34.269]  Exactly.
[00:44:34.269 --> 00:44:40.902]  So now, it brings us to the next trend, and I briefly touched upon it before, safe havens.
[00:44:41.991 --> 00:44:49.696]  You know, I tell the story, I used to go out with this wonderful French woman, and they came from a very, very well-to-do Parisian family.
[00:44:49.696 --> 00:44:52.478]  Her aunt used to teach at Tufts University.
[00:44:52.478 --> 00:44:57.341]  And her aunt was 14 years old when the Germans marched into Paris.
[00:44:57.341 --> 00:45:02.785]  And I said to her, Martine, I said, you know, you came from such an affluent family.
[00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:05.667]  Her father won the Legion of Honor.
[00:45:05.667 --> 00:45:07.148]  You know, this is the kind of family it is.
[00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:12.132]  I said, you must have known that the Germans were coming.
[00:45:12.132 --> 00:45:16.416]  You should tell me the story of how... Tell you what, stay there, we gotta hear it after this one minute break.
[00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:18.678]  Gerald Cilente, always riveting, is our guest.
[00:45:25.339 --> 00:45:30.182]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:45:30.182 --> 00:45:31.762]  You want answers?
[00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.683]  Well, so does he.
[00:45:33.683 --> 00:45:37.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:41.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:45:41.808 --> 00:45:44.889]  Alright, final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[00:45:44.889 --> 00:45:45.930]  He was getting into his, uh...
[00:45:48.226 --> 00:45:56.249]  Well-to-do French girlfriend years ago, and he was saying, he was talking to, I guess he was saying the mother of one of the family who was alive when the Nazis came.
[00:45:56.249 --> 00:45:57.810]  Didn't you know they were coming?
[00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.830]  Please continue where you left off, Gerald.
[00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:00.571]  Yes, I remember.
[00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:03.312]  This is about the safe haven trend.
[00:46:03.312 --> 00:46:09.234]  And so she told me, she said she remembers her mother, you know, which is my girlfriend's grandmother.
[00:46:09.654 --> 00:46:17.947]  Walking into the metro and the German soldiers grabbing her and putting her to one side and grabbing the next person and putting it to the other and they had 15 people.
[00:46:19.505 --> 00:46:25.508]  And they mowed down the 15 people on the right, and her mother survived.
[00:46:25.508 --> 00:46:30.070]  And that was because the resistance killed a German soldier the night before.
[00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:35.132]  For every one person that the resistance were killing, the Germans were killing 15.
[00:46:35.132 --> 00:46:38.054]  I said, why didn't you leave?
[00:46:38.054 --> 00:46:40.515]  You must have known they were coming!
[00:46:40.515 --> 00:46:48.059]  And she said to me, Gerald, the people that thought they had too much to leave behind, stayed behind.
[00:46:49.099 --> 00:47:00.269]  So when we talk about safe havens, if this country continues to go in the direction that it's going in, it may not be safe to live here anymore.
[00:47:00.269 --> 00:47:02.290]  What is worth more?
[00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.673]  Your financial and material possessions?
[00:47:05.673 --> 00:47:06.814]  Or your life?
[00:47:06.814 --> 00:47:07.715]  Or your freedom?
[00:47:07.715 --> 00:47:08.916]  Or your life?
[00:47:08.916 --> 00:47:10.477]  So that's the other trend.
[00:47:10.477 --> 00:47:15.502]  So we listed what we believe to be the number of good
[00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:18.284]  Solid, safe haven opportunity.
[00:47:18.284 --> 00:47:20.847]  Wow, so you're actually now saying the U.S.
[00:47:20.847 --> 00:47:23.829]  people may need to evacuate even though other places are bad.
[00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:30.395]  And you're saying, we'll have you back in the new year to list some of the places you're saying are safe, but they're in your big report.
[00:47:30.395 --> 00:47:32.317]  But, or safer, what are a few of them?
[00:47:33.305 --> 00:47:36.206]  Well, one of them is Norway.
[00:47:36.206 --> 00:47:37.686]  That's a pretty solid one.
[00:47:37.686 --> 00:47:40.127]  They still have their own currency.
[00:47:40.127 --> 00:47:42.148]  And they're very rich.
[00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:46.249]  And the people are quite free in a lot of ways.
[00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:48.050]  That's pretty high on the list.
[00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:52.714]  The other one, you know, is that, you know, people ask us about South America.
[00:47:52.714 --> 00:48:04.666]  It could go either way, but for the time being, an easy place to get into, and again, one of the recommendations that we make is people, right away they're ready to buy something.
[00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:06.107]  Don't buy anything.
[00:48:06.107 --> 00:48:06.508]  Don't look.
[00:48:07.228 --> 00:48:10.309]  Go there, check the place out.
[00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:11.509]  Uruguay.
[00:48:11.509 --> 00:48:22.232]  Uruguay is pretty solid right now, it's pretty easy to get into, and it has a lot of wealth flowing into it from Brazil and from Argentina.
[00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:25.952]  So those are just two of the several that we list.
[00:48:25.952 --> 00:48:32.014]  The next one, of course, is, and you're well familiar with this, Big Brother Internet.
[00:48:32.614 --> 00:48:40.917]  This could be a year when it determines whether or not we will truly ever have any kind of internet freedom.
[00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:51.760]  Because just like they passed the National Defense Authorization Act, you know the new acts that are coming into place that may close down internet freedom.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.321]  And again, these trends can be reversed.
[00:48:55.321 --> 00:48:58.722]  Just as I mentioned the repatriate-repatriate trend.
[00:48:58.722 --> 00:49:01.223]  We don't have to become a nation
[00:49:02.283 --> 00:49:08.751]  And continue to sink lower into people that are clerks and cashiers.
[00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:10.913]  So we have the will to change these things.
[00:49:10.913 --> 00:49:13.776]  Stop participating in the big megabox stores.
[00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:17.480]  Stop participating in New World Order establishment systems.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.221]  Wake up.
[00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.342]  Warn others.
[00:49:19.342 --> 00:49:20.423]  We can turn it around.
[00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:22.067]  Yes.
[00:49:22.067 --> 00:49:23.528]  Absolutely!
[00:49:23.528 --> 00:49:32.713]  I mean, who's to say that these people, as you call them and I call them, these psychopaths and sociopaths, should be telling us what to do?
[00:49:32.713 --> 00:49:37.435]  And that's part of the next one, by the way, going out in style.
[00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:38.956]  You go back to the 1930s.
[00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:40.396]  Carol, let me stop you right there.
[00:49:40.396 --> 00:49:40.957]  Here's the problem.
[00:49:40.957 --> 00:49:41.997]  I've got a guest coming up.
[00:49:41.997 --> 00:49:45.419]  I know you've got to go, but last time we didn't get to all of these.
[00:49:45.419 --> 00:49:46.239]  We've got to go to break.
[00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:49.181]  Can you do four or five minutes on the other side just to finish the trans?
[00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:49.681]  Sure can.
[00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:52.603]  Okay, guys, let Lindsey Williams apologize.
[00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:54.364]  Tell him we're just going to call him in five, six minutes.
[00:49:54.364 --> 00:49:59.387]  I'm going to come back with Gerald, have him kind of run back into these others real fast we haven't gotten to.
[00:49:59.387 --> 00:50:02.249]  And of course, it's all broken down in detail at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:10.235]  And we have a lot of similar analysis, but his is more in-depth on each particular topic at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:10.235 --> 00:50:11.916]  So we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:13.457]  But this is reality.
[00:50:13.457 --> 00:50:16.239]  I mean, we've got really sick criminals running things.
[00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:17.860]  We've got to learn to say no.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.080]  No!
[00:50:21.052 --> 00:50:25.475]  Well, we're finding out who's whom in the so-called conservative and libertarian movement.
[00:50:25.475 --> 00:50:27.236]  People are coming out of the woodwork.
[00:50:39.117 --> 00:50:42.799]  Attacking Ron Paul right now, and I've got a Mitt Romney article.
[00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:44.300]  In fact, will you guys get it off the printer for me?
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.101]  I forgot to get it in here.
[00:50:45.101 --> 00:50:53.105]  Out of the Washington Post, where they say, it's Mitt Romney's job now, there it is, to derail Ron Paul.
[00:50:53.105 --> 00:50:56.487]  Romney cast Ron Paul as a fringe candidate.
[00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:58.948]  Says he's working hard to derail the Texas Congressman.
[00:50:58.948 --> 00:51:00.269]  Well, I thought nobody liked him.
[00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:01.230]  I thought he couldn't win.
[00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.071]  I thought he was a fringe candidate.
[00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:05.092]  But you've got to work hard to derail him?
[00:51:07.065 --> 00:51:08.206]  Because you're discredited.
[00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:13.990]  You're for abortion, open borders, carbon taxes, and rote Obamacare.
[00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.371]  This is all on record.
[00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:17.712]  And you're just like Newt Gingrich.
[00:51:17.712 --> 00:51:19.413]  Look, he's in 5th place now.
[00:51:19.413 --> 00:51:21.775]  Ron Paul is numero uno.
[00:51:21.775 --> 00:51:23.636]  He's rising in all the states.
[00:51:23.636 --> 00:51:26.798]  He's either in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.
[00:51:26.798 --> 00:51:29.040]  So that mind control mantra that he couldn't win,
[00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.651]  is now failing.
[00:51:31.651 --> 00:51:37.735]  I wanted to get Gerald Celente's take on that briefly, and then hit the four or five other trends he didn't get to out of his 12 trends.
[00:51:37.735 --> 00:51:39.897]  Again, Gerald Celente, Top Trends Forecaster, is our guest.
[00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:54.989]  And for the rest of the hour, Lindsey Williams, who just always has amazing information, and we'll do part two of the interview we started earlier in the week, and we'll open the phones up again for your questions for Lindsey Williams, because they were really excellent questions and I wanted to get to more of those.
[00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:55.510]  But briefly,
[00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:07.310]  Isn't Ron Paul's rise another illustration of people really getting fed up and the fact that so-called MSM, the dinosaur prostitutes, aren't in control anymore and are getting more and more desperate?
[00:52:07.964 --> 00:52:11.926]  Absolutely, you pick up the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[00:52:11.926 --> 00:52:18.750]  I believe it was December 19th, front page story, Mittens-Romney all over the place.
[00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:23.853]  On Christmas Day, front page, Mittens-Romney all over the place.
[00:52:23.853 --> 00:52:28.456]  On Wednesday, front page, Mittens-Romney all over the place.
[00:52:28.456 --> 00:52:31.798]  Open it up, yesterday, Mittens all over the place.
[00:52:32.658 --> 00:52:36.763]  Only time they talk about Ron Paul is in a negative light.
[00:52:36.763 --> 00:52:45.332]  Listen to what fat boy Gingrich said about people like myself that support Ron Paul.
[00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:49.777]  No decent American would support his policy.
[00:52:51.087 --> 00:52:55.011]  Call me, tell me I'm not a decent American neuter.
[00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:57.113]  We can have it out man to man.
[00:52:57.113 --> 00:53:01.296]  And look at that little weenie up there, over in New Hampshire.
[00:53:01.296 --> 00:53:05.060]  The guy who runs that rag, that newspaper.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.721]  The Herald of the New Hampshire.
[00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:08.503]  You call Ron Paul dangerous?
[00:53:08.503 --> 00:53:11.406]  Yeah, no, and anybody that supports him,
[00:53:12.506 --> 00:53:14.749]  We're lunatic fringe!
[00:53:14.749 --> 00:53:18.253]  Let that little weenie come and call me a lunatic fringe!
[00:53:18.253 --> 00:53:22.418]  Well, hold on Gerald, that's exactly, you're right, that's what Mitt Romney's saying.
[00:53:22.418 --> 00:53:27.985]  He's saying, the frontrunner, that the majority of people are supporting, that we're bad too!
[00:53:27.985 --> 00:53:30.387]  No, you're bad, you hedge fund scammer!
[00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.722]  Exactly.
[00:53:33.722 --> 00:53:34.323]  Exactly.
[00:53:34.323 --> 00:53:44.725]  But what the media is doing, again, where does, where does Nooter Gingrich come out and say that any decent American wouldn't support Ron Paul?
[00:53:44.725 --> 00:53:50.327]  Who ordained this fat boy, the arbiter of who's decent?
[00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:54.828]  This guy that's screwing around as his wife's dying in the hospital.
[00:53:55.388 --> 00:54:00.230]  One after another, and he's saying we're indecent?
[00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:11.915]  And again, this little ragmeister up there in New Hampshire, with that crappy little newspaper out there, says only the lunatic fringe supports Ron Paul.
[00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.736]  Who are these people?
[00:54:13.736 --> 00:54:17.358]  And the toilet paper of record, the same thing.
[00:54:17.358 --> 00:54:19.199]  Read their editorials.
[00:54:19.199 --> 00:54:22.000]  You know what they call Ron Paul's ideas?
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.261]  Claptrap ideas.
[00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:26.583]  Oh listen, final point on this and we'll finish your trends, girls.
[00:54:26.583 --> 00:54:28.685]  I know you gotta go.
[00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.887]  I saw a new talking point.
[00:54:30.887 --> 00:54:38.292]  Ron Paul may still win Iowa because his people are cult members and won't listen to us and our reasoning with them.
[00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:45.378]  No, people know you're a pack of scumbags bought and paid for by the megabanks that gutted and destroyed this country.
[00:54:45.618 --> 00:54:50.083]  We know you're a bunch of Tory redcoat supporters, punks.
[00:54:50.083 --> 00:54:53.026]  And if Ron Paul doesn't win this time, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:53.026 --> 00:54:54.607]  Our power is rising.
[00:54:54.607 --> 00:54:58.771]  The people don't buy your lies anymore, scum!
[00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:02.175]  That's right, which brings us to the other trend.
[00:55:02.175 --> 00:55:03.836]  If Ron Paul doesn't make it,
[00:55:05.373 --> 00:55:08.394]  Better understand what you got out there, folks.
[00:55:08.394 --> 00:55:10.315]  The Gambinos and the Bananos.
[00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:12.656]  The Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:55:12.656 --> 00:55:15.298]  DirectDemocracyNow.org.
[00:55:15.298 --> 00:55:19.139]  We have to take the power, put it back into the hands of the people.
[00:55:19.139 --> 00:55:25.122]  And all those trolls out there that say, oh, then we would have mob war, mob rule.
[00:55:25.122 --> 00:55:26.543]  51% would rule.
[00:55:26.543 --> 00:55:28.444]  What do you think you got now?
[00:55:28.444 --> 00:55:29.624]  You got a gang of 535.
[00:55:29.624 --> 00:55:33.266]  That's the mob in Congress that's ruling.
[00:55:33.866 --> 00:55:35.167]  Another trend.
[00:55:35.167 --> 00:55:37.550]  And again, they all tie together.
[00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:39.231]  Going out in style.
[00:55:39.231 --> 00:55:42.334]  People need to rebuild their self-respect.
[00:55:42.334 --> 00:55:43.875]  You look at the 30s.
[00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:46.258]  The worst depression up until now.
[00:55:46.258 --> 00:55:48.600]  Look at the style this nation had.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.781]  Look what we were building.
[00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:51.423]  Look at the way people were dressing.
[00:55:51.983 --> 00:55:53.944]  Goes back to quality.
[00:55:53.944 --> 00:55:54.864]  You know what?
[00:55:54.864 --> 00:55:57.805]  It doesn't take anything much to dress up.
[00:55:57.805 --> 00:56:01.686]  It's not like, you know, doing exercise or going on a diet.
[00:56:01.686 --> 00:56:02.926]  You can look nice.
[00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:05.027]  You don't have to look like a cafone.
[00:56:05.027 --> 00:56:06.287]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:06.287 --> 00:56:07.528]  So what we're saying is...
[00:56:08.228 --> 00:56:12.230]  Step up to style because it builds self-respect.
[00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:26.396]  When you have self-respect, you don't take crap from Nooter Gingrich, Mittens Romney, or rag-owner McCade up in New Hampshire because you have self-respect.
[00:56:26.396 --> 00:56:31.958]  Going out in style means buying quality, supporting local.
[00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:33.239]  The last trend, Alex.
[00:56:33.979 --> 00:56:44.425]  We're talking about the new energy opportunities on the horizon, the big ones now, the dangers of them, and what we can see coming ahead.
[00:56:44.425 --> 00:56:46.946]  Alright, well people can find more at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:51.449]  Gerald, thank you so much for spending time with us, and have a great and safe New Year.
[00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:53.670]  And Happy New Year to you and everyone else.
[00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.912]  Alright, there goes Gerald Cilente of Trends Research.
[00:56:56.912 --> 00:56:58.453]  Now joining us for the rest of the hour...
[00:56:59.713 --> 00:57:02.735]  He's a man who needs no introduction to our regular listeners.
[00:57:02.735 --> 00:57:15.145]  And we do have Bob Chapman, Gary Franchi, and Max Keiser coming up later as well today in this final radio broadcast that's simulcast also at PrisonPlanet.tv of 2011.
[00:57:15.145 --> 00:57:18.047]  I'll be back with the TV show tonight, our actual last media event.
[00:57:19.318 --> 00:57:22.780]  of 2011 before we make the plunge into 2012.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.201]  Lindsey Williams, of course, is an ordained Baptist minister.
[00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:28.623]  He went to Alaska in 71 as a missionary.
[00:57:28.623 --> 00:57:34.865]  Ended up being brought in as the liaison by the oil companies to the oil field workers for at least three years.
[00:57:34.865 --> 00:57:43.129]  There he met a lot of people like Atlantic Richfield, head of operations and another actual CEO of one of the big three.
[00:57:43.129 --> 00:57:48.152]  One of them has died now so we can mention his name, Mr. Fromm, not this Christmas but last Christmas about a year ago.
[00:57:49.885 --> 00:57:54.268]  But the other gentleman is known by me, but I'm obviously not going to give out that source.
[00:57:54.268 --> 00:58:00.813]  But he's a big insider, gives Lindsey kind of a bird's eye view on what the globalists are saying and doing.
[00:58:00.813 --> 00:58:17.085]  And he joins us now to briefly, in this segment, in the next recap, but then I promise, at 33 after we're going to your phone calls, at 800-259-9231, because the callers asking questions are going to take us in directions that I wouldn't think to take us.
[00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:18.246]  So he's gracious to join us.
[00:58:18.986 --> 00:58:26.752]  I beg of everyone out there in your listening audience at GCN and on the Alex Jones Show today and for all of us, I beg of you, I plead with you to listen to the buzzwords
[00:58:46.204 --> 00:58:50.431]  That the elite have given me within the past two weeks time.
[00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:50.872]  If you do...
[00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:56.623]  You will be able to spare yourself major heartache in 2012.
[00:58:56.623 --> 00:59:05.848]  There is no question whatsoever that 2012 will be the most startling and unusual and eventful year in 2,000 years.
[00:59:05.848 --> 00:59:10.631]  I said that three months ago when we first came out with 2012, the beginning of the end.
[00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:21.076]  Now, since I was given this information just days ago about the currency devaluation, I want to give you the buzzwords right from Mr. Bernanke's speech
[00:59:21.736 --> 00:59:24.498]  Ben, I'd like to go into the five points he said.
[00:59:24.498 --> 00:59:29.720]  I'll do all this if I can between now and the end of this half hour.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.042]  And Ben, please folks, I want to tell you what to do about this.
[00:59:33.692 --> 00:59:36.934]  You see, there are elite who are old.
[00:59:36.934 --> 00:59:58.549]  The people I knew 35 years ago, when I was invited to be the chaplain to the elite of the world, and lived with these people, sat across the dinner table with them, lived in the same dorms with them for three years, have kept in touch with them over these years, they're in their 70s and 80s now, and old men are talking because they've got a conscience.
[00:59:58.549 --> 01:00:02.531]  Regardless of who they are, when they face their maker, they know they're going to face it.
[01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:03.292]  All right, here we go.
[01:00:03.912 --> 01:00:15.306]  Just within a matter of days ago, the elitist basically said to me, go to a certain place chaplain and you will know what is about to happen.
[01:00:15.306 --> 01:00:19.311]  First of all, I want to punctuate this by saying they did not give me a date.
[01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:23.753]  I didn't say whether it's going to happen in January or February.
[01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.415]  It is going to happen.
[01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:26.436]  Mark my words.
[01:00:26.436 --> 01:00:27.437]  It's already been said.
[01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:29.639]  I want to give you that buzzword.
[01:00:29.639 --> 01:00:31.321]  Please take this down.
[01:00:31.321 --> 01:00:38.249]  I hope you have pencils and paper again today because I'm going to give you facts that you can go on the internet and find them for yourself.
[01:00:38.866 --> 01:00:44.770]  They said, go to November the 21st, 2002.
[01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:48.573]  Look at the remarks of then Governor Ben Bernanke.
[01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:50.735]  He today is Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[01:00:50.735 --> 01:00:54.638]  Back then he was the Governor of the Federal Reserve, one of many.
[01:00:54.638 --> 01:01:01.623]  And they said, look at the speech that he gave at the National Economics Club in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:01.623 --> 01:01:07.908]  on November the 21st, 2002, and you will know what is going to take place
[01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:21.385]  And they didn't say 2012, but I think I can surmise from reading between the lines that this is going to happen, and it's not going to be too long off, and you must make preparation.
[01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:22.587]  They're buzzwords.
[01:01:22.587 --> 01:01:23.068]  Here they are.
[01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:27.900]  First of all, there is going to be a currency devaluation.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.103]  You can depend on it as much as you can depend on the sun coming up this morning and the moon being up tonight.
[01:01:34.103 --> 01:01:35.864]  It is going to happen.
[01:01:35.864 --> 01:01:38.646]  What does a currency devaluation mean?
[01:01:38.646 --> 01:01:41.287]  Alright, first of all, let me give you this statement.
[01:01:41.287 --> 01:01:44.649]  You need to get this one first, then I'll give you that buzzword.
[01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:50.312]  Whenever a nation finds itself in an insurmountable fiscal debt hole,
[01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:54.528]  There are essentially two ways to fix the problem.
[01:01:54.528 --> 01:01:58.829]  Number one, and on one hand, they can cut back on expenditures.
[01:01:58.829 --> 01:02:00.810]  Secondly, raise taxes.
[01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.451]  Or, they can do the other.
[01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:10.133]  The alternative to cutting back on expenditures or raising taxes is they can devalue their currency.
[01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:16.362]  Now, we know that the super committee in Washington did nothing to cut back on expenditures.
[01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:20.525]  In fact, it was an utter joke watching them play up there like children.
[01:02:20.525 --> 01:02:21.545]  Raise taxes?
[01:02:21.545 --> 01:02:22.406]  They can't do it.
[01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.307]  The rich?
[01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:24.007]  Nobody else.
[01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:27.650]  They can't seem to raise taxes on anybody, but they want to talk about cutting them.
[01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:42.377]  Since those two things have not been done, and will not be done, and they never intended for those things to be done, because behind closed doors they had planned a currency devaluation in the first place, and they knew none of those things were going to take place.
[01:02:42.377 --> 01:02:46.959]  They paid off all of Washington, D.C., with maybe the exception of Ron Paul.
[01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:48.360]  On the other hand, what can they do?
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.161]  Devalue the currency.
[01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:55.366]  Let me read it to you right from Ben Bernanke's own words in his speech.
[01:02:55.366 --> 01:03:02.233]  It is worth noting that there have been times when exchange rate policy has been an effective weapon.
[01:03:02.233 --> 01:03:04.395]  A striking example from the U.S.
[01:03:04.395 --> 01:03:11.121]  history is Franklin Roosevelt's 40... Folks, are you hearing the buzzwords?
[01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.884]  He used the word, first of all, exchange.
[01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:16.737]  There is going to be a devaluation.
[01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:21.710]  It gets them out of the devaluation.
[01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.731]  Folks, you've got to listen to this.
[01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:25.632]  A striking example from U.S.
[01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:34.137]  history is Franklin Roosevelt's 40% devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933 and 1934.
[01:03:34.137 --> 01:03:38.560]  That one sentence is one of the buzzwords.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.482]  First of all, there's going to be a devaluation of the currency at 40%.
[01:03:42.482 --> 01:03:43.983]  Let's just admit to it.
[01:03:43.983 --> 01:03:45.483]  You've got, say, $10,000 in the bank.
[01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:48.658]  And it's Friday afternoon.
[01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.840]  And you've been given no word whatsoever is going to happen on Monday morning.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.543]  I guarantee you, you will not know in advance what's going to happen.
[01:03:55.543 --> 01:04:00.427]  It's going to take place more than likely over a long holiday or a weekend.
[01:04:00.427 --> 01:04:12.295]  And when you wake up on Monday morning and get ready to go and see how much money you've got in your bank account, in your checking account, in your business account, whatever it may be, it is going to be cut by 40%.
[01:04:12.295 --> 01:04:14.416]  That means if you had $10,000 in that account on Friday,
[01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:23.640]  You will have somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,000 only in that account on Monday morning.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.541]  The currency will be devalued at 40%.
[01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:29.522]  Now, let me show you how they're going to do it.
[01:04:29.522 --> 01:04:33.703]  He used the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933 and 1934.
[01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.924]  What did Franklin Roosevelt do in 1933 and 1934?
[01:04:36.924 --> 01:04:39.345]  Remember, these people tell you something.
[01:04:39.345 --> 01:04:41.446]  Please go and listen to them, folks.
[01:04:41.446 --> 01:04:42.166]  I beg of you.
[01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:50.473]  They give me these things, I think, because they're old men, and they want to clear their conscience.
[01:04:50.473 --> 01:04:56.095]  He said, in 1933-34, what did Franklin Delano Roosevelt do?
[01:04:56.095 --> 01:04:59.176]  He said, bring in... They didn't use gold back in those days.
[01:04:59.176 --> 01:05:05.339]  A man would carry around a $20 gold piece in his pocket, which today you'll pay $1,400, $1,500 for.
[01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:08.120]  And they used it to buy groceries and other things.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.681]  And he said, bring in your $20 gold pieces.
[01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:11.301]  It is your
[01:05:12.032 --> 01:05:12.633]  I think so.
[01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:34.914]  He actually gave them gold certificates and said you can take it back to the bank and get $20.
[01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:40.799]  The scoundrel, the liar, he knew it had already been planned behind closed doors.
[01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:47.785]  I've been told this, that he knew that within a few months time he was going to take the price of gold from $20 an ounce.
[01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:50.828]  $235.
[01:05:50.828 --> 01:05:53.270]  Look in history.
[01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:55.212]  Go prove this for yourself.
[01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:59.335]  You don't have to take my word for it, nor the elitists that have just talked to me recently.
[01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:00.797]  You're going to face it soon.
[01:06:00.797 --> 01:06:02.498]  You better get ready for it.
[01:06:02.498 --> 01:06:07.403]  He took it from $20 a few months later without any warning.
[01:06:07.403 --> 01:06:08.304]  Nothing was said.
[01:06:09.073 --> 01:06:09.934]  Automatically.
[01:06:09.934 --> 01:06:12.795]  He said, we're going to $35 for gold.
[01:06:12.795 --> 01:06:13.656]  Figure it.
[01:06:13.656 --> 01:06:17.057]  From $20 to $35 is 40%.
[01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.078]  What did he do?
[01:06:18.078 --> 01:06:24.361]  The gold pieces that they had turned in for $20, they could go back to the bank and get $20 for it.
[01:06:24.361 --> 01:06:26.462]  They could not get $35.
[01:06:26.462 --> 01:06:32.926]  And when they went back to say, you scoundrels, you have ripped me off for 40%, he devalued the currency.
[01:06:33.386 --> 01:06:46.279]  This time they'll merely take the Federal Reserve note, and where it's worth a certain amount on Friday afternoon, it'll be worth another amount on Monday morning, and you're going to have a 40% devaluation.
[01:06:46.279 --> 01:06:47.160]  It is coming.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.441]  Now, what can you do about it?
[01:06:48.441 --> 01:06:54.067]  There's really only one thing, and Mr. Fromm told me this many years ago, and I didn't understand what he was saying.
[01:06:54.067 --> 01:06:55.448]  He said to me one day, he said,
[01:06:57.049 --> 01:07:00.552]  If it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[01:07:00.552 --> 01:07:03.934]  Alex, you've heard me say that over your show, over and over and over.
[01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:13.621]  I did not know what Mr. Brom was saying to me at the time, and he basically was saying, Chaplain, if it is not tangible, it's no good.
[01:07:13.621 --> 01:07:18.004]  Do you realize that piece of paper has got to be turned into something?
[01:07:18.004 --> 01:07:25.269]  If you don't get out of paper IRAs, 401Ks, your retirement funds, you can't depend on Social Security.
[01:07:26.289 --> 01:07:34.373]  The amount that you'll be getting will be worth 40% less the next morning after the devaluation and you think that you can live on it?
[01:07:34.373 --> 01:07:36.214]  You're having trouble living on it now?
[01:07:36.214 --> 01:07:37.354]  Just wait until then.
[01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:42.897]  You've got to get out of paper before the devaluation takes place.
[01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:43.377]  What do you do?
[01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:45.058]  It's very simple.
[01:07:45.058 --> 01:07:46.559]  As simple as 1, 2, 3.
[01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:56.222]  Do you realize that the next morning, after the currency devaluation, that gold is going to be worth 40% more than it was the day that you bought it?
[01:07:56.222 --> 01:07:58.463]  Now, I know I do not sell gold and silver.
[01:07:58.463 --> 01:08:00.523]  You couldn't buy an ounce from me if you tried.
[01:08:00.523 --> 01:08:02.224]  Alex can tell you where to go for that.
[01:08:02.224 --> 01:08:04.324]  GCN can tell you where to go.
[01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:07.846]  All I'm telling you is the facts that have been given to me.
[01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:12.047]  You must get out a paper of every kind immediately.
[01:08:12.975 --> 01:08:21.779]  Because it is going to be worth 40% less, but the gold is going to go up 40%, I guarantee you, within a matter of days after the devaluation.
[01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:28.222]  Okay, Lindsey, Lindsey, let me just give the number, because we're going to take calls when we come back, and I skipped that last network break.
[01:08:28.222 --> 01:08:31.964]  800-259-9231 to get people's take on this.
[01:08:31.964 --> 01:08:35.525]  Now, Gerald Salenti, who I respect, and his analysis has been spot on.
[01:08:37.186 --> 01:08:51.491]  It has made the point, I know you've made the point, that we have gotten reprieves, the elite has backed off a few times, and that's actually come out from Jim Tucker sources mirroring what you'd already reported, and that they are concerned.
[01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:58.293]  And we had over 2 million guns sold so far in the month of December, an all-time record.
[01:08:58.293 --> 01:09:06.216]  500 plus thousand of those, CNN reports, were sold just in the six days before
[01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:08.121]  I don't know.
[01:09:28.418 --> 01:09:29.599]  This is being reported.
[01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:30.979]  I mean, I heard it on 590 AM.
[01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:31.760]  I went and pulled it up.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.940]  Here's CNN.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.201]  That's got to shake up the elite.
[01:09:35.201 --> 01:09:38.543]  Because, I mean, I can't tell you how many veterans I know.
[01:09:38.543 --> 01:09:39.923]  Some of them are young, some of them are old.
[01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:41.704]  And they're not looking for trouble.
[01:09:41.704 --> 01:09:45.306]  But they're not going to be pushed around like this is Russia or something.
[01:09:45.306 --> 01:09:52.589]  I mean, I don't... Okay, they've trained the police and military to take on, quote, veterans and conservatives and libertarians.
[01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:55.190]  And we've gotten the manuals on that.
[01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.330]  This isn't going to fly.
[01:09:57.772 --> 01:10:01.744]  So I mean, bottom line, from your research, there are ways to turn this around?
[01:10:01.744 --> 01:10:04.472]  Or are we going into a zone where nothing's going to turn it around?
[01:10:05.094 --> 01:10:10.299]  Well, they're positively always to turn it around, and I've expressed this to you over the past many years.
[01:10:10.299 --> 01:10:11.500]  I've been on your show, Alex.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:22.149]  I told you that when I lived with these people, I've said it to your audience over and over, when I lived with these elite for three years' time, I mean, I sat across the dinner table from them, lived in the dorms with them, talked to them one-on-one.
[01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:23.210]  They were not in my church.
[01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.812]  I was on their oil field.
[01:10:24.812 --> 01:10:28.275]  And there's only one thing on the face of this earth that the elite are scared of.
[01:10:28.815 --> 01:10:31.999]  That just doesn't come from what you hear or read about in the book.
[01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:32.960]  I lived it.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.807]  The only one thing that the elite is scared of, they are scared to death of the masses waking up.
[01:10:38.807 --> 01:10:40.409]  That is the only thing that bothers them.
[01:10:40.409 --> 01:10:41.390]  Money doesn't bother them.
[01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.472]  They have the control of it.
[01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.094]  Congress, they could care less.
[01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:44.915]  They control them.
[01:10:44.915 --> 01:10:46.717]  The President, he's under that total control.
[01:10:47.017 --> 01:11:05.531]  And that's why they spend all day ridiculing people that say common sense things, and that's why it looks so silly now, as they defend all this evil, because they're desperately trying to keep people dumbed down, and now people don't trust them, but the final domino, Pastor, for my research is, people still think we're the minority.
[01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:06.632]  Lindsey, I'm out there.
[01:11:06.632 --> 01:11:11.116]  People recognize me, so I get interaction that folks, regular folks don't get.
[01:11:11.116 --> 01:11:12.417]  People are awake, my friend.
[01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:18.241]  They are awake, and they're waking up faster every day, and there are masses waking up out there.
[01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:23.964]  And, come on folks, you've got to, immediately, you can't wait until tomorrow morning to make preparation.
[01:11:23.964 --> 01:11:31.549]  The day after the currency changeover, you are going to see every gun store in America wiped out in 24 hours time.
[01:11:31.549 --> 01:11:36.752]  No, no, just last hour, I realized over the years I've expended most of my ammo.
[01:11:36.752 --> 01:11:42.475]  I am going to go tomorrow, I shouldn't even say this on air because I read the record city's awesome for gun sales.
[01:11:43.737 --> 01:11:47.638]  I'm gonna go buy a mass load of ammo myself tomorrow.
[01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:48.219]  Wow.
[01:11:48.219 --> 01:11:49.999]  All right, Lindsey, stay there.
[01:11:49.999 --> 01:11:51.180]  It's crazy.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.401]  I hope all this doesn't happen, but it's going from a possibility to a probability.
[01:11:56.401 --> 01:12:01.783]  Now, the wake-up may be big enough to back off the system, but they've done a lot of bold stuff.
[01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:02.663]  I'm not sure.
[01:12:02.663 --> 01:12:05.004]  And they want to start this war with Iran.
[01:12:05.004 --> 01:12:07.745]  It'll be a good political diversion for them.
[01:12:07.745 --> 01:12:08.906]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:12:08.906 --> 01:12:09.706]  Lindsey Williams, our guest.
[01:12:10.933 --> 01:12:13.794]  Tell me who's that ridin'?
[01:12:13.794 --> 01:12:17.874]  John the Revelator Tell me who's that ridin'?
[01:12:17.874 --> 01:12:21.875]  John the Revelator Tell me who's that ridin'?
[01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:28.776]  John the Revelator Wrote the Book of the Seven Seals Who's that ridin'?
[01:12:28.776 --> 01:12:32.777]  John the Revelator Tell me who's that ridin'?
[01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:36.158]  John the Revelator Well, who's that ridin'?
[01:12:36.718 --> 01:12:41.900]  John the Revelator wrote the Book of the Seven Seas.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:48.503]  You know, God walked down in a cool little day, called Adam by his name.
[01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:57.272]  And he refused to answer because he's naked and ashamed.
[01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:59.193]  Who's that writing?
[01:12:59.193 --> 01:13:00.953]  John Ravelator.
[01:13:00.953 --> 01:13:03.134]  Who's that writing?
[01:13:03.134 --> 01:13:04.895]  John Ravelator.
[01:13:04.895 --> 01:13:06.095]  Who's that writing?
[01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:07.015]  John Ravelator.
[01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.696]  Well, there's Sunhouse.
[01:13:08.696 --> 01:13:12.517]  That's some old-time blues for you there.
[01:13:12.899 --> 01:13:15.080]  Certainly a crazy time to be alive.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.902]  There's no doubt evil is rising.
[01:13:17.902 --> 01:13:20.344]  But for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:13:20.344 --> 01:13:25.327]  All right, Lindsey Williams is here, and he is here to take your calls.
[01:13:25.327 --> 01:13:26.427]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:13:26.427 --> 01:13:28.089]  I'm doing a fourth hour today.
[01:13:28.089 --> 01:13:29.750]  We got Bob Chapman on the next hour.
[01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:34.973]  We'll take calls for your financial questions, geopolitical questions for myself or Bob Chapman.
[01:13:36.226 --> 01:13:41.468]  As we got Lindsey on a little bit late, I skipped a break, and we're going to have him five minutes to the next hour, then Bob Chapman will join us.
[01:13:41.468 --> 01:13:52.933]  Then I'm doing a fourth hour today with Max Keiser, and we've got Gary Franchi, who's got an amazing TV ad running, exposing what those of us that know Ron Paul already know.
[01:13:52.933 --> 01:14:04.218]  He's obsessed with individualism and not religion or color or any of that, and that's why he's against all these wars and against mandatory drug sentencing and the rest of it, and that's why the system hates him.
[01:14:05.218 --> 01:14:14.347]  So we're gonna be talking to Franchi coming up and playing that ad here as well But Lindsey Williams is our guest right now Lindsey.
[01:14:14.347 --> 01:14:16.088]  Let's go to the phone calls here.
[01:14:16.088 --> 01:14:18.831]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina Frank You're on the air.
[01:14:18.831 --> 01:14:20.793]  Thanks for holding Yeah, Alex.
[01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:22.354]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:14:22.354 --> 01:14:28.860]  I live in a city comparable to Austin, Texas there here here in North Carolina and I am noticing
[01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:36.005]  An increase like, you know, and Ron Paul supporters being outspoken and calling into radio shows.
[01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:39.988]  And it's really, it's encouraging to see that he's starting to get some traction.
[01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:43.910]  Oh, we're getting reports all over the country of people out with signs on the streets.
[01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:47.712]  I mean, look, the system knows he's the frontrunner and they're scared.
[01:14:47.712 --> 01:14:48.193]  And that's why.
[01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:53.235]  I know I'm interrupting you before I get to your question, but first they said hackers were going to attack.
[01:14:53.235 --> 01:14:56.356]  And then I said, watch, they'll make the counting secret.
[01:14:56.356 --> 01:15:05.059]  And now the RNC is taking it to tally it at a secret location and it's making the tallying at the local area secret.
[01:15:05.059 --> 01:15:06.260]  So there's no doubt.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.883]  They're telling you Romney's down the lead so they can say Ron Paul's seventh place or something.
[01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:14.384]  I mean, they'll do third place or something.
[01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:17.465]  They're getting ready to do what they do as criminals.
[01:15:17.465 --> 01:15:18.826]  And these are criminals.
[01:15:18.826 --> 01:15:21.668]  These are criminals that lie about WMDs, you name it.
[01:15:21.668 --> 01:15:25.770]  That have the federal government sticking their hands down your wife's pants to train you that you're a slave.
[01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:27.090]  They are hardcore criminals.
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:28.991]  I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:34.854]  Yeah, but other than, you know, some outspokenness, some activism on the local 50,000 watt station,
[01:15:38.444 --> 01:15:42.405]  Alex, I'm not seeing any sign of any awakening at all around here.
[01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:45.487]  I mean, the people are complete zombies.
[01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:48.548]  They have no clue what's going on, as far as I can see.
[01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:53.290]  Now, maybe they're just being quiet about it, but I mean... Well, look, let me explain this to you.
[01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.150]  Let me explain this to you.
[01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.275]  I am very well-known now.
[01:15:58.275 --> 01:16:01.697]  I'm in some well-known movies.
[01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:02.578]  Never tried to be in movies.
[01:16:02.578 --> 01:16:05.220]  Rick Linter, nice guy, called up, put me in a few movies.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.541]  I have been all over national TV.
[01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:09.222]  I have millions of radio listeners.
[01:16:09.222 --> 01:16:12.585]  Our YouTube channels have over 300 million views.
[01:16:12.585 --> 01:16:16.287]  So hundreds of millions of people worldwide know who I am.
[01:16:16.287 --> 01:16:17.148]  So I get
[01:16:17.808 --> 01:16:34.362]  to have experiences other people don't because people recognize me they know me so they'll talk to me and I can go out on the street now and every third person stops and shakes my hand so there are a lot of people awake there are also a lot of people who don't feel like they have any power and are just thinking about
[01:16:34.762 --> 01:16:39.468]  Their car payment and getting home and they're hungry and their boss is mean to them.
[01:16:39.468 --> 01:16:46.057]  But there's always people who don't count and who are on the sidelines because they don't want to count or don't think they count.
[01:16:46.057 --> 01:16:48.780]  But it was 5% won the war against the British.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.923]  We got way more than 5%.
[01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:52.365]  Lindsey Williams, what's your take on this?
[01:16:53.052 --> 01:16:54.513]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:16:54.513 --> 01:17:01.919]  In fact, you remember back last May, I came on your show and I said, the price of gasoline or the price of crude oil is going to $150 a barrel.
[01:17:01.919 --> 01:17:09.784]  You remember I came back later and said, uh-uh, the elite, in fact, I told them, the elite is on the phone.
[01:17:09.784 --> 01:17:11.946]  I said, you really hurt my credibility.
[01:17:11.946 --> 01:17:15.809]  You told me it was going to $150 a barrel, now you're telling me that you're going to
[01:17:16.309 --> 01:17:16.629]  I think so.
[01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.837]  Keep you out of the loop.
[01:17:36.837 --> 01:17:38.738]  They don't want you to know what's going on.
[01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.860]  They don't want you to get excited.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.760]  They want to do everything in their power.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:49.864]  And then I came back on and I said, you're going to keep the price of gasoline right about where it is for the next number of months because the elite had to back off.
[01:17:49.864 --> 01:17:51.225]  Too many of them were waking up.
[01:17:51.225 --> 01:17:51.965]  You're right, Alex.
[01:17:51.965 --> 01:17:54.146]  They are waking up in mass out there.
[01:17:54.146 --> 01:17:59.069]  But this is going to shake them to the core when we have the devaluation, I'm quite sure.
[01:18:00.421 --> 01:18:05.844]  Yes sir, and again to the caller, you know, chin up my friend, but I want to give you my word.
[01:18:05.844 --> 01:18:15.370]  I don't come on the air and give you pep rallies and tell you that people are waking up to make you feel good.
[01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:17.351]  This is not campfire stories, okay?
[01:18:17.351 --> 01:18:22.014]  And if you heard my show 10 years ago, you didn't hear me talking about a big wake up.
[01:18:22.014 --> 01:18:25.896]  I was, you know, saying, my gosh, you know, people are going to come, a wake up.
[01:18:25.896 --> 01:18:28.178]  And just as an individual,
[01:18:29.309 --> 01:18:36.653]  By dedicating myself to truth and liberty, I have reached thousands of times the people I ever imagined I would.
[01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:42.077]  I just couldn't sit by and watch this happening, so I thought, well, I'll start fighting and, you know, there's others out there fighting.
[01:18:42.945 --> 01:18:49.611]  And so, look, I don't want to get into this again, but 20 years ago, Ron Paul couldn't get a single co-sponsored audit of the Fed.
[01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:51.312]  It passed the House this year.
[01:18:51.312 --> 01:18:52.473]  They killed it in the Senate.
[01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:53.794]  But we'll do even better.
[01:18:53.794 --> 01:18:56.316]  Four years ago, Ron Paul didn't get a fraction of the support.
[01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:57.477]  Look where he is now.
[01:18:57.477 --> 01:19:01.500]  Too bad he's going to be probably a little too old next go-around if he doesn't win this time.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.041]  But the ideas are there.
[01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.162]  I've talked to Jim Tucker.
[01:19:04.162 --> 01:19:05.063]  I've talked to Esselstyn.
[01:19:05.063 --> 01:19:10.908]  People that do have Bilderberg Group sources that have proven stunningly accurate, just as Williams has.
[01:19:11.846 --> 01:19:22.893]  And I mean, I was told, yeah, Obama's gonna be here by Tucker, and then two hours later, here comes the motorcade into the Virginia Hotel, while the mainstream media says nobody knows where Obama and Hillary went.
[01:19:22.893 --> 01:19:25.134]  You know, they shook the media, and there they are.
[01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:28.316]  I mean, that's how powerful Tucker's sources are.
[01:19:28.316 --> 01:19:30.297]  And too bad he's getting, you know, really old.
[01:19:30.297 --> 01:19:37.342]  But the point is, is that all of this is happening, all of this is going on, and in those meetings,
[01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.851]  I'm talking about Bilderberg in 2006.
[01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:43.831]  They were talking about Ron Paul in the official meeting.
[01:19:43.831 --> 01:19:47.652]  And they were talking about him even more this year in Switzerland.
[01:19:47.652 --> 01:19:50.033]  And yep, guess who else they talk about?
[01:19:50.033 --> 01:19:51.813]  Lindsey, they talk about this radio show.
[01:19:51.813 --> 01:19:53.654]  I've not just been told that from you.
[01:19:53.654 --> 01:19:54.974]  I've been told that by others.
[01:19:54.974 --> 01:19:56.754]  I mean, they are scared.
[01:19:56.754 --> 01:19:57.455]  And they better be.
[01:19:57.455 --> 01:19:58.675]  They're a bunch of criminals, Lindsey.
[01:19:59.435 --> 01:20:04.897]  Well, Alex, not only do they know about your radio show, I told you this back about a year ago.
[01:20:04.897 --> 01:20:09.699]  I said, Alex, you are in their crosshairs because some of them have said something to me.
[01:20:09.699 --> 01:20:12.960]  And then I didn't say it to you, but I'll say it to you now.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.101]  I talked to your producer a while back off the air when he asked me to be on one of your shows.
[01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:20.682]  And I said, they know Alex Jones' personal home phone number.
[01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.183]  And he said, where in the world did you get that?
[01:20:22.763 --> 01:20:30.227]  I said, from them, and they know exactly what you're doing, Alex, and they're scared to death because you're one of the greatest sponsors out there.
[01:20:30.227 --> 01:20:33.708]  GCN Radio is blasting it everywhere.
[01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:35.849]  People are waking up by the millions.
[01:20:35.849 --> 01:20:42.512]  Last summer, we took a trip from here to Oregon and back, and I'd go to one place, and I didn't even want to be known.
[01:20:42.512 --> 01:20:45.554]  I went to a convention someplace, and I didn't even want to be known.
[01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:46.754]  I said, let me sit in the back.
[01:20:46.754 --> 01:20:48.255]  I don't even want to be up on the platform.
[01:20:48.915 --> 01:20:53.637]  It wasn't 24 hours before they had a crowd of people that wanted to hear what I had to say.
[01:20:53.637 --> 01:20:54.858]  Alex, you're right.
[01:20:54.858 --> 01:20:55.798]  They're waking up.
[01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:57.159]  They know you're out there.
[01:20:57.159 --> 01:21:05.463]  But that's why they haven't killed us yet, because there's Ron Paul, there's Lindsey Williams, there's Bob Chapman, there's thousands of prominent people now.
[01:21:05.463 --> 01:21:05.963]  And you know what?
[01:21:05.963 --> 01:21:08.284]  A lot of people out there get into this Patriot stuff.
[01:21:08.664 --> 01:21:12.245]  For some of the right reasons, but they get competitive and want to be big stars.
[01:21:12.245 --> 01:21:17.086]  Folks, being big in this means you are in the crosshairs walking point.
[01:21:17.086 --> 01:21:20.247]  I am so happy when other people are prominent.
[01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:22.987]  So happy when people get more attention than I do.
[01:21:22.987 --> 01:21:25.128]  I wish Glenn Beck was totally for real.
[01:21:25.128 --> 01:21:27.128]  He has gone the right direction in many ways.
[01:21:27.128 --> 01:21:29.729]  Because I don't have a death wish.
[01:21:29.729 --> 01:21:32.830]  And the only reason they haven't killed us, they would 30, 40 years ago.
[01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:34.310]  They killed a lot of people.
[01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:36.271]  Is because back then they were trying to keep it down.
[01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:37.791]  They failed keeping this down.
[01:21:38.211 --> 01:21:42.758]  Now if they kill us, it highlights, it underlines everything we've said.
[01:21:42.758 --> 01:21:45.743]  But it doesn't mean that we're still not in danger.
[01:21:45.743 --> 01:21:46.745]  It is your prayers.
[01:21:46.745 --> 01:21:50.070]  Folks, remember, God is real and is in control.
[01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:51.752]  Lindsey, what's your take on why we're still alive?
[01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:54.960]  Oh, you're exactly right, but I'm going to go a step further.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:04.907]  Why have these elitists, just within the past few months' time, started giving me more outstanding information than they ever gave me when Ken Prom was alive?
[01:22:04.907 --> 01:22:06.348]  There's a reason why.
[01:22:06.348 --> 01:22:18.156]  There are a few of these people who are old and decrepit in their 70s and 80s who themselves are concerned, and when I talk to them on the phone and when I get emails from them, Alex, I am amazed
[01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:30.066]  There are some of the retired elitists today that are in some ways thinking like you and I think to the point that they say, as Ken Trom said to me a few years ago, Lindsey, I'm too old to care, just go ahead and give them everything.
[01:22:30.066 --> 01:22:34.209]  But you have got to know what you're facing in 2020.
[01:22:34.209 --> 01:22:34.669]  Exactly.
[01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:35.450]  Let me stop you there.
[01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.951]  Let me stop you because I want to go back to calls.
[01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.453]  This is so powerful, Lindsey.
[01:22:39.153 --> 01:22:43.654]  Look, being in the elite from my historical research is like a prison.
[01:22:43.654 --> 01:22:50.856]  A lot of these people, that's what Dr. Labo, who I know has treated some heads of state, one head of state told her, you know, I don't like this new world order.
[01:22:50.856 --> 01:22:52.997]  I don't like the population reduction.
[01:22:52.997 --> 01:22:55.057]  I don't like what we're doing, but I can't get out of it.
[01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:57.558]  It's like the mafia or the CIA.
[01:22:57.558 --> 01:23:00.799]  And we give the whistleblowers and the insiders
[01:23:01.579 --> 01:23:04.961]  Who aren't pure evil, a chance to repent.
[01:23:04.961 --> 01:23:07.883]  And when we see that historically, we see it in the Bible.
[01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:11.125]  Where powerful, wicked people, who aren't totally wicked, repent.
[01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:12.626]  We see it in pop culture.
[01:23:12.626 --> 01:23:14.288]  Darth Vader repents.
[01:23:14.288 --> 01:23:16.329]  And again, people are like, oh, now you're using fiction.
[01:23:16.329 --> 01:23:19.231]  The point is, that's a pop culture example.
[01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:26.916]  There are many people that now, as this new order gets closer and closer, that a lot of the leaders are compartmentalized themselves.
[01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:29.698]  They were told this world government was to help people.
[01:23:29.698 --> 01:23:31.259]  Now they know it's not, Lindsey.
[01:23:32.119 --> 01:23:39.763]  You know, once they get to the age of the elitist that I knew back 35 years ago, these people themselves are very concerned.
[01:23:39.763 --> 01:23:51.389]  And you're right, Alex, they are stepping out and themselves saying things, and then they'll turn around and, okay, let me put to this, and I can't go too far on the air, you'll please forgive me, there's certain things I can't say.
[01:23:51.929 --> 01:23:55.433]  But they'll turn around and say, Lindsey, why don't you go here and look for this?
[01:23:55.433 --> 01:23:58.716]  And Lindsey, Kaplan, go over there and look and you'll find the answer to this.
[01:23:58.716 --> 01:24:01.979]  And then they'll have somebody else to call me on the phone like they did the other day.
[01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:07.345]  Somebody sent me an email that they had told them, I think they told them at least, to send it to me.
[01:24:07.345 --> 01:24:12.030]  And whenever I got the information on exactly where it came from, they didn't want it to come from their computer.
[01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:34.219]  Alex, these people themselves, the older ones, who are from the generation many a time or two back, they're getting concerned themselves, and they have told me everything that is going to happen in 2012, and we put it in this new DVD series, 2012, The Beginning of the End, and you've got to know what to do.
[01:24:34.219 --> 01:24:39.241]  You don't have to worry about the currency devaluation if you have taken
[01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:40.001]  No, you're right.
[01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.243]  In fact, people can find that at prophecyclub.com.
[01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.144]  Let's go back to the calls before you leave.
[01:24:44.144 --> 01:24:45.085]  I'm going to dig out that number.
[01:24:45.085 --> 01:24:46.105]  We're going to give it out, Lindsey.
[01:24:46.105 --> 01:24:49.647]  Let's go to, because I'm hogging all the time here, saying I go to calls.
[01:24:49.647 --> 01:24:50.648]  I'm bad.
[01:24:50.648 --> 01:24:52.089]  Ironhead in Washington.
[01:24:52.089 --> 01:24:52.989]  You're on the air.
[01:24:52.989 --> 01:24:54.290]  Go ahead.
[01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:55.191]  Hello there again.
[01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:55.791]  I don't believe it.
[01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:59.914]  Twice in one month, I feel like this is better than 72 virgins.
[01:24:59.914 --> 01:25:05.517]  A quick spiritual comment.
[01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:08.639]  Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth and the sea.
[01:25:09.434 --> 01:25:12.515]  For the beast has been cast down knowing he has but a short time.
[01:25:12.515 --> 01:25:20.457]  I think both of you guys would agree that this is a spiritual battle and that's why so many around us refuse to wake up because they don't have the spiritual determination.
[01:25:20.457 --> 01:25:20.878]  Now that's it.
[01:25:20.878 --> 01:25:24.719]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows the time is short.
[01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:28.960]  And I'd sit in Sunday school and you know read that when I was a kid and wouldn't really pay attention to it.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.041]  But now I study these evil people whether you believe in God or not.
[01:25:32.341 --> 01:25:38.029]  They run around ravenously killing, stealing, and destroying because that's their nature.
[01:25:38.029 --> 01:25:40.412]  People go, well why does a serial killer do this?
[01:25:40.412 --> 01:25:41.854]  Because they like it.
[01:25:41.854 --> 01:25:43.716]  They're compelled to do it.
[01:25:43.716 --> 01:25:45.439]  Lindsay comments on what Ironhead said.
[01:25:46.089 --> 01:25:47.649]  The devil is on the rampage.
[01:25:47.649 --> 01:25:48.730]  You're exactly right.
[01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:50.310]  You hit the nail on the head.
[01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:58.773]  He knows his time is short and he's taking advantage of everything he can do with the new world order, new young elitist.
[01:25:58.773 --> 01:26:06.535]  And the old ones, Alex, as I've expressed before, the ones giving me information now, are becoming very concerned even themselves.
[01:26:06.535 --> 01:26:07.776]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:08.736]  Satan's on the rampage.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.801]  I mean, look at the bioweapons.
[01:26:10.801 --> 01:26:12.723]  Look at all the stuff they've developed.
[01:26:12.723 --> 01:26:14.604]  They're not in control of all of this.
[01:26:14.604 --> 01:26:17.507]  Why would they develop the superweapons they've created?
[01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:25.414]  Because there's a dark force behind it that wants to blow this planet up, ladies and gentlemen, because that entity hates God's creation.
[01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:26.895]  You love the creation?
[01:26:26.895 --> 01:26:28.997]  That's just a manifestation of the Creator.
[01:26:28.997 --> 01:26:30.918]  I'm not going to start preaching here.
[01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:31.739]  This is real.
[01:26:31.739 --> 01:26:33.380]  Ironhead, anything else?
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.141]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:34.141 --> 01:26:36.163]  What I really wanted to get to, and this is the crux of the matter,
[01:26:36.727 --> 01:26:43.530]  Most people, I've never heard any of your great associates such as people I know like Bob Chapman or anybody talk about position limits.
[01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:50.632]  Most people who own gold and silver do not understand that Goldman Sachs, Chase, AKA, all of them, do not have position limits.
[01:26:50.632 --> 01:26:54.414]  As long as they have computers, they can run the trade any way they want.
[01:26:54.414 --> 01:26:59.876]  No, that's how they keep the price down, but now physical really costs more than what the paper says.
[01:26:59.876 --> 01:27:02.737]  So it's, again, it's cooked.
[01:27:02.737 --> 01:27:04.797]  It's cooked.
[01:27:04.797 --> 01:27:06.218]  What was your final point on that?
[01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:09.007]  Okay, let me finish this point.
[01:27:09.007 --> 01:27:16.209]  What has to be understood by people owning gold and silver, they can run the price of gold and silver down to zero, and they're going to do that, without a doubt.
[01:27:16.209 --> 01:27:17.529]  They're going to run it to zero.
[01:27:17.529 --> 01:27:24.471]  Most people who do not understand the markets have never traded contracts like I have for 20 years, they do not understand that you can take this thing to zero.
[01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:30.753]  They will sell into a failing market, and that's why the concept of free gold has to be understood by everybody on this planet.
[01:27:30.753 --> 01:27:34.174]  And that's what I want Lindsey to address next time, or anytime he talks to you.
[01:27:34.764 --> 01:27:40.808]  Mr. L., we have to get everybody to understand that do not sell into a falling market because they can drive it to zero.
[01:27:40.808 --> 01:27:44.111]  And the weak hands will not know what's going on.
[01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:52.236]  Well, no, they could manipulate a really big drop, but when they do something fake like that, it'll bounce straight back up even more with more force from my research.
[01:27:52.236 --> 01:27:53.777]  So, yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:53.777 --> 01:27:57.840]  If they do a panic or something, which they can pull, absolutely.
[01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:02.022]  They've done this a bunch though, not to the extent you're talking about.
[01:28:02.022 --> 01:28:02.882]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:02.882 --> 01:28:04.362]  Let's go to another one here.
[01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:07.743]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[01:28:07.743 --> 01:28:09.364]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:28:09.364 --> 01:28:11.984]  Hi, it's Michelle, but that's okay.
[01:28:11.984 --> 01:28:12.884]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:12.884 --> 01:28:14.185]  I'm dumb.
[01:28:14.185 --> 01:28:18.606]  It does say Michelle right there, but I do this thing where Michelle looks like Michael across the room.
[01:28:18.606 --> 01:28:18.886]  Go ahead.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:19.920]  That's okay.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.863]  I have three quick questions but I just want to make a statement.
[01:28:22.863 --> 01:28:33.872]  I live in Florida but we have a place in Ohio and there are people awake and we're in rural areas in both places and there's a place in Cincinnati this lady came to church and I just knew she was
[01:28:35.456 --> 01:28:39.940]  Listen, I'm going to hold you over because I want to get your full question, but let me just tell you now.
[01:28:52.251 --> 01:29:03.995]  I have gone to like children's parties with my children in different small towns, and it's scientists and doctors and retired FBI agents and biochemists just everywhere.
[01:29:03.995 --> 01:29:08.277]  And sometimes they don't even know who I am, but they're saying, do you know about the global takeover plan?
[01:29:08.277 --> 01:29:09.417]  We're preparing for it.
[01:29:09.417 --> 01:29:11.118]  Do you know about the bioweapons they've got?
[01:29:11.118 --> 01:29:14.699]  I mean, it's like they know the higher educated people get.
[01:29:15.299 --> 01:29:20.900]  The more they are, they know, because they're in the system, and they're seeing it.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.801]  Lindsey, take us out the break with what I just covered.
[01:29:23.801 --> 01:29:25.221]  Yeah, you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:26.041]  They are waking up.
[01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:27.642]  They're waking up en masse.
[01:29:27.642 --> 01:29:29.182]  And I don't know a way to market that.
[01:29:29.182 --> 01:29:33.363]  I'm also, I've been a minister of the gospel for 55 years.
[01:29:33.363 --> 01:29:37.404]  I'm in my 70s, but just as active as I was when I was back in my 50s.
[01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:41.565]  And I am seeing for the first time in the past six months a number of churches that have called me
[01:29:42.245 --> 01:29:48.789]  And say, the next time you come out with any DVD series or anything that we can put in our, that we can show to our church, send it to me.
[01:29:48.789 --> 01:30:03.218]  There are, for the first time, Alex, in 35 years that I've been out here trying to beat the bushes and tell the truth, we actually have a series of churches now who are asking me for information on an every few day basis.
[01:30:03.218 --> 01:30:03.738]  Exactly.
[01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:04.439]  Okay, stay there.
[01:30:04.439 --> 01:30:06.980]  I'm going to come back to you, Michelle, in Florida.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:07.481]  Stay with us.
[01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:19.032]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:19.032 --> 01:30:21.994]  Run on for a long time.
[01:30:21.994 --> 01:30:25.617]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:30:25.617 --> 01:30:28.599]  Run on for a long time.
[01:30:28.599 --> 01:30:31.421]  Run on for a long time.
[01:30:31.421 --> 01:30:34.403]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:30:34.403 --> 01:30:36.845]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:30:39.113 --> 01:30:46.041]  Once the globalists are identified, they've got to move with hardcore tyranny, which they're now trying to sell.
[01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:48.905]  And I think it's going over like a lead balloon.
[01:30:48.905 --> 01:30:52.049]  Doesn't matter though, they're still going to run the bulldozer right over us.
[01:30:53.393 --> 01:30:54.535]  Because they don't have a choice.
[01:30:54.535 --> 01:30:57.599]  So get ready for impact, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:57.599 --> 01:31:00.463]  Lindsey Williams, our guest this segment, the next, and Bob Chapman joins us.
[01:31:00.463 --> 01:31:01.624]  Calls will continue here.
[01:31:01.624 --> 01:31:07.493]  We're doing a fourth special hour today with several guests, including Max Keiser and Gary Franchi.
[01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:09.055]  Going back to Michelle in Florida.
[01:31:09.055 --> 01:31:10.417]  Go ahead and ask your questions, Michelle.
[01:31:11.638 --> 01:31:18.339]  Real quick, the number one question I get from other Christians are, what do the globalists have planned with these FEMA camps?
[01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:22.520]  A lot of them are thinking they're going to be sent to these FEMA camps.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:29.822]  The next one is, silver is as good as gold to have, and should we be hiding our food, guns, and ammo somewhere in our house?
[01:31:29.822 --> 01:31:31.862]  Is that for me or Lindsey?
[01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:32.962]  Both of you, either or.
[01:31:32.962 --> 01:31:36.903]  Okay, let me just briefly give you my answer, and then we'll get Lindsey's, and I appreciate your call.
[01:31:38.508 --> 01:31:42.050]  Look, they're not going to say Alex Jones goes to a FEMA camp today.
[01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:52.115]  As things collapse, they'll put the poor people in there, and of course they're going to have to be enrolled for their safety, and then there are facilities for the extremist.
[01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:54.196]  I've been to the drills, we've got the training manuals.
[01:31:54.196 --> 01:31:55.497]  This is public.
[01:31:55.497 --> 01:31:57.658]  I mean, we know how the FEMA camps are rolled out.
[01:31:57.658 --> 01:32:00.340]  It's in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.002]  It just documents and calls for further funding of what's already there.
[01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:12.178]  So, you see all these leaders in Illinois saying, we want troops on the streets, and in New Orleans and Louisiana calling for it.
[01:32:12.178 --> 01:32:15.843]  That's, it's called for by the local operatives.
[01:32:15.843 --> 01:32:18.045]  Like, oh, Vampire, please come in.
[01:32:18.045 --> 01:32:21.129]  They beguile you with this.
[01:32:21.129 --> 01:32:21.749]  Lindsey Williams.
[01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:26.733]  I have tried to get the elite on the subject of the FEMA camps numbers of times.
[01:32:26.733 --> 01:32:32.398]  You've heard me say this on your show before, Alex, and they refuse to answer any of my questions.
[01:32:32.398 --> 01:32:37.903]  When I ask something of these people, in fact, even when Mr. Braun was alive, he didn't want to answer.
[01:32:37.903 --> 01:32:42.267]  He just positively was very curt sometimes and would say, no, let's don't talk about that.
[01:32:42.267 --> 01:32:48.613]  I'm going to talk about one thing, though, and I must be very emphatic about this, despite what the previous caller said.
[01:32:49.373 --> 01:32:50.014]  But it did do it!
[01:33:05.552 --> 01:33:06.433]  In the next six months.
[01:33:36.693 --> 01:33:39.394]  Sure, well it's even in industrial metals used everywhere.
[01:33:39.394 --> 01:33:42.035]  I'm not saying I agree with the guy that they can take it to zero.
[01:33:42.035 --> 01:33:48.078]  They can sure manipulate it up and down, but every time they artificially manipulate down, it only makes it bounce back up.
[01:33:48.078 --> 01:33:53.120]  But specifically about hiding guns, gold, silver, yes, it is good to do that.
[01:33:54.088 --> 01:33:55.609]  It certainly is good to do that.
[01:34:26.089 --> 01:34:31.051]  All right, back in one minute.
[01:34:31.051 --> 01:34:42.956]  We're going to do five more minutes with Lindsey Williams, and we're going to hurry through some quick questions from Sean and Roy and Justin and Mark and others.
[01:34:42.956 --> 01:34:46.257]  But just, we'll get your question and get a quick answer from Lindsey.
[01:34:46.257 --> 01:34:47.518]  On the other side, we'll be right back.
[01:34:55.475 --> 01:35:00.297]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:35:00.297 --> 01:35:01.878]  You want answers?
[01:35:01.878 --> 01:35:03.439]  Well, so does he.
[01:35:03.439 --> 01:35:07.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:07.621 --> 01:35:11.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:11.823 --> 01:35:18.206]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[01:35:19.994 --> 01:35:23.238]  I want to go to calls, just in a quick answer.
[01:35:23.238 --> 01:35:31.468]  What about your elitist sources priming the pump with good info to sucker punch everybody down the road with disinfo?
[01:35:31.468 --> 01:35:33.110]  I mean, have you ever worried about that, Lindsey?
[01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:37.832]  I would be if it ever happened in 35 years time.
[01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:50.326]  Now keep in mind, the one person right now that gives me more information than anything else has been a very close personal friend, an ally, his entire family, his wife, his children, all of them I know personally, I've been with them.
[01:35:50.806 --> 01:35:52.347]  No, I hear what you're saying.
[01:35:52.347 --> 01:35:53.007]  Great answer.
[01:35:53.007 --> 01:35:53.568]  I believe you.
[01:35:53.568 --> 01:35:54.889]  Let's go to Roy in New York.
[01:35:54.889 --> 01:35:55.729]  You're on the air.
[01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:56.049]  Go ahead.
[01:35:56.049 --> 01:35:56.590]  Hello, Roy.
[01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:57.410]  Come on down.
[01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:58.811]  Alex Lindsey, can you hear me?
[01:35:58.811 --> 01:35:59.051]  Yes, we can.
[01:36:20.402 --> 01:36:27.586]  I'm calling deep within the confines of FEMA Region 2, and I wanted to tell Lindsay not to be discouraged.
[01:36:27.586 --> 01:36:40.113]  A lot of people are awake, and even though some of them aren't Christians, they are deeply spiritual, and I'm one of them, and I do have an upstanding relationship with my Creator, but evil will never prevail.
[01:36:41.221 --> 01:36:44.203]  Not in this lifetime or any lifetime coming after us.
[01:36:44.203 --> 01:36:46.224]  So people need to not be fearful.
[01:36:46.224 --> 01:36:47.745]  They need to be confident.
[01:36:47.745 --> 01:36:50.786]  They need to wake people up around them and do everything they can.
[01:36:50.786 --> 01:36:53.208]  Get storable food, get ammo, get all those things.
[01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:56.509]  But more importantly, wake up and reach out to people.
[01:36:56.509 --> 01:36:59.031]  And if all people say, Alex, you're real paranoid.
[01:36:59.031 --> 01:37:00.051]  No, I'm not.
[01:37:00.051 --> 01:37:02.833]  I'm aware of history and I'm out there out front.
[01:37:02.833 --> 01:37:04.914]  I know we can beat these people, Roy.
[01:37:04.914 --> 01:37:06.355]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey?
[01:37:07.972 --> 01:37:10.574]  No, I'm just happy to hear Lindsey Williams back on your show.
[01:37:10.574 --> 01:37:13.176]  Every time he does, I tune in, and I thank you both for your work.
[01:37:13.176 --> 01:37:14.017]  Well, thank you, Roy.
[01:37:14.017 --> 01:37:15.698]  Let's go to Justin in Minnesota.
[01:37:15.698 --> 01:37:16.839]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:37:16.839 --> 01:37:18.700]  You got a question?
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.802]  Yes, I do.
[01:37:20.802 --> 01:37:29.188]  Basically, I'm a Catholic, and my church has pretty much been, I don't know, it seems like playing the New World game.
[01:37:30.308 --> 01:37:33.570]  Yeah, what about the Vatican calling for a World Bank and all this stuff, Lindsey?
[01:37:55.919 --> 01:38:00.902]  You know, the elite have never been willing to talk to me about certain things, and one of them is the Vatican.
[01:38:00.902 --> 01:38:07.746]  Now, I have personal opinions, but those don't weigh at all, because you can't depend on what I think in my mind.
[01:38:07.746 --> 01:38:17.331]  But whenever these people give me something, I'll say that they have never been willing to go into the subject of the Vatican.
[01:38:17.331 --> 01:38:19.893]  Anything else you'd like to add there, sir?
[01:38:20.754 --> 01:38:29.537]  Yes, actually I have two really important comments to make because I've waited so long to get on this show.
[01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:35.880]  I'd like to point out that MIT's OpenCourseWare, they're teaching things like how to stage a revolution.
[01:38:36.781 --> 01:38:54.242]  And the quote underneath the heading is from Mao Zedong, dated 1927, and the funny thing, or sad thing I should say, is it says, How to Stage a Revolution, and it shows four men to the left with a flag, and three men and a guillotine to the right.
[01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:55.643]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[01:38:55.643 --> 01:38:56.443]  Send me that.
[01:38:56.443 --> 01:38:59.925]  Email that right now to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:38:59.925 --> 01:39:01.566]  I have that in the article.
[01:39:01.566 --> 01:39:09.170]  The Egyptians have arrested a bunch of State Department front liberal groups who claim they want democracy, but everywhere they go they try to bring tyranny.
[01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:23.241]  And the government, the illegitimate government, is creating its own little commissariat, you know, enforcer system for their fake revolution, and it's totally seditious and evil.
[01:39:23.241 --> 01:39:24.381]  Where do people find that from?
[01:39:24.381 --> 01:39:31.047]  Because I know the universities are training for revolution against the freedom, an engine of pure evil, but how do you find that?
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:47.191]  Um, you go to, um, ocw.mit.edu and go under the humanities, um, social studies, look under the heading history, and then, I mean, this is full of course work, so this is their whole course of work.
[01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:48.172]  Send it to me right now.
[01:39:48.172 --> 01:39:51.874]  Send it to me right now.
[01:39:51.874 --> 01:39:54.656]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:57.478]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.945]  We are doing a fourth hour of special transmission today.
[01:40:19.945 --> 01:40:28.253]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, Gary Franchi, who runs a big Ron Paul super PAC of Restore the Republic, is another one of the groups he created.
[01:40:28.253 --> 01:40:32.196]  Really kicked things off, of course, working with Aaron Russo, does a great job.
[01:40:32.196 --> 01:40:40.044]  He has put out a bunch of really well-produced TV ads that are as good as anything I've seen the actual campaign put out.
[01:40:42.027 --> 01:40:44.868]  So it just shows the power of the grassroots.
[01:40:44.868 --> 01:40:50.772]  He's going to be joining us then to look at some breaking economic news that Max Keiser says he's breaking here.
[01:40:50.772 --> 01:40:52.273]  He'll be on with us in the last 30 minutes.
[01:40:52.273 --> 01:40:53.954]  You're like, last 30 minutes?
[01:40:53.954 --> 01:40:55.716]  Yes, we're doing a fourth hour today.
[01:40:56.596 --> 01:41:00.578]  But people like Barbara are listening on 1630 AM KKGM.
[01:41:00.578 --> 01:41:02.639]  We're going to get to you this hour.
[01:41:02.639 --> 01:41:11.463]  You may have called in to talk to Williams, but we couldn't get to everybody, so you'll get to ask your question on myself, Bob Chapman, you name it, Robert, Justin, Barbara, Mark, Sean.
[01:41:11.463 --> 01:41:15.085]  That's Sean's first up, and we do go to the calls coming up.
[01:41:15.085 --> 01:41:21.608]  But during this hour, too, with Bob, we can go over a lot of different news and get Bob's take on it and your take as well.
[01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:24.489]  But I promise we will start going to your calls at
[01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.790]  24 after.
[01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:33.291]  We'll go to them very quickly and intersperse news with that.
[01:41:33.291 --> 01:41:43.233]  Again, if you missed what Lindsey Williams was covering, if you want to get his DVD set, breaking all this down, it's prophecyclub.com or 888-799-6111.
[01:41:43.233 --> 01:41:52.175]  Also, if you want to support what we're doing, you can go to infowars.com and get all 18 of my films, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA,
[01:41:53.015 --> 01:41:55.558]  That looks completely crazy if you're watching us on the internet.
[01:41:55.558 --> 01:42:03.246]  Because they keep showing video shots, if you're on the radio you can't see it obviously, of the Cobra staff.
[01:42:03.246 --> 01:42:14.857]  By the way, that makes me think of, we're going to Bob here in a minute, that makes me think of the report that was in the news of the guy getting arrested at the airport for the cane knife.
[01:42:15.678 --> 01:42:23.973]  And Rob Dew, who was visiting in-laws, I guess, in South Carolina, he came in today and he goes, yeah, I saw that.
[01:42:23.973 --> 01:42:25.536]  I have video of it.
[01:42:27.063 --> 01:42:51.959]  of a kind of hip-hop dressed guy who tried to go through with a cane with a knife in it and he got through the first time through the TSA and then went outside to smoke a cigarette and came back in and that's what Rob Dew actually caught on tape so we're gonna play that on the nightly news tonight and do a blurb at Infowars.com on that subject but I just digressed completely because they cut to a shot over there
[01:42:54.506 --> 01:43:04.829]  Of my 18 films, I don't think that's all of them there, that you get for 70 plus percent off for the Everything Special, and it's a great way to wake your friends and family up and support our transmission.
[01:43:04.829 --> 01:43:06.330]  And you can see this.
[01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:13.872]  This is a Cobra Commander staff, because I've joked around and talked about our government behaving like the villainous Cobra Commander.
[01:43:13.872 --> 01:43:19.514]  Someone mailed me a complete Cobra Commander mask, suit,
[01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:24.356]  The problem is that it looks like it's for a child, so obviously I can't put it on.
[01:43:24.356 --> 01:43:26.937]  Or a teenager.
[01:43:26.937 --> 01:43:31.219]  But we have the entire Cubber Commander get-up now here at the office.
[01:43:31.219 --> 01:43:32.839]  It came in on Monday.
[01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:35.920]  And this stuff has been laying around in here since I've had it.
[01:43:37.942 --> 01:43:41.906]  And the crew keeps cutting to it with no description of why.
[01:43:41.906 --> 01:43:47.172]  And I saw some comment on the web of, look, they're secretly showing cobras subliminally.
[01:43:47.172 --> 01:43:48.393]  No, it's not subliminally.
[01:43:48.393 --> 01:43:51.156]  I'm holding a cobra staff here in my hand.
[01:43:51.156 --> 01:43:52.177]  Hail Cobra!
[01:43:53.238 --> 01:43:57.979]  Everyone will now accept Globo New World Order currency.
[01:43:57.979 --> 01:43:59.640]  World government is good.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.561]  Of course, the same voice of Corporal Commander is also the voice of Starscream.
[01:44:04.561 --> 01:44:07.682]  I'm gonna be the leader, Megatron, not you!
[01:44:07.682 --> 01:44:13.584]  Okay, we've got to have some comic relief here at the end of the show.
[01:44:13.584 --> 01:44:20.445]  And if you didn't watch the Transformers back in the 1980s, well, then you don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:44:20.445 --> 01:44:21.406]  I can actually do a
[01:44:23.086 --> 01:44:26.168]  I can actually do a Optimus Prime voice.
[01:44:26.168 --> 01:44:26.688]  Did you know that?
[01:44:26.688 --> 01:44:28.629]  You think I should do it right now for people?
[01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:30.450]  I can actually do it almost perfectly.
[01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:32.851]  Almost like a John Wayne voice.
[01:44:32.851 --> 01:44:43.516]  Well, if you haven't heard the Optimus Prime voice, it's almost the Optimus Prime voice in those promos I run waking folks up saying, we take the info war now to the next level.
[01:44:43.516 --> 01:44:47.378]  But I've got to, you know, kind of focus to get into that mode.
[01:44:47.378 --> 01:44:47.738]  Do what?
[01:44:50.567 --> 01:44:51.428]  Okay, okay.
[01:44:51.428 --> 01:44:56.251]  They were just saying that Chapman's probably pouring himself another martini.
[01:44:56.251 --> 01:44:57.612]  But Chapman doesn't drink.
[01:44:57.612 --> 01:44:59.573]  That's a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:59.573 --> 01:45:01.434]  I apologize to Bob Chapman.
[01:45:01.434 --> 01:45:08.779]  The point is, if you want to support us, we've got 15-day free trials at PrisonPlanet.tv right now to try out the nightly news and all the rest of it.
[01:45:08.779 --> 01:45:16.244]  And if you do get the Everything Special, we do include a citizen rulebook that's contraband, pro-America, anti-tyranny literature.
[01:45:16.244 --> 01:45:19.867]  And the Cobra Commander Golden Staff is not included.
[01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:23.129]  I'm sorry, but it's not included.
[01:45:23.129 --> 01:45:25.031]  But InfoWars bumper stickers are.
[01:45:25.031 --> 01:45:30.176]  Bob Chapman, can you believe that 2011 has almost elapsed?
[01:45:30.176 --> 01:45:34.019]  Yes, I can, because I'm getting older and I can feel it.
[01:45:34.019 --> 01:45:41.666]  I tell you, I always heard my grandparents people talk about how time speeds up, but now it's... I don't think it's just that I'm getting older.
[01:45:41.666 --> 01:45:44.969]  I think the world is speeding up, Bob.
[01:45:44.969 --> 01:45:46.410]  It's like rocket time.
[01:45:47.458 --> 01:45:54.140]  Yeah, you just pull one page after another off the calendar, and you said, where did it all go?
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:59.081]  Well, Cobra Commander took it over.
[01:45:59.081 --> 01:46:00.081]  Probably.
[01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:04.162]  Our ruling class is like a cartoon villain.
[01:46:04.162 --> 01:46:06.542]  I mean, aren't they, Bob?
[01:46:06.542 --> 01:46:11.063]  They certainly are, but it's not cartoon, unfortunately.
[01:46:11.063 --> 01:46:12.964]  I'll give you a good example.
[01:46:14.126 --> 01:46:16.627]  The coverage in Europe is about 30-35 percent.
[01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:20.589]  In the United States it's non-existent.
[01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:33.294]  I'm talking about the European Union and the European Eurozone and their problems financially.
[01:46:33.294 --> 01:46:39.296]  You have six nations who are underwater and you've got all sorts of rules that prohibit
[01:46:40.887 --> 01:46:45.911]  The funneling of money into one project or another.
[01:46:45.911 --> 01:46:54.238]  Whether it's a bank, or a country, or an industry, or a whole country itself.
[01:46:54.238 --> 01:46:59.783]  What has happened, and the people don't understand this, and this is why I'm explaining it.
[01:46:59.783 --> 01:47:08.190]  Through swap agreements, the Federal Reserve has given the European Central Bank
[01:47:09.344 --> 01:47:12.385]  A trillion dollar line of credit.
[01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:16.347]  Now, they did it through a swap.
[01:47:16.347 --> 01:47:19.489]  Because, technically, it's not a loan.
[01:47:19.489 --> 01:47:26.612]  If you noticed two weeks ago, Mr. Bernanke says, well, we can't give them a loan because that would be against the regulations.
[01:47:26.612 --> 01:47:29.453]  Yeah, Osama bin Bernanke got caught lying.
[01:47:29.453 --> 01:47:33.595]  They are giving loans to the European banks at 0%.
[01:47:33.595 --> 01:47:35.816]  But this is how they're doing it.
[01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:37.417]  And they don't explain it in full.
[01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:48.296]  So the money gets transferred in a swap agreement dollars to the European Central Bank, which in turn digitally returns them Euros.
[01:47:48.296 --> 01:47:58.342]  So that means that they're not borrowing money in the European Central Bank from local entities.
[01:47:58.342 --> 01:48:04.006]  They're getting a loan from the Fed Reserve, so they circumvent the law as well.
[01:48:04.006 --> 01:48:07.348]  Now, Germany made a secret
[01:48:08.012 --> 01:48:16.634]  Although legal, contribution if you may, to the European Central Bank about two weeks ago they didn't tell anybody about.
[01:48:16.634 --> 01:48:26.157]  And so between the two of them they get $1.6 trillion of which 523 banks have already taken in almost $600 billion.
[01:48:26.157 --> 01:48:33.198]  And they turn around and they send the money back to the European Central Bank and say, would you hold this for us until we need it?
[01:48:33.198 --> 01:48:34.839]  The main thing they've got to do with that money
[01:48:35.655 --> 01:48:40.357]  Is to roll the debt that they've got out there.
[01:48:40.357 --> 01:48:42.838]  And some of it's colossal.
[01:48:42.838 --> 01:48:46.359]  It's too much to go into in this segment of the program.
[01:48:46.359 --> 01:48:50.781]  But I remember you three or four years ago saying the euro would implode and nobody was saying that.
[01:48:50.781 --> 01:48:51.862]  So they're certainly doing it.
[01:48:51.862 --> 01:48:58.805]  Now I understand you want to get into all the technicals of this and it's interesting, Bob, but separately, well go ahead and finish your point, but I want to get into Ron Paul.
[01:48:58.805 --> 01:49:01.045]  The point is the U.S.
[01:49:01.045 --> 01:49:02.146]  is financing
[01:49:03.123 --> 01:49:11.127]  The European Central Bank, which is financing Europe and the progenitor of the funds, is the Federal Reserve.
[01:49:11.127 --> 01:49:15.829]  They're lying to us again, and they're going to get caught at it big time this time.
[01:49:15.829 --> 01:49:22.712]  And it's going to be before... Go ahead, as you said before.
[01:49:22.712 --> 01:49:28.234]  It's going to be before anybody asks for an audit.
[01:49:28.234 --> 01:49:31.876]  This is going to be news throughout the news world.
[01:49:32.672 --> 01:49:40.617]  And sooner or later, it's going to permeate everybody like they hid the last $16.1 trillion that they did.
[01:49:40.617 --> 01:49:41.978]  Well, this is only $1 trillion.
[01:49:41.978 --> 01:49:52.125]  And one of the things about that money that's there, they can multiply that 9 to 1 and be prudent in lending under the fractional system.
[01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:55.787]  Of course, the average bank now is hung out about 35 to 1.
[01:49:55.787 --> 01:49:59.470]  So I just wanted to make those points clear, because that's where the money's coming from.
[01:50:00.487 --> 01:50:02.088]  It's very inflationary.
[01:50:02.088 --> 01:50:04.390]  Very inflationary.
[01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:11.276]  So when are you expecting the inflation to really become noticeable in places other than commodities?
[01:50:11.276 --> 01:50:16.961]  I think you'll probably see it in the second and third and fourth quarters.
[01:50:16.961 --> 01:50:20.464]  It all depends on how quickly they use the money and what they use it for.
[01:50:20.464 --> 01:50:25.548]  And at the same time, we get QE3 going, they're just not telling you about it in the United States.
[01:50:26.317 --> 01:50:26.517]  Sure.
[01:50:51.218 --> 01:50:58.483]  And then they take the remainder of the money at 9 or 35 to 1 and go in a stock market to push it up.
[01:50:58.483 --> 01:51:02.186]  And that is undoubtedly going to start pushing inflation up.
[01:51:02.186 --> 01:51:03.647]  That's right.
[01:51:03.647 --> 01:51:08.070]  And so we have all of these things going on both sides of the table here.
[01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:12.473]  And they're going to be able to keep this system going for a minimum of the year.
[01:51:12.473 --> 01:51:18.278]  The only fly I see in the ointment in Europe is, will Greece go bankrupt?
[01:51:18.278 --> 01:51:19.318]  And I think the chance is 50-50.
[01:51:21.292 --> 01:51:28.193]  And I had some conversations on banking with people in France yesterday.
[01:51:28.193 --> 01:51:31.254]  And I'm going to be talking to them again.
[01:51:31.254 --> 01:51:33.494]  But they got a serious problem there as well.
[01:51:33.494 --> 01:51:38.115]  They're going to get downgraded at least once and maybe twice.
[01:51:38.115 --> 01:51:39.095]  Alright Bob, stay there.
[01:51:39.095 --> 01:51:43.216]  I want to get into the Ron Paul demonization campaign and then the calls.
[01:51:43.216 --> 01:51:45.776]  But I blew five minutes talking about Cobra Commander.
[01:51:45.776 --> 01:51:47.857]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:51:47.857 --> 01:51:48.317]  Stay with us.
[01:51:56.772 --> 01:52:06.698]  By the way, Rob Dew, the director of the Nightly News, was in here during the break on my computer pulling it up for me that it's already online at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:06.698 --> 01:52:09.939]  Suspect with knife cane arrested at DFW Airport.
[01:52:09.939 --> 01:52:10.600]  That's a good headline.
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:15.202]  We're going to change it to Exclusive Video of Knife Cane Arrest.
[01:52:15.202 --> 01:52:17.384]  Exclusive Video of Knife Cane Arrest.
[01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:21.005]  And that way, that totally describes it.
[01:52:21.005 --> 01:52:22.085]  And the guys are being mean.
[01:52:22.085 --> 01:52:25.966]  He didn't know he was on camera concentrating, so they were putting it on TV if you were watching that.
[01:52:25.966 --> 01:52:28.046]  That's the kind of thing Jaron and Chris do in there.
[01:52:28.046 --> 01:52:29.687]  They're like two gremlins.
[01:52:29.687 --> 01:52:46.351]  Going back to Bob Chapman, what do you make of tens of thousands of different publications of newsletters over 20 years, 20-plus-year-old stuff, less than 10 lines, as Ron Paul's pointed out, of, you know, mildly disparaging stuff against, you know, inner-city gangbanger types?
[01:52:47.637 --> 01:52:52.258]  And Ron Paul's always been on record who he is, what he supports, what he stands for.
[01:52:52.258 --> 01:52:59.560]  I happen to know all the real Ron Paul lore of him working for, you know, $2 a day at charity hospitals on purpose to help people.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.601]  Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, you know, Mr. Dudley Do-Right is the truth about Ron Paul.
[01:53:04.601 --> 01:53:06.902]  I mean, you watch footage of him 30 years ago on TV.
[01:53:06.902 --> 01:53:12.083]  He's the same really smart, kind of hokey, nice guy, and they're just running with this
[01:53:22.008 --> 01:53:24.369]  Well, I think it's to be expected.
[01:53:24.369 --> 01:53:39.577]  We have, for once in a long time, a real contender who understands all the problems, knows how to fix them, and who, if elected, will knock the people behind the scenes right out of the box.
[01:53:40.282 --> 01:53:50.610]  Because he'll take down the Federal Reserve System and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, and those are the two keys to keep them in control.
[01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:53.233]  And so, this is big-time stuff.
[01:53:53.233 --> 01:54:05.082]  They're going to do everything, including making up, as the program goes on, or the election nomination goes on, it's going to get worse and worse.
[01:54:05.082 --> 01:54:08.685]  They will create things that never existed before.
[01:54:08.685 --> 01:54:09.786]  These people are desperate.
[01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:17.616]  Well, it's like when they dressed up as hayseeds, saying racist things, claiming they supported Rand Paul, and then said he kidnapped women.
[01:54:17.616 --> 01:54:19.498]  I mean, it's going to get crazy.
[01:54:19.498 --> 01:54:22.860]  But the fact is, we know the establishment's bought and paid for.
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:24.100]  We know they're corrupt.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:27.583]  They're all saying Ron Paul's bad because he's so good.
[01:54:27.583 --> 01:54:37.469]  Let's go to this clip, and I'm going to get Franchione and ask where he found this guy down in South Texas, where the black fellow with his white wife couldn't get any care.
[01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:49.758]  And then all of a sudden Ron Paul came in and took care of him and then said forget the bill, but that's pretty much standard procedure for Ron Paul from what I've heard from his patients and others and from his neighbors of years by the way.
[01:54:49.758 --> 01:54:56.042]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:54:56.042 --> 01:55:00.726]  It was between 1972 and 73, but it was still a lot of prejudice around this area.
[01:55:06.363 --> 01:55:11.284]  My wife was sick and I was trying to get some attention for her.
[01:55:11.284 --> 01:55:13.005]  Nobody came to check.
[01:55:13.005 --> 01:55:15.265]  They just left her there.
[01:55:15.265 --> 01:55:21.847]  Well, I believe I was left there because of the difference, uh, me being black and her being white.
[01:55:21.847 --> 01:55:28.769]  And every time I would say something to her head nicer, she would get pretty upset.
[01:55:28.769 --> 01:55:34.151]  And then she finally called the, uh, Freeport Police Department.
[01:55:34.151 --> 01:55:35.471]  Said I was harassing her.
[01:55:36.798 --> 01:55:39.301]  And I mean, I didn't know anything to do.
[01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:42.844]  Well, then Ron Paul come to my rescue.
[01:55:42.844 --> 01:55:47.508]  He just stepped in and went to work with my wife.
[01:55:47.508 --> 01:55:57.838]  And after he seen her, I say no more than 10 minutes later, she had a stillborn boy child.
[01:55:57.838 --> 01:56:01.882]  And he said, as far as the bill, he would take care of everything, which he did.
[01:56:02.697 --> 01:56:20.386]  I never got a bill from the hospital or anything and he was a doctor of medicine and that's what he was doing was practicing medicine and it didn't matter who and what and why he was doing it because he think of one human being just as much as another.
[01:56:20.386 --> 01:56:28.230]  He's just a honest man and that's something we need now in this day and time.
[01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:30.932]  It's a lot of politics and no honesty.
[01:56:31.932 --> 01:56:39.283]  When you have honesty, well, people will try to do anything to blot you out.
[01:56:39.283 --> 01:56:46.513]  And that's what they will try to do to him, is blot him out, because he will be honest.
[01:56:46.513 --> 01:56:47.735]  And they need more like him.
[01:56:49.793 --> 01:56:50.714]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:50.714 --> 01:56:59.081]  Ron Paul is not for financing forced abortions in China, or they tell women they've basically got to have them to get any form of assistance in Africa.
[01:56:59.081 --> 01:57:04.906]  Ron Paul is, of course, against mandatory sentencing, which is designed to put mainly black males in prison.
[01:57:04.906 --> 01:57:06.688]  He's given all these speeches, explain that.
[01:57:08.283 --> 01:57:13.386]  And of course, Mr. Williams, James Williams, who's there on the commercial, understands that.
[01:57:13.386 --> 01:57:14.807]  We'll get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[01:57:14.807 --> 01:57:16.008]  Go to your phone calls.
[01:57:16.008 --> 01:57:27.534]  Get more into the hit piece by slimeball Chris Matthews, host of Globalist Slimeball, on the hardly viewed, ghost-like MSNBC.
[01:57:27.534 --> 01:57:29.015]  A shadow of its former
[01:57:30.848 --> 01:57:33.130]  Skinny, hardly viewed self.
[01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:37.213]  So it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow's reflection.
[01:57:37.213 --> 01:57:40.195]  We'll be right back as the mainline media.
[01:57:40.195 --> 01:57:44.799]  We're on.
[01:57:44.799 --> 01:57:51.384]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:57:51.384 --> 01:57:55.307]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:58:02.876 --> 01:58:13.304]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.304 --> 01:58:16.786]  Yeah, governors, we don't need any stinking governors or legislatures.
[01:58:16.786 --> 01:58:22.030]  We just have FEMA regions and ten governors and the Pentagon's over it.
[01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:25.212]  Oh yeah, you guys were worried about us using the military against you?
[01:58:25.212 --> 01:58:26.073]  We are going to!
[01:58:28.922 --> 01:58:47.296]  By the way, we produced a video that took us four or five days to put together, and then I premiered it here yesterday at this time in the third hour, and since then it's rolled off the front page of InfoWars.com, but if you just type in Slow Kill Holocaust, you'll find the video.
[01:58:47.296 --> 01:58:51.138]  Just put it into a search engine, Slow Kill Holocaust.
[01:58:51.138 --> 01:58:52.860]  Proof the government is killing you!
[01:58:54.286 --> 01:59:13.997]  And get the video and send it out to everyone you know because we have the Planned Parenthood documents and other information where they say we're going to break up the family, we're going to encourage homosexuality so people don't have children, and we're going to put chemicals in the food and water to sterilize you and to confuse your sexuality.
[01:59:13.997 --> 01:59:16.679]  And this is all part of why the public
[01:59:17.822 --> 01:59:29.508]  Even if you're awake, a lot of people can't get motivated or angry because you're being given all sorts of toxic chemicals that are known to reduce aggression, to lower IQ.
[01:59:29.508 --> 01:59:30.849]  And it's very, very nasty.
[01:59:30.849 --> 01:59:33.330]  And this is only a 15-minute video.
[01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:35.271]  It covers a tiny part of it.
[01:59:35.271 --> 01:59:36.632]  And you'll think, man, this is overkill.
[01:59:36.632 --> 01:59:39.613]  There's like 50 different documents and articles.
[01:59:39.613 --> 01:59:42.134]  It's nothing, okay?
[01:59:42.134 --> 01:59:42.695]  It's nothing.
[01:59:42.695 --> 01:59:43.855]  That's the problem.
[01:59:43.855 --> 01:59:45.476]  It's so much bigger.
[01:59:45.476 --> 01:59:46.697]  The world's so much larger.
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.081]  People say the world's getting smaller.
[01:59:50.081 --> 01:59:52.402]  To use that figurative term, it's really getting bigger.
[01:59:52.402 --> 01:59:57.924]  And there's more information, more things, more things going on, more facts to know.
[01:59:57.924 --> 02:00:01.946]  And in that complexity, evil can hide itself.
[02:00:01.946 --> 02:00:03.706]  And now it's not even hiding itself.
[02:00:03.706 --> 02:00:06.968]  Evil is out in the open, declaring everything good as bad.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:28.531]  By the way, if you want to get a copy of the International Forecaster, a full year subscription of either the hard copy or the twice a week email version, Midas Resources has a great deal where if you get a Swiss or European franc at cost, fifth of an ounce, great gold coin, great prices on those, very extremely competitive, you get $159 free.
[02:00:31.053 --> 02:00:45.228]  Your subscription to the International Forecaster with it at MidasResources, MidasResources.com or simply call 888, I was about to give out the number to my staff because they also have an 888 number, but 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237 and there's also a special number to call to get that video book
[02:00:53.197 --> 02:00:56.038]  Three silver dollars at cost deal.
[02:00:56.038 --> 02:00:58.278]  Well, the book and the video were free, so was the shipping.
[02:00:58.278 --> 02:01:02.679]  But I can't remember that 888 number to minus the special number for that deal.
[02:01:02.679 --> 02:01:04.540]  So just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:12.082]  There's a big banner at the top that says, buy these silver dollars, get free book and video, and that'll take you to a spot online where you can find that as well.
[02:01:12.082 --> 02:01:14.882]  Okay, I want to go to your phone calls now with Bob Chapman.
[02:01:14.882 --> 02:01:17.563]  I got a bunch of other news I'm going to hit with Bob here.
[02:01:18.323 --> 02:01:18.704]  Hey Alex.
[02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:44.232]  First of all, people are awake.
[02:01:44.232 --> 02:01:45.213]  They're very awake.
[02:01:45.213 --> 02:01:46.593]  I went to go... I'm in Chicago.
[02:01:46.593 --> 02:01:49.455]  I went to go see Ron Paul speak last week.
[02:01:49.455 --> 02:01:51.496]  I grabbed a couple yard signs.
[02:01:51.496 --> 02:01:52.777]  Went back to my condo.
[02:01:52.777 --> 02:01:54.678]  All the way back from I-80.
[02:01:54.678 --> 02:01:55.559]  All the way back.
[02:01:55.559 --> 02:01:56.399]  People were honking.
[02:01:56.399 --> 02:01:57.620]  They were flashing their lights.
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:00.142]  They were giving me the thumbs up.
[02:02:00.142 --> 02:02:03.524]  And then I parked... I live in a place called Lake Point Tower.
[02:02:03.524 --> 02:02:04.945]  It's where Axelrod lives.
[02:02:04.945 --> 02:02:07.286]  That's where Sherry Blalick used to live.
[02:02:07.286 --> 02:02:08.307]  Very, very liberal.
[02:02:08.307 --> 02:02:09.727]  Liberal part of town.
[02:02:09.727 --> 02:02:10.528]  Very liberal building.
[02:02:12.236 --> 02:02:16.861]  I walked down the block from where I parked my car.
[02:02:16.861 --> 02:02:18.943]  People were pulling over and stopping.
[02:02:18.943 --> 02:02:21.606]  People were stopping me on the street because I had two Ron Paul signs.
[02:02:21.606 --> 02:02:22.567]  So people are awake.
[02:02:23.291 --> 02:02:23.671]  No, no.
[02:02:23.671 --> 02:02:34.634]  Ron Paul, as he said, is the focal point of the revolution, the counter-revolution against the global banker collectivist and their attempt to dehumanize and make us all dependent.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:37.975]  And so win, lose, or draw, we win by Ron Paul running.
[02:02:37.975 --> 02:02:41.375]  So even if they cheat him and pull out all the stops, we still win.
[02:02:41.375 --> 02:02:47.477]  But it's a bigger win that, for the first time, the corporate dinosaur zombie controller media
[02:02:48.337 --> 02:02:52.138]  He is attacking somebody and it's actually making their poll numbers go up.
[02:02:52.138 --> 02:02:55.580]  So Ron Paul, I would add, is in physical danger, no doubts.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.980]  People should pray for him.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:02.942]  But what you pointed out is a great way people can experience what I've experienced without being well known.
[02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:06.984]  I'm well known now from radio, TV, internet.
[02:03:06.984 --> 02:03:12.786]  And so if I go down the street, every third person or at a restaurant or whatever comes over and is a listener.
[02:03:13.646 --> 02:03:19.048]  And I can be in the third world, I can be in Europe, and this happens very intensely now.
[02:03:19.048 --> 02:03:21.069]  I can be in Canada, and it happens.
[02:03:21.069 --> 02:03:23.750]  I can be in Florida, New York, wherever.
[02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:27.531]  And it's growing, and that is a focal point of how many people are awake.
[02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:29.311]  It's not like, oh great, people recognize me.
[02:03:29.311 --> 02:03:33.533]  It's actually kind of creepy, because enemies can recognize you too, and that happens occasionally.
[02:03:34.493 --> 02:03:34.954]  Well, I think
[02:04:00.476 --> 02:04:04.766]  The underlying thought process is we've got to have change.
[02:04:04.766 --> 02:04:06.430]  And who's the guy that's telling the truth?
[02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:07.031]  It's Ron Paul.
[02:04:07.777 --> 02:04:11.118]  And so he's the one that they're going to be drawn to.
[02:04:11.118 --> 02:04:16.080]  I'm hearing out of Iowa that he's got 50% of the vote.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:30.004]  I'm also hearing that the Republican committee has moved, is going to move the ballots to a safer place because there are people who are about who might try to interdict the things.
[02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:33.032]  Oh no, that's Washington Post with a straight face.
[02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:35.855]  Oh, it's going to be secret what each precinct votes.
[02:04:35.855 --> 02:04:41.261]  It's going to go to a secret area now for your safety because the hackers threatened.
[02:04:41.261 --> 02:04:42.562]  Sure they did.
[02:04:42.562 --> 02:04:43.663]  Another false flag.
[02:04:43.663 --> 02:04:47.127]  Do you smell a giant stinking rat?
[02:04:47.127 --> 02:04:47.848]  Absolutely.
[02:04:48.638 --> 02:05:03.512]  But they're trying to get away with it, and it'll be interesting to see what... They're such a group of crooks, such a group of corrupt blobs, such filth, such criminals, such scumbob, and people can't believe... I hope they're listening.
[02:05:03.512 --> 02:05:04.613]  Yeah, no, they are!
[02:05:04.613 --> 02:05:12.521]  These are... Folks, later more stuff's gonna come out, not just government drug dealing and money laundering and killing and white slavery and torture.
[02:05:15.117 --> 02:05:16.959]  You've been fighting these people 50 years, Bob.
[02:05:16.959 --> 02:05:24.525]  Undoubtedly, it's gotten worse because, you know, there's this paradigm in corruption, as you know, that the most corrupt in any group will then lead the pack.
[02:05:24.525 --> 02:05:27.668]  And then the next most corrupt will then double down.
[02:05:27.668 --> 02:05:29.790]  And so evil always intensifies.
[02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:31.191]  That's the thing.
[02:05:31.191 --> 02:05:33.973]  What's your take on that statement?
[02:05:33.973 --> 02:05:34.934]  It's perfect.
[02:05:34.934 --> 02:05:38.017]  And that means that we can never, ever stop.
[02:05:39.315 --> 02:05:50.502]  Even if we get Ron Paul elected and reverse all kinds of laws over the next eight, nine years, we still have to be vigilant every single second of the day.
[02:05:50.502 --> 02:05:52.563]  Because we've seen what's happened in history.
[02:05:52.563 --> 02:05:57.306]  You know, you let your guard down and you duck soup.
[02:05:57.306 --> 02:05:57.787]  Well said.
[02:05:57.787 --> 02:05:58.967]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:06:02.701 --> 02:06:06.482]  Yeah, Alex, I'm the one that called and told you about Obama's birth certificate.
[02:06:06.482 --> 02:06:08.142]  I guess that was half right.
[02:06:08.142 --> 02:06:12.303]  You know, he had one, but they were, I heard he was going to release it on the Super Bowl.
[02:06:12.303 --> 02:06:23.225]  The same people were telling me that, they told me this from July, their projections from the internal White House projections are that it's going to be a broken primary for the Republican Party.
[02:06:23.225 --> 02:06:28.126]  If you guys can speak on that, they think that Ron Paul has enough delegates.
[02:06:28.126 --> 02:06:30.386]  He's not going to win, but nobody else will.
[02:06:31.084 --> 02:06:32.404]  Is that a victory?
[02:06:32.404 --> 02:06:34.225]  And could you comment more on that?
[02:06:34.225 --> 02:06:47.529]  Well, the Republicans are getting everybody ready for a brokered because, you know, the Paulites, as the establishment dinosaur liars call them, are going to be there at the delegate level.
[02:06:47.529 --> 02:06:52.311]  But you did call a few months before and said they're going to release the birth certificate in a big stunt.
[02:06:52.311 --> 02:06:55.672]  And then it didn't happen when you said it happened, but it did happen as a big stunt.
[02:06:56.492 --> 02:06:58.933]  So I appreciate that information.
[02:06:58.933 --> 02:07:02.915]  What's your take on a broker convention, Bob Chapman?
[02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:06.597]  Possible, but there's going to be an awful lot of irate people.
[02:07:06.597 --> 02:07:14.120]  And for our side, it's going to accomplish nothing, which means that Ron Paul is going to have to run on another ticket.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.821]  He's got to run on some ticket.
[02:07:16.926 --> 02:07:18.027]  Well, I agree.
[02:07:18.027 --> 02:07:22.830]  He's been trying to, on the surface, say he probably won't run third party, but the door is open.
[02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:25.492]  He has to, just to inject real issues.
[02:07:25.492 --> 02:07:29.534]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Mark and then Barbara and others.
[02:07:29.534 --> 02:07:31.375]  Mark, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:07:31.375 --> 02:07:33.577]  Go ahead.
[02:07:33.577 --> 02:07:34.297]  Thank you for calling.
[02:07:34.297 --> 02:07:38.320]  I've been trying to get online for years.
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:41.942]  I've got two quick points that kind of freaked me out yesterday.
[02:07:41.942 --> 02:07:46.105]  The first day this week you had Lindsey Williams on, I went to go
[02:07:47.082 --> 02:08:02.652]  Find the speech myself and also like you were saying I went to go check on ammunition non-perishables and all of a sudden about an hour later I had a knock on my door and it was an AT&T person.
[02:08:02.652 --> 02:08:15.721]  It was kind of weird because I tried to get AT&T that cable universe a while back ago and got denied for it so I was like okay that's not a big deal don't need it anyway but then all of a sudden this guy popped up and he was AT&T supposedly guy.
[02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:23.928]  He had a paper badge and immediately I looked because he was trying to ask my wife questions and I looked at his badge to make sure he was legit.
[02:08:23.928 --> 02:08:26.033]  It was a paper badge, like something you could print off.
[02:08:26.736 --> 02:08:28.577]  In your house.
[02:08:28.577 --> 02:08:37.683]  Kid expired on the 31st of this month and he had I was just very observant just from listening to your show.
[02:08:37.683 --> 02:08:39.884]  I was trying to watch everything he was doing.
[02:08:39.884 --> 02:08:46.468]  He had a packet and there were a packet was split up into different regions and had everybody's information.
[02:08:47.168 --> 02:08:48.869]  And immediately it went to my head.
[02:08:48.869 --> 02:08:54.533]  I was like, one of these are people who listen to Alex Jones and there's some kind of way they know.
[02:08:54.533 --> 02:09:00.636]  And he was asking, you know, he knew how many people were in my house, how many TVs we had.
[02:09:00.636 --> 02:09:01.517]  And it was crazy.
[02:09:01.517 --> 02:09:10.002]  And the one thing that gave him away was the fact that when he called back to his central location, he was speaking in military term.
[02:09:11.195 --> 02:09:15.738]  So he was saying Echo and Romeo instead of saying...
[02:09:30.146 --> 02:09:45.617]  If you have reloading equipment, if there's plates in your thing, you wonder why the CPS comes and takes your kids, and you bring in service people into your house, that's why it's good to go with small companies or good old boys you know, and they are literal government spies.
[02:09:45.617 --> 02:09:49.760]  They're trying to turn America into the Soviet Union, basically.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:52.643]  Again, this is a conscious, totally wicked agenda.
[02:09:53.323 --> 02:10:00.988]  And they've got all the service clerks spying on you, and the rental car people, and the hotel people, and they get off on it!
[02:10:00.988 --> 02:10:10.415]  They get off on spying on you and treating you like you're a crook, because they work for narcotics trafficking, money laundering, child kidnapping, murderers!
[02:10:10.415 --> 02:10:18.681]  The government is run by pure evil at the top, and they're turning everyone into their little Renfield servants.
[02:10:18.681 --> 02:10:21.523]  And so, how did this creepy story end, Mark?
[02:10:22.952 --> 02:10:30.654]  He, uh, after a while he called in and he had this fake badge number and he got kind of nervous because his badge number wouldn't work when he was calling in.
[02:10:30.654 --> 02:10:37.735]  So I just played along with the game and tried to order the service with him to see if he could actually get the service turned on in my house.
[02:10:37.735 --> 02:10:39.656]  He started fumbling over his words.
[02:10:39.656 --> 02:10:44.157]  It's kind of like he already knew that I had tried this before and it didn't work and he knew he was going to get
[02:10:44.892 --> 02:10:46.473]  Well, there's another thing that could be happening.
[02:10:46.473 --> 02:10:53.316]  There's a lot of general criminals posing as service people as well, and he could have been casing you out, but I appreciate your call.
[02:10:53.316 --> 02:10:55.877]  So how did it end?
[02:10:55.877 --> 02:10:57.838]  He finally caught wind.
[02:10:57.838 --> 02:11:03.161]  I got to talking, and I actually started talking about your show and talking about, you know, how things are going on in the world.
[02:11:03.161 --> 02:11:04.121]  It kind of freaked him out.
[02:11:04.121 --> 02:11:05.502]  He kind of hurried up and tried to end his...
[02:11:06.129 --> 02:11:12.836]  I was about to say, sometimes their agents are sub-minions and they want you to know their government like it's going to intimidate you.
[02:11:12.836 --> 02:11:15.358]  And as soon as you let them know you're not afraid, they hate it.
[02:11:15.358 --> 02:11:17.080]  They literally drink the fear.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:18.101]  Appreciate your call.
[02:11:18.101 --> 02:11:20.924]  Bob Chapman, your take on this?
[02:11:20.924 --> 02:11:22.605]  I think we can trace this back.
[02:11:23.799 --> 02:11:37.638]  To the end of the demarcation between East and West Germany and Marcus Wolf being invited to the United States along with the people who worked in Stasi to tell you how they control people.
[02:11:37.638 --> 02:11:41.342]  They had the most sophisticated operation in the Soviet Union.
[02:11:42.243 --> 02:11:54.315]  And so this is where all of these kinds of ideas came from and how they were refined and then passed on to the United States government.
[02:11:54.315 --> 02:12:01.042]  But more importantly, and I agree with you, it's about a chilling effect where now they want you to know they'll arrest you for no reason.
[02:12:01.042 --> 02:12:02.364]  They want you to know they're spying.
[02:12:02.364 --> 02:12:03.405]  Good, you little crooks!
[02:12:03.965 --> 02:12:05.246]  Good, I'm glad you're scum.
[02:12:05.246 --> 02:12:06.526]  I don't have anything to hide.
[02:12:06.526 --> 02:12:07.587]  You filth.
[02:12:07.587 --> 02:12:08.647]  You do.
[02:12:08.647 --> 02:12:09.848]  And that's the attitude.
[02:12:09.848 --> 02:12:12.029]  They're doing this to create a chilling effect.
[02:12:12.029 --> 02:12:16.591]  Barbara in Texas, listening on 1630 AM out of Dallas, KKGM.
[02:12:16.591 --> 02:12:18.112]  Go ahead, Barbara, you're on the air.
[02:12:18.112 --> 02:12:19.873]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:19.873 --> 02:12:27.537]  I'm an old woman, but I've been getting woke up by the Southwest Radio Church in Oklahoma for 65 years.
[02:12:27.537 --> 02:12:28.637]  Oh, I've been a guest on that.
[02:12:28.637 --> 02:12:30.178]  They're great people.
[02:12:30.178 --> 02:12:32.880]  Yes, and what I wanted to know was
[02:12:35.052 --> 02:12:39.333]  Uh, where it can get a radio log, uh, of you.
[02:12:39.333 --> 02:12:51.557]  And, uh, then what they said on Southwest Radio today was that now the law has been put in place that our military can sodomize and they can do bestiality stuff.
[02:12:51.557 --> 02:12:54.678]  Yeah, yeah, by the way, uh, I didn't read the whole NDAA.
[02:12:54.678 --> 02:13:01.480]  It was thousands of pages, but I scanned over the sections that I saw Ron Paul talking about and stuff and read it, and I heard it's got bestiality in it.
[02:13:02.148 --> 02:13:03.209]  And I was like, come on.
[02:13:03.209 --> 02:13:14.957]  And I went and pulled it up, control F'd on the computer, you know, for keyword search, bestiality, and it says the military can take pigs, cows, whatever they want, right into the barracks.
[02:13:14.957 --> 02:13:18.319]  Guys, pull in NDAA legalizes bestiality.
[02:13:18.319 --> 02:13:19.860]  You cannot make this up.
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:20.821]  I mean, it's always...
[02:13:21.161 --> 02:13:22.182]  That's what I know.
[02:13:22.182 --> 02:13:26.225]  It says they're now gonna have pigs on base and goats and stuff.
[02:13:26.225 --> 02:13:36.233]  I mean, who can... It said the troops now, like, instead of, like, just showing two women kissing on the cover of a magazine, they're now gonna be met by, like, a cow or something when you get off the ship.
[02:13:36.233 --> 02:13:37.634]  Bob Chapman, your take on that.
[02:13:37.634 --> 02:13:38.675]  I'm not kidding.
[02:13:38.675 --> 02:13:40.997]  It doesn't get any weirder than that.
[02:13:40.997 --> 02:13:43.819]  I'm telling you.
[02:13:43.819 --> 02:13:46.381]  That is unbelievable.
[02:13:47.014 --> 02:13:53.780]  And by the way, as for RadioLog, ma'am, we probably should have every show available on DVD or something for sale, but we just never did it.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:14:08.434]  All the archives are online, saved, and if you've got friends and family that are savvy on computers, I'm not very savvy, they can download it and put it on disk or whatever for you, but by RadioLog, what specifically do you mean?
[02:14:09.494 --> 02:14:13.677]  I want to know what stations I can find you on when I go across the country.
[02:14:13.677 --> 02:14:15.459]  Oh, you're talking about an affiliate list.
[02:14:15.459 --> 02:14:16.980]  Yes, that's it.
[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:18.821]  GCNlive.com.
[02:14:18.821 --> 02:14:19.702]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:19.702 --> 02:14:20.662]  God bless you.
[02:14:20.662 --> 02:14:23.705]  Yeah, there's Texas GOP vote is talking about it.
[02:14:23.705 --> 02:14:29.349]  Texas senators vote to legalize sex with animals and National Defense Authorization Act.
[02:14:29.349 --> 02:14:31.230]  They found a Texas article.
[02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:34.613]  Just type in NDAA bestiality.
[02:14:34.613 --> 02:14:35.834]  You'll get like AP Reuters.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.183]  Yo, Bob, who can make this up?
[02:14:42.183 --> 02:14:45.766]  It is beyond anything I ever thought would happen.
[02:14:45.766 --> 02:14:50.349]  I knew of the rampant pedophilia that had gone on for the last hundred years.
[02:14:51.398 --> 02:14:59.362]  That was recordable, but bringing animals into the act is a... I don't know what's behind that.
[02:14:59.362 --> 02:15:04.404]  I shouldn't laugh, but pretty soon you'll get arrested like in Europe in criticized groups.
[02:15:04.404 --> 02:15:12.947]  You'll go to a party or you'll go out and there'll be someone there like with their monkey or their pig dressed up and there'll be wedding services.
[02:15:12.947 --> 02:15:13.748]  No, I'm not kidding.
[02:15:13.748 --> 02:15:15.108]  Their group's calling for that, Bob.
[02:15:18.852 --> 02:15:20.994]  Somebody shows up, get married to their donkey.
[02:15:20.994 --> 02:15:22.215]  I mean, what?
[02:15:22.215 --> 02:15:24.157]  There's no end to this.
[02:15:24.157 --> 02:15:25.398]  Oh, man.
[02:15:25.398 --> 02:15:28.801]  Okay, I shouldn't.
[02:15:28.801 --> 02:15:31.063]  We'll be right back with more of your calls straight ahead.
[02:15:31.063 --> 02:15:33.285]  And then we've got our fourth hour we're doing today.
[02:15:33.285 --> 02:15:38.169]  And if your local AM and FM doesn't cover it, it'll be on the audio streams at Infowars.com.
[02:15:38.169 --> 02:15:40.571]  But this is Key coming up with Gary Franchian.
[02:15:48.365 --> 02:15:55.432]  Yeah, this hadn't been a big media issue, but I have seen it in the news, and during the break I looked it up.
[02:15:55.432 --> 02:16:04.360]  At White House press briefing, a reporter asked if Obama approves of bestiality, because it's in the new National Defense Authorization Act.
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:05.621]  And here's the report.
[02:16:05.621 --> 02:16:09.305]  The two Texas senators voted for it.
[02:16:09.305 --> 02:16:11.247]  I mean, you can't be politically incorrect.
[02:16:14.175 --> 02:16:18.878]  Here's the Indiana Express News reporting, SPCA reports alleged bestiality with dogs.
[02:16:18.878 --> 02:16:21.740]  Well, you're being beast-a-phobic.
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.941]  You're just not open-minded.
[02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:28.124]  Okay, I just, this is unbelievable.
[02:16:28.124 --> 02:16:34.788]  Yes, Senate defense bill removes military ban on sodomy and bestiality.
[02:16:34.788 --> 02:16:35.829]  That's off LifeSite.
[02:16:37.330 --> 02:16:42.853]  Here's a Washington Post article about it, and they report it like it's kind of cool.
[02:16:42.853 --> 02:16:44.714]  Hey, this is trendy.
[02:16:44.714 --> 02:16:47.375]  When I talk about trendiness, folks, they sell.
[02:16:47.375 --> 02:16:49.416]  It's not trendy to like Ron Paul.
[02:16:49.416 --> 02:16:51.137]  He's a kook.
[02:16:51.137 --> 02:16:53.138]  It's not trendy to be into freedom.
[02:16:53.138 --> 02:16:54.078]  Hey, look at these guys.
[02:16:54.078 --> 02:16:55.679]  They don't want troops on the streets.
[02:16:55.679 --> 02:16:57.139]  They're crazy.
[02:16:57.139 --> 02:16:58.920]  Meanwhile, a couple years ago, they're crazy.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.681]  They think we want to put troops on the streets.
[02:17:00.681 --> 02:17:02.242]  Now we are, but they're still crazy.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.664]  And the general public just kind of buys into all this stuff, those that aren't awake.
[02:17:10.664 --> 02:17:13.126]  We've got Gary Franchi coming up here.
[02:17:13.126 --> 02:17:18.710]  I'm going to do a special year-end top ten news stories from our perspective, not on the nightly news and a lot more.
[02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:25.175]  Ray McGovern's joining us, but we do have a whole other hour coming up as we talk about Ron Paul and a bunch of other issues I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:17:28.223 --> 02:17:35.554]  I want to go back to the calls in this little short segment and the next with Bob Chapman before he's got to leave us.
[02:17:35.554 --> 02:17:37.296]  But let's go ahead and go to some more calls here.
[02:17:37.296 --> 02:17:40.561]  But I mean, just briefly going back to this, Bob.
[02:17:40.561 --> 02:17:43.345]  More and more, I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:17:43.345 --> 02:17:44.306]  Don't you feel like that?
[02:17:46.274 --> 02:17:49.516]  I really do, and it's things I never expected.
[02:17:49.516 --> 02:17:59.122]  I didn't think that that kind of agenda would be important, but the way they've shaped this whole thing, it's the total disruption.
[02:17:59.122 --> 02:18:11.910]  Now, you brought it up earlier with the acceptance of homosexuality and to keep the birth rate down and things like that, so it figures if you're not doing it human to human,
[02:18:14.192 --> 02:18:17.675]  Maybe you should go off and do things with animals.
[02:18:17.675 --> 02:18:24.121]  And so I guess it does conform to today's thinking in their part.
[02:18:24.121 --> 02:18:28.205]  But I would have never thought that they would get into that.
[02:18:28.205 --> 02:18:31.989]  Well, all I can say is that things are definitely going insane.
[02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:40.859]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air with extremists who think that the military should not have pigs on board aircraft carriers for the captain's pleasure.
[02:18:40.859 --> 02:18:41.780]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.982]  Go ahead.
[02:18:43.982 --> 02:18:46.264]  Well, I guess I'm one of those extremists too.
[02:18:46.264 --> 02:18:47.666]  I'll try to make this quick.
[02:18:47.666 --> 02:18:51.109]  Yeah, when you see a squirrel in a tree, you don't get excited.
[02:18:51.109 --> 02:18:52.271]  You are a bad person.
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:59.305]  Or watch Animal Planet in the middle of the night by yourself with a box of tissues.
[02:18:59.305 --> 02:19:01.106]  Anyway... Okay, let's stop.
[02:19:01.106 --> 02:19:01.987]  I shouldn't have gone there.
[02:19:01.987 --> 02:19:02.408]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:02.408 --> 02:19:03.008]  Go ahead.
[02:19:03.008 --> 02:19:03.549]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.969]  My fault.
[02:19:03.969 --> 02:19:04.650]  My fault.
[02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:06.772]  Okay, anyway, real quick.
[02:19:06.772 --> 02:19:12.577]  The Mark Levin Show got blitzed by Ron Paul supporters last night.
[02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:16.841]  The video is up on Funkmaster5.com or the YouTube channel Funkmaster5.
[02:19:16.841 --> 02:19:18.343]  Who got blitzed?
[02:19:18.343 --> 02:19:18.543]  Great.
[02:19:19.657 --> 02:19:28.941]  The Mark Levin Show and it was one caller and then two callers later another caller called in and just pummeled him with facts and information.
[02:19:28.941 --> 02:19:38.426]  He tried to call the fact that Ron Paul has the most military support out of all the candidates a myth and after the first caller called in I called in myself
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.827]  And named four sources that are credible sources for that.
[02:19:42.827 --> 02:19:46.514]  But even Bloomberg admitted that and said it was a horrible thing.
[02:19:46.514 --> 02:19:49.560]  He has more support from government workers than any other candidate.
[02:19:50.643 --> 02:19:51.903]  Well, we flattened this guy.
[02:19:51.903 --> 02:19:56.484]  He was a guest host neocon guy on there, and we absolutely, uh, pummeled him.
[02:19:56.484 --> 02:20:00.005]  It's on Funkmaster 5 if you want to... You know, that's what I can't believe about these shows.
[02:20:00.005 --> 02:20:04.206]  They claim all day they're trying to keep us safe from the Muslim dreaded threat and all this stuff.
[02:20:04.206 --> 02:20:09.907]  But meanwhile, you got a better chance dying from champagne corks than some crazy, you know, jihadi blowing you up.
[02:20:09.907 --> 02:20:18.329]  And then, I talk to these neocons when they lecture me, some of them call me, and I tell them, hey, the government's funding al-Qaeda in Libya, and they go, so what?
[02:20:18.329 --> 02:20:19.789]  I mean, it's just none of it holds water.
[02:20:28.916 --> 02:20:37.123]  All right, we're now into hour number four today of special four-hour transmission because it is the final radio show of 2011.
[02:20:37.123 --> 02:20:39.645]  Bob Chapman with us for a few more minutes.
[02:20:39.645 --> 02:20:52.456]  Funkmaster5 just called in a great activist who gets a lot done calling into kind of fake alternative media neocon shows who poses the alternative to the mind control media.
[02:20:53.553 --> 02:20:59.878]  The zombie control media that's losing so much power, but I was joking around with the guys, but it's not funny.
[02:20:59.878 --> 02:21:05.463]  You know, when I was a teenager, I had pinups of Heather Locklear in swimsuits hanging up in my room.
[02:21:05.463 --> 02:21:10.948]  But I guess in the new system now that the Pentagon with the NDAA, I never even mentioned this because it was so crazy, but it's in the news.
[02:21:11.548 --> 02:21:12.948]  I think when they try everything
[02:21:41.335 --> 02:21:51.403]  They go to whatever limits they can go as a human being, whether it's high or low, in this case it's low, and it's just astounding.
[02:21:53.286 --> 02:22:03.453]  It happens in other areas, not just in this one, where people want to become deeply involved in things that they never really would for the experience thereof.
[02:22:03.453 --> 02:22:04.553]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:22:04.553 --> 02:22:11.218]  So, in World War II, the troops shouldn't have had, you know, pin-up girls of, you know, beautiful women that's obviously attractive.
[02:22:11.218 --> 02:22:14.620]  They should have, like, a possum or something on the side.
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:15.180]  Probably.
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:19.143]  In fact, this weekend, what I'm going to do is re-create Animal Farm.
[02:22:21.882 --> 02:22:27.685]  I'll tell you one thing.
[02:22:27.685 --> 02:22:30.566]  Every program I'm on, I'm going to mention this.
[02:22:30.566 --> 02:22:32.527]  There's going to be a lot of people who know about it.
[02:22:33.487 --> 02:22:34.327]  It's insane.
[02:22:34.327 --> 02:22:40.771]  I mean, I pulled up the main articles and, again, no longer will it be Marilyn Monroe as looking attractive.
[02:22:40.771 --> 02:22:42.932]  They're going to teach us not to be extreme.
[02:22:42.932 --> 02:22:44.272]  Marilyn Monroe bad?
[02:22:44.272 --> 02:22:45.573]  Pig with lipstick on?
[02:22:45.573 --> 02:22:47.134]  That's the new chic.
[02:22:47.134 --> 02:22:48.354]  And see, I'm not trendy, folks.
[02:22:48.354 --> 02:22:50.836]  Just give me Marilyn Monroe all day.
[02:22:50.836 --> 02:22:52.596]  Ivan in New York, you're on the air.
[02:22:52.596 --> 02:22:53.057]  Go ahead.
[02:22:53.057 --> 02:22:53.377]  Welcome.
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:55.481]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:55.481 --> 02:22:56.081]  Hey, buddy.
[02:22:56.081 --> 02:22:58.523]  Pleasure.
[02:22:58.523 --> 02:23:03.186]  I'm from the Army branch up here in New York Armory.
[02:23:03.186 --> 02:23:08.930]  We were stationed in Huntington Station, and they were giving us a normal drill.
[02:23:08.930 --> 02:23:15.094]  We go in the 10 drill every month, and the drill was labeled urban warfare.
[02:23:15.094 --> 02:23:22.139]  Now, when we were clearing the buildings, they had this dummy that looked like it resembled a U.S.
[02:23:22.139 --> 02:23:23.640]  citizen, a normal urban citizen.
[02:23:24.392 --> 02:23:25.712]  Which I found kind of weird, you know?
[02:23:25.712 --> 02:23:29.194]  I asked, who and what are we training to kill, you know?
[02:23:29.194 --> 02:23:35.816]  And, uh, I questioned my sergeant, and I was actually kicked out of drill for questioning him.
[02:23:35.816 --> 02:23:38.397]  So, so, are you in regular army or National Guard?
[02:23:38.397 --> 02:23:40.057]  No, I'm in regular army.
[02:23:40.057 --> 02:23:43.699]  Oh, so you're in big army, and you've done a drill.
[02:23:43.699 --> 02:23:50.521]  I'm surprised the dummy didn't have a John Deere hat on, and, uh, or a hayseed outfit, because that's who they practice against.
[02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:53.602]  And so, uh, you guys are now doing urban warfare drills.
[02:23:54.266 --> 02:23:59.107]  Yeah, I mean, and not one straight, which I found kind of, you know, weird in general.
[02:23:59.107 --> 02:24:11.630]  And, uh, being the fact that most of us in armory are disagreeing with our sergeant and we're not going to drills anymore from the infantry division, 11 Bravo is my MOS, you know, I decided to cancel drills.
[02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:12.970]  I'm not attending at all anymore.
[02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:16.351]  You know, it's ridiculous that they're training us to attack the American civilians.
[02:24:16.431 --> 02:24:25.394]  Well, I'll tell you what, Bob's gotta go, and Gary Franchi's coming up, but I'd like to give you the floor when we come back for a couple minutes to tell the whole story, Ivan, so stay there.
[02:24:25.394 --> 02:24:32.717]  Bob, taking us out here, hopefully I'll see you back here next week, Lord willing, as we say every week, nothing's for sure, but briefly, what's your comment on what he just said?
[02:24:34.498 --> 02:24:36.078]  Uh, it's to be expected.
[02:24:36.078 --> 02:24:45.020]  Uh, it will continue and probably in a greater way, uh, now that they got the legislation where the president can have anybody picked up.
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:47.560]  And, uh, you're gonna see more and more of it.
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:25:01.303]  And, uh, all I can say to the, uh, our brothers in the military, and I'm a veteran, uh, is to listen to what they have to say and, uh, don't use what they're doing because it'll cost you your life.
[02:25:01.303 --> 02:25:02.883]  Alright, Bob, we'll talk to you next week.
[02:25:02.883 --> 02:25:03.263]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:25:04.204 --> 02:25:04.725]  Okay, bye-bye.
[02:25:24.639 --> 02:25:29.481]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:25:29.481 --> 02:25:31.062]  You want answers?
[02:25:31.062 --> 02:25:32.602]  Well, so does he.
[02:25:32.602 --> 02:25:36.784]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:36.784 --> 02:25:40.846]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:25:51.328 --> 02:25:53.570]  All right, the founder and head of Revolution PAC.
[02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:55.992]  He also heads up Restore the Republic, Gary Franch.
[02:25:55.992 --> 02:25:57.954]  He's going to be with us in a couple minutes.
[02:25:57.954 --> 02:26:01.296]  But, Ivan, we don't screen calls.
[02:26:01.296 --> 02:26:06.521]  But when you got something like this, please volunteer it to us so we can get to you earlier.
[02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:07.842]  Ivan is in New York.
[02:26:07.842 --> 02:26:08.662]  He's in the Army.
[02:26:09.443 --> 02:26:15.549]  And he's saying just recently they tried to have him do drills of basically taking on the American people, which is admitted.
[02:26:15.549 --> 02:26:16.530]  I've been to these drills.
[02:26:16.530 --> 02:26:17.691]  It's in the news.
[02:26:17.691 --> 02:26:19.553]  They admit they're quote training to pull triggers.
[02:26:19.553 --> 02:26:26.559]  The American people stars and stripes magazine that's in the brigade homeland starts its tour article.
[02:26:26.559 --> 02:26:27.400]  You just type that in.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:28.821]  You'll be able to pull it up.
[02:26:28.821 --> 02:26:29.021]  But.
[02:26:29.662 --> 02:26:39.611]  To have him questioned and be kicked out of drill, and now he's saying a bunch of his unit are saying no, and he's giving out names, I guess.
[02:26:39.611 --> 02:26:53.263]  Ivan, go ahead and give us, in a few minutes here, we appreciate you standing up for the Constitution, give us the full synopsis, recap it, where this was, when this happened, and how many people are refusing to go along with this.
[02:26:54.062 --> 02:26:59.226]  Well, our unit consists of about, I would say, 150 people.
[02:26:59.226 --> 02:27:04.250]  We were informed to go in and continue with the training, and I refused.
[02:27:04.250 --> 02:27:08.053]  I told my guys, you know, this is against the Constitution.
[02:27:08.053 --> 02:27:12.217]  Why would we even train to take firearms from civilians in general?
[02:27:12.217 --> 02:27:20.864]  And this is what I'm upset at, you know, and I regret joining the military for this, is that if we have a voice, we are told to shut up and follow commands.
[02:27:21.753 --> 02:27:28.635]  Now, most of my unit, I mean, is questioning everything, and then we decide not to attend drills in general, you know.
[02:27:28.635 --> 02:27:44.078]  We think that people should have the rights, the constitutional rights, and military can go to hell for, I don't know, I'm not going to listen to no command, no high command, and if they ever implement martial law and try to tell me to go out there and shoot civilians, I have one thing coming for them.
[02:27:44.078 --> 02:27:45.439]  You know?
[02:27:45.439 --> 02:27:48.559]  It's ridiculous, and I'm ashamed.
[02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:50.480]  I'm ashamed to be an American citizen at the moment.
[02:27:53.274 --> 02:27:56.175]  Wow, what else happened?
[02:27:56.175 --> 02:28:04.118]  Well, afterwards, I was escorted by MP, military police, and I was told to get out of the post.
[02:28:04.118 --> 02:28:05.798]  And I was like, alright, I'll leave.
[02:28:05.798 --> 02:28:07.439]  And I took my bag and I left.
[02:28:07.439 --> 02:28:11.320]  And I told my drill sergeant that I'm not going to attend drill anymore.
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:16.662]  Also, one of my friends came back from Fallujah, Baghdad, and he's sick.
[02:28:16.662 --> 02:28:18.003]  He's sick.
[02:28:18.003 --> 02:28:22.064]  He's losing his hair, you know, a lot of unknown things, and this guy's a health freak.
[02:28:24.116 --> 02:28:28.400]  So, I'm scared of my government right now at the moment, you know.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.143]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that this is happening.
[02:28:32.143 --> 02:28:38.928]  Can you send us an email with any of your other associates or people we can talk to, to maybe get some press on this?
[02:28:38.928 --> 02:28:40.609]  Because where is this going now?
[02:28:40.609 --> 02:28:42.791]  I mean, when were you kicked off the base?
[02:28:42.791 --> 02:28:46.174]  Well, I was kicked off, we went to a Huntington Station.
[02:28:47.191 --> 02:28:49.593]  And, uh, they have routine drills every month.
[02:28:49.593 --> 02:28:56.077]  Huntington, Fort Dix, uh, basically the eastern region has monthly drills.
[02:28:56.077 --> 02:28:59.760]  And we're now being trained to attack civilians.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.483]  And most of us are not complying with their orders.
[02:29:03.483 --> 02:29:09.647]  So, somebody who doesn't comply with their orders, a soldier that does not comply with their orders, will be kicked off the base.
[02:29:12.811 --> 02:29:16.914]  But you're kicked off the base, you're not court-martialed, you don't get in trouble?
[02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:17.514]  No.
[02:29:17.514 --> 02:29:19.535]  No, you're kicked off the base.
[02:29:19.535 --> 02:29:21.677]  In general, you're just kicked off the base.
[02:29:21.677 --> 02:29:28.281]  You know, I've seen a lot of that in the news, because they don't want to get reports of it going, so they basically make you go AWOL?
[02:29:28.281 --> 02:29:30.842]  Yeah, basically you can say that.
[02:29:30.842 --> 02:29:38.207]  I was also talking to most of my other guys in the unit, and we do hear you, and we do appreciate what you're doing at the moment, and we thank you for the truth.
[02:29:39.653 --> 02:29:40.373]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:29:40.373 --> 02:29:44.896]  Can you send us any information or your contact?
[02:29:44.896 --> 02:29:50.080]  Just send it to the showtips at infowars.com.
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:30:00.287]  And I would like to talk to you and other members of your unit and perhaps get a report out on this because, I mean, are they specifically training you?
[02:30:00.287 --> 02:30:03.369]  I mean, how do you know this is for domestic operations?
[02:30:04.702 --> 02:30:14.186]  Well, the dummies, we were breaching a building, and we're told to clear the building, and it's a routine training drill.
[02:30:14.186 --> 02:30:19.388]  And the dummies were dressed like regular civilians, with regular jeans, clothes, you know.
[02:30:19.388 --> 02:30:22.809]  One of them had a bandana, an American bandana on the head.
[02:30:22.809 --> 02:30:25.310]  I was like, what the hell is going on here?
[02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:28.151]  And to the right, I looked at the guys, and I said, are you serious?
[02:30:28.151 --> 02:30:30.932]  Are we going to go through with this crap, or are we going to just say no more?
[02:30:32.463 --> 02:30:33.964]  All right, incredible information.
[02:30:33.964 --> 02:30:35.045]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:30:35.045 --> 02:30:37.627]  I appreciate Ivan calling into the show.
[02:30:37.627 --> 02:30:39.028]  And stay in contact with us.
[02:30:39.028 --> 02:30:40.529]  Send us an email with more information.
[02:30:40.529 --> 02:30:41.650]  Thank you.
[02:30:41.650 --> 02:30:44.332]  That is really frightening information.
[02:30:44.332 --> 02:30:47.535]  But I can pull up right now, New York Times.
[02:30:47.535 --> 02:30:52.338]  Explorer scouts trained to take on terrorists and more.
[02:30:52.338 --> 02:30:53.920]  From three years ago.
[02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:56.061]  And it's got a whole bunch of photos in it.
[02:30:56.061 --> 02:31:00.465]  And the first line says, they're trained to take on disgruntled vets and kill them.
[02:31:01.949 --> 02:31:05.992]  And it shows them practicing to kill good old boys, basically.
[02:31:05.992 --> 02:31:11.256]  And then I've got the training manuals where it says the number one enemy of America is veterans.
[02:31:11.256 --> 02:31:13.898]  We're the folks that broke that.
[02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:15.659]  Everybody knows about it.
[02:31:15.659 --> 02:31:19.082]  You can just type in Homeland Security documents, says veterans number one threat.
[02:31:20.032 --> 02:31:21.193]  It's not Al-Qaeda.
[02:31:21.193 --> 02:31:26.196]  I saw a report where Delta Airlines and there were some guys in their Muslim garb.
[02:31:26.196 --> 02:31:27.697]  Number one, they were real Muslim terrorists.
[02:31:27.697 --> 02:31:29.699]  They're gonna be dressed in blue jeans, folks.
[02:31:29.699 --> 02:31:36.383]  And people got so scared of them because they were men wearing, you know, Middle Eastern outfits that they freaked out and the pilot wouldn't fly.
[02:31:36.383 --> 02:31:39.245]  Everyone was rolling around in convulsions of fear.
[02:31:39.245 --> 02:31:41.627]  This is so ridiculous.
[02:31:41.627 --> 02:31:44.008]  You should be afraid of the big corrupt government.
[02:31:44.008 --> 02:31:45.269]  Afraid of doing nothing.
[02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:49.492]  Now, shifting gears for the balance of the next 20 minutes is Gary Franchi.
[02:31:51.193 --> 02:32:09.426]  Heads up Revolution Pack and he's always doing new great work in the fight for Ron Paul and I just want to know in the case of James Williams who's in the piece from South Texas on the coast where Ron Paul was a physician for many years, how on earth did you guys find James Williams?
[02:32:09.426 --> 02:32:15.891]  Because this has certainly got the media covering it and pretty upset because it humanizes Ron Paul.
[02:32:17.412 --> 02:32:18.793]  Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:32:18.793 --> 02:32:24.176]  Yeah, James Williams, he's like a needle in a haystack.
[02:32:24.176 --> 02:32:33.461]  Alex, Ron Paul has delivered over 4,000 babies in his medical career, so you know there's plenty of stories more just like this.
[02:32:34.421 --> 02:32:53.858]  And because the Revolution PAC has people who used to work in the 2008 campaign, people who have always been very close to Ron Paul, they have an institutional knowledge of past campaign tactics, as well as the people that have been close to Ron.
[02:32:53.858 --> 02:32:56.480]  And through our sources within the PAC,
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:06.487]  We found James and he said he would come through and perform the interview for us and help us get his story out.
[02:33:06.487 --> 02:33:08.989]  Wow, and you sure got some good producers.
[02:33:08.989 --> 02:33:12.551]  All these ads look like, you know, million-dollar ads you're producing.
[02:33:12.551 --> 02:33:14.693]  Just an amazing job, Gary.
[02:33:14.693 --> 02:33:16.014]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:33:16.014 --> 02:33:24.680]  That ad was shot last Monday in Jamestown in the Congressional District of Ron Paul.
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:25.721]  Our crew flew out
[02:33:26.221 --> 02:33:28.103]  Uh, you know, they flew out to Houston.
[02:33:28.103 --> 02:33:31.225]  They shot the ad on, they flew out Sunday, shot the ad on Monday.
[02:33:31.225 --> 02:33:39.471]  Uh, we got two more videos that are going to be coming out in this Who is Ron Paul series that talk about Ron Paul the man.
[02:33:39.471 --> 02:33:44.155]  Um, and of course this one with James Williams talks about the compassion of Ron Paul.
[02:33:44.155 --> 02:33:55.764]  So, uh, that video was shot Monday and, uh, our, our producing team put the video together through the holiday weekend, uh, because we knew that this message needed to be heard and, uh, we, we,
[02:33:56.064 --> 02:33:57.405]  We fine-tuned it.
[02:33:57.405 --> 02:34:09.416]  In the past couple days we released it and now it has over 250,000 views and it's really stifling a lot of the arguments that the media is trying to pin on Ron Paul.
[02:34:09.416 --> 02:34:12.359]  Of course, you know, we see the claims that he's some sort of a racist and a bigot.
[02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:17.481]  And let's just be clear, this video is not specifically designed to address that.
[02:34:17.481 --> 02:34:22.504]  It's one video in a series that addresses the Ron Paul the man.
[02:34:22.504 --> 02:34:28.826]  But we're already getting reports from people on the ground who, they're talking to individuals.
[02:34:28.826 --> 02:34:31.907]  They're trying to convert people to Ron Paul and they say, oh well Ron Paul's a racist.
[02:34:31.907 --> 02:34:32.948]  Ron Paul's a racist.
[02:34:32.948 --> 02:34:38.290]  Well then they go ahead, they pull this video up on their laptop or their iPhone and they say, take a second and watch this video.
[02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:39.110]  It was uh...
[02:35:01.917 --> 02:35:10.481]  Between 1972 and 73, but it was still a lot of prejudice around this area.
[02:35:10.481 --> 02:35:15.403]  My wife was sick and I was trying to get some attention for her.
[02:35:15.403 --> 02:35:17.124]  Nobody came to check.
[02:35:17.124 --> 02:35:19.365]  They just left her there.
[02:35:19.365 --> 02:35:25.728]  Well, I believe I was left there because of the difference of me being black and her being white.
[02:35:27.029 --> 02:35:32.894]  Every time I would say something to her, he'd notice that she would get pretty upset.
[02:35:32.894 --> 02:35:38.258]  And then she finally called the, uh, Freeport Police Department.
[02:35:38.258 --> 02:35:40.920]  Said I was harassing her.
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:43.422]  And, I mean, I didn't know anything to do.
[02:35:43.422 --> 02:35:46.965]  Well, then Ron Paul come to my rescue.
[02:35:46.965 --> 02:35:51.609]  He just stepped in and went to work with my wife.
[02:35:51.609 --> 02:35:54.291]  And after he seen her, uh,
[02:35:55.342 --> 02:36:23.412]  I say no more than 10 minutes later she had a stillborn boy child and he said as far as the bill he would take care of everything which he did I never got a bill from the hospital or anything and he was a doctor of medicine and that's what he was doing was practicing medicine and it didn't matter who and what and why he was doing it because he think of one human being just as much as another
[02:36:24.511 --> 02:36:27.873]  He's just a honest man.
[02:36:27.873 --> 02:36:32.316]  And that's something we need now in this day and time.
[02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:36.039]  It's a lot of politics and no honesty.
[02:36:36.039 --> 02:36:43.384]  When you have honesty, well, people will try to do anything to blot you out.
[02:36:43.384 --> 02:36:50.629]  And that's what they will try to do to him is blot him out because he will be honest.
[02:36:50.629 --> 02:36:51.850]  And they need more like him.
[02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:55.244]  Alright, we're going to be back with Gary Franchi.
[02:36:55.244 --> 02:37:01.388]  There's another video where Ron Paul this morning on Talk Radio responded to the ad and he had some tears in his eyes.
[02:37:01.388 --> 02:37:03.829]  We'll talk to Gary Franchi on the other side of Revolution Pack.
[02:37:03.829 --> 02:37:07.051]  We'll give you that website if you want to get involved in supporting this.
[02:37:07.051 --> 02:37:10.192]  I tell you, Gary is really doing impressive work.
[02:37:10.192 --> 02:37:14.275]  And we can do exactly what the globalists do, but we use the truth, not lies.
[02:37:14.275 --> 02:37:16.696]  We can kick their you-know-whats.
[02:37:16.696 --> 02:37:18.357]  If we just stand up and give them a fight.
[02:37:21.225 --> 02:37:22.466]  Wow.
[02:37:22.466 --> 02:37:25.509]  That's a long time ago.
[02:37:25.509 --> 02:37:27.991]  I just saw this a little while ago.
[02:37:27.991 --> 02:37:29.412]  It wasn't put out by our campaign.
[02:37:29.412 --> 02:37:34.217]  It was put out by the super PAC type stuff that are separated from the campaign.
[02:37:34.217 --> 02:37:35.738]  I'm amazed at how they found that.
[02:37:35.738 --> 02:37:40.103]  If you would have asked me to go back and find somebody like that, I wouldn't know.
[02:37:40.903 --> 02:37:49.573]  To me, I don't remember it, I don't recall it, because it was one of, you know, just the way we practice medicine, you know, and the way at least I practice medicine.
[02:37:49.573 --> 02:37:51.455]  I would say it was incredibly important to that guy.
[02:37:51.455 --> 02:37:57.401]  It was a non-event in the sense that that is what I thought my responsibilities were.
[02:38:01.562 --> 02:38:02.762]  And then Paul continues.
[02:38:02.762 --> 02:38:06.323]  The video is up at Infowars.com.
[02:38:06.323 --> 02:38:10.684]  Talking about, you know, sometimes he wonders, why did I ever sign on to this to be attacked?
[02:38:10.684 --> 02:38:12.784]  But then he realizes that the truth will out.
[02:38:12.784 --> 02:38:14.804]  The truth will always come out.
[02:38:14.804 --> 02:38:16.985]  Perhaps we'll play that when we come back to the next segment.
[02:38:16.985 --> 02:38:18.365]  Gary, I got you on late today.
[02:38:18.365 --> 02:38:19.765]  I got to get you back on next week.
[02:38:19.765 --> 02:38:24.426]  But super job with what you're doing.
[02:38:24.426 --> 02:38:26.746]  And I can't wait.
[02:38:26.746 --> 02:38:30.687]  I mean, give us an idea of some of the other surprises coming out the next videos.
[02:38:31.789 --> 02:38:39.134]  Well, you know, when you go down to Congressman Paul's congressional district, there are so many people that have been touched by Paul.
[02:38:39.134 --> 02:38:44.437]  And we've spoken to people that have worked very closely with him in the medical field.
[02:38:44.437 --> 02:38:46.399]  We spoke to veterans.
[02:38:46.399 --> 02:38:54.584]  And we've just got some compelling human interest stories that the American people are really going to relate to when they see these videos.
[02:39:01.849 --> 02:39:02.989]  I don't think so.
[02:39:18.567 --> 02:39:21.550]  Well, you know, you might just see something like that coming out pretty soon.
[02:39:21.550 --> 02:39:27.877]  And the thing is, is that Ron Paul doesn't brag about himself, but the Revolution PAC will brag about Ron Paul.
[02:39:27.877 --> 02:39:33.523]  He's a great man, and we want to see him in the White House, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that that happens, Alex.
[02:39:34.304 --> 02:39:39.066]  And Gary, folks can give unlimited to these revolution packs.
[02:39:39.066 --> 02:39:42.027]  I mean, you've got a great name for the pack.
[02:39:42.027 --> 02:39:47.808]  And so if people go donate, you'll be able to run this two minute commercial on television to counter these people.
[02:39:47.808 --> 02:39:58.532]  And I mean, even if you only get one one hundredth of the donations, the big mega banks get people like Mittens Romney or scum like Newtard Gingrich.
[02:39:58.532 --> 02:40:01.493]  A grain of truth shatters a mountain of lies.
[02:40:02.353 --> 02:40:08.617]  Well, Alex, when we release the video, we've already received close to $40,000 in donations to support it.
[02:40:08.617 --> 02:40:10.518]  And people can go to revolutionpack.com.
[02:40:10.518 --> 02:40:15.201]  There's a ticker that they can keep track of the support that we're getting.
[02:40:15.201 --> 02:40:16.681]  And it's overwhelming, Alex.
[02:40:16.681 --> 02:40:17.542]  It's overwhelming.
[02:40:17.542 --> 02:40:18.963]  And that's true.
[02:40:18.963 --> 02:40:20.243]  Unlimited donations.
[02:40:20.243 --> 02:40:30.129]  So we can accept $10,000, $50,000, even a million dollars to air a 60-second version of what you're seeing in the two-minute version.
[02:40:30.129 --> 02:40:30.309]  Yeah.
[02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:32.350]  Incredible.
[02:40:32.350 --> 02:40:50.276]  So when do we see the next ads coming out because he needs all the help he can get now and obviously it's being seen millions of times online going going super viral and it's important for people whether it's your videos or our videos or other other real media countering the the Decepticon media.
[02:40:50.276 --> 02:40:53.437]  It is so important that people pass these videos on to others.
[02:40:55.618 --> 02:40:58.059]  Again, when are we going to see the next videos come out?
[02:40:58.059 --> 02:40:59.440]  I talked to my producer today.
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:02.541]  We've been just reeling with the responses.
[02:41:02.541 --> 02:41:03.581]  Reuters just called.
[02:41:03.581 --> 02:41:05.862]  They want to talk to James Williams.
[02:41:05.862 --> 02:41:08.103]  The media has been communicating with us.
[02:41:08.103 --> 02:41:11.645]  The supporters out there are sending us emails.
[02:41:11.645 --> 02:41:13.326]  You know why they want to talk to James Williams.
[02:41:13.326 --> 02:41:16.367]  They want to somehow twist it and attack it or something.
[02:41:16.963 --> 02:41:20.908]  Yeah, and we're being very sensitive on how we distribute James' content.
[02:41:20.908 --> 02:41:23.191]  Well, James seems like a pretty smart guy.
[02:41:23.191 --> 02:41:26.836]  He might not want to talk to the... By the way, I want to get James on this show.
[02:41:26.836 --> 02:41:27.637]  How do we do that, Gary?
[02:41:27.637 --> 02:41:29.619]  I meant to ask you that off-air.
[02:41:29.619 --> 02:41:33.745]  Have your producer email me and we'll get that connected for you.
[02:41:34.045 --> 02:41:35.866]  Yeah, well, let's just get him on Sunday or Monday.
[02:41:35.866 --> 02:41:39.648]  Let's just, or let's do an interview today on the nightly news.
[02:41:39.648 --> 02:41:46.272]  I mean, I think it's important before they go, because they'll go interview him for two hours and cut it together to make him look bad.
[02:41:46.272 --> 02:41:47.513]  I mean, these are wicked devils.
[02:41:47.513 --> 02:41:48.754]  We know that.
[02:41:48.754 --> 02:41:49.354]  Absolutely.
[02:41:49.354 --> 02:41:51.355]  And, yeah, just have Jaron shoot me an email.
[02:41:51.355 --> 02:41:55.578]  We'll make sure that connection takes place and see if we can establish that interview for you.
[02:41:56.175 --> 02:41:56.875]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:41:56.875 --> 02:42:12.682]  Only because, or you guys need to do an extended one right now, because you know that extended one, the first extended one to go out there is going to go viral, versus letting them get the first extended interview, edit it, butcher it, and then try to misrepresent.
[02:42:12.682 --> 02:42:14.783]  Because, I mean, again, we're dealing with criminals here.
[02:42:14.783 --> 02:42:21.426]  Well, look what they did to Ron Paul in that CNN clip, where they claim that he stormed off the interview.
[02:42:21.426 --> 02:42:23.787]  When you watch the uncut version, he clearly didn't.
[02:42:24.187 --> 02:42:26.948]  Well, she also goes back on CNN and says, well, you saw it.
[02:42:26.948 --> 02:42:28.468]  He never answered the question.
[02:42:28.468 --> 02:42:29.209]  They edited it.
[02:42:29.209 --> 02:42:31.429]  He answers it three times.
[02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:33.030]  And then says, OK, I got to go.
[02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.270]  Thanks.
[02:42:33.270 --> 02:42:34.690]  That's the 10 minutes.
[02:42:34.690 --> 02:42:39.011]  And then they cut it before that and then never show him answer the question.
[02:42:39.011 --> 02:42:41.512]  CNN thinks their viewers are idiots.
[02:42:41.512 --> 02:42:42.332]  They hate you.
[02:42:42.332 --> 02:42:43.433]  They disrespect you.
[02:42:43.433 --> 02:42:44.793]  They think you're a joke.
[02:42:44.793 --> 02:42:46.054]  They love manipulating you.
[02:42:46.054 --> 02:42:47.374]  They count on you being ignorant.
[02:42:49.093 --> 02:42:51.294]  All right, Gary, let me come out there and talk to you during the break.
[02:42:51.294 --> 02:42:59.417]  We got Max Keiser coming up, but yeah, in fact, I meant to try to work with you today to get him on while we did this show today, but there's no time like the present.
[02:42:59.417 --> 02:43:04.159]  We might need to go ahead and just get his phone number right now and do this on the nightly news this evening.
[02:43:04.159 --> 02:43:05.380]  We'll be right, hell, I'm in Texas.
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:06.700]  I could go down there.
[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:07.261]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:07.261 --> 02:43:07.621]  Stay with us.
[02:43:24.673 --> 02:43:27.940]  Some folks are born, that's the way to fly.
[02:43:36.498 --> 02:43:45.547]  You know, I haven't done the standard 10 top stories of the year, but we like to do the 10 stories we think are really the most important to give our perspective on the nightly news this evening.
[02:43:45.547 --> 02:43:49.891]  I will be doing that 7 o'clock central.
[02:43:49.891 --> 02:43:59.000]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, we do have a 15-day free trial running right now, and when you do become a member, it supports the broadcast, the crew.
[02:44:00.563 --> 02:44:07.387]  We are about to put the ads out there to hire some more reporters, some more editors.
[02:44:07.387 --> 02:44:11.669]  If I could find somebody, I'd like to find somebody to host the Nightly News a few times a week.
[02:44:11.669 --> 02:44:13.871]  We have Aaron, we have Paul Watson, we have Dew doing it.
[02:44:13.871 --> 02:44:14.631]  They do a great job.
[02:44:14.631 --> 02:44:18.493]  But I'd like to expand it and have more than one show.
[02:44:18.493 --> 02:44:24.417]  And we've already are getting the equipment, thanks to your support, to do the uploading and the satellite uplink stuff.
[02:44:24.417 --> 02:44:26.798]  But then I've got to discipline the show down to an hour.
[02:44:26.798 --> 02:44:29.340]  We're going to do a 30-minute show, but it looks like it's going to be an hour every day.
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:40.167]  Uh, and so we beta tested all that, uh, for delivery to different satellite systems and, and, uh, for some people still living in the matrix to get their news from mainline satellite or cable.
[02:44:40.167 --> 02:44:41.728]  Uh, so we're definitely expanding.
[02:44:41.728 --> 02:44:45.991]  Uh, when the Austin police chief was here, he hadn't been here in about a year and a half.
[02:44:45.991 --> 02:44:51.855]  He saw we've expanded over to the other side to about, uh, 15,000, almost 16,000 square feet.
[02:44:51.855 --> 02:44:54.256]  And he's like, man, it looks like you're getting ready to launch an offensive.
[02:44:54.256 --> 02:44:57.418]  And I said, you're absolutely right to defend the Republic.
[02:44:57.418 --> 02:44:59.620]  And we're just one little operation here.
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:02.502]  I mean, you saw what Gary Franchi's doing.
[02:45:02.502 --> 02:45:11.208]  I mean, I remember meeting him in 2006 in Chicago, and he was just getting involved at a 9-11 Truth Conference.
[02:45:11.208 --> 02:45:21.334]  He had no website, no organization, no nothing, and now he reaches millions of people a week with his weekly TV show and Restore the Republic and all that.
[02:45:21.334 --> 02:45:26.378]  Again, he was a loss prevention guy at a shopping mall.
[02:45:27.947 --> 02:45:37.132]  Just like I was a guy going to community college and didn't like the New World Order and being taught anti-American garbage.
[02:45:37.132 --> 02:45:44.736]  And I went over to UT to sit in on classes to see if I wanted to pay to go there, because I was an A student and could easily get in there.
[02:45:46.573 --> 02:45:50.777]  It was just all baloney, because I've read so many history books on my own.
[02:45:50.777 --> 02:45:52.239]  I've studied so much on my own.
[02:45:52.239 --> 02:45:55.682]  I wasn't that informed then, but compared to the general public, extremely informed.
[02:45:55.682 --> 02:45:57.484]  That's what's scary about it.
[02:45:57.484 --> 02:46:00.867]  I said, I'm just going to go to an Axis TV show and start my own media operation.
[02:46:00.867 --> 02:46:01.748]  Boom!
[02:46:01.748 --> 02:46:03.369]  17 years later, here we are.
[02:46:03.369 --> 02:46:06.552]  It shows the power of the individual.
[02:46:06.552 --> 02:46:08.634]  There are people out there listening right now.
[02:46:09.662 --> 02:46:18.229]  That if you decided to take action and dedicate yourself to reaching people, you could dwarf what I've done in the next five years.
[02:46:18.229 --> 02:46:22.473]  But you've got to start the journey of a thousand miles with a single step.
[02:46:23.982 --> 02:46:31.184]  None of us are perfect, none of us have all the answers, but you've got to take action and you've got to keep doing it over and over again.
[02:46:31.184 --> 02:46:41.547]  And if you have talent and hard work, and everybody's got talent in one way or another, we all have our own gifts, and you keep doing it for the right reasons, build it and they will come.
[02:46:41.547 --> 02:46:43.648]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:46:43.648 --> 02:46:46.189]  And so I want to encourage everybody
[02:46:47.031 --> 02:47:09.359]  To start a newsletter, to make documentaries, to... I mean, now, the technology, and we're going to Max Keiser, that I had in 1995, three quarter inch tape decks, a hundred dollar used VHS camera, out there doing my own interviews on the street, out there exposing corruption, out there defending the Second Amendment.
[02:47:09.359 --> 02:47:16.122]  If I was starting now, with all the technology, and the computers, and the cheapness of it all, what we could do?
[02:47:18.268 --> 02:47:19.449]  Think of what you can do.
[02:47:19.449 --> 02:47:25.252]  We need good people to just tackle your own little area of corruption.
[02:47:25.252 --> 02:47:27.693]  Just get in its face.
[02:47:27.693 --> 02:47:33.856]  Many times just getting in its face will make it go so wild it'll blow itself up.
[02:47:33.856 --> 02:47:38.219]  Evil is easy to defeat if you'll just get in the ring with it.
[02:47:38.219 --> 02:47:42.341]  Now, it might mean you are destroyed.
[02:47:42.341 --> 02:47:43.582]  That happens sometimes.
[02:47:43.582 --> 02:47:45.603]  Not very often, but let's just say the worst happens.
[02:47:46.528 --> 02:48:00.847]  In your defeat always brings massive defeat to the enemy on the next round by others that see that example just laws of the universe the bigger the sacrifice the bigger the result you're gonna have and
[02:48:02.321 --> 02:48:04.163]  I'm not saying that's going to happen to you.
[02:48:04.163 --> 02:48:09.388]  Chances are nothing's going to happen to you, or good things are going to happen to you.
[02:48:09.388 --> 02:48:13.972]  But you've got to be willing to get past the fear and take action.
[02:48:13.972 --> 02:48:20.798]  Now, we're going to end this year's radio with Max Keiser, who lives over in Paris, an American broadcaster, filmmaker.
[02:48:20.798 --> 02:48:24.762]  He's got shows on RT, Press TV, BBC, Syndicated Radio.
[02:48:25.828 --> 02:48:46.400]  MaxKaiser.com is his website, and he was, of course, before he retired, a successful stockbroker and inventor of virtual trading systems used on many stock markets today, and he joins us with some breaking news and analysis here at year-end as we take the plunge and cry havoc and enter the vaunted 2012.
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:47.941]  Max Kaiser, good to have you here with us.
[02:48:48.661 --> 02:48:51.084]  Hey Alex, it's great to be with you.
[02:48:51.084 --> 02:48:53.306]  I'm actually in Barcelona, Spain.
[02:48:53.306 --> 02:48:54.247]  I'm sorry, that's right.
[02:48:54.247 --> 02:48:56.750]  You told us that five times and of course I got it wrong.
[02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:59.113]  You're in Barcelona, Spain today.
[02:48:59.113 --> 02:49:00.154]  Yeah, very sunny.
[02:49:00.154 --> 02:49:03.658]  So Stacy and I came down here for a few days to catch some sun.
[02:49:03.658 --> 02:49:05.620]  Very hard day's work for you.
[02:49:05.620 --> 02:49:09.765]  Now, continuing sir with your analysis, what do you make of what's going on in the world?
[02:49:11.115 --> 02:49:18.983]  Well, a couple of trends that I wanted to bring to your attention we've been talking about on your show for a couple of years that are now coming to fruition.
[02:49:18.983 --> 02:49:26.311]  One is that starting in January of next year, in Chicago, there's a new exchange that's been approved called NADEX.
[02:49:26.311 --> 02:49:28.213]  N-A-D-E-X.
[02:49:28.213 --> 02:49:30.015]  Markets, Trade and Political Predictions.
[02:49:30.015 --> 02:49:31.196]  You've said this forever.
[02:49:31.196 --> 02:49:32.558]  Here it is from USA Today.
[02:49:33.524 --> 02:49:39.929]  Yeah, so people are going to start to trade politicians as securities.
[02:49:39.929 --> 02:49:43.872]  And the reason this is important is because, of course, all securities markets are manipulated.
[02:49:43.872 --> 02:49:53.100]  For example, the in-trade market in Dublin has Mitt Romney with a 75% probability of winning the Republican nomination.
[02:49:53.100 --> 02:50:00.906]  And that creates a fake feedback loop, obviously, and allows them to game it and pump value into it, which is basically another fraud.
[02:50:01.847 --> 02:50:02.708]  Exactly right.
[02:50:02.708 --> 02:50:13.259]  And now this is going to become a much bigger market because this new CFTC regulated Nadex in Chicago will be a multi-hundred billion dollar market.
[02:50:13.259 --> 02:50:15.642]  We already know that is fraud.
[02:50:15.642 --> 02:50:22.049]  Back in the 2008 campaign, John McCain was manipulating the in-trade contract in Dublin in his favor.
[02:50:22.409 --> 02:50:27.231]  Then they'll say, we've got to have Mitt Romney or whoever be elected because hundreds of billions are invested.
[02:50:27.231 --> 02:50:28.732]  It's too big to fail.
[02:50:28.732 --> 02:50:35.194]  So now everybody's got a domino effect or snowball pile on to whoever the scammers say.
[02:50:35.194 --> 02:50:38.996]  That's like 10 years ago when they said they were going to trade on terror attacks.
[02:50:38.996 --> 02:50:40.917]  Well, of course, then they get to stage them themselves.
[02:50:42.045 --> 02:50:42.946]  Well, that's another point.
[02:50:42.946 --> 02:50:56.965]  The terror attacks was the policy analysis market that John Poindexter at the Pentagon was trying to put in place based on my technology, the virtual specialist technology, but they had such an outcry against it that they banned it.
[02:50:57.506 --> 02:51:17.355]  Now, flash forward a couple of years, and Cantor Fitzgerald, who bought my technology, they tried to launch Cantor Exchange to trade box office futures, but the Motion Picture Association of America got the Congress to ban the concept of box office futures exchange because they had a lot of emails
[02:51:17.935 --> 02:51:26.742]  From people who were threatening to injure or to kill talent that was trading on the box office futures exchange.
[02:51:26.742 --> 02:51:32.287]  And so the MPAA to defend their constituency of stars in Hollywood got caught.
[02:51:32.287 --> 02:51:32.867]  That's right.
[02:51:32.867 --> 02:51:36.230]  One mafia figured out the bigger mafia was going to use this to take them over.
[02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:41.972]  Right, but what's funny is that there's no such protection for American politicians.
[02:51:41.972 --> 02:51:45.194]  So the assassination risk is quite high.
[02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:52.437]  People who are short politicians will want to, you know, do injury to them to make money on this new Nadex market.
[02:51:52.437 --> 02:51:57.700]  But it was considered not much of a problem as a Hollywood star being injured.
[02:51:57.700 --> 02:52:00.221]  So it shows you where America's values are.
[02:52:00.221 --> 02:52:04.563]  You know, Gwyneth Paltrow deserves more protection than the President of the United States, clearly.
[02:52:04.983 --> 02:52:09.408]  Or our own troops, our own troops breathing DU, because they're the real enemy.
[02:52:09.408 --> 02:52:19.020]  They want them to go kill people, but then they know the troops in the actuaries are going to wake up and be a threat to the tyrants, and so they're glad that they're using DU as a soft kill weapon that'll get rid of them later.
[02:52:20.406 --> 02:52:24.168]  Yeah, so this will put a price on all the politicians' heads.
[02:52:24.168 --> 02:52:27.829]  And so this is what's going to start up in January, people.
[02:52:27.829 --> 02:52:41.874]  And we come to the next election cycle because it'll be obvious that there's massive fraud in terms of the misuse of these new securities markets brought to you by the same people who are not regulated or anything going on.
[02:52:41.874 --> 02:52:47.736]  And this is pure betting, just like who's going to win, the Redskins or the Cowboys, the 49ers or the Steelers.
[02:52:47.736 --> 02:52:49.957]  I mean, this is just pure gambling.
[02:52:51.098 --> 02:52:54.980]  Well, gambling plus derivative markets, so you'll be able to leverage your bet.
[02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:59.543]  You know, if you put on a million dollar bet, you can leverage that to ten million or a hundred million dollars.
[02:52:59.543 --> 02:53:03.926]  And then they run the government so it's too big to fail, so it's gambling with our money and our future.
[02:53:05.014 --> 02:53:17.590]  Yeah, and then when the next election is determined that it was completely fraudulent, they'll say we can't investigate because it'll be a systemic risk to the banking system because these Wall Street banks have hundreds of billions of dollars tied into political futures derivatives.
[02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:22.717]  The derivatives fraud paradigm is invading reality and waging war against it.
[02:53:23.618 --> 02:53:34.825]  Right, and it's now in the very machinations of the voting and political system, the democratic systems of America, have been securitized, financialized, and turned into derivatives.
[02:53:34.825 --> 02:53:36.906]  And this is all starting up in January.
[02:53:36.906 --> 02:53:50.615]  It's a huge multi-billion dollar trading platform in Chicago, regulated, or I should say not regulated, by the CFTC and the CME, the same people who completely missed the MF Global scandal and all the other scandals that came before it.
[02:53:51.175 --> 02:53:55.259]  And this is really combining the two worst elements of American society.
[02:53:55.259 --> 02:53:58.101]  Graft in Washington and fraud on Wall Street.
[02:53:58.101 --> 02:54:03.867]  By the way, when you say missed it, most of the regulators just now come out, actually got money in the pocket from MF Global.
[02:54:03.867 --> 02:54:08.571]  I mean, they missed it, you know, like somebody walking up and punching you in the nose missed it.
[02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:10.393]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:54:10.393 --> 02:54:12.555]  It's just they're getting so bold now, Max.
[02:54:13.928 --> 02:54:14.529]  Right.
[02:54:14.529 --> 02:54:16.650]  They're totally conflicted.
[02:54:16.650 --> 02:54:17.971]  Absolutely correct.
[02:54:17.971 --> 02:54:31.122]  They're pocketing... Because inside information, as we've recently discovered, or has been talked about, in Washington is actually legal for Congress to trade on material inside information in the stock market.
[02:54:31.122 --> 02:54:33.825]  Now they'll be able to trade on information about themselves.
[02:54:33.825 --> 02:54:39.950]  So Rick Perry could start a rumor that he's suddenly turned homosexual.
[02:54:40.510 --> 02:54:49.156]  And short himself on the exchange and make money on his own false rumor, and then use that proceeds to finance his election campaign.
[02:54:49.156 --> 02:54:59.344]  As long as there's idiots that'll invest in it, but they don't care because they tell you you're investing in a regular pension, but really it's being leveraged and sold into derivatives.
[02:54:59.344 --> 02:55:01.526]  They've collectively gone insane, Max.
[02:55:01.526 --> 02:55:03.127]  I think this has got to implode sometime.
[02:55:04.434 --> 02:55:15.916]  Well, they're finding new ways to get deeper into the daily lives of the average American who is now going to be confronted with a decision to make when they go to the polling station.
[02:55:15.916 --> 02:55:25.678]  Do they vote their pocketbook, as they've been speculating for the past 12 months in the derivatives political futures markets, or do they vote their conscience?
[02:55:25.678 --> 02:55:29.039]  And what we've discovered is that more and more people, because they're so far in debt
[02:55:29.699 --> 02:55:39.596]  Of course they're going to vote their pocketbook as a way to get out of debt, and this is yet another way to separate America from its identity as something relating to the Constitution.
[02:55:39.596 --> 02:55:41.419]  And again, it's all done through fractional...
[02:55:42.671 --> 02:55:54.114]  Or fiat money changing, and so the system can create just all this fake garbage, but then get people tied to it so they'll sell out their own mother because their entire future is tied to the fraud.
[02:55:54.114 --> 02:55:56.655]  You gotta admit it's a genius plan, Max.
[02:55:56.655 --> 02:55:57.575]  Well, I invented it.
[02:55:57.575 --> 02:55:58.636]  Of course it's ingenious.
[02:55:58.636 --> 02:56:03.117]  It's all based on my technology, the virtual specialist technology, patent number 5950176, filed and patented in 1996.
[02:56:06.998 --> 02:56:16.081]  And of course now my other company, the Hollywood Stock Exchange, is going public for a hundred million dollars in the next few weeks.
[02:56:16.081 --> 02:56:18.542]  So it'll give you an idea of what the technology is worth.
[02:56:18.542 --> 02:56:20.802]  They're now based in Las Vegas.
[02:56:20.802 --> 02:56:28.565]  So they're going to start trading a whole betting scam based on a pure betting, Vegas style.
[02:56:29.285 --> 02:56:34.166]  Uh, on that technology and that's going to be going forward and now in the next few weeks as well.
[02:56:34.166 --> 02:56:51.330]  So the, the, the, the casino gulag model that I've been talking about for a couple years is coming into fruition on the political front, the entertainment front, the gambling front, because Obama has let it be known that he now favors passage of a bill that will allow online gambling.
[02:56:51.750 --> 02:57:07.631]  That's the big one as far as I can see it because this will mean that all these people glued to their iPhones and iPads and online Farmville simulated gaming platforms will be gambling now with real money and this will be the only job left in America.
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:17.950]  And they don't tell you now when your kids download some video games and there's some extra creds you gotta pay that that's gambling and your child is being taught by the global mafia how to gamble.
[02:57:17.950 --> 02:57:19.351]  They don't tell you that.
[02:57:19.351 --> 02:57:20.673]  It's totally trendy.
[02:57:20.673 --> 02:57:22.034]  It's so cool.
[02:57:22.034 --> 02:57:26.458]  Well, not only that, but how are most students in the UK paying off their student debts?
[02:57:26.458 --> 02:57:27.700]  They're going into prostitution.
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:31.842]  Yeah, I saw that in the BBC, and the media's like, this is good!
[02:57:31.842 --> 02:57:38.044]  Little Jenny's 21, and she turns six or seven tricks a night, and it's wonderful.
[02:57:38.044 --> 02:57:40.045]  Gambling, prostitution, and drugs.
[02:57:40.045 --> 02:57:47.208]  Well, mostly it's legal drugs, because all the latest generation of mood-altering, happy pills, etc., is legalized drugs.
[02:57:47.208 --> 02:57:57.373]  So you've got drugs, gambling, and prostitution, the three pillars of the global economy, now brought to you vis-a-vis social gaming platforms,
[02:57:59.474 --> 02:58:09.882]  But it is like a little red devil in an actual pajamas is running this because it's so ridiculously destructive and evil and almost cartoonishly bad.
[02:58:09.882 --> 02:58:12.384]  I mean, take the NDAA.
[02:58:12.384 --> 02:58:14.705]  Somebody called in and mentioned this and asked if it was true.
[02:58:14.705 --> 02:58:17.547]  And I'd seen it a month ago, two weeks ago.
[02:58:17.547 --> 02:58:19.549]  I'd seen it in AP Reuters, a minor footnote.
[02:58:20.089 --> 02:58:26.453]  That, oh, by the way, the military is going to allow troops to bring their donkey, their pig, whatever, as long as it's their own private house off base.
[02:58:26.453 --> 02:58:29.015]  You can marry pigs, whatever, in the military now.
[02:58:29.015 --> 02:58:31.036]  Turkeys, possums.
[02:58:31.036 --> 02:58:34.058]  And the Republican leadership voted for bestiality.
[02:58:34.058 --> 02:58:39.422]  I mean, my point is, it's like cuckoo land or something.
[02:58:39.422 --> 02:58:43.064]  It's like, it can't get any crazier, but it does, Max.
[02:58:43.064 --> 02:58:44.145]  What is going on?
[02:58:44.145 --> 02:58:49.489]  I mean, now you're not conservative, like Senator Graham, if you're not for, you know, marrying possums.
[02:58:50.632 --> 02:59:00.360]  Well, I heard Donald Rumsfeld fell in love with one of his horses, so they went ahead and they tried to pass this law to cover for his bestiality, and that's what's the whole backstory there.
[02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:01.501]  Are you kidding?
[02:59:01.501 --> 02:59:01.721]  Yes.
[02:59:04.165 --> 02:59:05.285]  I'm not kidding.
[02:59:05.285 --> 02:59:08.647]  Did you see where the NDAA legalizes bestiality?
[02:59:08.647 --> 02:59:09.588]  Yeah, no, I did see that.
[02:59:09.588 --> 02:59:25.717]  And I'm not exactly sure why they felt it needed to legalize the military having sex with goats in Afghanistan, except maybe there's some industry that's about to start up in those regions that we're not quite familiar with.
[02:59:25.717 --> 02:59:27.639]  I know that, you know,
[02:59:28.479 --> 02:59:31.662]  I mean, he can really go to town with this and make a lot of crazy jokes about it.
[02:59:31.662 --> 02:59:37.107]  Well, that could be political correctness training, like they'll teach eight-year-olds now, I guess, in class.
[02:59:37.107 --> 02:59:41.051]  They already teach them stuff similar to that, so I guess, well, we're being bigoted right now.
[02:59:43.214 --> 02:59:53.482]  Yeah, it's a remarkable story that they felt that it was necessary to allow the military to legally have sex with animals.
[02:59:53.482 --> 02:59:55.984]  But I'm not sure exactly what the precedent was.
[02:59:55.984 --> 02:59:58.126]  I'm like Bob Chapman on this.
[02:59:58.126 --> 02:59:59.787]  I'm a bit gobsmacked and startled.
[02:59:59.787 --> 03:00:02.870]  It's hard to even know how to respond.
[03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:04.891]  I'm really flattered you actually listened to the show, Max.
[03:00:06.553 --> 03:00:07.755]  Alright, well let's continue.
[03:00:07.755 --> 03:00:09.537]  What do you see coming up in the rest of the year?
[03:00:09.537 --> 03:00:11.600]  Because I see these articles here.
[03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:16.848]  And how did you sell this to Cantor but then not ever get paid anything?
[03:00:16.848 --> 03:00:17.629]  Because here it is.
[03:00:17.629 --> 03:00:18.230]  It's on record.
[03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:19.712]  These are your inventions.
[03:00:19.712 --> 03:00:21.836]  So I guess that's just they're allowed to have that, I guess.
[03:00:22.984 --> 03:00:43.443]  Well they did, they engaged in an illegal third-party transaction, which what happened was basically one of my board members, a guy by the name of Woody Knight, Howard Woody Knight, he was loaned two million dollars from Cantor to invest in Hollywood Stock Exchange, a preferred issue, which gave him voting control.
[03:00:43.763 --> 03:00:53.331]  But without telling the board that he was doing this, at the same time, he was arranging to sell the stock in the company as a swap that was arranged.
[03:00:53.331 --> 03:00:56.133]  So illegal, it's a fraudulent conveyance.
[03:00:56.133 --> 03:00:58.075]  So he committed massive securities fraud.
[03:00:58.075 --> 03:01:01.838]  Well, you need to then, if you believe that's the case, you need to do something about it, Max.
[03:01:01.838 --> 03:01:04.800]  Let's come back, get more of what you see coming up in the new year.
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:05.601]  We'll be right back.
[03:01:05.601 --> 03:01:07.142]  Last radio show of the year, folks.
[03:01:07.142 --> 03:01:07.362]  2012 Up Next.
[03:01:12.746 --> 03:01:18.568]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:18.568 --> 03:01:24.070]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:27.311]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:01:27.311 --> 03:01:29.912]  Final second of this special four-hour transmission.
[03:01:29.912 --> 03:01:32.813]  This will be the last radio show of 2011.
[03:01:32.813 --> 03:01:34.414]  Wow, that'll take some getting used to in 2012.
[03:01:36.059 --> 03:01:38.701]  And it looks like that year is shaping up to be crazy.
[03:01:38.701 --> 03:01:44.705]  They've got the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of the Israeli military, saying they're getting ready to attack Iran.
[03:01:44.705 --> 03:01:48.447]  We've got record gun sales, all sorts of other bedlam.
[03:01:48.447 --> 03:02:03.377]  But in closing, Max Keiser, quickly, any trends you see in 2012, and what do you make of just the all-out hysteria as the so-called mainstream media runs out of bullets and is having trouble slowing Ron Paul?
[03:02:06.571 --> 03:02:12.975]  Yeah, they can't seem to stop the Ron Paul momentum at this point.
[03:02:12.975 --> 03:02:22.562]  But they're going to pull out all the stops and they're going to try everything they possibly can to stop the Ron Paul Express from continuing.
[03:02:22.562 --> 03:02:24.643]  And so it'll be quite interesting.
[03:02:24.643 --> 03:02:35.050]  I'd love to see Ron Paul get the nomination and then bait Barack Obama because I think he would be the one guy to expose Barack Obama as an utter fraud.
[03:02:36.991 --> 03:02:42.434]  But he doesn't want to bomb all the brown people and turn it into a glass parking lot.
[03:02:42.434 --> 03:02:42.674]  He's racist.
[03:03:01.914 --> 03:03:17.426]  Well, yeah, you know, the thing is that, you know, that seems like a very thin gruel from his opponents to dredge up some third-party, tangential, you know, bigoted remark that was made out of context.
[03:03:17.426 --> 03:03:21.389]  I mean, that's quite a Hail Mary pass, you know, to try to smear Ron Paul.
[03:03:21.389 --> 03:03:22.930]  Well, newsletters were the internet of the day.
[03:03:22.930 --> 03:03:27.814]  At one time, at the peak of this, there was 14 Ron Paul newsletters per week.
[03:03:27.814 --> 03:03:29.876]  I mean, people were reading these like newspapers.
[03:03:30.436 --> 03:03:35.222]  It was a giant business and political and most of these were the supplements.
[03:03:35.222 --> 03:03:36.504]  There's only nine of them.
[03:03:36.504 --> 03:03:41.170]  They were the supplement promo letters sent out by a company hired to promote it.
[03:03:41.170 --> 03:03:42.411]  The media knows that.
[03:03:42.411 --> 03:03:43.933]  That's why they're discredited scum.
[03:03:44.901 --> 03:03:48.444]  Well, it's also rather duplicitous, because what do you have now?
[03:03:48.444 --> 03:03:55.590]  You have people like Michelle Bachman, you know, making incredible racist comments about Arabs.
[03:03:55.590 --> 03:04:00.835]  Making racist comments about Arabs today is considered to be du rigueur.
[03:04:00.835 --> 03:04:03.057]  You know, it's like, oh, this is perfectly acceptable.
[03:04:03.057 --> 03:04:07.441]  It's just that America's taste in racism
[03:04:08.061 --> 03:04:08.321]  That's
[03:04:23.949 --> 03:04:24.690]  It's on racism.
[03:04:24.690 --> 03:04:27.352]  That's what America stands for to the rest of the world.
[03:04:27.352 --> 03:04:39.660]  I mean, I live outside of America, and the first thing people think of when they think of America is this racist country that's committed genocide not once, but twice with the American Indian and then the slave trade.
[03:04:39.660 --> 03:04:42.582]  So it's not like this is new for the American people.
[03:04:42.582 --> 03:04:44.524]  Now they want to commit genocide in the Middle East.
[03:04:44.924 --> 03:04:48.906]  Now we're getting the NDAA though.
[03:04:48.906 --> 03:04:52.608]  Every culture always wants to grab some group that it's okay to basically hunt.
[03:04:52.608 --> 03:04:57.390]  Humans are such predators, we'll engage in predator, or preditate upon ourselves.
[03:04:57.390 --> 03:05:03.193]  That's a human trait, but you're right, the United States certainly has its history of that.
[03:05:03.193 --> 03:05:07.815]  And now the NDAA, I mean look at that Max, everything we talked about now happening.
[03:05:07.815 --> 03:05:11.217]  We'll secretly arrest you, the military will come after you.
[03:05:11.217 --> 03:05:13.638]  I mean that's what every third world nation falls to Max.
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:18.822]  Well, as I've been saying on your show for a few years, you know, there's two choices.
[03:05:18.822 --> 03:05:20.682]  Fight or flee.
[03:05:20.682 --> 03:05:23.023]  Personally, I made the choice of fleeing.
[03:05:23.023 --> 03:05:23.923]  You know, I'm not living in Africa.
[03:05:23.923 --> 03:05:24.884]  Max, we're out of time.
[03:05:24.884 --> 03:05:25.944]  Great job.
[03:05:25.944 --> 03:05:27.625]  Look forward to talking to you in the new year.
[03:05:27.625 --> 03:05:28.545]  God bless.
[03:05:28.545 --> 03:05:29.546]  There goes Max Keiser.
[03:05:29.546 --> 03:05:31.226]  By the way, they ran in here.
