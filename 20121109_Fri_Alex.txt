[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:36.820]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.820 --> 00:44.140]  it is Friday the ninth day of November 2012 I am your host Alex Jones and we
[00:44.140 --> 00:47.980]  are going to be here for the next three hours today we have several special
[00:47.980 --> 00:52.860]  from reports that are going to premiere here on the radio in the third hour
[00:52.860 --> 00:59.060]  today including the proof that yes the UN treaty does restrict your second
[00:59.060 --> 01:05.580]  amendment and proof that Obama is coming after your gods it's on they're moving
[01:05.580 --> 01:09.140]  on every front they're going to shut down the industry they're going to raise
[01:09.140 --> 01:14.860]  the taxes they're going to put in the carbon taxes all of it designed you see
[01:14.860 --> 01:18.060]  all these businesses finally shutting down now that Obama has been reelected
[01:18.060 --> 01:22.620]  tens of thousands being laid off just in the first day it's because a lot of
[01:22.620 --> 01:30.060]  companies operate on such small profit margins that they cannot compete with
[01:30.060 --> 01:34.020]  the government health care system also increasing the price of health care they
[01:34.020 --> 01:38.460]  can barely hang on against China against India against Mexico who don't have any
[01:38.460 --> 01:43.500]  health care any workers comp make you work 18 hours a day suicide nets at the
[01:43.500 --> 01:47.980]  Apple factories and so it's like okay we're shutting down we're closing our
[01:47.980 --> 01:52.300]  doors we're gone we're not going to hire anybody or we're going to lay off you
[01:52.300 --> 01:56.220]  know half our workforce or all the big corporations are saying you know what you
[01:56.220 --> 02:02.060]  get 20 hours a week now instead of 40 so you don't get your insurance and that's
[02:02.060 --> 02:07.700]  great that's the plan now you'll go from 25 million on food stamps when Obama got
[02:07.700 --> 02:13.620]  in to ride at 50 million it'll go to 100 mil and the even more will shut down
[02:13.620 --> 02:19.780]  until we have the gas shortages the food shortages that this is a plan they did
[02:19.780 --> 02:23.860]  this in China they did this in Russia they did this in Cuba they did this
[02:23.860 --> 02:29.060]  everywhere they've been doing it in Venezuela and this is it until those of
[02:29.060 --> 02:35.140]  us that even know how to work our enforced labor camps producing for the
[02:35.140 --> 02:39.940]  welfare Queens walking around with their submachine guns beating a sub of the
[02:39.940 --> 02:43.780]  head but shovels now it'll never get to that point it got to that point in
[02:43.780 --> 02:47.940]  North Korea got to that point to a great extent in Cuba got to that point in the
[02:47.940 --> 02:51.540]  Soviet Union got that point in China China got smart made a deal with the
[02:51.540 --> 02:56.820]  globalist who put him in place to begin with in 49 to be just a slave system or
[02:56.820 --> 03:01.500]  a fascist system calling itself communist but but allowing some free
[03:01.500 --> 03:05.020]  enterprise but they're not gonna do that they're gonna strangle the goose with
[03:05.020 --> 03:10.620]  the golden eggs because they hate America so much and it's about total
[03:10.620 --> 03:17.060]  domination and so there will be plenty of cream in the globalist bunkers the
[03:17.060 --> 03:21.620]  armored redoubts and the new status will be black uniforms won't matter if you
[03:21.620 --> 03:24.980]  live in a little hovel and you know don't get a lot of food either at least
[03:24.980 --> 03:29.100]  you're gonna get to strut around into the new austerity and check some papers
[03:29.100 --> 03:33.100]  and break some jaws all right and run some checkpoints and see the once
[03:33.100 --> 03:38.020]  great citizens pull up to him and be scared this is the pure baptism in
[03:38.020 --> 03:43.140]  enslavement because we think abortion is good I mean I was thinking about this
[03:43.140 --> 03:47.140]  morning and it really hit me that I need to codify an entire ten minute
[03:47.140 --> 03:52.020]  special report on this and not just get on the air and talk about it and really
[03:52.020 --> 03:55.500]  break down an epiphany I had about abortion you know I knew this about
[03:55.500 --> 04:00.500]  abortion but it really hit me in like a five ten minute epiphany where I just
[04:00.500 --> 04:06.940]  stood there with my hand on the counter after my wife and children had left
[04:06.940 --> 04:10.940]  before I came into the office they were gone on some errands I just sat there
[04:10.940 --> 04:17.220]  and it all made perfect sense because if you'll say those aren't humans and
[04:17.220 --> 04:21.020]  that that's not a life and you've got that choice and all the excuses once you
[04:21.020 --> 04:25.340]  have the abortion you're now committed to that idea and you'll commit to any
[04:25.340 --> 04:32.740]  other rationalization a lot of people been involved in abortions and as long
[04:32.740 --> 04:37.140]  as you realize it it was wrong what you did and understand the fraud of it you're
[04:37.140 --> 04:43.060]  cleansed it's a great weight off your shoulders I know but I'll tell you those
[04:43.060 --> 04:47.180]  of you out there it is your religion when I said women who have all these
[04:47.180 --> 04:50.980]  abortions they're in love abortion and then are proud of it and brag about it
[04:50.980 --> 04:55.420]  they their wombs are temples to human sacrifice they are the ultimate
[04:55.420 --> 04:58.540]  Satanist they have murdered their children we'll be right back with Ron

[08:33.420 --> 08:40.660]  Friday the ninth day of November 2012 I am your host Alex Jones Ron Paul soon to
[08:40.660 --> 08:45.540]  be former Congressman Ron Paul is set to join us in about 30 minutes here on the
[08:45.540 --> 08:50.220]  air and obviously he was quoted by the Washington Times and others when he was
[08:50.220 --> 08:53.740]  on Bloomberg television as saying America already went over the cliff and
[08:53.740 --> 08:59.340]  we're far gone and that we have converted to socialism and will collapse and
[08:59.340 --> 09:02.940]  that is the plan yes they were they're gonna collapse us into total
[09:02.940 --> 09:07.460]  tyranny and the domesticated masses will not know any better and they will
[09:07.460 --> 09:12.380]  demand anyone who has any money any property that everything be taken from
[09:12.380 --> 09:18.620]  you until finally you are physically put in forced labor camps that that is
[09:18.620 --> 09:23.460]  what every socialist and communist country ends up collapsing into if the
[09:23.460 --> 09:26.460]  people put up with it that's where it leads as the North Korean Soviet
[09:26.460 --> 09:32.300]  communist Chinese you know Foxcom Apple suicide nets around the building
[09:32.300 --> 09:37.060]  forced abortions you know inside that's where it leads that that's who these
[09:37.060 --> 09:44.260]  people are that's what they create that is what they push in every single case
[09:44.260 --> 09:53.100]  so Ron Paul the congressman will be joining us to break all of that down
[09:53.100 --> 10:00.860]  later in the hour on top of all of that they're pushing the fiscal cliff and
[10:00.860 --> 10:05.500]  this has been done in Europe over and over again they've the globalist the
[10:05.500 --> 10:08.020]  megabanks that bragged they've conquered our country and the rest of the
[10:08.020 --> 10:11.900]  world through fraud and derivatives and manipulation hold everyone hostage
[10:11.900 --> 10:16.500]  saying the economy is going to implode unless you give us carbon taxes increase
[10:16.500 --> 10:22.900]  carbon taxes VAT taxes a higher income taxes and they call it austerity and then
[10:22.900 --> 10:30.900]  the prostitute media plays along with it and never points out that almost all the
[10:30.900 --> 10:36.660]  debt is really from bailing out the megabanks themselves so that is some of
[10:36.660 --> 10:41.700]  the information that we're going to be covering on that front as well today and
[10:41.700 --> 10:49.660]  again Coles election loss could mean gain for carbon tax Bloomberg the hill
[10:49.660 --> 10:55.180]  carbon tax could be an Obama's toolbox Bloomberg Obama may levy carbon tax to
[10:55.180 --> 11:02.180]  cut US deficit HSBC says that's where this is going on top of a VAT Obama's
[11:02.180 --> 11:05.380]  set to give a speech today and you know he's going to talk about how we're in
[11:05.380 --> 11:10.820]  trouble why the economy just imploded the day after I got elected again the same
[11:10.820 --> 11:16.140]  megabanks that financed to get him back into office and finance Romney just to
[11:16.140 --> 11:21.020]  make doubly sure they maintain control either way their guy got in they drop
[11:21.020 --> 11:24.780]  the hammer after the election because they've been somewhat propping it up
[11:24.780 --> 11:28.680]  because now they're going to the next phase of austerity and when they raise
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.100]  taxes just like they've done in California or like to another countries
[11:32.100 --> 11:37.140]  like Greece other places it actually lowers revenue and kills business
[11:37.140 --> 11:42.140]  that's the plan you don't want people up at E with their own businesses running
[11:42.140 --> 11:46.380]  around with money in the bank you want them with the hands out that's why they
[11:46.380 --> 11:51.420]  they Chris Matthews has said it Michael Morris said it how great the storm is
[11:51.420 --> 11:56.780]  because it makes you dependent and it teaches you to be dependent of course
[11:56.780 --> 12:04.900]  we see 11 days without power Sandy victims want answers we have other
[12:04.900 --> 12:11.980]  reports power outages continue to plague New Jersey New York you name it 30
[12:11.980 --> 12:16.300]  hour wait for fuel offers plenty of intrigue but no gas New York Daily News
[12:16.300 --> 12:23.700]  gas rationing New Yorkers welcomed to the third world ready to snap in Cedar
[12:23.700 --> 12:28.820]  Grove residents are at 10th and 11th day no power what they're really freaking out
[12:28.820 --> 12:32.340]  about is the liquor deliveries aren't happening but the alcohol has run out
[12:32.340 --> 12:37.260]  there's more looting more crime going on but the media is keeping it quiet bitter
[12:37.260 --> 12:41.540]  cold inside disaster shelter even the government shelters in places like
[12:41.540 --> 12:51.620]  Merleboro don't have power that's the type of information that we have here
[12:51.620 --> 12:58.140]  all right now there's your government 11 days can't won't help you but we're
[12:58.140 --> 13:05.420]  bad if we say that you should get prepared we're bad if we say you should
[13:05.420 --> 13:09.060]  have a year of food you should have firearms you should know how to fix
[13:09.060 --> 13:13.980]  basic stuff in your house or car you should know how to run a trot line you
[13:13.980 --> 13:19.380]  should know how to clean a firearm you should know how to stomp somebody's
[13:19.380 --> 13:24.300]  button to the ground if they assault you but the new religion in America there's
[13:24.300 --> 13:30.100]  three groups of people really there's globalist technocratic crime syndicates
[13:30.100 --> 13:35.060]  that know the street no other world works and decided to fleece the sheep
[13:35.060 --> 13:38.820]  you've got good hard-working people that try to work within the system that's
[13:38.820 --> 13:43.220]  fraudulent who are being attacked and and and destroyed and then you have the
[13:43.220 --> 13:48.740]  giant mass of dumbed-down Kim Kardashian you know fans who don't even know what
[13:48.740 --> 13:53.900]  day of the week it is literally who were in helpless zombie like states and all
[13:53.900 --> 13:57.660]  they know how to do is beg and plead and demand that somebody else's stuff is
[13:57.660 --> 14:06.180]  theirs they are going to literally societally culturally eat us alive this
[14:06.180 --> 14:09.300]  has happened everywhere it's not like we're just theorizing this is
[14:09.300 --> 14:13.820]  guaranteed it's like you got gangrene on your leg and your toes are turning black
[14:13.820 --> 14:19.100]  and and smelling if they're gonna cut those toes off and if they don't you're
[14:19.100 --> 14:22.660]  gonna lose the whole leg and then your whole body you're gonna die well we have
[14:22.660 --> 14:26.660]  gangrene flesh-eating bacteria all over us politically okay we're stumbling
[14:26.660 --> 14:31.380]  around snot's coming out of our nose our eyes are bloodshot we've got 110
[14:31.380 --> 14:37.200]  fever this country is on death's doorstep which is the plan going from
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.500]  liberty and four percent of the world's population having half the wealth
[14:40.500 --> 14:44.180]  because we weren't perfect we had more freedom and so it was a cornucopia it
[14:44.180 --> 14:48.740]  was an engine of wealth and we became spoiled brats and people learn to sit
[14:48.740 --> 14:52.780]  around or get government jobs and you know festoon themselves and convince
[14:52.780 --> 14:56.340]  themselves that they make the earth you know turn and the grass grow and the
[14:56.340 --> 15:03.180]  birds sing and I mean we look I've been saying it we're far gone we're over the
[15:03.180 --> 15:07.180]  cliff it's all designed Ron Paul's now saying that in fact guys will you print
[15:07.180 --> 15:11.700]  me that stack of Ron Paul articles up no actually here they are good I found
[15:11.700 --> 15:15.620]  them and I know you gave them to me I couldn't find them Ron Paul election
[15:15.620 --> 15:19.740]  shows us far gone Washington Times the hill Ron Paul we're already over the
[15:19.740 --> 15:24.140]  fiscal cliff yeah by design Ron Paul America already over the cliff
[15:24.140 --> 15:28.340]  Wall Street Journal those on with it okay he's gonna come on we've got
[15:28.340 --> 15:36.940]  questions for him the point is that this is an engineered situation now now I
[15:36.940 --> 15:41.340]  spent three days making sure of this and I went and checked at blackboxvoting.org
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.940]  her numbers and the past Bev Harris was a pretty much a Democrat she called
[15:45.940 --> 15:48.860]  herself an independent because she realizes they're all a mafia she helped
[15:48.860 --> 15:53.780]  expose Republican theft of elections so we're not saying Mitt Romney's good
[15:53.780 --> 15:57.380]  we had Obama supporters calling yesterday you heard me open the phones
[15:57.380 --> 16:01.620]  for we're gonna do it again today later if Ron Paul leaves us and I would say
[16:01.620 --> 16:07.100]  now listen my guy didn't lose Mitt Romney's a globalist but the referendum if
[16:07.100 --> 16:11.780]  you believe this election certifying that people say yeah you didn't build
[16:11.780 --> 16:15.500]  that I want an Obama phone and the government needs to give us a little
[16:15.500 --> 16:18.980]  something we went on interviewed Obama supporters the Driscoll the Democratic
[16:18.980 --> 16:23.300]  Party of Texas celebration here in the capital city of Texas Austin and and
[16:23.300 --> 16:26.020]  that's what they were all saying yeah we need to help people we need to give
[16:26.020 --> 16:29.860]  people money give them free health care give them free education there's an
[16:29.860 --> 16:33.420]  there's no such thing as free when you start giving out free it starts to
[16:33.420 --> 16:39.460]  basing everything Democrats polled want quantitative easing they want money
[16:39.460 --> 16:45.460]  printing they just don't get it folks they really are in this weird star
[16:45.460 --> 16:48.860]  struck fantasy does that mean Republicans are good no they like torture
[16:48.860 --> 16:53.100]  secret arrest lying wars they bought into their own brand of evil the point is
[16:53.100 --> 16:57.460]  if they would have kicked Obama out that would have been hey incumbents look out
[16:57.460 --> 17:01.740]  hey you know people are mad the fact that things are so bad Obama's been caught
[17:01.740 --> 17:05.940]  lying so much in the AA torture secret arrest hiring nothing but lobby is
[17:05.940 --> 17:10.740]  signing statements all the insider deals shutting down the coal plant shipping
[17:10.740 --> 17:15.860]  General Motors that China salendra all the I mean just makes Bill Clinton look
[17:15.860 --> 17:18.500]  like a saint it's not the Bill Clinton's the same he's actually running this
[17:18.500 --> 17:22.940]  administration it's a Clinton operation folks it's on record it's that things
[17:22.940 --> 17:26.380]  are so far gone now they get away with anything just department running fast
[17:26.380 --> 17:30.940]  and furious the list goes on and on and meanwhile they're buying 1.6 billion
[17:30.940 --> 17:34.140]  bullets they're digging in their fortifying police stations they're
[17:34.140 --> 17:36.980]  training them the gun owners and libertarians of the enemy that those
[17:36.980 --> 17:40.620]  that don't don't like world government of the enemy those of us that understand
[17:40.620 --> 17:44.300]  the takeover those of us that don't want this to happen we are now listed as the
[17:44.300 --> 17:47.500]  enemy and they're putting the internet kill switch in with cyber security and
[17:47.500 --> 17:50.820]  they're announcing they want the fairness doctrine back to shut us down and
[17:50.820 --> 17:56.340]  they're doing all sorts of cyber attacks to alternative media it's on folks it's
[17:56.340 --> 18:02.460]  on now here's the good news and I've studied this and I can tell you right
[18:02.460 --> 18:08.580]  now Bev Harris vote fraud expert Romney votes not counted in key states and if
[18:08.580 --> 18:11.940]  you add up all the places where there was clear fraud that they wouldn't that
[18:11.940 --> 18:14.340]  they admit none of the votes were counted on election day they would just
[18:14.340 --> 18:18.940]  announce it and the trends where Romney really won those states met Romney
[18:18.940 --> 18:24.660]  really won now that's not a good thing but it's not the worst scenario because
[18:24.660 --> 18:28.660]  it just shows people at least hitting the reset button you know going you know
[18:28.660 --> 18:32.380]  what we don't like what Bush did we're putting Obama in we don't like what
[18:32.380 --> 18:37.020]  Obama did we're putting Romney in at least it shows some primitive inkling
[18:37.020 --> 18:41.060]  of understanding how much trouble we're in there's video Bev Harris breaking it
[18:41.060 --> 18:44.580]  down two days ago but we went and collated it all you know get our own
[18:44.580 --> 18:47.740]  vetting it's accurate it's a very important article because here's the
[18:47.740 --> 18:51.380]  deal folks you don't really believe that most polls showed two-thirds of people
[18:51.380 --> 18:57.620]  wanted GMO labeling in California but then magically 60% or close to 59%
[18:57.620 --> 19:02.780]  voted against it they're still counting votes I mean you don't really believe
[19:02.780 --> 19:05.940]  Californians don't want to have something label GMO does anyone buy that
[19:05.940 --> 19:09.180]  does anyone when there's admitted election fraud everywhere and now they
[19:09.180 --> 19:12.420]  call states you know when they haven't even counted the day's ballots they're
[19:12.420 --> 19:17.060]  not even in I mean does anyone believe this look here's the deal the systems
[19:17.060 --> 19:20.900]  totally discredited now they're gonna say the voting machines at state levels
[19:20.900 --> 19:25.740]  say band guns they're gonna say that oh all the new property tax increases pass
[19:25.740 --> 19:30.140]  wow who would have thought it oh my gosh you know and a few times they'll you
[19:30.140 --> 19:33.700]  have a few state referendums to make it look like you're having some victories
[19:33.700 --> 19:37.580]  I'm telling you folks this is a scientific takeover where they grab power
[19:37.580 --> 19:42.660]  see if we buy it okay they bought it move forward you have to either discredit
[19:42.660 --> 19:47.700]  the whole system disengage fight against it every way you can or we're going
[19:47.700 --> 19:52.660]  into a cross between the Soviet Union communist China Nazi Germany and
[19:52.660 --> 19:57.300]  Caesar's Rome I mean this is it we're in trouble and if you don't have ghost

[23:05.820 --> 23:11.980]  state I was in back in 2010 then I learned about RNA drops I learned that 97% of

[23:59.180 --> 24:21.940]  a little piece of me a little piece of you we die for the system
[24:21.940 --> 24:35.380]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[24:35.380 --> 24:39.900]  show stocks are falling people are laying off their employees all over the
[24:39.900 --> 24:45.700]  place because you see we're in a global system designed by the megabanks and
[24:45.700 --> 24:50.700]  it's designed to shut down the once wealthy economies and convert them over
[24:50.700 --> 24:54.780]  to tyranny and the globalist brag about this they write about this but that's in
[24:54.780 --> 24:58.820]  their economic treatises the general public just likes to buy into whatever
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.380]  the mainstream media is telling them and they're telling them the government
[25:01.380 --> 25:05.300]  wants you to do great and wants to help the little guys and as more people get
[25:05.300 --> 25:09.140]  poor they think well the answer must be government because they say they want to
[25:09.140 --> 25:13.940]  make me rich and then government gets bigger more people get poor and they go
[25:13.940 --> 25:17.420]  well we better have a bigger government that's what makes poor people rich and
[25:17.420 --> 25:22.340]  bigger government more poor people until we convert from the richest country in
[25:22.340 --> 25:26.980]  the world to a globalist New World Order military colony where they just get
[25:26.980 --> 25:31.460]  conscripts and they're coming out with the drone ships the drone aircraft the
[25:31.460 --> 25:36.900]  drone submarines the drone soldiers that one won't even be needed soon you see
[25:36.900 --> 25:40.900]  the future doesn't need us human life's always been cheap but now now because of
[25:40.900 --> 25:45.460]  robotics and automation we're not even needed according to the globalist and so
[25:45.460 --> 25:48.980]  they're just shutting down the ones free society so they can convert us into pure
[25:48.980 --> 25:55.140]  authoritarianism I had a forced population reduction that is that is just
[25:55.140 --> 26:01.220]  some of what's going on and we did a national poll that I mentioned yesterday
[26:01.220 --> 26:04.540]  on air but this got published by the time we went off air at 2 p.m. central
[26:04.540 --> 26:10.780]  yesterday poll nearly one-third of Americans should accept TSA body cavity
[26:10.780 --> 26:16.700]  search in order to fly that was a Harris scientific poll of 2000 plus adults
[26:16.700 --> 26:23.420]  that we commissioned you can read the full poll and in full wars.com and some
[26:23.420 --> 26:28.500]  newspapers picked this up but you imagine that be a big national story but
[26:28.500 --> 26:31.660]  some people are commenting no I think they should check us there could be a
[26:31.660 --> 26:35.300]  bomb well why not cut you open there there be there could be something in
[26:35.300 --> 26:38.620]  your stomach I mean why not just not let you leave your house how about you just
[26:38.620 --> 26:43.780]  live in a little confined a gen 21 ghetto just for your security of course that's
[26:43.780 --> 26:46.860]  what Hitler said go to these ghettos that have bar bar around them for your
[26:46.860 --> 26:49.940]  security I mean that's where this is all going but if you advertise it is the
[26:49.940 --> 26:53.380]  latest greatest thing and have Madonna promote it well it must be great and the
[26:53.380 --> 26:56.500]  poll asked six questions one of the others was would you wear an electric
[26:56.500 --> 27:00.860]  shock or taser bracelet poll 35% of Americans would wear electric shock
[27:00.860 --> 27:07.420]  bracelet in order to fly and a homeland security actually has taken bids and had
[27:07.420 --> 27:11.340]  meetings about making everyone wear it shocking survey results show how much
[27:11.340 --> 27:13.820]  freedom Americans are willing to sacrifice of course they don't care if
[27:13.820 --> 27:17.780]  you don't like it they'll just try to implement it and they already put you in
[27:17.780 --> 27:23.860]  a radiation bath to you know get your authorization you know for the safety of
[27:23.860 --> 27:26.460]  everybody of course the government needs to have that happen and they grope you
[27:26.460 --> 27:29.660]  of course for your safety so that's what's happening in the once land the
[27:29.660 --> 27:34.900]  freedom of the brave because of al-qaeda that the government publicly runs in
[27:34.900 --> 27:40.780]  Libya and Syria and always ran and always will run out of Saudi Arabia but
[27:40.780 --> 27:45.180]  it's just so much fun to be Islamophobic even the globalists run the radicals and
[27:45.180 --> 27:48.740]  put them in power that it's like so what just get rid of my future get rid of my
[27:48.740 --> 27:53.060]  kids future take all my rights hey but the government manuals that police and
[27:53.060 --> 27:56.620]  military sent us an FBI and federal marshall sent us over the years that
[27:56.620 --> 28:00.180]  broke over and over again national news it says it's not about al-qaeda that it's
[28:00.180 --> 28:04.220]  gun owners returning veterans and farmers and people anybody that is
[28:04.220 --> 28:07.380]  self-sufficient wow just like all authoritarians go after those people
[28:07.380 --> 28:13.100]  this is a repeat of history right here linen now I this is important and
[28:13.100 --> 28:19.460]  they're all yeah well we do need to watch those evil right wingers I mean
[28:19.460 --> 28:23.460]  they don't want us to get our old bomb a phone they'd I mean what did Janet
[28:23.460 --> 28:28.300]  Reno say on 60 minutes back in the mid 90s she said the biggest cult in America
[28:28.300 --> 28:31.700]  the most dangerous people are quote evangelical Christians who believe in
[28:31.700 --> 28:35.460]  the second coming of Christ why you believe in the second coming of Christ
[28:35.460 --> 28:39.620]  and that's what they teach in those manuals and you know what if you're a
[28:39.620 --> 28:42.260]  cop and you go to those intelligence training deals and you don't agree with
[28:42.260 --> 28:45.940]  that they take note and you're out of there you're back on patrol we're gonna
[28:45.940 --> 28:50.140]  bust you down from you know sergeant back to on the street pal how about you
[28:50.140 --> 28:54.020]  lose $20,000 a year in your paycheck oh you don't like shaking people down and
[28:54.020 --> 28:58.300]  writing them tickets all day how about you get put back out there you know where
[28:58.300 --> 29:02.660]  you started 10 years ago oh you don't like that how about you just get out of
[29:02.660 --> 29:05.340]  here and what I'm doing it's like good we got people that are willing to do
[29:05.340 --> 29:09.100]  whatever they're told you just get out of the force and so the conversion
[29:09.100 --> 29:14.940]  towards pure evil accelerates and I want to beg all of you out there to
[29:14.940 --> 29:19.420]  realize that a lot of us have disengaged from the system because we know we
[29:19.420 --> 29:22.460]  don't have a choice within the system of people like Mitt Romney but it is a
[29:22.460 --> 29:31.380]  mandate it is a it is a vote against liberty that people voted for Obama not
[29:31.380 --> 29:34.220]  that not that either guy would have done really something different it's just
[29:34.220 --> 29:37.740]  that Obama openly says you didn't build that openly that we're collectivist
[29:37.740 --> 29:42.780]  openly that banning all guns is good in the past and now he's coming after the
[29:42.780 --> 29:46.780]  guns now they're coming out with the legislation they physically want them
[29:46.780 --> 29:51.260]  we'll be right back stay with us Ron Paul coming up we're on the march the

[33:20.940 --> 33:25.380]  us right back congressman Ron Paul he's been a busy man out there speaking to
[33:25.380 --> 33:29.900]  millions of young people around the country and we're doing a great job
[33:29.900 --> 33:34.900]  exposing collectivism and that the path this country is going on and on this
[33:34.900 --> 33:38.980]  Friday edition a few days after the election we have a couple of minutes
[33:38.980 --> 33:44.300]  here 30 minutes or so with congressman Ron Paul congressman I don't know how
[33:44.300 --> 33:48.900]  you do it holding up under something that a young man couldn't do but a great
[33:48.900 --> 33:53.620]  job getting the message of liberty out during the campaign well it's been a
[33:53.620 --> 33:59.740]  lot of fun and of course at times frustrating but what really gets me
[33:59.740 --> 34:03.700]  going or keeps me going is what everybody knows is that I have identified
[34:03.700 --> 34:07.180]  with a lot of young people as you have you know I'm going to the campuses and
[34:07.180 --> 34:13.220]  that's why I've never dwelled on DC DC is important but DC is a reflection of
[34:13.220 --> 34:17.380]  what the next generation is going to be thinking about and realizing so that's
[34:17.380 --> 34:21.820]  where I'm optimistic Washington's as big as best as ever but there's there's
[34:21.820 --> 34:26.780]  reason to believe that all the freedom organizations your radio show we're all
[34:26.780 --> 34:30.540]  making some progress and more in the last five years than we did probably in
[34:30.540 --> 34:37.340]  the previous 20 years absolutely look Bev Harris who is as you know one of
[34:37.340 --> 34:41.220]  the top voting fraud experts in the country she's nonpartisan she says a
[34:41.220 --> 34:45.300]  lot of Romney votes didn't get counted they called states long before they
[34:45.300 --> 34:49.380]  should have that articles up at info wars.com I know it looks like you're a
[34:49.380 --> 34:52.700]  spoiled sport if you talk about election fraud but it's been certified and
[34:52.700 --> 34:57.100]  proven over and over again I don't so much see it as a mandate for
[34:57.100 --> 35:02.580]  collectivism that Obama got reelected I see it as a mandate that people have
[35:02.580 --> 35:08.020]  been dumbed down and that Romney wasn't really a somebody who was really
[35:08.020 --> 35:12.620]  speaking out against Obama but when you make the statement congressman that the
[35:12.620 --> 35:19.420]  US election shows were far gone can you elaborate on that well yes the subject
[35:19.420 --> 35:26.140]  comes up because the big talk now is a fiscal cliff and in many ways I work on
[35:26.140 --> 35:30.420]  assumption that we've sort of gone off the cliff nobody realizes because we
[35:30.420 --> 35:35.220]  haven't hit the bottom we don't know what their implications are but in the
[35:35.220 --> 35:39.740]  key in the election what I was thinking about that time was that one of the
[35:39.740 --> 35:45.580]  things that Obama was able to do was play on fear fear of those people you
[35:45.580 --> 35:50.860]  know in a rough belt who are used to artificially high wages and jobs and
[35:50.860 --> 35:56.820]  bailouts and he played on that so in many ways it was those individuals in
[35:56.820 --> 36:02.140]  Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin are saying hey you protect me take care of
[36:02.140 --> 36:05.460]  you make sure my checks are coming and I said it's not a whole lot different in
[36:05.460 --> 36:08.980]  the way they line up on the streets in Greece you know don't cut anything and
[36:08.980 --> 36:14.340]  the people who are on the dole wanted so in that way that's fine of the argument
[36:14.340 --> 36:21.020]  one the but I'm not as down on what happened in the election because 12
[36:21.020 --> 36:26.340]  million decided not to bother which isn't all that bad you know because they
[36:26.340 --> 36:30.740]  decided they looked at Romney and they and they looked at Obama says it's not
[36:30.740 --> 36:34.020]  worth the effort and they know this whole system is rigged against us if we
[36:34.020 --> 36:38.860]  try a third party so they just sit back with it and but I think those are our
[36:38.860 --> 36:42.780]  supporters I mean I think those are people who probably listen to you and
[36:42.780 --> 36:48.060]  pay attention to me but but they they know that you know the current system
[36:48.060 --> 36:52.020]  isn't working but I think we're the majority there's no doubt in my mind if
[36:52.020 --> 36:57.060]  you take people who have dropped out a while ago or dropping out now not
[36:57.060 --> 37:01.460]  enthusiastic wouldn't vote for either of them I think they're listening more to
[37:01.460 --> 37:05.260]  what we're saying that was my next question I saw some of the breakdowns
[37:05.260 --> 37:09.980]  in areas of Florida and other places where there were massively less
[37:09.980 --> 37:16.220]  Republican voters just not voting this time around then voted four years ago
[37:16.220 --> 37:21.620]  with McCain and Obama and I looked at the numbers and the demographics I
[37:21.620 --> 37:23.860]  think you're alluding to this I'd like you to expand on it congressman
[37:23.860 --> 37:27.100]  I'm from Ron Paul joins us if you just tuned in live here on this Friday
[37:27.100 --> 37:32.100]  edition that it is the Ron Paul libertarian constitutional true
[37:32.100 --> 37:38.460]  America group that was snubbed and demonized and attacked and drummed out
[37:38.460 --> 37:43.180]  by the Rockefeller blue blood Republicans that just didn't vote I mean I
[37:43.180 --> 37:47.500]  know that I ended up not voting because of that Richard Reeves one of my crew
[37:47.500 --> 37:51.100]  members was one of your delegates he ended up not doing that most Republicans
[37:51.100 --> 37:54.700]  and conservatives and libertarians I talked to just said hey let Obama come
[37:54.700 --> 37:58.300]  in and bring in total communism let's let everybody really see what this is
[37:58.300 --> 38:02.780]  like no more of these fake Republicans who are basically exactly the same
[38:02.780 --> 38:08.500]  Republican and name only counterfeit conservatives I mean what I'm hearing is
[38:08.500 --> 38:14.020]  people are voting by buying four or five million guns a month and they're done
[38:14.020 --> 38:21.460]  yeah now people are hoping down and they realize this and the big question the
[38:21.460 --> 38:28.940]  big job we had is when the major crisis is the really big one is you know there
[38:28.940 --> 38:33.900]  will be a revamping there's always a a restoration of a currency that people
[38:33.900 --> 38:38.860]  can at least trust for a while or told to trust it and they have to have restored
[38:38.860 --> 38:44.300]  confidence in a government and right now though the contest is between us who
[38:44.300 --> 38:48.620]  would like very limited federal government and a lot of self-government
[38:48.620 --> 38:54.380]  versus those who want to march onward not to see I know I don't usually use
[38:54.380 --> 38:59.460]  word carelessly but onto a form of you know just socialism but it's a form of
[38:59.460 --> 39:04.540]  socialism that's called fascism and that's what why I dread the combination
[39:04.540 --> 39:08.540]  of big government big corporations when you look at that whether it's medical
[39:08.540 --> 39:15.340]  care or the media or the military the Goldman Sachs in the banking industry
[39:15.340 --> 39:21.660]  that's that's who's been in charge and they're going to hang on tenaciously so
[39:21.660 --> 39:25.980]  our challenges is very great but our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds
[39:25.980 --> 39:30.300]  and people that because of the crisis they're looking elsewhere because they
[39:30.300 --> 39:36.500]  know that the economic policy of Keynesian and the inflation of the fed
[39:36.500 --> 39:42.740]  there they're not you know confident that they can do it again there's a term
[39:42.740 --> 39:49.620]  out there Obama ism or obama ism basically communism and you just said
[39:49.620 --> 39:54.740]  it is someone who studied history and also finance and economics they're
[39:54.740 --> 39:58.980]  always saying oh we have the choice of fascism or socialism in the extreme of
[39:58.980 --> 40:05.460]  socialism communism but Stalin and Hitler had a packed together they
[40:05.460 --> 40:10.540]  divided Poland in half Stalin admired Hitler and adopted much of what he did
[40:10.540 --> 40:15.940]  Mussolini and Hitler were actually national socialist they socialized
[40:15.940 --> 40:19.980]  things for the general public but allowed mega robber barons to have a
[40:19.980 --> 40:23.620]  centralized fascist economy and historically that's what I've seen just
[40:23.620 --> 40:27.700]  studying history myself is you get a socialism or communism on the bottom
[40:27.700 --> 40:34.820]  with powerful exempt elites or empires that are you incredibly wealthy with the
[40:34.820 --> 40:39.820]  general public fighting over scraps and I mean this is the type of real
[40:39.820 --> 40:44.380]  definition we need out there that liberalism we hear about is not liberal
[40:44.380 --> 40:49.260]  at all like Thomas Jefferson a real liberal this is a virulent authoritarianism
[40:49.260 --> 40:56.980]  you know and when these changes occur if a national socialism is defeated they
[40:56.980 --> 41:02.500]  have no trouble becoming becoming communists in this in the in the
[41:02.500 --> 41:08.980]  communists in Russia KGB became sort of the you know corporates you know all
[41:08.980 --> 41:12.180]  the stuff that was amazing to be the head five years that you had these
[41:12.180 --> 41:16.700]  billionaires and then I found out that it was the KGB that ended up opening most
[41:16.700 --> 41:20.940]  of the big businesses they did have more of a market economy and you can't
[41:20.940 --> 41:25.660]  complain about the Soviets falling apart but really many of the same people
[41:25.660 --> 41:28.620]  stayed in charge so they're very flexible they went power and money and
[41:28.620 --> 41:33.420]  control and what they call it is secondary to that sure and again the
[41:33.420 --> 41:37.660]  proper definition of old bomb you nism which I hope everybody adopts is the
[41:37.660 --> 41:41.780]  high-tax big government economic growth killing centrally planned economic
[41:41.780 --> 41:46.100]  regime favor by Barack Hussein Obama essentially the same as communism and
[41:46.100 --> 41:52.060]  socialism and I mean if this isn't Obamnianism I don't know what is
[41:52.060 --> 41:55.500]  congressman when you talk about we're already over the cliff when you talk
[41:55.500 --> 42:01.860]  about you know we are basically far gone that's not negativity that's
[42:01.860 --> 42:06.820]  that's historically being being accurate in in in my well research view but can
[42:06.820 --> 42:10.020]  you flesh it out you know you talked a few years ago about something big is
[42:10.020 --> 42:13.620]  coming break down where we're going because I've seen numbers even in the
[42:13.620 --> 42:18.180]  Wall Street Journal that are per capita government debt individual debt is far
[42:18.180 --> 42:22.460]  above Greece's even and so how you expect historically you've predicted so
[42:22.460 --> 42:26.820]  much of this what you expect to now unfold as we see the economy imploding
[42:26.820 --> 42:32.820]  just days after Obama gets back in I was always impressed with talking with
[42:32.820 --> 42:36.700]  the young people on the campuses and telling them how bad I see things and
[42:36.700 --> 42:40.340]  then the comments afterwards when we talked and they say you the only gives
[42:40.340 --> 42:43.700]  me hope when they come across very optimistic and I think knowing the
[42:43.700 --> 42:48.620]  truth and what to do and offering them something else is a reason for for
[42:48.620 --> 42:55.700]  optimism but my point about us being over the cliff means that I don't work
[42:55.700 --> 42:58.900]  on the assumption that all of a sudden there's going to be an agreement in
[42:58.900 --> 43:03.580]  December or January and they're going to solve spending and deficit problems in
[43:03.580 --> 43:08.980]  the entire now that's that's not going to happen so so we're over the cliff in
[43:08.980 --> 43:13.780]  that sense and we're falling off we just don't know the entire consequences of
[43:13.780 --> 43:20.820]  this so I see the consequence being that there will be more and more debt more
[43:20.820 --> 43:25.500]  and more inflation the money will finally come out and start getting up the
[43:25.500 --> 43:30.980]  price is even even more so and today I wrote a little thing commenting on the
[43:30.980 --> 43:35.740]  Germans wanting to get their gold holdings out of the Fed holdings up
[43:35.740 --> 43:41.060]  in New York and I said maybe this is the crack in the themes where they're
[43:41.060 --> 43:47.180]  losing confidence of the supremacy of the dollar as well as the supremacy of
[43:47.180 --> 43:51.380]  our political system you know we went through depressions we went through
[43:51.380 --> 43:56.900]  world wars and we always came out with on top you know people said and they
[43:56.900 --> 44:02.180]  even now I mean we're still on top in the sense that when they have a crisis
[44:02.180 --> 44:07.380]  day in the markets people will still buy those stupid government bonds you know
[44:07.380 --> 44:11.740]  because they don't know what else to go but I think this idea that the Germans
[44:11.740 --> 44:15.700]  are saying hey do you really have our gold and what if I find out there's gold
[44:15.700 --> 44:19.580]  isn't there what if they decide to go along with our concerns and check and
[44:19.580 --> 44:24.900]  say tell us where our gold is as well and that to me will combine with the
[44:24.900 --> 44:31.020]  recognition that the war that we took upon ourselves the drone war and the
[44:31.020 --> 44:38.060]  unwarranted continuous bombing in this global war on terrorism is going to be
[44:38.060 --> 44:41.980]  something that we can't handle because just having a lot of nukes on submarines
[44:41.980 --> 44:47.100]  can't solve those problems and if we get weakened with our dollar and
[44:47.100 --> 44:53.460]  financially I think we'll be a paper tiger militarily and then I see what
[44:53.460 --> 44:58.900]  would happen that is a movement for all these all the countries that we have be
[44:58.900 --> 45:05.940]  little and badgered and and you know on they're going to love to come piling on
[45:05.940 --> 45:10.580]  us and it'll be interesting to see if the next year or two this whole thing
[45:10.580 --> 45:16.380]  about what Germany's talking about might not be in the opening salvo on an
[45:16.380 --> 45:20.780]  international pack on our dollar and congressman as you know there's a bunch
[45:20.780 --> 45:24.020]  of other countries a lot of Latin American countries led by Venezuela
[45:24.020 --> 45:28.260]  that are pulling their gold out of England out of the euro out of the US as
[45:28.260 --> 45:32.660]  well and so we really see the battle lines being drawn we see the Chinese
[45:32.660 --> 45:38.420]  trying to get away from treasuries and then here at home we did a national
[45:38.420 --> 45:43.060]  Harris poll for info wars calm that just came out yesterday scientific poll
[45:43.060 --> 45:48.060]  35% of Americans would accept the electric shock bracelets that the TSA
[45:48.060 --> 45:51.540]  actually with Homeland Security two years ago looked at adopting where we
[45:51.540 --> 45:57.140]  all wear taser bracelets that way we're all safe I'm not joking folks and also
[45:57.140 --> 46:02.020]  30% or nearly a third in the same Harris poll so they would accept a TSA body
[46:02.020 --> 46:07.180]  cavity search and this is not satire ladies and gentlemen a congressman you
[46:07.180 --> 46:11.820]  yourself have complained of the abuse at their hands and now we've seen other
[46:11.820 --> 46:16.100]  congress people complain of it and it's getting more intense what is your take
[46:16.100 --> 46:20.580]  on the 1.6 billion bullets now being purchased by Homeland Security what is
[46:20.580 --> 46:24.980]  your take on the TSA now on the highways all of this expansion of the
[46:24.980 --> 46:30.140]  police state well it's all preparation they say just in cases of emergency we
[46:30.140 --> 46:35.020]  have to restore order some of them are probably sincere in the sense that we
[46:35.020 --> 46:38.580]  can't control events they can't didn't control events they didn't know when the
[46:38.580 --> 46:43.940]  storm was coming but if it does occur you know they want to order is is what
[46:43.940 --> 46:50.060]  they want they want order and therefore it doesn't prove that they have
[46:50.060 --> 46:53.580]  something absolutely planned on paper is actually what they're going to do and
[46:53.580 --> 46:58.700]  when but they also know the fragility of the system like we know we know it's
[46:58.700 --> 47:05.660]  fragile and we know that whether it's a storm or a financial crisis that people
[47:05.660 --> 47:10.660]  people are gonna unruly and and my argument is that it is a moral issue
[47:10.660 --> 47:16.860]  but there's a lot of morality that needs to be taught because people who give
[47:16.860 --> 47:22.620]  out government services are they believe themselves to be very moral just like
[47:22.620 --> 47:26.900]  you know the sub on the street he doesn't necessarily lay awake at night for
[47:26.900 --> 47:31.380]  what he has done wrong but I think as the government breaks down and can't
[47:31.380 --> 47:37.220]  provide the services that in morality will be expanded in with the people and
[47:37.220 --> 47:41.140]  the people say well the government has to do this and now they're not forthcoming
[47:41.140 --> 47:45.740]  so therefore I am going to take what is rightfully my own and I think our enemies
[47:45.740 --> 47:50.260]  know that and they'll say well even though they have pretended that they
[47:50.260 --> 47:54.660]  were going to take care of everybody who needs help they're really there to
[47:54.660 --> 47:59.060]  control them so this is why I think they lay these plans but it is rather scary
[47:59.060 --> 48:03.620]  especially since the founders didn't even want a national police force we
[48:03.620 --> 48:07.700]  shouldn't have any federal agents other than our military to have guns and now
[48:07.700 --> 48:11.260]  we have hundreds of thousands I don't know the exact number I know it's over
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.300]  a hundred thousand federal agents who are carrying guns and that number is
[48:16.300 --> 48:20.340]  going to continue to expand it looks like they have a lot of guns that they're
[48:20.340 --> 48:26.620]  buying a lot of bullets so basically do you agree with the I mean my boil down
[48:26.620 --> 48:31.220]  that if they know the collapse is coming they're digging in for it while
[48:31.220 --> 48:35.180]  telling the public it's bad to basically be a prepper I mean why doesn't
[48:35.180 --> 48:40.380]  government want us to be preppers 11 days without power now in many areas of
[48:40.380 --> 48:43.860]  New York and New Jersey and all government is doing is frustrating the
[48:43.860 --> 48:48.020]  efforts at churches and citizens that did prepare that are actually holding
[48:48.020 --> 48:51.060]  things together and giving their neighbors food some estimates are more
[48:51.060 --> 48:55.460]  than 60% made no preparation there they're just begging the government
[48:55.460 --> 49:00.220]  that's the Obama disaster plan is to have just I guess a can a bucket you
[49:00.220 --> 49:05.380]  beg beg for government handouts from yeah but that'll come going in I don't
[49:05.380 --> 49:11.260]  know if you saw it but this picture should be used by all of us to show it's
[49:11.260 --> 49:16.060]  actually how efficient they are did you see the picture of the FEMA office up
[49:16.060 --> 49:21.180]  in New York if they had the war the storm then and then the northeast and
[49:21.180 --> 49:25.900]  northeastern come in and the snow came in the on the science is FEMA office
[49:25.900 --> 49:32.140]  closed due to weather yes I did see that did you see that thing in fact guys pull
[49:32.140 --> 49:35.420]  it up FEMA office closed due to weather it's all over the place we can show
[49:35.420 --> 49:40.060]  people watching on TV that's something else that is so symbolic of the
[49:40.060 --> 49:44.940]  idiocy and you know people always you know they went after me for having
[49:44.940 --> 49:48.620]  condemned FEMA for so long and voting against it in spite of the fact that I
[49:48.620 --> 49:55.020]  took care of a of a coastal district but I won that argument over with my
[49:55.020 --> 50:00.500]  constituents because I did more to help them get around the bureaucracy and get
[50:00.500 --> 50:04.660]  through the bureaucracy when the police when the or the fans wouldn't allow them
[50:04.660 --> 50:08.980]  to quit and get there probably we would go to bath form so that the people
[50:08.980 --> 50:12.260]  themselves are a little bit further ahead than than the politicians and the
[50:12.260 --> 50:16.460]  media people think we are they are absolutely congressman moving quickly
[50:16.460 --> 50:21.780]  now in the last 10 minutes we have left with you what do you expect Obama to do
[50:21.780 --> 50:25.540]  now that he's got four more years in his in his victory speech he talked about
[50:25.540 --> 50:29.260]  how we're a collective or not individuals very creepy kind of you
[50:29.260 --> 50:33.660]  didn't build it statements again he's got constituents literally that just beg
[50:33.660 --> 50:37.700]  incoherently for their free Obama phones I'm not trying to be mean it's just very
[50:37.700 --> 50:43.380]  very sad but dependency does to people and now they are just racing ahead saying
[50:43.380 --> 50:47.820]  you in gun treating and now dying feinstein it's on record says she
[50:47.820 --> 50:52.700]  physically wants california style not just a ban on sale of semi-autos they
[50:52.700 --> 50:56.380]  want you to turn them in I mean that could cause a civil war congressman
[50:56.380 --> 51:02.700]  people are not turning their guns in that's right and you know politically
[51:02.700 --> 51:06.740]  they do it back off on that you know in the last several presidential elections
[51:06.740 --> 51:12.420]  even this one Obama didn't campaign on stricter gun control that doesn't mean
[51:12.420 --> 51:16.740]  he won't work for him but he knows politically it's not popular and I
[51:16.740 --> 51:22.120]  think those are the you know drawing the lines in the sand if they knock on the
[51:22.120 --> 51:26.580]  door they want your gold once you're done I don't think people are going to
[51:26.580 --> 51:32.300]  give them up but it doesn't put them out of business to harass us they're going
[51:32.300 --> 51:39.860]  to maybe put more limits on buying ammunition you know more taxes on it
[51:39.860 --> 51:43.820]  they're going to make it more difficult for you to sell your gold or use your
[51:43.820 --> 51:50.820]  gold and maybe have 50 70% tax on your gold and they will do this but that'll
[51:50.820 --> 51:56.700]  just drive the underground economy you know to a much greater height but now
[51:56.700 --> 52:00.500]  they're going to they will continue to do that so I don't know how this tree
[52:00.500 --> 52:04.900]  you'll pay an hour I keep always wanting to be you know bit optimistic and say
[52:04.900 --> 52:10.580]  they can't possibly do that that's going against the grain so once again it's
[52:10.580 --> 52:16.620]  going to be up to us to reach people and not reach our hardcore friends I mean
[52:16.620 --> 52:22.180]  that's why we have to reach out to a new audience as well and say that they have
[52:22.180 --> 52:28.220]  to join us in these efforts and that's I'm hopeful for that because we do have
[52:28.220 --> 52:32.540]  the internet you know and and I know they're trying to attack us there but
[52:32.540 --> 52:38.900]  we're still able to get more from me right now we're we're writing high on
[52:38.900 --> 52:45.500]  our internet abilities compared to the three major in the TV right now absolutely
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.340]  are you concerned about the internet kill switch cyber security and all these
[52:49.340 --> 52:54.500]  calls to reinstate the fairness doctrine for talk radio yeah I am concerned
[52:54.500 --> 53:02.380]  but I also hope that technology is so big and so broad that you know that the
[53:02.380 --> 53:06.580]  private market as they would overcome any obstacles so and I don't understand
[53:06.580 --> 53:12.380]  actually how all that work sure I hope I'm not naive to think that people can
[53:12.380 --> 53:16.540]  you know develop their own protection but ultimately the only thing that
[53:16.540 --> 53:22.220]  counts with its guns the golds of the internet or war is to await sure the
[53:22.220 --> 53:26.460]  people to say we're not going to put up with this governments reflect the
[53:26.460 --> 53:29.940]  people sure expanding on that in the limited time we have left going to move
[53:29.940 --> 53:33.380]  quick now congressman because I want to get to several other points here I'm
[53:33.380 --> 53:36.420]  very glad to see that you've taken back over campaign for liberty now that
[53:36.420 --> 53:39.780]  you're not running for president and about to finish up there with Congress
[53:39.780 --> 53:44.220]  so congratulations on that very exciting to see you in there because I know
[53:44.220 --> 53:48.780]  you know like nobody else can drive it right and with all the grassroots what
[53:48.780 --> 53:52.820]  do you make of the Republicans in this new spin that Republicans need to get
[53:52.820 --> 53:58.460]  more socialistic and become the Democratic Party to win when the reason
[53:58.460 --> 54:02.940]  the Republicans have lost in my view is that they've gotten so unconstitutional
[54:02.940 --> 54:08.060]  people are just standing down that's what the numbers show what's your take
[54:08.060 --> 54:11.420]  on this talking point we're seeing that Republicans should just adopt Mao
[54:11.420 --> 54:16.540]  say tongue's views yeah it's just diversion because but where we are in
[54:16.540 --> 54:19.740]  this country today and when we look at our political system we only have one
[54:19.740 --> 54:23.820]  party so we're already there it's just tone and rhetoric is slightly
[54:23.820 --> 54:27.100]  different so yeah they may move a little bit in that direction and what they
[54:27.100 --> 54:33.620]  say has nothing much to do with what they do and that's why you know we have
[54:33.620 --> 54:38.860]  to watch what they do and where they go but going in that direction of course
[54:38.860 --> 54:42.940]  would be the obviously wrong thing and I think it's becoming more clear because
[54:42.940 --> 54:47.420]  we don't know the exact numbers of support that we had in the campaign but
[54:47.420 --> 54:52.940]  it's bigger than they gave us credit for and I keep thinking of those 12 million
[54:52.940 --> 54:56.820]  that refuse to vote some of them maybe a large number of those are sympathetic to
[54:56.820 --> 55:05.380]  us so therefore you know our our numbers outside are significant and I still
[55:05.380 --> 55:10.220]  work on the assumption it it is that attitude that eventually prevails I mean
[55:10.220 --> 55:14.540]  when the attitude is changed in the Soviet system communism you know fell
[55:14.540 --> 55:18.620]  apart because it had no strength left and the people no longer supported it
[55:18.620 --> 55:23.100]  absolutely they can only steal from one group to give it to the other and as it
[55:23.100 --> 55:25.700]  gets clearer and clearer that big government doesn't work it'll finally
[55:25.700 --> 55:28.580]  implode that's what we just got to keep working keep getting the word out
[55:28.580 --> 55:32.860]  congressman is it time for people to apologize to you and my shelf and others
[55:32.860 --> 55:36.620]  were talking about the Bilderberg group and the Davos New World Order crowd
[55:36.620 --> 55:40.820]  because now in the Financial Times of London Reuters AP they say there is a
[55:40.820 --> 55:45.140]  global government technocrats mega bankers they're gonna run the countries
[55:45.140 --> 55:48.660]  they're gonna appoint the leaders they're gonna get us at a fiscal cliff hold
[55:48.660 --> 55:52.580]  this hostage I want to play you a brief clip here from the Kudlow report where
[55:52.580 --> 55:55.860]  they announced were slaves to international bankers here's that clip
[55:55.860 --> 56:01.940]  congressman Paul so mostly what they do is hold summits I think that right now
[56:01.940 --> 56:05.820]  the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want to
[56:05.820 --> 56:10.500]  address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one
[56:10.500 --> 56:15.140]  world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some
[56:15.140 --> 56:19.740]  downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living
[56:19.740 --> 56:23.780]  and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[56:23.780 --> 56:28.940]  that there's a Bernanke pot put and that we won't go any lower than say five
[56:28.940 --> 56:33.700]  percent down from here of course we are there and then all four guests agree
[56:33.700 --> 56:36.980]  we're under world government they're bragging we're under world government but
[56:36.980 --> 56:40.660]  then I hear we're not supposed to talk about it congressman isn't this our
[56:40.660 --> 56:44.500]  strength and not our weakness that we've been right about this instead now
[56:44.500 --> 56:49.820]  we're being told we should not talk about this well obviously they we should talk
[56:49.820 --> 56:52.580]  about the fact that they don't want us to means that we really have to talk
[56:52.580 --> 56:56.420]  about it I've written the speech at hopefully I get enough time to give them
[56:56.420 --> 57:01.780]  a house floor a farewell speech and I listed five major problems that we face
[57:01.780 --> 57:06.500]  and one of those five is international government you know that the fact that
[57:06.500 --> 57:13.740]  it's the UN WTO IMF and and and the World Bank taking over deciding when we go
[57:13.740 --> 57:18.340]  to war and and how to deal with trade bonds the whole works so I would say
[57:18.340 --> 57:21.260]  giving up our national sovereignty it's bad enough that we've given up
[57:21.260 --> 57:25.860]  individuals at state sovereignty to our federal government but I see they giving
[57:25.860 --> 57:30.340]  up of our national sovereignty to internationalism and they claim well
[57:30.340 --> 57:34.700]  they need to WTO to have free trade they need to WTO to protect the powerful
[57:34.700 --> 57:39.100]  trading special interest the internationalist so yes that is a big
[57:39.100 --> 57:43.100]  issue but don't hold your breath on getting your apology because I don't
[57:43.100 --> 57:46.900]  think he's gonna call your Russian balls gonna call you the next week or two
[57:46.900 --> 57:50.620]  absolutely I see it well I got a minute and a half left congressman I hope you
[57:50.620 --> 57:53.780]  can come back again soon I don't want to kill you literally you're making you
[57:53.780 --> 57:59.300]  work so hard but thank you so much for coming on the broadcast in closing we
[57:59.300 --> 58:02.380]  just want to thank you for all you've done and can you talk about also the
[58:02.380 --> 58:06.900]  vindication that they now admit all over the news LA Times you name it that
[58:06.900 --> 58:12.020]  al-Qaeda was put in by the UN and NATO and our government in Libya now in Syria
[58:12.020 --> 58:16.780]  we'll fade the music down for a moment and is now blowing back on us again
[58:16.780 --> 58:20.660]  you're you're comment on that yeah well I shouldn't surprise any of us because I
[58:20.660 --> 58:26.220]  think both you know started and just at the very beginning I made some
[58:26.220 --> 58:30.140]  projections on that and before you knew it the weapons and the support we were
[58:30.140 --> 58:33.940]  given the certain groups were turned against this but it's that but it I
[58:33.940 --> 58:37.420]  don't have to be a genius you don't have to be a genius to figure out very well

[59:48.020 --> 59:58.700]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[59:58.700 --> 01:00:12.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:19.780]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:28.260]  Alex Jones man I tell you Ron Paul talked right into the break there but he
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.500]  had to go that guy worked so hard he was doing an interview while driving he had
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.100]  just arrived at his destination his meeting to go speak to a crowd so he
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:41.380]  had to go but he it was great talking to him you know I didn't push too hard to
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.300]  get Ron Paul on the last six months or so because I knew they were just had him
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:52.100]  all over the place working hard but I also knew that you know he said I want
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.860]  to come on every month but that the messages weren't all getting passed on
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.380]  and I can't blame Ron Paul for that so I was like you know what Ron Paul ever
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.740]  wants to come back on he'll contact us and we got words for Lou Rockwell he
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.980]  liked to come on so it was great and Ron Paul's like hey hadn't been on a while
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:11.700]  hadn't had me on so it was great having him on and he was also saying hey you
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.740]  know you know I heard you know some folks saying that you might not be too
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.380]  happy with some stuff and I meant to get to that so I'll just get to it now here
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.980]  on air as an addendum that will tack on to the video for radio listeners that
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.460]  will post tonight of this because we also stream video of it of your radio
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:32.100]  listener I hold Ron Paul and campaign for liberty to a higher standard because
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:36.420]  because they've always been non-compromise and I've been I've been
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.780]  critical of Jesse Benton and some of his decisions but you can call that arm
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.180]  chair quarterbacking but I've been in there helping the campaign from day one
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:47.020]  for 17 years I mean a Ron Paul's district used to come right up to South
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.020]  Austin and I've been interviewing Ron Paul for 17 years Ron Paul never
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.180]  compromises Ron Paul is a great guy that I totally you know agree with literally
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.460]  on 99% of things but I meant to get to this with him on or off air but I didn't
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.980]  have a chance because we had to go on air and then go off air so since he brought
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.580]  it up to me off air I'll just get it on record here he said yeah a few people
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.180]  you know you know in the campaign stuff said that you know you were being
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.460]  critical because I know that's not true Alex Jones you know he's always been a
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.980]  stalwart supporter and I said yeah let me just be clear Jack Hunter and let's
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.860]  put it on screen wrote articles saying we shouldn't be critical the Bilderberg
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:25.020]  group and it was incindicated columns it was in the Charleston City paper and
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.780]  others clearly pointed at yours truly this year at Bilderberg saying that it
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.540]  was stupid to talk about the New World Order in Bilderberg when they're
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.100]  announcing it Ron Paul's been proven right I've been proven right so that's
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:42.260]  my point and then I'm sure guys like that then go to Ron Paul's who Alex is
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:46.780]  attacking you to drive a wedge so that Ron Paul then thinks I don't like him
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:53.620]  Ron Paul's not stupid Jack okay and listen Jack I understand let's put him
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.140]  on screen I got a photo of him I'm not Jack Hunter's enemy and it's one thing
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:03.860]  of ran wants to go you know meet with the founder of founder of you know a bunch

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.900]  interview and I didn't get to get to one of my final points with him so I'm
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.900]  gonna cover that here in a moment and then get into the latest on the election
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.860]  Obama saying he is coming for your guns he is coming for your electricity he is
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.860]  coming for your cars he is coming for your family he's gonna tell you what
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:05.340]  your kids are gonna eat major cities everywhere from Chicago to Atlanta from
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:10.140]  San Francisco to Trenton New Jersey you name it they're all coming out saying

[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.780]  we're gonna watch what you eat we're gonna control your life I mean this is
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:22.100]  dungeon level prisoner control we're going under with an anti-state and I
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.500]  look at the Obama supporters on average especially the white ones there's
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:32.820]  nothing more chicken-necked than than the they walk with a shuffle they're into
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.660]  their weakness they're into their fawning on the system it is a religion of
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:42.300]  statism and the fact that they're weak and have power through the collective I
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:49.300]  mean I've observed these people these are very sniveling mindless weirdos and
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.620]  but yesterday we opened the phones up for Obama supporters and some called in
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.020]  and said hey Bush was really bad I like Obama and I don't want the neocons in
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:04.540]  again and I get that so some of them had reasonable points others though were
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:08.940]  unbelievable and I meant to do this more often but we're gonna start doing it a
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:12.500]  couple days a week where we we don't screen calls but sometimes I say hey the
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.900]  phones are just open for police officers or the phones are just open for school
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.060]  teachers or we want your take on government health care phones are open
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:29.940]  for medical practitioners RNs nurses doctors things like that the phones are
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:37.900]  open for Obama supporters right now 800 259 92 31 and let me tell you a couple
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:42.780]  of them were reading right off talking points man about your guy lost haha you're
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:50.300]  I mean it was amazing so we need to hear the victory the satisfaction in the
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.420]  voice out there because they're not successful because of themselves in
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:59.060]  their lives it's Obama it's the state it's the government and and
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.020]  conservatives do this when it comes to war they lot of them really get off on
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.100]  shock and awe buildings blowing up watching jets take off aircraft carriers
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.620]  I've talked to business owners liquor stores pizza places restaurants and I'll
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.540]  walk in I've done it so many times and I've talked to people that you know I
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.060]  learned run restaurants liquor stores and I'll say to them but I've asked them
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.300]  in stores as well let me guess what's the most busy time ever you get in here
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:30.420]  and they'll go what holiday and I go no anytime and they'll go well it's got to
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.140]  be a holiday and I'll go think again they'll go a war when there's a war when
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:39.940]  a war starts I'm like that's right because I'd also seen articles about
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:45.300]  liquor sales and food sales the mainline conservative pulls in it's just
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.100]  gallons of alcohol goes home for days effect a lot of conservatives end up
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.260]  not even showing up for work for a few days when a war starts and it is just
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:58.540]  drunken pleasure and then they sit back like it's a football game and whoo and
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:01.980]  cheer you'll see it on the news when like people really enjoyed watching the
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:07.460]  you know the cruise missiles flying it'll show some Iraqi television shots of
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.860]  one flying over and the Iraqis all scared and everybody claps look at them
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.740]  they're scared those those you know what heads all the racist terms and it'll
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:18.300]  and then it'll show like an apartment building boom and the TV station the
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:23.900]  power plant hey the lights are off and Baghdad yeah yeah that's blowing people
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:30.460]  up yeah pretty sick so I want to be fair here you know when you hear the
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:34.820]  satisfaction of a pathetic obama noid you guys are pretty pathetic sometimes
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:39.100]  do you you mainline people think conservatism is having a big global
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.300]  empire and attacking a bunch of countries and putting al-qaeda and Libby
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.020]  in Syria and then put me on having al-qaeda attack the Serbs and then
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:52.100]  forgetting about it later and and and this is the reality is what I'm getting
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:57.460]  it okay and so it's pathetic so it's not just obama noids that are in an
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:07.020]  absolute love affair a deep love affair at every level with the state a lot of
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.140]  mainline Republicans are in love with it in other ways and that's why real
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:14.140]  constitutionalist real libertarians real conservatives in record numbers didn't
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.860]  vote this time it's not because they're stupid they're smart they just couldn't
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.940]  do it they they know it's a lesser of two evils only on one level that Romney
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:27.300]  was worse than others and they couldn't do it but how dare you obama noids call
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.260]  into a show run by one of the you know the chief constitutionalist who does
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:37.540]  deep research and laugh at me like I'm upset that Obama got in because Romney
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:42.940]  didn't I would have been upset if either one got in in different ways and I'm
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.460]  upset about where this country is going I'm upset about our power prices
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:50.380]  exploding I know what that's gonna mean for people on fixed incomes I've got
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:54.740]  family that's on fixed incomes that be that almost was going out with going
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.340]  without food because they were too proud to talk about it or go on welfare and
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.540]  and and and if I wouldn't have helped them they would literally be you know old
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:08.260]  people on dog food you make me sick and it's your love of this big corrupt thing
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:11.340]  that's allowed this to happen and it's gonna get a lot worse and when the power
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:14.860]  price is more than double nationwide the next few years that's a conservative
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.500]  estimate I live in the beta test city it's already doubled the last five they
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.540]  they're in the news I've read it saying get ready for a doubling it's for the
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.740]  earth no it's to squeeze us and shut us down you think we can't compete with all
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.260]  the regulations and health care and government control with China India
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.180]  Mexico and 160 other third world countries or our jobs are all going our
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:38.820]  economy went you think we can't compete now wait till our power prices that's
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.060]  all we had going was the cheap energy and it's going bye-bye the cheap
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.900]  energy is going bye-bye the giant profits for the globalist are here and
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:54.260]  you call me and laugh at me and giggle and say your old precious Obama got in
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:59.980]  you people are dangerous because you're so ignorant and you will have your time
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.780]  socialism will probably fully take over you'll get to see total poverty
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.260]  everywhere I guess misery loves the company and you're victorious you've
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.220]  destroyed us and and conservatives you mainline conservatives you're not
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.740]  conservative you've helped do this as well and so you're just all different
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:23.500]  flavors of the same same deception and but but at least conservatives that are
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:28.060]  mainliner pro-gun anti-abortion at least they realize that freedom and free market
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:33.420]  on the surface is good you see at least they've got that in their mind you
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.300]  Democrats have nothing nothing except maybe on the surface you're
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.340]  understanding a bunch of wars aren't a good idea but then of Obama does it well
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.300]  it's not a war it's a peace action so the globalists have got it all covered
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.540]  both parties get done what they need it looks like there's a difference and it
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.540]  isn't because they're really one big stinking thing that kind of fights with
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.460]  itself over who gets to run things kind of like me and my wife don't tell me of
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.700]  arguments is if we finally get my parents a babysitter something and we're
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:06.660]  gonna you know go out to a movie and we sit out at the computer or iPad to see
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.180]  which movie and I'm like I don't want to see a chick flick I don't want to see a
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:13.620]  chick flick let's go see a science fiction movie she's like no I'm not gonna
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:19.980]  go see one of your science fiction movies and and I'm like but I finally most
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.140]  the time when I take her to what she goes this was actually really good I'm
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.340]  like yeah you you like cloud Atlas didn't you I mean even though it had a
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:30.060]  bunch of messages that probably weren't the best in it I mean the point is is
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:35.380]  that it was overall a good movie I had a lot of good messages to the point is is
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.020]  that this is the type of stuff that goes on and that's about the difference
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.380]  for the Democrats and Republicans I mean when you finally get down to the final
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:48.340]  equation we're gonna go to break and we got Matt Nebraska and Obama lover
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:53.740]  listening on XM 166 we got Dave he loves his king he's listening in
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.220]  Pennsylvania John and Ohio James Kevin everybody we're gonna we're gonna kneel
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.420]  to you right now and you are you are victorious not by your literature not
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:07.100]  by your art not by your inventions not by your strength not by the sweat of your
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:11.700]  brow but by your Obama phone god okay that said I'm not gonna spend any more
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.060]  time on this of the Ron Paul thing it was just turning Ron Paul was on great
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:20.100]  interview I've always loved Ron Paul I blew up one time when callers were
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.500]  calling in after Ron Paul had already stepped out of the race saying oh we
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.940]  got to vote Ron Paul he's still gonna get in and I said I don't want to hear
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:30.620]  about Ron Paul anymore and how he's still gonna win okay the Republicans shut
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.100]  them out that's what happened please I'm tired of the irrational exuberance
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:40.180]  okay and then I criticized Jack Hunter who was one of the head guys with him
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:45.060]  he wrote this article Bilderberg conspiracies have become a handicap for
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.140]  the Liberty Movement I mean that's that's the key that mega offshore banks run
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:52.260]  both parties and and that and that and the Bilderbergs one of their meetings
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.660]  where they meet illegally with Hillary and Obama four years ago we were there
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.340]  covering it this year and he criticized it and said we shouldn't cover it and
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:03.740]  that it's in its kooky right when they're admitting in Europe technocrat
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:07.580]  megabanks are installing leaders they're admitting the megabanks are running
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.580]  agenda 21 they're admitting the megabanks are saying they want our guns
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:15.380]  they want a hundred trillion new tax London Telegraph a hundred trillion new
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:20.980]  global tax raised in carbon taxes here's Bloomberg Cole's election laws could
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:25.500]  mean gain for carbon tax your new 50% taxes on your energy we'll go to that
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.140]  private groups Obama may levy carbon tax cut us deficit we've been conquered by
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:35.820]  foreign banks okay and if we can ever admit we were conquered not
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.100]  militarily that were designed to face but but but by economic corporate
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:44.140]  takeover that's not free market and criminal which they're bra played for
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.500]  Ron Paul CNBC admitting we're in a global government run by private banks
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.900]  and he goes yes but we're not gonna get our apology so all I've said on air is
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:58.540]  hey Jack Hunter Ron Paul's talking about the Bilderberg group 30 years ago
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:05.620]  buddy boy in speeches in his newsletter so don't shit there at campaign for

[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.940]  no particular reason I just think it's good to get him in here so that he
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.580]  could introduce a bunch of special reports we did one of these premiered
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:41.540]  last night on the news we had a caller who called in who said I was a liar
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.380]  Chicago does not restrict guns there is no plan to get our guns and I'm
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:50.820]  completely insane and and Obama has not announced he wants to ban semi-autos and
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.920]  Diane Feinstein said physically take them so we show clips of her clips of
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:02.380]  Holder the quotes it's 22 minutes long and so we'll play that in a couple
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.460]  segments Aaron Dyches will cover some other breaking news and a couple other
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:09.660]  great reports. Jakari Jackson did a great one on foreign news covering CIA drug
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.860]  trafficking but it's got subtitles so I was like hey you're gonna play this
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:16.580]  special report I said well it's in Spanish he goes but it's got subtitles like
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:20.220]  yeah that'll work good for radio it's just funny it's just funny I do the same
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.060]  stuff I was walking around the day when we're in my sunglasses my watch is there
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:28.180]  on your head anyways hey even when you're smart folks you miss the simplest
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.900]  thing that's what we've all got to double check each other in this world just a
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:36.660]  bunch of special reports coming up but let's start I'm gonna try to shut up have
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.260]  the Obama people make their step that you know their comment and then I'll move
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:45.420]  on to the next person because if I go into a long diatribe even refuting them
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:51.220]  I know our audience is informed it's just best to hear the distillated genius
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:57.260]  that is the the Obamanoid so Matt thank you for calling in from Nebraska XM-166
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:02.500]  listener go ahead sir. Hey I'll say I voted for a biologist because there's
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.940]  nobody really else to vote for that mainstream wasn't telling me to vote for
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:12.220]  so and I sent you an article update on show chips about FEMA shelters not
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:15.900]  really existing but the Columbus Nebraska they got approved for a six point
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.780]  nine billion dollar FEMA's FEMA shelter that get all over yeah no I mean
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.700]  basically FEMA shelters are giant barbed wire facilities to lock people up in
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:30.340]  that's why folks showing up at them no food no water no power I covered that
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:34.660]  out of what Associated Press and CBS News in the last hour and then and then
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:37.820]  they hang up signs saying due to bad weather we're gone we're government
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:44.300]  workers we're gonna go spend some paychecks right now so Obama phone so
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:47.500]  you're being sarcastic Matt did you really vote for Obama because the media
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:53.340]  told you to no I voted for Gary Johnson I'm sorry listen listen listen we had
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:57.060]  callers they had the lines burning up people are finding the office lines
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:00.900]  yesterday wanting to get on to refute the Obama people please don't cheat and
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:07.020]  say you're a bomber supporter I want to hear the actual the actual people with
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:11.060]  the satisfaction with the condescension telling us we need to be arrested and
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:16.300]  stuff we need to hear them John and Ohio you're on the air go ahead yeah I am
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:24.500]  been opposing Obama since 2007 as a sinister CI agent a studio Wall Street
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:31.780]  in the military industrial complex whose 99% Republican but uses that kind of
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:37.140]  phony vague populist rhetoric to con his people into thinking that he's
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:43.460]  something other than what he is and I actually think I'm ashamed to admit it
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:49.380]  that this this over wretch is a lesser evil but then Romney who would have
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:53.340]  taken us into World War three a catastrophic war with Iran and then
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:59.340]  with Russia his top enemy is Russia as his own statement and every bit of
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:06.180]  Obama's rabid war mongering support for al-Qaeda to destroy countries and the
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.780]  guys of support he was saying Obama wasn't doing enough in Libya and Syria
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:15.260]  yeah yeah exactly so that's exactly where's the problem you've been calling
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.580]  the show for ten years and and and and run off other places and talk trash
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.700]  about me which I love by the way just get the name right Alex Jones and four
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.500]  stars.com people don't understand the entertainment value and people send me
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.620]  clips of being attacked it's actually a sick indulgence that I've tried to
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.820]  repent of literally that's not reverse psychology folks it's a sickness I have
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:38.780]  but but the issue here is socialism and communism never works John I get
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:43.180]  there's a form of crony capitalism that's absolutely virulent as well but
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:49.060]  communism is a horrible nightmare I hate it I hate the agenda 21 the plastic
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:53.980]  cities they want to cram us in I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it and you
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:59.060]  know what show me where communism and socialism has delivered some volholic
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:05.620]  wonderland that's not exactly the point right now but actually your lies about
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:10.740]  that you know these before forms of communism have been proven absolute
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:16.380]  John Bridge Society Nazi concoctions that's all you commies can say is John
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:19.220]  Birch Nazi I say I don't want government-run healthcare written by

[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:28.380]  Nazi and that's all you got every one of you guys Nazi John Birch I think the
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:31.860]  John Birch Society is an incredible work I think they've documented for 50
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:35.460]  something years exactly what actually happened I think you go watch old film
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:39.660]  stuff of in the 50s and stuff of Welch talking it's like he's a prophet I've
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.100]  never even been to a John Birch meeting but I've sure read their literature you
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:48.540]  think you think that's like some label that scares people away I support the

[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:35.140]  st. Peter don't you call me cuz I can go I owe my soul to the company store that's
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:42.640]  the sharecropper creed worse than slavery I was born one morning when the
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.420]  sun didn't shine they tell you you're free and I walked at the mine but then
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:53.700]  they've got it all set up where it's impossible to ever get ahead and you've
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:57.300]  got to buy everything from the company store you got all by all from Walmart not
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:01.620]  from those Amish those farmers not from that co-op all the talk about
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.820]  environmentalism it's the opposite destroying the environment but saying
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:10.020]  carbon dioxide is evil while cross species genetic engineering toxic waste
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:14.020]  dumping everything else they're doing it's all about land grabbing it's all
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.300]  about power it's all about the criminal syndicates having the moral high ground
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:23.260]  and then these people get indoctrinated in the educational system funded by the
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.820]  big megabanks notice the richest people fund the universities and the more
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:31.060]  educated you are the more communist or socialist you are look at the national
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:37.660]  studies the more educated you are the more you vote Democrat educated now
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:43.540]  now there's a middle class though breakdown you can pull these
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:47.140]  demographics up where Nouveau reach people that are worth millions of
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:51.140]  dollars what poor people think is rich what the elite think of as their enemy
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:55.820]  because they are independent they vote almost exclusively Republican and
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.140]  libertarian because they know how to run things they know how to build things
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:04.180]  they're producers and so we're always stuck between the globalist on top
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:07.220]  people that make a hundred thousand dollars a year and right on up to a
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:11.740]  billion a year in some cases by the ultra-rich that hate competition and
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:17.740]  want consolidation and you talk to socialist and communist and I I mean I
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:20.740]  went to college with them I went to high school with them politically I've been
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:25.020]  to so many events and they'll come right up and say you racist scum shit out of
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:28.580]  here we're gonna beat you up you're like I'm just your videotape in the
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.980]  democratic convention I went to the RNC to this back in LA they go we're gonna
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.100]  punch you in the back of the head when you're not looking you racist scum it's
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.660]  always a white guy you're like there was like some methamphetamine head you
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.660]  know there's some trust fund kid and you're just like you were brought in
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.300]  here by a big foundation weren't you you know this is all bull you're actually
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.420]  just an operative that's right I am an operative we're gonna kill you someday
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:53.020]  I've had them repeatedly tell me that in Austin everywhere and they're just
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:57.140]  criminals the what's sick is when you realize it's not even an ideology with
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.660]  most of them some of them are dumb enough to actually be communist but a lot
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.740]  of them they're just it's just something they say it's just something they push
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:09.100]  and then you've got the poor dumbed-down people that that were never taught how to
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:13.940]  build anything never given an economy because it had been offshored everything's
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.860]  designed to make you dependent and they've grown up you know drinking baby
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.660]  formula that's 75 percent corn syrup have you looked at the baby formulas out
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:28.940]  there the brains are getting smaller physically smaller the cc size of the
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.020]  of the inner skull is the same size genetically like even getting bigger in
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.900]  some cases but the brains little as it doesn't get the fats it needs there's
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:41.140]  not fats in the diet they drink fluoride all day drink aspartame all day and
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:45.020]  they're like these little mindless jellyfish that come in all colors and
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:50.180]  shapes just drooling around shuffling around that's kind of the lower level
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.380]  and above that's kind of a trendy class that shuffles around and the men are
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:57.660]  into acting weak and the women are into acting dominant you'll you'll see a
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.660]  woman who's got like the you know sometimes two or three males trailing
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.860]  behind her that you know the more weak they act the more she pats them on the
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:07.740]  head as she looks around hatefully any strong men that ought to be brought down
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:11.420]  I mean you know it's it's quite a scientific system that's been set up and
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:14.700]  then above that you've got all the other guilds and you've got all the business
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.500]  people that just think they're gonna get ahead by not caring about anybody else
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:23.140]  but themselves and it's just a big wicked nightmare mess all scientifically
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:27.500]  engineered dumbing the culture down attacking the family poisoning the food
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:34.740]  and water oh I'm sorry let's go back to more Obama people who's up next we've
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:40.380]  got Dave in Pennsylvania an Obama supporter then Kevin James Ben Zeke and
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:44.020]  others Dave please enlighten me about our Lord and Savior I don't be
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:48.820]  blasphemous our King Obama he's now been called that by Democrats in posters
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:52.460]  insides and shirts I thought it was a joke at first it's real he is now the
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:58.700]  Caesar the King the well he was called the Christ four years ago the some of
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:03.300]  the churches were so I tell us to tell us Dave about your great victory yes
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:09.300]  Alex are you genuflecting right now yes I am okay thank you sir well you put
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:13.300]  out the call and I just wanted to let you know that yes I did I did vote for
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:18.340]  Mr. Obama and and on the way up to the polling place I saw all the people with
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:22.060]  their Romney hats and you know with their bumper stickers and stuff and I just
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:27.820]  smiled and waved and I said yes I can and yes we can and yes I did I did vote
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:35.140]  for our Lord and Savior Mr. Obama good and I mean tell me why you did that
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:42.380]  well two reasons the first one was I've been a big Ron Paul supporter for over
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:47.660]  20 years I knew him before he hit the mainstream and I've seen how the
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:52.060]  Republican Party and the neocons have have treated him all these years you
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:56.700]  know especially at the end they shut him out of the convention and I was just
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:01.740]  well it's going to be a protest vote I was tired of the shot hand of these the
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.460]  Glenbecks the Rush Limbaugh taking over the Tea Party and claiming it was
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:09.980]  theirs so I said okay are you neocons it's like throwing holy water on a
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:14.620]  vampire I'm going to drive a stake through your heart me and a lot of my
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:17.900]  wrongful friends here in Pennsylvania we did the same thing we voted for the
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:23.740]  Kenyan with a smile good so your idea is make things worse as possible let's get
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:28.060]  this thing on by the way if you're a TV viewer we found an amazing candid shot
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:33.020]  of Janet Napolitano that was taken inside the Justice Department and you
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.100]  could see all the Justice Department criminal lawyers and scammers and
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.300]  globalist terrorists and Oklahoma City bombing masterminds come there bowing
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:48.380]  down behind her and to here you can see the American people kneeling to her if
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:53.260]  you're not a TV viewer and there she is laying another TSA agent anything else
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:59.060]  sir well Alex and hey thank you for having Dr. Paul on but but I wish you
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.940]  would ask them you know one question about about his campaign and how it
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:05.900]  ended and sort of with a whimper not with a bang because I thought he was going
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:09.620]  to go to the convention and you know raise raise the roof a little bit and
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:13.580]  he's sort of like he did four years ago just kind of like just stopped it and I
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.820]  mean I know I listen to your show after after this happened and I just wish you
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.860]  would ask them that question said you left a lot of supporters sort of you
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:23.980]  know hanging hanging out to dry well here's I mean look do you want to know
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:28.820]  what happened go ahead and punch me back up guys what happened is Ron Paul has a
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:33.740]  mission to try to have the idea of liberty and freedom and small government
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.140]  that this made this country so great out there with the young people and to get on
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:43.100]  television as much as he could so when things collapse people have an
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.700]  alternative you see they're telling Republicans right now the talking point
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:53.740]  is get even more socialist endorse abortion get rid of marriage and all
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.940]  these other things this is what you're hearing now from the talk shows and then
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:01.260]  the Democrats will vote for us no you know they become Stalin you've got to
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:10.220]  become you know Mao say tongue and then it just moves on down the line true
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:14.100]  libertarians which they admit would have won the election for Romney stood down
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:18.220]  because they're done playing games with the neocons the Republic this is the
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:24.060]  truth the Republican Party is over if it doesn't get constitutional the minute
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.340]  the Republican Party kicked out the globalist special interest that run it
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:32.180]  same as run the Democrats and really went with the constitutional system and a
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:36.500]  constitutional idea people would line up even people that one way or another
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.300]  government contracts and they would take less for a while just to get rid of
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.620]  this cancer and I've looked at the numbers the actuaries it's an overwhelming
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:48.060]  win then you got to get through the electronic voting machine fraud the
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:51.540]  problem is that the Republicans are bought and paid for at the top by the
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:56.900]  same globalist so they're taking us down the road so the libertarians said well
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:00.380]  let's just go ahead and let it get really really bad and hope that it's kind
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:06.540]  of like a fever wakes enough people up and so you know the the deals were made
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:11.060]  that if Ron Paul didn't go to Paul fast that the people set up and that if and
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:14.380]  that if he didn't attack and disrupt things too much that ran would get the
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.900]  speaking slot and then the Republicans would work with him and maybe he can be
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:24.300]  president someday and and and that's basically what happened and I think
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.540]  Rand Paul's a good guy overall I don't think that was the daring strategy I
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:34.980]  think it was a stratagem not a strategy and I don't like stratagems I go with
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:39.220]  strategy not stratagem and people know the difference of that you can look at
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:44.060]  the definitions but a stratagem generally you know has some cloak and dagger in it
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:48.700]  or let's just say things that are a bit untoward but you can spin it in your mind
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.820]  and say it's not and I don't I have some proof of that I know some of the back
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:57.420]  room stuff Ron Paul wasn't really even overall part of it he just said okay I'll
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:01.820]  just go forward and you know Rand was promised a lot more than he's actually
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.740]  gonna get to and then you notice that all the little guys like Jesse Benton
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.300]  others who smart enough to marry into the family so you marry in then it really
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:12.620]  becomes a problem to kick people out but Ron Paul has pushed a bunch of those
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.820]  guys on the side now really they already jumped ship into the Republican bosom
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:20.100]  and he's come back in to run himself and that's what that call from Ron Paul
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:24.140]  through the great patriot Lou Rockwell hey Ron Paul wants to come on that's
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.500]  that was about let's just get it all out in the open because I said you know like
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.380]  six months ago I said just don't try to get Ron Paul anymore they ever want to
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:34.020]  come on again they'll call us and then I like Ron Paul I know he's for real I
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:39.380]  know you can argue the socialist view and it sounds good but it could do some
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.500]  good for a little while but it always becomes the greatest evil it's like the
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:47.220]  ring of Mordor libertarian constitutionalism rugged individualism
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:51.940]  that's the way to go the eugenicists want socialism to control people they
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:56.940]  want socialism to dominate and take control of you not to lift you up okay
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:03.900]  if angels were dispensing socialism it still would probably create a problem
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.580]  down the road look if you go to the park and feed the squirrels and feed the
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:12.820]  pigeons they're gonna overproduce and sit there and not do any work if you feed
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.260]  the bears they start coming into camp and don't know how to get food for
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:22.820]  themselves anymore and they don't like how how how you know bugs and carrion
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.220]  and mushrooms taste anymore and they start breaking in your house and they
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:30.300]  start killing you you know if you get in their way when they're ripping up in
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:35.380]  your refrigerator and it's the same thing this is what made Rome fall and so
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:39.100]  all the socialists have got their reasons low-level socialists how they
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:43.420]  imagine they would divvy up all the goods and and how government programs
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.660]  would would build things and to a certain extent if it's raw infrastructure
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:50.580]  yeah it actually works but then even that becomes corrupt and then they use
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:56.020]  the infrastructure as a control grid you know it's like anything anything you
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:01.460]  build with the ring of Mordor any victory you have will end up it's like
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.820]  the old legends of genies I don't really believe in genies but I'm you know
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:07.780]  it's the parable if you read you know the old Arabic things about genies if you
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:13.780]  ask a genie for a ton of gold first say in front of me 20 feet I want a ton of
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:18.780]  gold placed and then I and then as part of that you are to swear to never do me
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:23.140]  harm and or have anyone else do me harm it's like a legalese you understand you
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:28.940]  don't you get the lamp or the ring of power okay you can't use the ring of
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:34.020]  power do you understand that because anything you do you ask for the ton of
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:38.180]  gold what does the genie do it's always going to be more sophisticated and devious
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:42.260]  than you can be because it's it's ageless it will figure out a way to
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:46.980]  destroy you with what you get do you understand that you understand you cannot
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:53.780]  use the you cannot use the lamp you cannot use the ring of power because it
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:58.500]  comes from a source of evil it will come back and bite you in the butt
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:05.420]  understand it's the Faustian riddle you can make the deal you can make the deal
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:08.620]  with the devil and you could have always gotten out of it by repenting the
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:13.300]  devil's lie is that it's always too late when it's never too late you understand
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.820]  you don't believe in God I'm not good and evil here folks right and wrong you
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.420]  tricked yourself Faust could have been free at any time by saying I don't want
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.940]  what you've got to offer I'm done but he believed he was trapped and people
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:29.580]  believe that the power they innately feel well if I just had some magic thing
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:33.460]  if I just served evil I just did something bad then it would prove myself
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:39.580]  and then evil would give me power evil will only give you destruction the any
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:45.460]  temporal power you get is a curse many of you'll never understand it I don't
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:50.340]  know does it matter Kevin in Illinois you're on the air welcome thanks Alex
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:55.740]  for having me on just wanted to just ask you a question you know you criticize
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:47:01.980]  people who voted for Obama and so I don't know are you are you trying to
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:06.380]  say that you support Romney that look here's the deal we had three callers
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:11.140]  who weren't really Obama supporters yesterday this is happening again today
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:16.620]  maybe you are really one but I mean you you've got to be smart enough you sound
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:20.140]  like you're smart just hearing a few words out of your mouth try to explain
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:23.420]  this it's like if you went to a car dealership and he said you can have this
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:28.380]  gremlin or you can have this you can have this pacer or or you can have this
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:32.260]  you know whatever the case is junker you're like you know what I don't like
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:37.020]  the price on these I think I'll go to another dealership you see Romney would
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.340]  have been one sack of destruction and Obama would have been another but
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:46.300]  Obama openly is diametrically opposed to the principles that made this country
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:51.120]  great so the fact that people are raw rying him is very disconcerting like
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:55.180]  Ron Paul said who didn't endorse Romney that the fact that they rejected it
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:59.420]  though even his rhetoric and our wanting socialism and free goodies and we went
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:04.300]  out and talked to him articulate people that said you know I think we should give
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:08.020]  some goodies to people and and and and you know one one liberal patronized
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:11.460]  David Ortiz because he's Hispanic and said it was a black guy and he goes and
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.460]  I think we should help the Hispanics a little more and I'm you're gonna get
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.820]  some and you're gonna get something like David Ortiz has worked for a TV station
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:22.100]  he's worked in sales he has skills he's well-spoken he's a good researcher he's
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:26.660]  here not because he's Hispanic but because he is a dynamic intelligent good
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:31.020]  reporter who does his research jacari Jackson isn't here because he's black
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:35.900]  he's here because he's smart and dynamic and got a great voice and it's the same
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:40.100]  with all the reporters we've got here that Derrimick brains not here because
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:45.740]  he's Irish I'm not here because I'm whatever I am I'm here because I want
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:50.980]  freedom and don't you understand it's watching you idiot celebrate about
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:54.460]  Obama running around with your tongues hanging out like it's you just won the
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:59.180]  lottery when I know how evil Obama is it makes me sick don't you understand that
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.980]  go ahead make your point tell me how great Obama is you know it's one of
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:07.860]  the things where I don't think he's I just think he's a better choice at this
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:12.220]  point and there are a lot of reasons are if you look at Bush Jr. before him two
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:17.500]  terms you know we NDA all that stuff was already there and the same globalist
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:23.940]  that Obama is a puppet Bush was a puppet I understand that but but and see
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:28.500]  Obama supporter like you I can kind of get what you're saying okay but you
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.740]  think it's better because of the warmongering and that's the one point I
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:34.380]  get you're articulate the people that call us are giggling and saying I'm
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.700]  upset because my guy lost what you kind of started with I just don't know how
[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:43.260]  to communicate with you it's not that it's that the system is selling Obama
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.820]  and he's so bad I mean do you really think big government socialism works
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:55.500]  buddy I don't think it's socialism at all okay okay more than half the
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:58.820]  American people that actually produce have their have their wealth taken more
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:04.660]  than half of it trying to pump up the economy socialism how is it when the
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:09.380]  bank bailouts you talk about all the time they paid that back actually they
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:13.860]  didn't that's a fraudulent news report they took stuff at zero interest and
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.900]  only part of it was that they had three different ways to get money the open
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:21.900]  window the rest of it and they paid some of it back and they were able to loan
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.100]  it out at 10 20 30 percent interest and make giant profits and then pay it back
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.300]  years later and they ordered a lot of the banks to take the money how was the
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.660]  government doing that you know it's like 40 something trillion that the mega
[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.820]  banks got not the 876 billion you were told about you understand they play
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:42.980]  games sir like Obama saying he wouldn't sign the NDAA and then he did and it
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:47.820]  turned out his people wrote it I mean you know that's admitted now right
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:54.780]  no huh that's it for next week I want to take his call and show all the
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:59.540]  admissions where Obama's people wrote it we'll be back with more you guys

[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:42.020]  that was great man that was great stuff you were doing let's see here it's more
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:46.460]  like what Obama it's more like a starvation and Romney I'm seeing World
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:50.700]  War three that's what I'm I don't know that's the only argument that I think is
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:54.940]  fair that Romney was licking his lips talking about war with Russia and stuff
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.460]  that not very expanding with things yeah that but don't worry Obama's still
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:07.380]  gonna do that too and some of my other talking points here I mean he's more
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:12.980]  pro cannabis medical cannabis Obama we said I would actually on the surface he
[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:16.500]  is see the that's what I'm saying about the NDAA he said he was against it while
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.140]  his people wrote it to make sure we get past he said he would veto it so there
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:25.220]  wouldn't be opposition he's a bit he is slicker than Romney and that's what
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:30.420]  I'm telling you is he stabs you in the back Obama tripled raids in states you
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.420]  can look this up I've had the act of a song that's who a medical dispensaries
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:38.660]  and things that were legal under state law than what Bush did you're gravely
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:42.740]  mistaken about Obama and the cannabis thing he lied and said he would stop
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:49.620]  raids did raids in states that decriminalize stop under Obama okay we
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.620]  disagree on that point there's a certain extent I understand where you're coming
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:59.660]  from but no it's a fact it's a fact well it may be factual also I'm in the
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:03.700]  abortion issue Solomon even said in scripture it's better for those who were

[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:09.820]  system lied to you but but a lot of women that do it and men once they do it
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:13.020]  they're always going to defend it because you can't admit it's wrong now
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.860]  they're saying let's kill babies up to age three they're saying kill old people
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:20.180]  this is part of eugenics okay so it you know Gloria Steinem saying I had an
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:23.180]  abortion I'm proud of it it's sexy to have an abortion you can pull those
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:27.620]  photos and articles up it's sick they're teaching you to hate life look at what's
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:32.500]  on television all these shows saying kids are bad families are gross messages
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.740]  about government healthcare being good in the shows it's anti-human so you
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:41.820]  stand down and die okay can't you get that through your head can't you have
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:47.620]  mercy on the kid they use that example of rape have mercy on that kid have
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:54.300]  mercy on them have mercy have mercy and then it's another thing even if it's in
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:58.140]  the first trimester my god suck it and third ladies and gentlemen I've gone
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:03.580]  and I've watched it okay and listen I grew up pretty wild when I was there and
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:06.820]  I didn't know till I was older that girlfriends would go off and have
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:10.620]  abortions my god I'm guilty of this not consciously but I feel guilty every
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:14.140]  minute about it they were telling me about some TV show where the guys haunted
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:19.340]  by it I that must be a pop a common thing as I'm haunted by it every day if I
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.540]  drive by an abortion clinic folks I shake it's the only thing makes me shake I
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:27.660]  just can't believe it because I look at my three children now and I would kill
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.980]  if a hundred men I guarantee you were armed I'd probably kill 15 of them
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:35.860]  before they got me I mean I would fight like a savage wolf for my children I
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:39.340]  know it because I've been a lot of fights I know what I fight like just when I
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:43.260]  was fighting just to show people I wouldn't a wimp I guarantee you folks I
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:47.180]  could climb over people rip their heads off if I had to for my children and back
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.740]  when I was a stupid teenager what you had an abortion well I didn't say that was
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:03:01.220]  okay but that doesn't sound too good as I got older I realized my god and I've
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:06.460]  never talked about that on air I'm gonna do a piece about it like my son's even
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:11.020]  here today I just can't handle it anymore and I hear the people get all
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.180]  excited about their right and glorious time and how fun it is to have an

[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:36.880]  amazing caller thinks he's working for the system through Obama he's got the
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:41.900]  power at TSA you've seen those clips over the years those crazy TSA workers
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:46.180]  not all of them of course but the ones who are on a real power trip saying I've
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:49.780]  got power I've got do you have power Alex he's just called in if you just
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:53.380]  tuned in and said he's gonna make me bend over and he's gonna beat me and all
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:57.420]  this stuff but anyways take some more of these Obama supporters we've got the big
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:02.060]  report with yourself David Knight and myself with that caller from yesterday
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:06.060]  where we totally document everything we said when he said Obama doesn't want our
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:09.980]  guns and that Chicago hasn't banned people's guns that's coming up at the
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:14.660]  bottom of the hour you got a bunch of key carbon tax news at the proof of how
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:17.740]  it's meant to shut things down I'm gonna quit bugging you but great job since
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:21.980]  you were talking about the TSA going I have power I have power and they take
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:24.940]  their clothes off and run around and announce their God that's happened a
[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:29.140]  bunch we're not joking these are insane nobodies that want to grab your wife's
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:34.580]  genitals all day and they are just pawns in the state system but why who has
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:39.220]  power what is this power about we are in a fight over the power monopoly as they
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:43.700]  try to centralize everything that's why this gun thing is so important that's
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:47.980]  why the carbon taxes are so important they're controlling food so Bill Gates
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:52.340]  in Monsanto can reap profits worldwide and force you onto their centralized
[02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:56.860]  poisoned foods while they talk up organics and and getting kids on healthy
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:10:01.100]  lunches even though they admit in the Daily Mail that school kids eat a lunch
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:05.860]  worse than prisoners they analyze the actual nutritional value so we've got
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:11.380]  the big gun report coming up here's a quote that'll just lead into it in 2001
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:16.740]  during the UN gun debate it was at Kings College a UN spokesperson said quote
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:23.140]  civilian ownership of firearms in the US threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.220]  of the state that's the whole reason we have the Second Amendment right there
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:32.060]  the founding fathers understood tyranny is natural anyone who gravitates
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:38.220]  towards power wants to control everyone and genocide depopulation deed just
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:42.220]  legitimizing your own right to run your life it's natural to anyone
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:46.820]  gravitating towards power the whole reason we try to balance power with
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:51.060]  individual rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights the second among them
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:54.420]  right after free speech and the right to speak your mind and have your own
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:59.140]  religion the right to bear arms shall not be infringed now you've got the
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:03.540]  Obama administration the Clintonites the United Nations people all trying to
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:07.220]  disarm us not because they're going to keep us safe they can't that's the
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:11.300]  illusion this TSA caller they can't keep us safe they have never caught a
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:15.340]  terrorist the TSA has never stopped anyone they let the underwear bomber on
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:19.540]  the plane they let the 9-11 hijackers through because they were ordered to it's
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:23.180]  a corrupt system they can't and won't protect you look at what's going on with
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:26.860]  FEMA right now that's why we have to protect ourselves and the biggest way
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:30.780]  to protect ourselves is to keep the state from having a total monopoly of
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:34.820]  power you've got to have separation of powers I'm sure a lot of the Obamanoids
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.060]  are not having that but let's hear are there any other Obama supporters on the
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:43.420]  line we have a Zeke in California what do you have to say Zeke yes that would be
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:49.500]  me are you in fact an Obama supporter oh yeah absolutely in terms of the
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:55.860]  duck the dynamic of the spectrum there I have to go with Obama on the spread
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:12:01.500]  out initially I am I'm really a Ron Paul guy a Ron Paul kind of a guy but then
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:06.460]  when we deal with the Mitt Romney you know I think he's more of a rhino we for
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:09.540]  those of us that know that's the Republican and name only type of
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:12.660]  situation well there's no doubt about that but how do you go from Ron Paul to
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:19.180]  Obama yeah but it's the global body politic that I'm looking at you know
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:23.700]  I'm looking at the face of the world the face of the United States someone who
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:30.660]  is actually have some elements left for being a sound individual and a real
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:35.500]  individual but I can even shake it up even more also supported Bush against
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:41.020]  Kerry you know because I don't hold Bush you know responsible for all the stuff
[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:45.580]  they try to throw on him same thing I don't think it's fair to throw all this
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:50.220]  stuff on Obama either because we know it goes beyond Bush beyond Obama to their
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:55.260]  predecessors and then many grandparents ago when they said I'm sorry what about
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:58.540]  the system itself that's being collectivized you keep identifying with
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:02.500]  political faces we get over the years it doesn't make sense we have to break out
[02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:06.900]  from the system we keep endorsing it when we vote for people like Obama Bush
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:10.500]  you name it they're only concentrating power I mean do you don't you don't see
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:16.740]  that check this out I would say this because it's almost like acclimating a
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:21.340]  fish into another fish tank if you get a fish from this from the fish store
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:25.020]  or whatever you got a you know floated in the bag and the other tank for a
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:28.180]  minute before you get dumping in there to get the temperatures and everything
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:32.820]  organized correctly I think if we were to automatically just like jump up and
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:37.460]  wake up tomorrow and it'd be just like a romp all environment people aren't
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:43.460]  maybe haven't been aren't ready to take on that responsibility yet there's a lot
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:46.340]  of truth that needs to circulate there's a lot of things that people need to
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:50.180]  why did you support Obama I mean that's that's why we're taking calls here how
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:53.100]  did you come to vote for Obama what do you think is going to do that is
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:58.020]  anything short of horrible yeah it's more of a real person because I think
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:01.740]  if we have somebody there that's that's a more of a real person I think the
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:07.380]  inner city does tie in into the global body politic to where you have someone
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:12.900]  who can identify with the inner city same way as yourself Alex Jones how you
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:18.820]  you all understand there's a certain group of individuals who are not inner
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:23.100]  city folk who understand what's going on within the inner cities and how things
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:28.860]  have been unfairly there's been a major attack and then not just on the inner
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:33.420]  city but they're just the country as a whole but fortunately the other side of
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:38.980]  dynamic has been waking up on these past few years with the patriot movement you
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:43.340]  know I found out about Ron Paul through Aaron Russo I was working with Aaron Russo
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:46.780]  when he brought the American freedom to fascism help get that out in the land and
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:51.380]  everything like that I thank you for your call of course Ron Paul has tried to
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:55.700]  advance the Liberty movement return us to the Constitution Aaron Russo the late
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:59.780]  great Aaron Russo had a great documentary exposing how the Federal Reserve has
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:04.060]  captured this nation and those are the real issues identifying with Obama is
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:08.140]  not going to get us anywhere identifying with Bush Romney there's not much to
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:12.460]  identify with we are captured by a system which is moving towards total
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:15.900]  collectivism I don't know if you understand that but you've got to start
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:21.140]  to these dependent inner city wards are not going to ever get freedom we want
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:26.460]  freedom for people who are you know minorities who can't make ends meet in
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.660]  cities and people who are losing everything under this economic
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:33.620]  implosion you understand they're centralizing the energy controls they're
[02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:39.260]  using these EPA regulations the new announced move on carbon taxes so that
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:44.420]  the crony capitalist the corporates who run the global structure can profit off
[02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:48.580]  of it you've got to understand this look at what happened with and run the game
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:52.780]  the system in California so they could artificially shut down the supplies
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:57.300]  jack-up electricity rates and they're still doing it all these big banks are
[02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:02.380]  just last week in the Daily Mail you had Barclays traders who admittedly rigged
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:07.020]  American electricity prices to boost their own profits and bragged about it
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:11.580]  in damning emails and they list some of those emails this happens over and over
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:16.060]  again and look back a couple years to the whole carbon tax debate it almost
[02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:19.700]  passed through Congress now Obama is going to give it another go if he
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:22.660]  doesn't do it through the congressional system he's going to do it through
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:26.460]  executive fiat through these new EPA regulations that they've been boiling
[02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:30.460]  over and everything else and what are they doing they're just gaming the
[02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:34.860]  system to force you on to the alternatives so they can extort you so
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:39.020]  they can put you into an austerity mode and charge you more for less and they'll
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:43.540]  convince you through all this green propaganda environmentalism nonsense to
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:47.620]  get onto the system where they're allowed to control everything you do look at
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:51.980]  agenda 21 Mari strong the biggest figure behind it preaching this
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:55.780]  environmentalism how it needs to take over everywhere yeah you want to look
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:00.260]  up his actual record he's involved in stealing water rights in entire states
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:05.860]  in Southwest he's taking over dams from other companies who control them so he
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:09.860]  can make profits off of them while telling you you need to do less I'm
[02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:12.620]  going to rant about this some more but let's take another call do we have an
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:17.380]  Obama supporter in Nebraska Scott are you there
[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:23.260]  hello I'm here can you hear me yes we want to know if you voted for Obama I
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:30.340]  definitely did I had to you had to my predicament I'm my back is phase two
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:34.740]  I've had four injuries on the workforces for you know as the economy
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:40.460]  continues to implode you end up doing jobs that you didn't need to do and three
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:45.660]  injuries in a car accident my fault and then two injuries in the army I've been
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:49.100]  fighting the VA for two and a half years to get some kind of compensation I
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:55.340]  can't get I haven't paid the taxes on my house for a year year and a half and it's
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:59.340]  gonna go up for auction in the spring sometime if I can't find the money or
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:06.340]  the VA doesn't come through solve your problem sir well well the Republicans
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:10.220]  just basically used me up you know if you look at the difference between Romney
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:14.540]  and Obama Romney wanted to start giving all the money back to the military
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:19.140]  industrial complex to keep the wars going and at least got a Democrat in
[02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:23.060]  there that will help the people that need to help because they're not helping
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:27.020]  anyone it's a two-headed beast did you not hear me talking about how it's a
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:31.900]  corporate controlled a crony capitalist system they game and force everyone on
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:35.740]  the system so that they have the insider deals to profit off of it what
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:40.540]  don't you get they may distribute the money from those corporate deals do you
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:43.220]  know who is Secretary of the Treasury are do you know who they're
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:47.180]  considering as putting in the Secretary of Treasury for Obama do you know who
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:51.100]  these people are what they've been involved in do you understand they
[02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:55.140]  created the economic crisis they deliberately created that bubble and
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:59.380]  popped it bet on both sides so they could rake billions and billions off of
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:03.940]  it trillions even as they starved us out do you not understand that well I
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:09.060]  understand that but I don't have a choice because if I went the other way the
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:13.180]  Republicans in an order to qualify for any kind of financial support in this
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:17.220]  state you can't live off that small amount of money I mean I really don't

[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:22.780]  the info wars nightly news we had great unprecedented broadcast with all our new
[02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:26.900]  reporters covering the important issues breaking it down but I want to reach out
[02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:31.820]  post-election to the Obamanoids who got confused and and lost their minds and
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:35.220]  thought they could help themselves by voting for an authoritarian I want to
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:38.820]  reach out to Romney supporters even the bidder bitter clingers who thought they
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:42.620]  had to hold their nose and vote for someone who at least taught conservative
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:46.980]  this is a power monopoly game that's why they're coming for the guns we're
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:50.980]  breaking that down on the other side of this break a very important second
[02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:55.180]  amendment breakdown of how the Obama administration the Clintanoids the
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:59.060]  globalists the United Nations are all coming after the guns and they said
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:04.740]  that civilian ownership of firearms it threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:08.700]  of the state you bet it does because all throughout history it's a game of
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:13.060]  control and I understand literacy has been broken down understand we have been
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:16.660]  dumbed down but you've got to try to go back and read you've got to look up
[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.780]  history and see how much control through these authoritarians throughout history
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:26.700]  has been about disarming the population starving them out controlling the food
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:31.780]  supply controlling the energy and they're doing it all again how did Stalin
[02:25:31.780 --> 02:25:36.340]  how did Mao depopulate the areas they did it was by withholding the food
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:40.020]  controlling the food supply and by disarming the population that's how they
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:44.260]  lined them up in the pits the Nazis did it as well so did all the other
[02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:49.100]  authoritarian and socialist regimes throughout history it's just simple
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:53.620]  dynamics of controlling the system from the top after you get everyone under one
[02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:57.020]  umbrella and look again at what they're doing with energy you've got to
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:01.940]  understand what is agenda 21 they want to force us into urban population centers
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:06.180]  they say it's sustainable it's the very opposite the more you cram people into
[02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:09.820]  an area where they can't grow their own food where you don't have property rights
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:14.340]  the less sustainable you are you lose all your individual power and give it
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:18.660]  over to the state and will they protect you no because the sustainable council
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:22.620]  under President Clinton that started implementing agenda 21 way back in
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:30.260]  1993 was started by Ken Ron of inlay I'm sorry Ken Ken lay of Enron and other
[02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:34.380]  big power companies it was all so they could control the supply and
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:38.460]  artificially shut it down to jack-up rates while controlling your life more
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:43.220]  and more it's all a monopoly game you've got KKR that's Colbert Kravitz roots
[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:48.060]  very big Bilderberg players Goldman Sachs they did the biggest ever energy buy
[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:54.180]  out here in Texas it's the TXU utility company all over those big coal plants
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:57.580]  knowing that these new regulations were coming why do they do it so they could
[02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:01.620]  saddle those coal plants with debt and rake off the profits now it's in the
[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:07.540]  news just in October that the largest ever energy buyout $45 billion is now
[02:27:07.540 --> 02:27:11.940]  losing $2 billion but the companies on Wall Street who have the insider firms
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:17.220]  they're making $500 million in fees you can see why they'd be interested in
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:21.580]  that again Barclays traders caught in rigging electricity prices this is what's
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:26.060]  coming under carbon and the big monsters the Rockefellers the oil companies
[02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:30.060]  Dutch Royal Shell all the traders on Wall Street the big banks who got the
[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:33.620]  bailouts they're the ones who are going to profit off of the carbon trading
[02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:37.580]  schemes are forcing us on to anyway I don't know if any of the Obamanoids are
[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:41.060]  getting to we have some of them on the air we're about to get to the big gun
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:44.540]  special on the other side but let's see what Kim and Georgia has to say are you
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:47.980]  there yes I am thank you Erin for taking my call
[02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:56.780]  appreciate it do you have your Obama phone no we will actually sort of I'm
[02:27:56.780 --> 02:28:04.420]  I supported Obama and I'll tell you why well let's hear it please they can go
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:10.820]  ahead and pursue their not-so-secret agenda I think that Obama is capable of
[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:16.460]  being the straw that breaks the camel's back he's gonna be the one that
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:20.740]  separates the sheep from the man and I say let's just go ahead and get on with
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:26.180]  the inevitable so you voted for Obama to escalate the collapse and the divides in
[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:30.940]  this country basically switch tell me let's get on with it yeah I don't think
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:34.860]  so I think we need to try to avert that crisis let's learn to help each other
[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:38.460]  let's move towards sustainability the more they crack down on front yard
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:43.580]  gardens or people with chickens and come and mow them down under agenda 21 with
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:48.060]  police escort guns and smoke them out with fire and everything referring to
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:51.780]  that case in Georgia but it happens all over under different guys is the more
[02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:56.060]  we need to move back to the country help our neighbors and start to provide for
[02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:59.740]  each other meanwhile we need to have a big conversation about how much we're
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:03.260]  controlled by those special interests in Washington and those people on Wall
[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:06.840]  Street are getting all the financial fees off of either side of this
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.620]  collective of system that's what's really going on here let's real quick
[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:16.380]  move to Joe in Illinois yeah how you doing hi hi let's hear what you have to
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:21.060]  say about Obama please we got about a minute I supported Obama because Romney
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:25.580]  and Ryan want to cut federal jobs Romney is pro-war he had six sons none of them
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:33.740]  serving in military but I want to ask Alex was he racist Alex is not racist you

[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:27.900]  Aaron Dykes back here at info wars.com in just a moment we are going to prove
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:31.940]  that they are coming to confiscate your guns I've been researching this very
[02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:35.900]  special report with Alex I've been researching with him for over six years
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:39.700]  and I'm really starting to figure this out I hope other people out there are
[02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:43.460]  too and you got to love it somebody calls in when they don't have an argument
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:47.260]  about the system the way we're all game the way they're coming after the entire
[02:33:47.260 --> 02:33:52.700]  population to the basis all you got to throw out racism the state is racist the
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:57.260]  state hates everybody don't you get it the first gun control laws in this
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:01.780]  country were so that black people could not empower themselves on the age of Jim
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:05.420]  Crow under the age of sharecropping so they could keep them on the system to
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:12.220]  pin it subsistence living just enough to play into the larger state power people
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:15.860]  won't talk about the black genocide if you do that's when people start giving
[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:19.580]  you the weird eye no we need to start talking about that about how much the
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:23.860]  system that loves eugenics that loves abortion that loves birth control hates
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:29.420]  black people they've got plans to tie housing and benefits to people not
[02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:33.340]  being allowed to have babies and they will come and induce in some cases in
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:37.780]  these urban centers people into having abortions it's just a scuffle one child
[02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:42.260]  policy Foxcom and their abortuaries in there Alex was saying the China one
[02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:46.140]  child policy and they just saw him there too it happens everywhere it's a
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:50.460]  collectivist model it has a socialist tinge but the fascist tinge is just as
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:53.940]  bad but without further ado let's just get into the gun issue right now
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:57.100]  because it's happening and it's so important let's go to that report are
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:08.660]  we ready yes we are bombarded by messages on television in the culture in
[02:35:08.660 --> 02:35:14.940]  the government-run schools that gun ownership is bad and we see cities like
[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:19.540]  New York and Chicago with total gun bans for the citizens we see states like
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.260]  California New York Illinois with incredibly draconian laws and then we
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:28.100]  see foreign countries run by the globalists where they did the same thing
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:33.820]  first restricts semi-auto then register then ban you can only be at a hunting
[02:35:33.820 --> 02:35:39.620]  club then you can't have your gun at the hunting club it's just totally gone we've
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:43.180]  seen them do this over and over again banning hunting they're always saying
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:46.100]  don't worry you'll have your second amendment but we're gonna restrict your
[02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:51.300]  hunting also implying the second amendment is only about hunting and not
[02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:56.500]  defense against tyranny and defense against the common street thug there
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:01.060]  were a lot of things that the British Imperial troops did that made the
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:04.620]  British citizens get mad and revolt but the final straw at Lexington and
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:11.140]  Concord was the attempt to disarm the firearms and the ammunition and we're
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:18.540]  right back where we started in 1775 1776 here we are and today I opened the
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:24.100]  radio show up to Obama supporters to call in and tell me what they thought
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:28.180]  and they would say oh your man lost when I wasn't even supporting Romney and aha
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:32.740]  or or hey you're crazy we're not trying to take your guns and I'm like well
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:37.460]  Chicago's band guns I don't know anything about that you're crazy so there's that
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:42.380]  always this crazy attitude where they say we're crazy when we point out real
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:47.220]  facts Diane Feinstein Chuckie Schumer they've all called for total gun bans the
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:51.420]  violence policy center Sarah Brady you can go pull up their own publications
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:54.620]  we're gonna go over some of those in a moment with Aaron Dykes where they've
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:58.540]  said this and wherever they're in control they take all the guns I mean for
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:01.500]  heaven's sakes Bloomberg now wants to say what you can eat and drink and what
[02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:04.860]  type of sugar you can have and where you can go and how many people can be in
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:08.140]  your car I mean these are control freaks these are authoritarians this is
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:12.020]  agenda 21 this is turning the whole world into a giant reeducation camp but
[02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:16.300]  before I go to our reporters Aaron Dykes and David Knight going over the
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:20.820]  evidence of the fact that the world corporate oligarchy wants to disarm
[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:24.700]  people that the UN's done it in dozens of countries here are just some articles
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:29.060]  right in front of me Forbes in an analysis of the UN Gun Treaty that
[02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:33.260]  Obama is publicly supporting like he did a few years ago now they probably got
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:37.900]  the votes in the Senate to ratify it and you can go read the UN Treaty here's
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:42.420]  Forbes saying UN agreement should have all gun owners up in arms and act
[02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:45.460]  tougher licensing requirements creating additional bureaucratic red tape for
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.460]  legal firearms ownership confiscated a story all unauthorized
[02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:55.380]  civilian firearms including those that are semi-automatic ban the trade and
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:58.500]  sale of private ownership of semi-automatic weapons any that have
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:01.900]  magazines and it just goes on and on create an international gun registry
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.740]  clearly setting up the stage for full-scale on confiscation in short
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:09.260]  overriding national sovereignty but listen I didn't just believe that I went
[02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:13.820]  in scan through the treaty and we wrote multiple articles here's one by Aaron
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:18.540]  Dykes bombshell leaked UN tree does ban guns and it goes through the subsections
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:22.660]  and links to the UN Treaty so it's not just us claiming it because the callers
[02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:27.180]  like oh something on your site that and no no it's links to the treaty and we
[02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:31.500]  even have the treaty posted on our site below it in case the UN ever pulled it
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:36.900]  I mean look outside the UN in New York that's a civilian citizen 357 Magnum
[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:43.020]  six-shot I've got one of those my dad has that very gun awesome guns that he
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:46.820]  bought from a cop when I was a little kid he gave me one I've been looking at
[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:51.820]  that gun since I was two years old I've got one of the guns that gun beautiful
[02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:58.780]  rose handle I've got that gun I got a 357 right here under my desk excuse me I'm
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:02.980]  starting to rant we need to get this report through quickly here so go to our
[02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:06.780]  article bombshell leaked UN tree does ban guns and we have the footnotes there
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:11.940]  you link through and you read this from UN org and it's the Department of Small
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:16.180]  Arms restriction a unity or where they say civilian ownership of firearms
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:21.140]  threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state they said that back in July
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:26.820]  7th of 2001 and couldn't get it through I mean we've read what the policymakers
[02:39:26.820 --> 02:39:29.340]  who write this come up with and now they're back we're gonna get to that in
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:36.100]  a moment but continuing here is Reuters today after Obama wins US backs new UN
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:40.900]  arms treaty talks and that's disarming third-world countries and after and
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:44.660]  other places so the globalists can come in and mow them down incredible
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:49.420]  remember Obama in the second debate we've got those clips you can pull it up
[02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:52.500]  yourself he said I don't want to just ban semi-automatics that's assault
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:56.860]  rifles I want to ban the handguns well that's what Diane Feinstein has
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:00.460]  introduced last session and says he's gonna introduce in the new session of
[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:03.820]  Congress coming up in about a month and a half after Christmas and I've got those
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:11.620]  articles guys punch up the Google search here just type in gun control type any of
[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:16.020]  those searches in we can punch in my computer this right here and just type
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:22.940]  in Obama assault weapons ban boom literally dozens of articles today look
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:26.340]  right here senator Feinstein looking introduced new assault weapons ban and
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:30.940]  this is what the Sacramento bees reporting today that it's a physical
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:34.540]  ban you not just from sale or new manufacturer they want you to turn them
[02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:41.380]  in that's in the Sacramento be okay oh but oh look at ABC news this is back in
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:48.380]  October boom Obama calls for renewal of assault weapons ban okay I've shown a
[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:52.300]  few of the articles we're gonna go to Aaron and to a David Knight here in a
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:55.900]  moment with other angles and more proof of this and their own quotes that they
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:41:00.140]  want to totally ban our guns because government wants total power over people
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:06.020]  but here's the caller listening to us in Tennessee on WBC our local affiliate
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:11.980]  Knoxville calling in today laughing at us and saying he's never seen any proof
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:17.740]  so we'll go to that clip and here we are but we got it all for you right now
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:25.660]  let's let's go a few excerpts of that call William in Tennessee do you support
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:31.660]  Obama yes I did I do well tell me all about how great it is well to be honest
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:37.460]  with you Alex you know he has not mentioned banning guns and the fire you
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:45.140]  tell me where he has part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban
[02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:48.740]  reintroduced an assault weapons ban reintroduced so I mean you just you
[02:41:48.740 --> 02:41:53.940]  just say I defy you to show you I'm sure have you seen them ban guns in all these
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:42:04.980]  other Western countries well sir you just said it you said the word conspiracy
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:09.460]  theory and that nobody wants our guns are and I guess you're denying that the
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:13.740]  rest of the Democratic Party that they're always calling to ban guns you're
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:17.940]  saying the violence policy center cerebrating big contributors are you
[02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:23.460]  saying Rahm Emanuel didn't say that he wants to restrict our gun ownership and
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:27.500]  that he wants to put us on a no-gun buy list with no judge or no jury are you
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:32.140]  saying that's not true either that is if you are on the no-fly list because you
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:38.660]  are known as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America that
[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:42.180]  is the right thing to take into the election it's the right policy if you're
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:47.780]  on that no-fly list your access to the right to bear arms is canceled are you
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:56.820]  really saying sir sir in the city Obama's from is there a gun ban for the
[02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:03.780]  general population there you go you live in a world of ignorance all you do all
[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:07.060]  you do is say the word conspiracy theory
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:33.340]  okay so I gave you proof we just went to his clip we're gonna give you more proof
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:37.620]  now I mean I've just got stacks of a Chicago Tribune after Obama wins US
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:41.660]  backs new arms treaty talks I was watching CNN during a break today on the
[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:46.540]  radio they're saying they're coming to physically get all the semi-autos the
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:50.820]  ATFs introduced rulemaking to ban most shotguns I mean it's all happening
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:54.420]  Aaron Dykes we've got a move quicker as we got to go back to Mike Adams who's
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:58.380]  waiting in the other studio but break down just in the little bit of a
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:02.740]  re pooling of infos we've already done this research a hundred times what you
[02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:06.260]  think about that caller first of all it is a fact there was an assault weapons
[02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:10.740]  ban signed into quote law under Clinton it lasted 10 years it expired in 2004
[02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:14.860]  under sunset provisions so it's not exactly wacky to suggest it you go to
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:18.340]  Diane Feinstein you just showed how she's reintroducing gun control they're
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:21.820]  gonna document can this in a moment meeting with the FBI and the ATF right
[02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:26.420]  now this week this month on new provisions so here's Diane Feinstein May
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:31.540]  31st 2012 recorded in the Sacramento B voters guide as she's running for Senate
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:35.660]  question what special interests in Washington have too much power she says
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:39.460]  guns I wrote the assault weapons ban that was the law of the land for a
[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:45.540]  decade so she's involved she also brags about how she got the gun ban passed in
[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:51.060]  San Francisco overhand guns despite the fact she has a gun permit a concealed
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:55.460]  carry permit she later melted it down into a cross as a stunt now she is
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:45:00.820]  trying to introduce a new assault weapons ban it's in the market daily news
[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:05.380]  that she wants to ban all assault rifles high-capacity magazines and pistol
[02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:10.380]  grips and also refers to banning the sale of quote weapons in possession that
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:15.340]  means private sales you've got Obama calling for a renewal of assault weapons
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.980]  ban three weeks ago at the debate he says part of it is saying if we can get
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:22.740]  an assault weapons ban reintroduced but the other part is looking at other
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:27.740]  sources of the violence because in Chicago it's not AK-47s they are using
[02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:32.100]  cheap handguns alluding to a handgun ban not surprising since you go back to
[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:37.340]  state senator Obama as a candidate who filled out a voter survey in Illinois
[02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:43.500]  question number 35 do you support the legislation to ban the manufacturer sale
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:48.700]  and possessions of handguns yes ban assault weapons yes mandatory waiting
[02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:52.780]  periods of background checks yes there's a series of bizarre denials where they
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:56.460]  claimed a staffer filled out that survey and that it wasn't Obama despite
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:59.420]  again that's mainstream news reporting on them when they tried to claim they
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:03.180]  hadn't but it came out they had again again they play these games with people
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:07.260]  but it doesn't really matter because the 2003 survey he filled out for the same
[02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:12.500]  group Illinois voters independent independent precinct organization 2003
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:17.660]  running for US Senate he filled out a similar survey question 35 do you
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:21.180]  support the legislation to ban manufacturer sale and possession of
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:25.420]  handguns this time it's not a simple yes it's a whole statement while a complete
[02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:29.700]  ban on handguns is not politically practicable doesn't say he doesn't want
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:33.100]  it says it's not practicable he believes in reasonable restrictions on the sale
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:39.020]  and possession of handguns and the statement goes on he again says yes he
[02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:44.340]  liked to ban assault weapons he says handguns and ammunition I mean giving a
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:48.260]  break it's from Chicago where they've totally disarmed them then you've got
[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:51.860]  his attorney general Eric Holder who again was in the Clinton administration
[02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:57.020]  during the assault weapons ban in 1995 he's on video saying we must brainwash
[02:46:57.020 --> 02:47:01.340]  people against guns quote what we need to do is change the way in which people
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:05.100]  think about guns especially young people and make them think it's not cool
[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:09.420]  talks about doing it like cigarettes and then says we need to do this every day
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:12.860]  of the week we really just need to brainwash people into thinking about
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:16.220]  guns in a vastly different way and if you watch the whole clip he's there at a
[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:20.460]  media thing admitting he's met with the media saying put anti-gun messages
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:25.060]  private ownership messages in your programs that's correct flash forward to
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:30.100]  February 2009 a month after Obama enters office Holder revives talk of an
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:34.980]  assault weapons ban quote he tells a reporter question quote well as President
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:39.020]  Obama indicated during the campaign there are just a few gun related changes
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.580]  that we'd like to make and among them would be to re-institute the ban on the
[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:46.700]  sale of assault weapons I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico at
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:51.060]  a minimum alluding to fast and furious scandal yeah after he ships guns into
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:55.420]  Mexico after making that statement in 2009 Rahm Emanuel then chief of staff
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:48:01.380]  for Obama so tells Holder to STF you that being shut up expletive on guns
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:03.900]  by the way he's the one that says they just want to put you on a list where you
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:07.820]  can't own guns no judge no jury a no gun violence we have that video clip let's
[02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:12.220]  play just a short piece just a long speech where he says that this is Holder
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:16.740]  that they're going to need to brainwash the public here it is and what we need
[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:20.940]  to do is change the way in which people think about guns especially young
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:24.420]  people one thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:27.980]  well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to
[02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:32.380]  simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:36.540]  do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:41.900]  about guns in a vastly different way so there you go the brainwashing
[02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:44.820]  genius now they got a lot more air but the interest of time go ahead go to the
[02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:51.220]  rest Alder also told Congress in 2012 during fast and furious testimony in
[02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:54.700]  the House oversight and government reform committee a statement extremely
[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:59.140]  similar to the one he made in 2009 this administration has consistently
[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:03.180]  favored the reinstitution of the assault weapons ban it is something that we
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:06.260]  think was useful in the past with regard to the reduction that we've seen in
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:10.260]  crime and certainly would have a positive impact on our relationship let's
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:13.140]  stop right there because we're pretty much just repeating him saying it over
[02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:17.420]  and over again what we're seeing illustrated here is that that that's
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:21.660]  so-called liberals are really authoritarians of another stripe and they
[02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:26.340]  think they control reality because they always do this they say what terms are
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:29.940]  they say what meanings are and they say we're not going to try to take your
[02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:33.860]  guns we're just reintroducing stuff to physically take them not just ban their
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:38.820]  sale or manufacture so they play these games hoping everyone's ignorant and
[02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:43.340]  they try to just laugh at you with an appeal to everyone else's stupidity

[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:55.020]  the building and they're saying this is not an assault this is what's going on

[02:54:14.180 --> 02:54:17.380]  first off any other points you'd like to make about what you've just heard well
[02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:21.460]  whatever I was just talking about was internal laws on assault weapon bands
[02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:26.340]  that sort of thing what broke in the news today and here's headlines at 6 40
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:31.140]  a.m. this morning November the 8th no votes against finalizing global arms
[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:34.900]  trade treaty at UN General Assembly basically they've got the strongest
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:39.380]  they just had they were meeting starting in on Tuesday the day we had our
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:43.900]  election the UN was meeting about gun control and they just finalized it
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:48.420]  today two days later and they had a couple of abstentions but they had the
[02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:53.180]  most support they've had for this yet now they tried this back in July on July
[02:54:53.180 --> 02:54:56.980]  26 they had a vote and the vote didn't pass and one of the reasons that didn't
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:03.980]  pass was because fast and furious and bright was breaking at the time and what
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:07.060]  they were telling everybody at the time was don't worry this isn't about your
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:11.580]  handguns this is only about transfer of weapons between countries but that's
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:15.100]  exactly what fast and furious was about so that was something that was really
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:18.820]  kind of an embarrassment to the bomb administration they really didn't want to
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:21.940]  get into this until after the election and they were telling everybody at the
[02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:24.580]  time that you know the word was out that they were going to revisit this
[02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:28.260]  immediately after the election well here we are two days after election and
[02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:31.940]  they're they're right on top of it and they're saying they're going to have the
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:36.540]  the next meeting is going to be for the actual finalize this is going to be in
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:40.940]  March by that time the Senate will be a little bit more Democrat so they've got
[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:46.300]  a better chance of getting this through but the whole idea that this is just
[02:55:46.300 --> 02:55:50.300]  about transfer of weapons between countries is is not really anything
[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:57.100]  that's anybody's buying because part of regulating this transfer is registration
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:56:01.220]  and tracking that's that's gonna be well it says to control international we've
[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:05.620]  got to control internal and it says states have a right to have guns in the
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:10.580]  subsections that we list but not individuals right it says the state
[02:56:10.580 --> 02:56:15.820]  can curtail that and I put up on screen just type in map of world gun laws and
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:20.660]  if you just type that into a search engine you can see mainline news and
[02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:26.460]  government's breakdowns of this and if you look at maps of this almost the
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:32.820]  entire world is disarmed green is totally disarmed dark green almost totally
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:38.580]  you know purple a few guns but but black is a lot of guns well look at the
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:43.660]  United States okay the United States is it folks every government wants those
[02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:50.020]  guns I mean look at communist China just like England now I mean this is
[02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:54.340]  incredible Canada is pretty much partially disarmed look at South America
[02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:58.620]  look at Central America look at Mexico yeah Mexico only civilians can purchase
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:02.220]  small caliber firearms and they can only purchase them from the Defense Department
[02:57:02.220 --> 02:57:06.060]  you know what kind of gun violence do they have I mean compare that to Switzerland
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:10.060]  where the government requires the citizens to have military weapons right
[02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:13.060]  but but but I've been told that the Defense Department decides if they're
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:17.220]  gonna let you have a gun right so it's almost impossible right exactly and and
[02:57:17.220 --> 02:57:21.140]  they don't have any gun violence there do they continue with what the UN's doing
[02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:24.500]  because here's the bottom line folks they're coming for the guns and they're
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:27.500]  gonna play this game and we're not coming for your guns the TSA is not
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:30.980]  groping and remember the TSA will grope people and go in their pants and say well
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:33.940]  we don't call that groping or they'll strip search you and say we don't call
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:38.300]  that strip searching it's this mind game they play or they control reality and
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.220]  this is this is developing exactly like we saw with the NDA a where you know
[02:57:42.220 --> 02:57:45.260]  Obama said he didn't want it then he was gonna do it and you know don't worry
[02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:49.180]  I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna do that you know and and you're saying the
[02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:52.220]  same type of thing when they get this passed they're gonna have to have the
[02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:56.780]  Senate is gonna have to ratify this amendment once they ratify it the UN
[02:57:56.780 --> 02:58:00.540]  will be able to change the details of how these things are implemented that's
[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:04.060]  the key tell people about that yeah that's the key the key is is that they
[02:58:04.060 --> 02:58:08.180]  need a super majority and that's all we have time for that report needs to go
