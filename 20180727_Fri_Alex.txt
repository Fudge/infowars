[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.520]  Yesterday, Anderson Cooper kicked off his brand new Facebook livestream, which he's
[00:12.520 --> 00:17.720]  going to be doing five days a week, which Facebook is paying CNN to produce.
[00:17.720 --> 00:19.920]  Let's take a look and see how it went.
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.320]  Now, as I said, remarkable.
[00:21.320 --> 00:25.600]  It didn't take long for Democrats to chastise President Trump, probably no surprise there.
[00:25.600 --> 00:29.320]  Some Republicans also condemned the president, most notably Senator John McCain, said in
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.960]  a statement, I want to read part of it to you.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.240]  You may be wondering what that noise is in the background, and it's actually an audio
[00:35.240 --> 00:40.600]  track that they played throughout the entire broadcast, trying to be like some cool, hip,
[00:40.600 --> 00:45.920]  millennial YouTube vlogger, which plays annoying background music during their entire YouTube
[00:45.920 --> 00:46.920]  video.
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.680]  Later in the show, he was joined by Jim Acosta, and as you can see by the live viewer
[00:50.680 --> 00:56.040]  count here, they didn't even have 5,000 people turning into the stream.
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.120]  And look at this, they're formatting the show vertically for mobile devices, because apparently
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.120]  their audience doesn't know that you could turn your phone sideways and expand it full
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.040]  screen when you're watching media.
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.480]  Later in the stream, Anderson decided to answer some audience questions to make the show interactive.
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.320]  And by that time, the viewership had dropped down to under 4,000 people.
[01:16.320 --> 01:21.000]  What story did you do that had a long-lasting effect on you personally?
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.600]  There's been so many places I've been that have really been life-changing and eye-opening
[01:25.600 --> 01:32.240]  and mind-vending, and you know, you see a lot of people, and the greatest satisfaction
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.840]  I get from the job is...
[01:33.840 --> 01:39.480]  Is making $11 million a year, or if you break it down per episode with five episodes a week,
[01:39.480 --> 01:42.800]  that's over $45,000 per show.
[01:42.800 --> 01:48.480]  Oh, and speaking of money, Facebook is reportedly paying CNN $5-10 million a year to produce
[01:48.480 --> 01:54.360]  this new five-day-a-week streaming show called Anderson Cooper Full Circle.
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.320]  Let's do the math on that, shall we?
[01:56.320 --> 02:05.880]  That's $5 million divided by 12 months divided by four weeks divided by five shows a week.
[02:05.880 --> 02:17.560]  That's $20,833.33 per episode of his streaming show, which capped out at about 6,000 viewers.
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.400]  His show was such a failure that by the end of the 30-minute livestream, they actually
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.080]  hid the number of viewers, and then it just showed the little red live button without
[02:26.080 --> 02:27.080]  the viewer count.
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.920]  And here he is later on CNN begging people to tune in to his new Facebook show.
[02:31.920 --> 02:32.920]  One last note.
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.120]  Today we were proud to kick off something new, a live interactive daily newscast on Facebook.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.600]  It's called Full Circle on it.
[02:38.600 --> 02:42.280]  You'll see great interviews with the day's biggest newsmakers, a quick look at the day's
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.560]  hottest stories online as well, stories that you yourself decide on.
[02:46.560 --> 02:49.120]  We've been working hard getting it ready, incorporating your feedback.
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.640]  It's a really interactive broadcast, trying to make it as special and different as possible.
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.240]  You can access it at facebook.com slash Anderson Cooper Full Circle.
[02:57.240 --> 02:58.240]  That's one word.
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.040]  Discover what tens of thousands of followers already have.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.040]  We'll see you there.
[03:02.040 --> 03:05.360]  No, you won't, because nobody's watching.
[03:05.360 --> 03:09.040]  Anderson was so disappointed in President Trump's press conference with Vladimir Putin
[03:09.040 --> 03:12.640]  yesterday that as soon as it finished, he had this to say.
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.360]  You have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American
[03:16.360 --> 03:24.520]  president at a summit in front of a Russian leader, the only that I've ever seen, an extraordinary
[03:24.520 --> 03:26.440]  press conference.
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.120]  I'm back with CNN Global Affairs analyst Susan Glasser, CNN senior political analyst
[03:30.120 --> 03:31.120]  David.
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.120]  Gee, I wonder why you can't even get 5,000 people to watch your new Facebook show, Anderson.
[03:35.120 --> 03:39.280]  Of course, with the liberal media creating new Trump-Potent conspiracy theories almost
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.320]  every day, seeing the two of them standing next to each other was just more than they
[03:43.320 --> 03:44.320]  could bear.
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.520]  Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's trying to be a YouTuber now, posted a rant on his
[03:48.520 --> 03:53.560]  official YouTube channel in portrait mode, of course, with two giant black bars on the
[03:53.560 --> 03:57.320]  side of it, which got a whopping 12,000 views.
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.920]  President Trump, I just saw your press conference with President Putin, and it was embarrassing.
[04:01.920 --> 04:08.040]  I mean, you stood there like a little wet noodle, like a little fanboy.
[04:08.040 --> 04:10.800]  I mean, I was asking myself, when are you going to ask him for an autograph or for
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.600]  a selfie or something like that?
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.840]  I mean, you've literally sold out the press conference, our intelligence community, our
[04:16.840 --> 04:19.240]  justice system, and worst of all, our country.
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.600]  You're the president of the United States, you shouldn't do that, and what's the matter
[04:23.600 --> 04:24.600]  with you?
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.520]  I'm sorry, Arnold, but shouldn't you be taking care of your illegitimate son that you had
[04:28.520 --> 04:30.280]  with your Mexican maid?
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.640]  Liberals got so bent out of shape over Trump's press conference with Putin that former CIA
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.640]  operative and current CNN contributor Phil Mudd called for the shadow government to take
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.120]  over the country.
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.600]  Serious point in American government, when do we see almost a shadow government come
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.520]  out and say, we cannot side with the government, whether it's the cabinet or the Senate?
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.800]  I think that's the big question.
[04:49.800 --> 04:53.800]  But frankly, look, frankly, you're literally calling for a deep state coup.
[04:53.800 --> 05:00.640]  By the way, yesterday's...
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.440]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.440 --> 05:08.960]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[05:08.960 --> 05:14.400]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.800]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.800 --> 05:21.320]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.320 --> 05:27.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.840]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.840 --> 05:33.120]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.560]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.560 --> 05:44.640]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.640 --> 05:50.280]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.280 --> 05:55.600]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.600 --> 06:09.840]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:09.840 --> 06:37.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:37.320 --> 06:40.240]  We have forced the enemy out in the open.
[06:40.240 --> 06:51.200]  MSNBC, CNN, ABC News, Forbes, ABC News, Australia, the BBC, the London Guardian, Verspeagle.
[06:51.200 --> 06:55.720]  There's over a thousand articles a day.
[06:55.720 --> 07:04.800]  Local TV, radio, beyond that, lying and demonizing info wars, and yours truly, Alex Jones, and
[07:04.800 --> 07:11.360]  calling for us to be shut down, calling for us to be banned, calling for us to be removed,
[07:11.360 --> 07:18.120]  and then building straw men lying about what we've said and done to then try to set the
[07:18.120 --> 07:20.760]  precedent for everybody else.
[07:20.760 --> 07:27.360]  And just as night follows day and day follows night, no sooner had they put strikes on my
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.920]  YouTube and Facebook accounts and blocked us on most of the accounts from live streaming
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.960]  that's a very small part of our audience, but for CNN, it's a giant audience, they're
[07:36.960 --> 07:37.960]  very jealous of it.
[07:37.960 --> 07:39.800]  I'll get to that in a minute.
[07:39.800 --> 07:44.600]  Anderson Cooper's total failure with 4,000 viewers on his new Facebook show that they
[07:44.600 --> 07:50.800]  paid $18 million for and that his force fed and push notifications to tens of millions
[07:50.800 --> 07:51.800]  of people.
[07:51.800 --> 07:56.600]  They shadow banned us and our videos have hundreds of thousands or millions of views.
[07:56.600 --> 08:05.920]  They force feed Anderson Cooper and he had 4,000 viewers in the entire show.
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.400]  That's by the way, in the newspapers today, it's very, very embarrassing for them.
[08:10.400 --> 08:14.400]  That's why I led in that little first segment of you just tuned in with Mark Dice breaking
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.400]  it all down.
[08:15.400 --> 08:18.720]  I mean, Mark Dice's average video used to have 5 million views.
[08:18.720 --> 08:21.400]  They were so jealous of him, they shadow banned him, so now, you know, he has a half
[08:21.400 --> 08:26.840]  million views, doesn't matter, he just does more and is, you know, proliferating into
[08:26.840 --> 08:27.840]  other areas.
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.040]  So, this is the craziness of all of this.
[08:32.040 --> 08:33.560]  These people are total jokes.
[08:33.560 --> 08:41.640]  So now Anderson Cooper and Acosta that was on with him, they now do these things in studios
[08:41.640 --> 08:47.120]  like they're outside with a vertical video and you hear car noises and music and stuff
[08:47.120 --> 08:49.640]  in the background like he's really out on the street.
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.880]  And I sort of noticed this a few weeks ago, Cooper does feeds now on CNN where it's not
[08:54.880 --> 08:57.560]  an external mic, it's a internal mic.
[08:57.560 --> 09:01.520]  So, it's really bad audio and they're doing it on purpose.
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.320]  They think it's the low quality that makes people watch, no.
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.800]  People want to watch other people that they think are independent.
[09:10.800 --> 09:16.120]  They'd rather watch independent people on a slick platform, but they do not want to watch
[09:16.120 --> 09:26.160]  you, look, you could put fudge icing on a dog turd, but once somebody bites into it,
[09:26.160 --> 09:27.160]  they're going to spit it out.
[09:27.160 --> 09:32.920]  You can go, oh no, I'm putting more fudge on, no amount of hot fudge on the dog dropping
[09:32.920 --> 09:36.840]  is going to make people eat it and CNN is beyond a dog dropping.
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.280]  It's beyond fake news.
[09:38.280 --> 09:45.400]  I sent them a letter today on notice for torsus interference, you know, I don't just follow
[09:45.400 --> 09:49.160]  lawsuits to follow my follow back and win them 100%.
[09:49.160 --> 09:55.400]  And they are on television saying, take me off the air and then lying about what I said
[09:55.400 --> 10:03.360]  and then calling publishers and getting publisher people fired because I'm working on a book
[10:03.360 --> 10:11.280]  with one of the top selling authors who's alive, Neil Strauss, The War for the Future,
[10:11.280 --> 10:13.640]  Secret History of the World and The War for the Future.
[10:13.640 --> 10:16.000]  That isn't a book that sells 10 million, what doesn't?
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.160]  Everyone knows it's the super head.
[10:18.160 --> 10:22.760]  Of course, after you try to ban it, then we'll of course publish it ourselves.
[10:22.760 --> 10:23.840]  We already knew you'd all do this.
[10:23.840 --> 10:27.240]  You've just walked right into our trap as usual, but the point is, is that you're still
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.840]  very, very dangerous because you may not have any viewers, but you've got a huge army of
[10:32.840 --> 10:40.840]  leftist foundation operatives, SJWs, intelligence operatives at CNN, at MSNBC, and that is the
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.840]  deep state.
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.560]  CNN is the tip of the iceberg, but it's the visible part of the deep state.
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.200]  And under what you see on the surface with Anderson Cooper and the rest of them is the
[10:54.200 --> 10:55.700]  enemy.
[10:55.700 --> 10:58.440]  And that's why President Trump has called them the enemy, but they're the ones calling
[10:58.440 --> 10:59.440]  for violence.
[10:59.440 --> 11:07.400]  They're the ones out trying to restrict everybody's speech ahead, ahead.
[11:07.400 --> 11:15.920]  This is critical of the midterms to suppress our speech so that we're not able to speak
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.160]  out or show you video of what really happens at Antifa events or leftist attacking people.
[11:20.160 --> 11:28.200]  I've got so many riveting videos today, but we're having to bleep them of leftist attacking
[11:28.200 --> 11:29.840]  people all over the country.
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.560]  If they see you in an American flag shirt, if they see you in a Trump hat, if they see
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.720]  you in a Make America Great Again shirt, I mean, you're talking about a group of racially
[11:40.720 --> 11:49.600]  charged Hispanics in California at the destroyed star, Hollywood star of Donald Trump, believing
[11:49.600 --> 11:56.080]  the propaganda of CNN and all the race force stuff, attacking Joy Vila, who is Hispanic,
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.680]  by the way, and a couple of white dudes, Marine Corps veterans, that are just out there to
[12:01.680 --> 12:09.040]  exercise their free speech, but even 15 gangbangers couldn't beat up the two white dudes.
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.880]  Now, that's because they're punks.
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.480]  It's absolutely pathetic to see how the Democratic Party is trying to turn Hispanics, blacks,
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.320]  whites, you name it, into leftist KKK members to go out and attack people, the articles
[12:23.320 --> 12:24.840]  on infowars.com.
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.660]  So they don't want all this being reported that the literal modern brown shirts are taking
[12:31.660 --> 12:38.320]  control of the streets, CNN, MSNBC are putting out lies to Congress, trying to legitimize
[12:38.320 --> 12:42.200]  why they're banning people, they're shadow banning most members of Congress.
[12:42.200 --> 12:44.760]  It's going on and on and on.
[12:44.760 --> 12:50.760]  To our now in Los Angeles, many Hispanic Americans believe any white person that supports Trump
[12:50.760 --> 12:56.960]  deserves to be physically attacked 15 to one because they're a Nazi.
[12:56.960 --> 13:04.520]  There's also footage of a black reporter and a white reporter just out calmly asking SJWs
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.800]  at a pro Maxine Waters rally about what's going on.
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.160]  And I know about this particular show, one guy's a liberal actually, they're just pro
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.880]  free speech and they get chased and attacked, screaming in word at the black reporter.
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.560]  Just like you see the videos coming out that if we show it, they say we're racially insensitive.
[13:22.560 --> 13:28.520]  Liberal news can show the border patrol and ICE and police that are out at these events
[13:28.520 --> 13:32.560]  and occupy this, occupy that and then they run up to the black cops, white people and
[13:32.560 --> 13:35.720]  scream in word, in word, in word.
[13:35.720 --> 13:40.600]  And then if we pointed out, they take down our videos saying we called somebody an in
[13:40.600 --> 13:41.600]  word.
[13:41.600 --> 13:43.960]  Did you hear Jones had a video taken down for in word?
[13:43.960 --> 13:45.760]  Yeah, showing you saying it.
[13:45.760 --> 13:54.600]  But see, since they take the video down, you don't even know what's going on.
[13:54.600 --> 14:01.640]  Just like they said, it was on local radio, it was on local TV, I guess KVUE did it.
[14:01.640 --> 14:05.640]  And I got cousins calling me in each taxes going, yeah, we heard on the news, you beat
[14:05.640 --> 14:06.640]  up a child.
[14:06.640 --> 14:13.400]  It was that one of your kids, they would show the video and I said, no, that was Missouri
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.120]  kid, it was a kid beating up adults and one guy pushed him down, it was on ABC News, I
[14:18.120 --> 14:19.520]  showed it.
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.920]  And then the news went, wait, we can say that's child endangerment, take the video down, just
[14:22.920 --> 14:31.480]  say child endangerment, Forbes said I beat a kid up and there's now filings at the Travis
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.040]  County Courthouse, people are down there trying to do TROs to take my kids and they're holding
[14:36.040 --> 14:37.240]  up the article.
[14:37.240 --> 14:39.720]  And the news locally won't say it's not true.
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.120]  They are actively on the news saying, well, we can't get into it because of children's
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.120]  privacy, but Jones beat up a child and my phone's ringing and I got family going, are
[14:49.120 --> 14:50.120]  you okay?
[14:50.120 --> 14:51.120]  Did you really beat up a child?
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.280]  I'm like, no, it's, it's like warfare, they're about to, and here's the key to everything.
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.040]  They wouldn't be doing all this because this is so discrediting to them that they weren't
[15:00.040 --> 15:02.120]  planning a total takeover soon.
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.600]  They're launching, as I said, towards the end of summer, early fall in their own admissions,
[15:05.600 --> 15:16.240]  a massive civil unrest situation to bring in a national emergency and CNN's own comments.
[15:16.240 --> 15:20.120]  So that's what's happening.
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.400]  And even Facebook put out a statement saying we were reviewed, CNN's complaint calling for
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.120]  M4s to be shut down, and he did not say they were crisis actors or that no one died.
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.080]  And CNN doesn't even know what to do, I'll show you screenshots of the Twitter of Facebook
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.480]  saying that, so here's the deal, it's a lot bigger than M4 wars.
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.000]  They're making their move, the globalist are counter striking, Hollywood owned by the
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.760]  Chai Combs is doing that.
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.760]  It's incredible.
[15:47.760 --> 15:50.280]  It is unbelievable.
[15:50.280 --> 15:51.520]  They're going for broke.
[15:51.520 --> 15:55.280]  They're about to make their big move, everybody watch your six, don't let them intimidate
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.320]  you, just keep getting the word out, we're winning.
[15:59.320 --> 16:02.640]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[16:07.680 --> 16:12.680]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.960]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[16:15.960 --> 16:19.800]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[16:19.800 --> 16:22.360]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[16:22.360 --> 16:27.200]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work and

[16:37.520 --> 16:42.200]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[20:03.600 --> 20:20.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.960 --> 20:38.560]  So, CNN has been on national news, lying about Infowars, lying about everything else
[20:38.560 --> 20:41.800]  that's pro-America, and they've been caught.
[20:41.800 --> 20:47.000]  And Facebook said, no, he didn't say nobody died at Parkland, and so they went ahead and
[20:47.000 --> 20:55.640]  moved on, then, to saying that I beat up a kid, and Forbes did it as well.
[20:55.640 --> 20:58.800]  And now that's the national headline.
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.680]  Without even looking for my name, I go to, like, yahoo, CNN, and it's like, Alex Jones
[21:02.680 --> 21:07.800]  blocked on YouTube for child endangerment, child shoved to the ground, we won't show
[21:07.800 --> 21:12.360]  you the graphic video of what happened to the child, and everybody just goes, and that's
[21:12.360 --> 21:16.160]  next-level defamation, because Forbes said I beat a kid up.
[21:16.160 --> 21:18.360]  Others just leave it out there.
[21:18.360 --> 21:20.440]  So people call me, they go, what happened to the kid?
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.440]  Who was the kid?
[21:21.440 --> 21:25.920]  You know, we don't think you'd attack a child, Alex, and I go, no, I didn't, it's fake news.
[21:25.920 --> 21:29.320]  And they go, they go, they're that bad now?
[21:29.320 --> 21:32.240]  Wow, this country really is in trouble.
[21:32.240 --> 21:37.560]  Now, Tucker Carlson is under big-time attack, because he pointed out the obvious.
[21:37.560 --> 21:43.160]  They've had Jim Acosta and his producer and all this fake news at CNN constantly in the
[21:43.160 --> 21:48.600]  face of Trump during everybody else's questions, you name it, during the press conferences,
[21:48.600 --> 21:51.040]  just dominating him.
[21:51.040 --> 21:57.240]  So the producer for one of the CNN shows, that used to be the producer for Tucker Carlson
[21:57.240 --> 22:00.520]  when he was there, she got blocked for the week.
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.360]  Now, they already have thousands that want to get in, only a few hundred to get in.
[22:04.360 --> 22:08.080]  And so it's normal, but CNN always just expects it's in there.
[22:08.080 --> 22:11.040]  So they didn't get their week pass coming up.
[22:11.040 --> 22:13.920]  So oh, Brian Skelter's up there.
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.720]  Oh, it's so horrible for First Amendment, the president's trying to destroy it.
[22:17.720 --> 22:21.680]  Meanwhile, he comes back next segment and brags, we're very close to banning Alex Jones
[22:21.680 --> 22:23.560]  and shutting down a speech.
[22:23.560 --> 22:28.640]  That's how they don't think there's any logic or memory going on here.
[22:28.640 --> 22:35.000]  So here is Tucker Carlson, who by the way, the Democrats are in the news now calling
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.120]  for him to be de-platformed and a bunch of other conservatives, like Stephen Crowder
[22:40.120 --> 22:47.160]  and Stephen Malinu, because they know what's happening.
[22:47.160 --> 22:48.920]  They know they're losing.
[22:48.920 --> 22:54.840]  And so they misrepresent in Newsweek CNN, they go, Tucker Carlson defends Alex Jones,
[22:54.840 --> 22:59.160]  bullying the Parkland students and saying no one died.
[22:59.160 --> 23:05.600]  And Tucker Carlson defends child endangerment, all hoaxes, all lies.
[23:05.600 --> 23:10.680]  Just like they say, every hour on the hour, Trump hates Hispanics and says they're all
[23:10.680 --> 23:13.720]  rapists and criminals.
[23:13.720 --> 23:24.920]  So then everybody shows up at the Trump star that's been pickaxed
[23:24.920 --> 23:27.960]  and you beat up the white people because, well, they're obviously bad.
[23:27.960 --> 23:32.640]  I mean, Donald Trump means Hal Hitler, right?
[23:32.640 --> 23:35.120]  That's the brainwashing and that footage is coming up.
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.080]  That's where they're trying to take this country, totally divided by the media and the globalist
[23:40.080 --> 23:44.320]  and the Chinese government that oppresses their own people, openly manipulating it, trying
[23:44.320 --> 23:47.760]  to stop our government getting control of our country again.
[23:47.760 --> 23:50.840]  America has been captured by foreign interest, period.
[23:50.840 --> 23:53.600]  And they're using weaponized garbage to do it.
[23:53.600 --> 23:57.040]  And Tucker Carlson points this out another piece that Brian Stelter said is hateful
[23:57.040 --> 23:59.040]  and needs to be removed.
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.120]  So see, once they start policing in full wars, it's everybody.
[24:04.120 --> 24:07.960]  Just like they started shadow banning members of Congress last week, just like I told them
[24:07.960 --> 24:08.960]  that was coming.
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.200]  And now people are awake because they're going too far, too fast because they're desperate
[24:13.200 --> 24:16.560]  because the midterms are coming because the blue wave is going to fail, they believe.
[24:16.560 --> 24:20.120]  And I believe that will as well, unless there's election fraud and so they don't know what
[24:20.120 --> 24:21.120]  to do.
[24:21.120 --> 24:22.120]  They're scared.
[24:22.120 --> 24:23.120]  They've been caught doing all this stuff.
[24:23.120 --> 24:24.320]  So now they're going to go for broke.
[24:24.320 --> 24:28.000]  Here is Tucker Carlson last night.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.640]  The big story in Washington today is that Caitlin Collins over at CNN was prevented from
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.480]  covering an event at the White House yesterday.
[24:35.480 --> 24:37.520]  And Caitlin worked for me for years.
[24:37.520 --> 24:40.800]  She's a fair and decent person and I don't think she should have been prevented from
[24:40.800 --> 24:42.160]  covering anything.
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.160]  That's my position.
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.160]  But CNN has been basically a martyr for free speech for the last 24 hours.
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.680]  At the same time, they're telling us how important it is that people should be able to say what
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.040]  they think they are agitating for Alex Jones to be pulled off YouTube.
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.800]  Now, I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.000]  Marr, Michelle Wolfe or Rosie O'Donnell, but he's got a point of view and CNN is trying
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.640]  to squelch his point of view.
[25:06.640 --> 25:07.640]  What do you make of that?
[25:07.640 --> 25:11.960]  Yeah, you know, I'm all in favor of CNN getting all the access that it wants to the White
[25:11.960 --> 25:12.960]  House.
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.240]  I want all reports to get all the access that they want at the White House.
[25:16.240 --> 25:17.240]  Me too.
[25:17.240 --> 25:18.240]  But you're right.
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.240]  The hypocrisy is just astounding.
[25:19.240 --> 25:24.000]  And I guarantee you that if you flipped over to CNN right now, there would not be a single
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.280]  story about the Twitter shadow banning, there would not be a single story.
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.320]  And the only story you would see about YouTube pulling Alex Jones videos would be probably
[25:31.320 --> 25:40.000]  something celebratory about, you know, a scalp of sorts for managing to eventually get their
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.320]  way on that story.
[25:42.320 --> 25:49.240]  And you know, I look at all of the consternation about Donald Trump and this White House.
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.400]  But you know, my goodness, this has been going on for absolutely ever.
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.560]  You know how the White House press shop works, you know, at press conferences, the president
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.000]  always picks who he wants to ask him questions.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.960]  Often the staffers go around and talk to the reporter beforehand.
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.880]  It's almost, as far as I'm concerned, it's the same as planting questions because you're
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.680]  basically setting who it is that's going to ask you a question.
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.960]  So you know, all of these concerns suddenly about access and free speech at the White
[26:20.960 --> 26:21.960]  House, come on.
[26:21.960 --> 26:27.440]  I mean, there's so many problems with the White House press court to begin with that,
[26:27.440 --> 26:29.920]  you know, you never hear any of that.
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.440]  I've never heard this level of consternation before now.
[26:33.440 --> 26:39.680]  So CNN, MSNBC, the Democratic Party, they all call for me to be banned for months.
[26:39.680 --> 26:46.920]  And then Facebook and YouTube catch CNN in a bunch of lies, but then they say, well,
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.800]  we can objectively then just kind of make up that you've done something here.
[26:49.800 --> 26:51.560]  We'll go ahead ban Alex Jones on this.
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.560]  And here it is.
[26:52.560 --> 26:53.560]  Facebook suspends personal profile.
[26:53.560 --> 27:04.040]  Then for his founder Alex Jones, CNN, celebrating right now, they say he bullied a child.
[27:04.040 --> 27:09.320]  I showed ABC news footage so they won't show you the footage.
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.800]  Paul Watson has an article up on info wars.com that shows the four banned videos, but that's
[27:14.800 --> 27:17.560]  not even what's important.
[27:17.560 --> 27:24.320]  The live streaming on those platforms, that one has 2 million followers, then doesn't
[27:24.320 --> 27:28.600]  let us broadcast, it's what they call it, it's a transmission to people.
[27:28.600 --> 27:34.760]  So CNN is effectively having its victory, its porous interference in the market, lying,
[27:34.760 --> 27:40.440]  having an ad campaign, a hoax, to then bully corporations into setting the precedent to
[27:40.440 --> 27:46.080]  restrict me so they can then expand that to everyone else, which then I've got the stacks
[27:46.080 --> 27:48.440]  of articles coming up.
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.000]  They're having big international TV conventions right now, two of them where they're calling
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.520]  for Fox News to be de-platformed, and the Republican Party and countless Republican
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.760]  congressmen and women can't even post now to their Facebooks or Twitters and their shadow
[28:00.760 --> 28:01.760]  ban.
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.480]  Shadow banning has been going on five years.
[28:06.480 --> 28:12.120]  They've ratcheted up from 50% to 90% of conservative posts being blocked.
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.440]  You could say, man, I really like President Trump, you can't do that.
[28:17.440 --> 28:20.960]  So they act like, oh, we're just banning Alex Jones and they're not.
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.160]  So it's here, it's exponential censorship ahead of the midterms and ahead of civil
[28:25.160 --> 28:26.560]  unrest they want to start.
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.680]  That's why this is critical, but here's the good news, you, the listeners and viewers
[28:29.680 --> 28:37.840]  of this show, every color creed, red blooded humans that I love, you expose this and now
[28:37.840 --> 28:39.880]  shadow ban is the household term.
[28:39.880 --> 28:42.840]  People now know how they're being censored, they're getting together, they're realizing
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.400]  it and that's why Facebook's plunging, that's why the globalists are in trouble.
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.440]  So now they're going to accelerate their plan towards total censorship in desperation.
[28:50.440 --> 28:54.240]  That will only detonate their downfall that much quicker.
[28:54.240 --> 28:57.640]  But Tucker Carlson knocked it out of the park again, I'm going to play that when we come
[28:57.640 --> 28:58.640]  back.

[29:31.360 --> 29:37.080]  My name is Kevin Ship, I'm a former decorated CIA officer, finally someone has come out
[29:37.080 --> 29:40.760]  and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.800]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a
[29:45.800 --> 29:46.800]  shadow government.
[29:46.800 --> 29:49.760]  We got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[29:49.760 --> 29:50.760]  are.
[29:50.760 --> 29:53.480]  This is critical to get, to read, to give a library, to give you a church, to get them
[29:53.480 --> 30:00.360]  right now at killingunclesambook.com, killingunclesambook.com.
[30:00.360 --> 30:05.840]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[30:05.840 --> 30:08.080]  you are changing the world.
[30:08.080 --> 30:11.800]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globlest.
[30:11.800 --> 30:16.360]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[30:16.360 --> 30:20.200]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[30:20.200 --> 30:25.120]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.

[33:03.440 --> 33:21.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:21.720 --> 33:39.800]  By the way, I've always said on air that if I found somebody more effective than me and
[33:39.800 --> 33:44.160]  more on target than I would point that person out.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.680]  Not that I'm that good, but my strong points were very strong.
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.280]  Tucker Carlson is that person, there's no doubt, so if the media picks up on my particular
[33:54.280 --> 34:00.960]  love fest, I love my children, I love the truth, and Carlson, the way he lays it out
[34:00.960 --> 34:07.320]  and the way he's hit his stride is, I mean, it's about as close to perfection there is.
[34:07.320 --> 34:12.920]  Obviously, he has his moments and nobody's perfect, but it's like, he's hitting about
[34:12.920 --> 34:14.520]  a 99 here.
[34:14.520 --> 34:19.800]  And that's why Stelter and all these no talent cookballs want him off the air, because he
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.640]  points out what they've said and what they've done, not like Stelter saying, Joe's bullied
[34:24.640 --> 34:26.440]  a small child and beat him up.
[34:26.440 --> 34:27.680]  He's been taken off YouTube.
[34:27.680 --> 34:28.680]  Total lie.
[34:28.680 --> 34:36.040]  Doesn't matter if Forbes said it, doesn't matter if you get Facebook to agree to it.
[34:36.040 --> 34:40.720]  When Carlson talks about something, he shows it.
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.720]  You're a radio looser, you can't see it, but I'm showing Forbes and others retracting that
[34:44.720 --> 34:47.920]  I wasn't in Missouri a month ago, I didn't beat up some kid that was punching me in
[34:47.920 --> 34:48.920]  the face.
[34:48.920 --> 34:52.760]  The guy didn't even look like me, but right now we can't stream on YouTube or my main
[34:52.760 --> 35:00.760]  Facebook account because YouTube was lobbied by CNN, CNN says they lobbied for this.
[35:00.760 --> 35:09.280]  And again, why would CNN be spending all its time and all its energy doing this?
[35:09.280 --> 35:12.000]  Because they're globalists, they work for multinational corporations, they work for
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.640]  the Communist Chinese.
[35:13.640 --> 35:15.440]  Americans aren't an afterthought.
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.760]  If Carlson isn't going all the way because his audience isn't ready yet, Americans are
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.800]  the enemy of CNN, just as Trump has said.
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.560]  And they're globalists and that's their model and that's their plan, so that's coming up.
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.560]  And then I've got all the clips, I say all the clips, there's so much cussing, it takes
[35:34.560 --> 35:36.400]  the crew hours to bleep it all.
[35:36.400 --> 35:41.040]  Like five minutes of video, you got to bleep it like 80 times, just beep, beep, beep, beep.
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.280]  But we're on broadcast TV and stuff, so we got to cover up people flipping folks off,
[35:46.280 --> 35:48.800]  we have to do all that.
[35:48.800 --> 35:53.000]  And it is Democrats just beating people up everywhere.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.920]  It's just exponentially increasing, so it's a huge deal.
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.200]  But also at the start of the next segment, I'm going to read to you on air my letter
[36:01.200 --> 36:09.120]  officially to CNN, putting them on notice of lawsuit.
[36:09.120 --> 36:12.640]  And of course, you notice when I sue people, it's not in the news.
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.160]  But I've countersued a bunch of folks, a lot of lawsuits have been dropped, but that takes
[36:17.160 --> 36:19.160]  a lot of money to finance what we're doing.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.160]  This is a war.
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.120]  You think we're going to take America back from the chai comms and the globalists and
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.600]  the big banks and Hollywood that literally has mounted America's head on the wall?
[36:27.600 --> 36:31.720]  Do you think these people that in their own private recordings call you flyover country
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.480]  and bitter clingers and say how much they hate you on Bill Maher and all these shows?
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.520]  Do you think it's going to be easy to take it all back from them?
[36:40.520 --> 36:41.520]  No.
[36:41.520 --> 36:44.360]  It's certainly not going to be easy for those of us on the front line, but I'll tell
[36:44.360 --> 36:47.720]  you, it's a lot better than living under their scumbag control, so I'm very honored to be
[36:47.720 --> 36:49.120]  part of this contest of liberty.
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.680]  It's very animating.
[36:50.680 --> 36:57.680]  So I'll play the Tucker Club that Stelter says is hateful and un-American and you know,
[36:57.680 --> 36:58.680]  once censored.
[36:58.680 --> 36:59.680]  People say, why do you focus on Stelter?
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.360]  He has like 100,000 viewers.
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.360]  He's a total joke, but he's the mouthpiece of the establishment, so you're hearing from
[37:07.360 --> 37:13.560]  them when you hear that monster, that anti-free speech defiler, that deceiver.
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.360]  He is the mouth of the enemy.
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.560]  So we're going to do that here in just a moment.
[37:20.560 --> 37:28.880]  If it isn't clear now, it'll never be clear that if you want to truly be part of the Second
[37:28.880 --> 37:34.000]  American Revolution, and if you really want to be part of the zeitgeist, everyone listening
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.680]  should buy a shirt at infowarstore.com.
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.520]  That finances what we're doing, our fight against the globalists, our continued operations.
[37:42.520 --> 37:43.520]  It spreads the word.
[37:43.520 --> 37:46.920]  You can get them all on lobby where you just meet fellow patriots, or if you want to wear
[37:46.920 --> 37:53.480]  a Trump 2020 shirt or a Relic 45 and go into a blue area, you might get killed, but I mean,
[37:53.480 --> 37:54.640]  it's choose your own adventure.
[37:54.640 --> 37:58.840]  We have hundreds of amazing shirts from shirts I designed 20-something years ago, like mass
[37:58.840 --> 38:03.560]  murderers agree, gun control works, politicians love disarm peasants, to the new info wars
[38:03.560 --> 38:07.000]  logo shirt and army green.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.920]  We got made America shirts, we got made Mexico shirts, it's all there for you to choose from.
[38:11.920 --> 38:19.360]  Visit infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139 and you know, a lot of people claim they want
[38:19.360 --> 38:22.720]  America to continue and they claim that they, you know, well, if I ever see UN troops, I'll
[38:22.720 --> 38:23.720]  go to war.
[38:23.720 --> 38:25.600]  Listen, we already kicked the UN troops out.
[38:25.600 --> 38:28.520]  We already took the country back at the federal level partially.
[38:28.520 --> 38:32.960]  This is an info war to silence the patriots and cause civil insurrection to bring in a
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.640]  crisis to then bring in the UN, which is officially in the strong cities initiative that Obama
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.920]  tried to launch with a little retta lynch three months before he left office.
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.680]  If you won't get involved politically now in the streets and information warfare, you'll
[38:47.680 --> 38:54.400]  never get involved if we fail in these defensive steps to try to save things peacefully.
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.000]  And I'm not bitching at the listeners and viewers, I love you, but the power of you
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.720]  wearing these shirts in public, the power of you downloading the free iPhone and drawing
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.000]  it up info wars.com, forward slash app, the new official app, much better than last app.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's excellent.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.200]  The power of you spreading the word and taking action, the power of you telling your office,
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.200]  Hey, you ever hear these bad things about Alex Jones?
[39:17.200 --> 39:18.200]  Yeah, it's all over.
[39:18.200 --> 39:19.200]  Who is he?
[39:19.200 --> 39:21.440]  What is he the guy that beat up a little kid the other day?
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.960]  Well, no, actually, it's not true here.
[39:23.960 --> 39:25.240]  Hear from him yourself.
[39:25.240 --> 39:26.240]  Find out.
[39:26.240 --> 39:32.720]  Doesn't everybody want to know the thing that everybody's so afraid of?
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.240]  Well, by the way, look at that new one.
[39:34.240 --> 39:35.240]  That shirt's brand new.
[39:35.240 --> 39:38.040]  Go to George Washington, please.
[39:38.040 --> 39:39.800]  It's it's the it's the right, right there.
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.400]  Click on that George Washington.
[39:41.400 --> 39:46.600]  That is put together by one of the former leaders of still team six who runs a big t-shirt
[39:46.600 --> 39:47.600]  companies, big Patriot.
[39:47.600 --> 39:50.000]  That was already their best seller.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.760]  And he let me put that out.
[39:53.760 --> 39:59.800]  So I'm going to say his name is one of his names on there, obviously, but and show him
[39:59.800 --> 40:00.800]  the back.
[40:00.800 --> 40:01.800]  That is an awesome shirt.
[40:01.800 --> 40:05.240]  George George Washington, not the old George Washington, nothing bad that he was old, but
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.760]  that's the young George Washington, you know, the 50 year old French India war towards Washington.
[40:10.760 --> 40:17.040]  And it says in full wars.com with the original 13 that is an out of the park shirt that everybody
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.040]  should order.
[40:18.040 --> 40:19.040]  It's amazing.
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.080]  It's 1995 with the fabric and the printing and Texas and everything.
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.400]  We're not making much money on that because it's an expensive shirt to make.
[40:25.400 --> 40:27.160]  They're all there in full or store.com.
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.480]  If you don't get them, you're insane.
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.600]  I mean, literally, I'm here frontline battling, winning, fighting, getting attacked, and I'm
[40:34.600 --> 40:35.600]  not bitching.
[40:35.600 --> 40:36.600]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.680]  But when you just commit and buy the products and then meet like-minded people, it's a whole
[40:40.680 --> 40:41.840]  new world you get involved in.
[40:41.840 --> 40:42.840]  It's a whole new adventure.
[40:42.840 --> 40:50.320]  Now that said, we have come out with two months supplies of from our research in the top studies
[40:50.320 --> 40:52.560]  and testing the cleanest fish oil.
[40:52.560 --> 40:54.480]  The fish oil is magic as everybody knows.
[40:54.480 --> 40:56.400]  So good for the heart, the brain, the body, the skin.
[40:56.400 --> 40:59.200]  But if you get it from big fish, it's got a lot of mercury and it's not good for you.
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.800]  Well, this has got the mercury extracted out of it and because the krill oil is easiest
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.720]  to do is it's so small, it doesn't bioaccumulate, amazing.
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.040]  We've got the ultimate fish oil, targeted release fish oil, so it actually goes into
[41:11.040 --> 41:14.960]  your intestines, doesn't get burned up in your gut, then your stomach, and ultimate
[41:14.960 --> 41:15.960]  fish oil.
[41:15.960 --> 41:18.600]  Now, honor rolls also over here.
[41:18.600 --> 41:19.600]  This is for your kids.
[41:19.600 --> 41:23.800]  This is all the known fish oils that are good for the brain targeting that.
[41:23.800 --> 41:25.600]  So it's amazing.
[41:25.600 --> 41:26.880]  Go look at what it does for yourself.
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.680]  But let me just show, TV viewers, if you can go study fish oil and learn about the ones
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.360]  that really matter, but this, see when they're yellow, they've been denatured.
[41:36.360 --> 41:43.600]  When they're peach, pink, orange, in fact, a lot of companies will actually dye or have
[41:43.600 --> 41:45.720]  colored gelatin caps to make it have that color.
[41:45.720 --> 41:47.600]  No, this is clear gelatin.
[41:47.600 --> 41:53.200]  This is, I mean, it took us again years to actually know that we were putting out the
[41:53.200 --> 41:58.960]  strongest, purest fish oil there is, and this is honor roll.
[41:58.960 --> 42:06.400]  This is a whole big spectrum of the known omega threes and DHA and EPA and vitamin D
[42:06.400 --> 42:08.200]  and E, so it gets uploaded.
[42:08.200 --> 42:09.760]  This for your children is unbelievable.
[42:09.760 --> 42:13.120]  It's a child-sized capital, but there's no filler.

[42:14.120 --> 42:15.440]  Let me tell you something.
[42:15.440 --> 42:21.840]  When I want energy, when I want stamina, when I want to, when I, you know, am down from

[42:26.480 --> 42:29.720]  These are so good because I went and tried to outdo a leading competitor.
[42:29.720 --> 42:31.800]  I've been giving my children this for years.
[42:31.800 --> 42:32.800]  That's rolling over there.
[42:32.800 --> 42:36.680]  I've been doing this for years, but now we've got ours in it.
[42:36.680 --> 42:37.680]  Just look at that.
[42:37.680 --> 42:38.680]  Nobody's got that.
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.680]  Nobody's got that vibrancy.

[47:02.960 --> 47:21.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.760 --> 47:43.640]  You know I didn't even cover this yesterday but on Monday I said that the Iranian National
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.920]  Guard and Hezbollah, their force around the world would launch terror attacks during a
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.520]  war with the U.S. all over the western world and they have sleeper cells inside the U.S.
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.280]  That's actually standard Iranian doctrine and in fact not in public circles but classified
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.360]  but from my own research the head of their military said that they have sleeper cells
[48:01.360 --> 48:05.960]  inside the U.S. and will attack us during a war yesterday.
[48:05.960 --> 48:08.640]  Next week's news today.
[48:08.640 --> 48:11.040]  But how about next month's news today?
[48:11.040 --> 48:12.720]  Can we pull it up?
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.560]  Now it took us about five minutes during the break because Google buries all of our results.
[48:17.560 --> 48:24.640]  But back on June 7th a month and a half ago I said according to our White House sources
[48:24.640 --> 48:32.360]  and that's a CNBC article I said according to our White House sources we're going to
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.360]  find it.
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.600]  I'll tell you that's what since Google broke their search engine it drives me crazy that
[48:38.600 --> 48:47.480]  I even tweeted it I even Facebooked it I did videos I said watch it's going to be 4.1 when
[48:47.480 --> 48:53.760]  the next quarter comes in and they announced the last quarter and I can't even find it
[48:53.760 --> 48:56.480]  because it's so buried.
[48:56.480 --> 49:03.200]  See I have this OCD thing about clips about how I can't find the things.
[49:03.200 --> 49:06.480]  I mean it's like I don't find your kids birth certificate you know what I mean and like
[49:06.480 --> 49:08.920]  you know it was in this drawer and it's not there.
[49:08.920 --> 49:12.800]  But everybody remembers I said it'd be 4.1 according to White House sources that were
[49:12.800 --> 49:19.680]  in the economic meeting hell I had Roger Stone on about it twice it'll never be found.
[49:19.680 --> 49:26.120]  I could have one trillion dollars and offer it and it would not be found.
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.320]  The video would not be found the article would not be found.
[49:30.320 --> 49:33.800]  I'll be in a coffee shop or at the grocery store in a month and some left us a walk over
[49:33.800 --> 49:38.800]  and go how do you like it beating up kids got banned on the internet for child endangerment
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.040]  beating that kid up.
[49:40.040 --> 49:46.240]  For me to get up total lie total hoax they don't care because it's a world of delusion
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.640]  it's like Stelter for a week one of our producers isn't allowed the White House because we keep
[49:50.640 --> 49:54.640]  interrupting all the questions we're being censored oh god next segment we're going to
[49:54.640 --> 50:09.880]  ban Alex Jones and we want Tucker Carlson off the air.
[50:09.880 --> 50:13.440]  I figured out what I got to do when I make a prediction which it wasn't a prediction
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.040]  we were told people in the meeting that was going to be 4.1 at least maybe 4.3 that's
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.560]  the headline that I've got to actually take it glue it to a wall there's not that many
[50:22.560 --> 50:29.800]  like one every couple days and they all come through but then it's impossible I will never
[50:29.800 --> 50:36.080]  no matter what I do no matter how hard I try no matter I'll never have it just it will
[50:36.080 --> 50:40.520]  not happen just won't this matter was multiple shows and articles and clips everywhere just
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.400]  won't happen because the search engines hide everything we do because they want to lie
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.480]  about who we are while they lie about us and destroy us so we can't respond that's how
[50:51.480 --> 50:58.480]  they operate.
[50:58.480 --> 51:09.320]  Oh there it is they found it mega agenda Trump's economy projected to grow 4% in the next quarter
[51:09.320 --> 51:15.760]  how the liberals spend the news to make Trump look bad and then but see it should be prediction
[51:15.760 --> 51:21.640]  we broke that here scroll down and then Roger goes into his White House economist that was
[51:21.640 --> 51:26.000]  it yeah yeah just he talked to the the economist that was in the meeting with Cudlow and they
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.800]  thought it could be even 4.3 but they weren't sure okay there it is okay okay wow hell just
[51:30.800 --> 51:37.320]  froze over oh my god I feel so good right now maybe I should just play that clip next
[51:37.320 --> 51:44.480]  hour because I mean I know we do this I know we predicted all and and and wasn't in prediction
[51:44.480 --> 51:49.440]  I mean they were in the meeting and they cautioned the president don't don't say this yet sir
[51:49.440 --> 51:55.840]  because stuff could happen but they thought 4.3 but they said some computer models show
[51:55.840 --> 52:02.800]  4.1 it was all between 4.1 and 4.5 one model said five you know this weeks after we said
[52:02.800 --> 52:10.000]  that there was a CNBC article that some model showed five but it was between basically four
[52:10.000 --> 52:19.360]  and 4.5 so we were saying 4.1 so well that's 6% GDP growth right there point is this is
[52:19.360 --> 52:25.400]  getting insane but it's all because oh I wasn't mad at the crew they couldn't find it Google
[52:25.400 --> 52:31.560]  buries this stuff man they're not gonna let us sit there and always be right they can't
[52:31.560 --> 52:38.600]  stand it their job is to lie Brian Stelter's job is to destroy the truth now let's go to
[52:38.600 --> 52:41.800]  what they don't want you to see this this triggered CNN now I've learned three different
[52:41.800 --> 52:46.400]  shows not just Stelter called it evil dangerous un-American ban it take it off I've got the
[52:46.400 --> 52:50.880]  articles right here they're having a big international conference we're calling for Fox News to be
[52:50.880 --> 52:56.320]  banned off Facebook here it is Facebook asked to justify info wars and Fox News deadline
[52:56.320 --> 53:06.280]  Hollywood I mean this is what's going on and then next oh here's the next four conservatives
[53:06.280 --> 53:14.040]  to be banned and you read all these articles it's like a step on my new and Steven Crowder
[53:14.040 --> 53:19.760]  and then this girl isn't as big because conservatives don't like women what it's just all I told
[53:19.760 --> 53:23.120]  everybody this is coming in now they're starting to lick their lips and go we want Joe Rogan
[53:23.120 --> 53:28.840]  and pootie pie pan too because you've got billions of viewers over the years they don't think
[53:28.840 --> 53:37.920]  Brian Stelter or Anderson Cooper who had 4,000 views on average his top was 5,000 in a show
[53:37.920 --> 53:42.400]  for Facebook they push notification millions of people and they and they paid millions
[53:42.400 --> 53:48.000]  for the show and all they've got is five four 5,000 viewers do you think Brian Stelter is
[53:48.000 --> 53:58.400]  going to let that continue no no one wants to watch some billionaire rich you know kid
[53:58.400 --> 54:10.480]  of the Asters are you off a teleprompter good lord here let's go to Anderson Cooper explaining
[54:10.480 --> 54:14.680]  that America is an afterthought no it's not an afterthought Cooper go to the final one
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.800]  percent where you get it where the enemy as the president has said here it is for more
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.200]  than a hundred years the Democratic Party was organized around the interests of ordinary
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.680]  Americans Democrats ran campaigns on things like higher wages better working conditions
[54:29.680 --> 54:34.560]  against the banks that crush their voters with debt a lot of Democratic ideas didn't
[54:34.560 --> 54:41.400]  always work some were silly but their focus was always clear American citizens were the
[54:41.400 --> 54:46.440]  majority's priority and that is no longer the case to the modern Democratic Party Americans
[54:46.440 --> 54:51.000]  are an afterthought try to find a Democrat running this year for example on the opioid
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.600]  crisis or high energy prices the collapse of public schools the decline of the middle
[54:54.600 --> 55:01.360]  class hard to find one Democrats are bored by these topics what interests them is power
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.800]  in order to win and maintain power Democrats understand they need reliable new voters
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.520]  voters will support them obediently without making difficult demands like a higher standard
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.880]  of living that's why the Democratic Party suddenly supports open borders so fervently
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.640]  immigration is really the only issue that matters to them because packing the electorate
[55:22.640 --> 55:27.560]  is the only way they can regain control of this country their goal is clear they will
[55:27.560 --> 55:32.960]  do this is so true is why they're calling for to be banned but remember the chai comms
[55:32.960 --> 55:36.800]  are funding it to Anderson is exposed so it's beyond just that they want to sell the country
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.080]  out they hate the country they've been trained and prepared for this continuum to achieve
[55:41.080 --> 55:45.400]  it here for example is the governor of new york likening the trump administration to
[55:45.400 --> 55:51.360]  islamic terrorists for the crime of daring to enforce federal immigration law watch they
[55:51.360 --> 56:00.720]  are on a jihad to deport as many people as they can who they believe are not in the united
[56:00.720 --> 56:07.920]  states legally who they believe are not in the united states legally pretty easy to determine
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.240]  whether someone's here legally or not and it wasn't that long ago that leading democrats
[56:12.240 --> 56:17.480]  like bill clinton for example argued in public that our country should deport illegal immigrants
[56:17.480 --> 56:23.680]  they're here illegally after all they're breaking our law now democrats claim that non citizens
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.880]  even illegal ones have a right to vote in our elections that is happening in san francisco
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.560]  and in parts of the state of maryland by the 2020 election it'll be happening in many other
[56:33.560 --> 56:39.200]  places that's guaranteed and remember that was a thing we made up to keep going republicans
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.240]  would be upset about this allowing illegals to occupy and run our country makes a mockery
[56:45.240 --> 56:49.840]  of citizenship it's terrible for america and it's a death sentence for the republican
[56:49.840 --> 56:56.560]  party but nope republicans on the hill seem okay with this here's one example in 2014
[56:56.560 --> 57:01.280]  the obama administration changed the rules so that anybody claiming a threat from gang
[57:01.280 --> 57:06.280]  violence or domestic abuse could get asylum in the united states the effect was to allow
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.960]  pretty much anybody to permanently enter this country provided they supplied the right story
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.240]  and many many did of course that was precisely the point to open the border so that's saying
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.640]  so well earlier this summer attorney general jeff sessions reversed the obama rule now

[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:27.240]  the info war
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:32.120]  all right if you go to the uk or you go to australia go to new zealand go to other areas
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.320]  it's not just people being banned off the internet there are christians or conservatives
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.320]  or patriots or nationalists it's being banned from countries being kicked out of nations
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:49.560]  being totally shut down the australian press celebrate the occupiers of australia our shadow
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:55.120]  ban us being restricted and then in line about what we did so we got a pastor who's been
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.560]  persecuted joining us from australia and what unfolded coming up in the next segments this
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.640]  is a serious situation we're gonna be looking at it but take the crew they're not the ones
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.880]  that were bad earlier i want to be clear about not being able to find our prediction
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:18.160]  from may put it back on screen before anybody else did with economists in the white house
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.680]  meeting with cutlow looking at computer projections for the quarter when it ended being between
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:30.040]  four and four point five percent maybe even higher we exclusively broke white house economists
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:36.640]  predicts four plus percent growth rate scroll back up to the top on may twenty first it
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.640]  wasn't till the middle of june you started hearing that from cnbc now again that's just
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:50.600]  another bombshell we broke first with exclusive intel and what has google done they've already
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.680]  delisted us they've already banned us from google ads they've already done all this youtube's
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:03.680]  already blocking us we're subsidiary but now you try to search info wars dot com you try
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.800]  to search i mean we ourselves google is a broken search engine it does not work i came
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.640]  back during the break and i said stop using google you are not going to find anything
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.120]  we do i go microsoft is bad but it's like the whole google it halfway works it's at least
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.200]  somewhat fair use bang and i said no that's how we just found it on bang and start page
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.960]  is great it's a virtual browser but it kind of uses google and others so you're still going
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:34.040]  through them and i'm going to do a study of search engines because google until about
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:39.320]  three years ago was the best big search engine but now it's just i mean you try to get anything
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:48.800]  christian gun nationalistic it's all force fed the results are all paid and twitter censoring
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.080]  they're all doing it they're shadow banning everybody remember we've been talking about
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.600]  shadow banning for five years i was on the phone congressman two weeks ago saying you're
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.600]  going to be shadow ban you're already being blocked look at our report they're only wood
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.800]  wood and finally they looked and now it's a big story and i'm like i'm not that important
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  if they're shadow banning trump on twitter for three years we're almost none of his push
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.160]  notifications go out you've got to go to his twitter to see it or the media is dumb enough
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:22.640]  to pick it up then you see it the president should understand that i talked to folks that
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:29.760]  talked to the president he didn't even understand this till a month ago now he understands it
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.160]  now he's pointed out it's illegal so don't ever think your voice is small because all
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.280]  of us that understand this our voices are huge together and this is a big time to be alive
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.440]  but we're going to retweet this at real alex jones they shadow ban it but you can still
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.200]  say look at shadow ban we're going to put it out flashback we should flashback in full
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:56.320]  wars dot com broke 4.1 percent growth rate in may and just have a screenshot of our article
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.080]  and a link right to it we need to have a flashback right now because again they keep saying
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.680]  we're fake news and they lie about what we said they create fake news and say that we
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:10.400]  said the fake news and then blame us and facebook came out and said no jones did not beat up
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:18.200]  a child you know jones did not uh so that nobody died at parkland jones did not do these things
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.240]  but didn't matter the pressure got put on the corporates and they banned us on our main
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.320]  site reaching you know millions of subscribers and sure you say oh well you're on a sub site
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.360]  still streaming at least we're on 200 plus radio stations hundreds and hundreds of tv
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.000]  stations 80 plus cable stations that's great the point is is that if they can shut us down
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.560]  they can shut everybody down and now they're calling for everybody else to be shut down
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.960]  so i keep harping on this because globally they're making their move against the west
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.360]  against christianity the chai comms are funding it from australia to the us they're the ones
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.080]  doing it and if we wake up to that as a culture it will unify us around free speech and we
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:59.440]  will win if we don't wake up they're going to win the midterms i want to plow into all
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:05.600]  of this but i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:13.480]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:20.480]  from infowarstore.com you are funding the revolution i mean i cannot say it any clearer and so

[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:09.280]  against us so we need your support
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:19.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones over 20 years ago alex jones
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.280]  created the media platform called info wars and in the decade since it's grown into a
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:29.920]  truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates tens of millions of unique
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.440]  website visitors monthly and a 24 7 live news tv channel broadcasting from state of the
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.760]  art studios in austin texas info wars has become the most trusted independent news source
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.440]  in the country dedicated to delivering breaking news live coverage of special events and exclusive
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.960]  reports you won't find anywhere else while the old guard media struggles to maintain
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.920]  supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation and technology info wars has been at the forefront
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:04.840]  of the information revolution from 8 million radio listeners over 2 million youtube subscribers
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:10.360]  or the billions of views of our online content info wars proves dominant in every facet of
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:17.480]  media we enter for the hardest hitting reports uncompromising analysis for high profile interviews
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:28.480]  and bombshell revelations except no substitutes demand truth demand info wars info wars tomorrow's
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.760]  news today all right coming up to the last 45 minutes of the sour three quarters the
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.800]  broadcast of the sour we're going to be talking to a pastor who's being demonized who's being
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.320]  lied about who's being ostracized is being deported to foreign countries for preaching
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.560]  the gospel in australia and new zealand that's coming up a pastor logan robertson whether
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.400]  you agree with what he says or disagree actually go hear what he has to say not what the media
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.240]  says because let me explain something and others just i keep saying it but i'm gonna
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.880]  break this down the level of dis info and lives that we see out of corporate dinosaur
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:12.960]  media all over the world now is five times more insane than during the campaign because
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.120]  they were worried to push too hard and wake people up before with their lives so they
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.320]  they rigged debates and they lied and they did and they said hillary didn't fall down
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.080]  and all that they said anybody that votes for conservatives is a racist or whatever but
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:32.200]  it didn't work so they went well we have no choice but to go all the way in now why is
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.040]  cnn the new york times the washington post bbc i mean literally thousands of publications
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:44.200]  a day saying ban info wars it's not about us because once they set the president for
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.120]  us it's everybody and sure enough they're saying ban fox news off twitter and facebook
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.120]  sure enough they're saying ban tucker carlson because they know he's the most on target
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:09:00.000]  ban sean hannity they're making their move because they're desperate and they're trying
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.840]  to cause civil unrest they're trying to cause riots i've got all these videos on info wars
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.680]  dot com we'll get to next hour where i mean they are just beating up christians conservatives
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:14.600]  the left is out in force it is crazy polosi and maxine waters are calling for all this
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:21.600]  violence and then they misrepresent with hoaxes just like they launched the first iraq war
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.520]  claiming that babies were throwing incubators the brain stomped out they're saying that
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:33.360]  i beat up a kid in missouri in cnn forbes they had to retract it but didn't matter by
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.440]  then and that's why my youtube channel was blocked no it wasn't i showed abc news showing
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:44.680]  this kid punching a guy in the face so the guy pushes him down but again that you have
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.680]  to understand why would they tell such blatant lies when they're so verifiably false because
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.800]  they're planning something big they're making their move not just here but worldwide with
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.960]  civil unrest with election fraud with all these cities legalizing illegal aliens voting
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.960]  who's always denied they were doing they're making their move you can feel it your gut
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:11.360]  your spirit you can see it and it's because big corporate governments in trouble the communist
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.600]  chinese are in trouble hollywood's in trouble the nfl's got thirty forty percent less viewers
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:23.360]  same with hollywood they paid tens of millions of dollars eighteen million dollars for anderson
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:33.720]  cooper to launch this big vaunted hyped everywhere show daily on facebook and they put push notifications

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.200]  banned us on facebook our average video had a million two million views i mean i could
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.320]  sit at my dinner table and do one at midnight and have a million views then i got calls

[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.760]  folks you'll be part of this trusted guardian group are gonna set up that years later they've
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.840]  now set up they just said just play ball let's stop bashing look come meet and get our agenda

[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.720]  it was like five million ten million views of videos like god almighty they were just
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.160]  letting my viewers see me didn't play ball they restricted it down to you know a couple
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.600]  hundred thousand and two and then they crushed that down what they found is they did big studies
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.160]  on it last week the news put it out everybody copied it put it elsewhere so they realized
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.000]  what i already knew it was a feeder it was a feeder and i don't want to put out a lot
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.480]  of ten million people and put the truth out to a thousand because then it will grow the
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.680]  truth grows a lie can go halfway around the world for the truth puts its pants on but
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.280]  the lie doesn't have roots it just blows over in the wind use a biblical analogy for the
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.120]  seeds fall on the rocks the birds eat it i want stuff i'd rather have one big oak tree
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.280]  that's there for a thousand years and a bunch of stuff that just blows away and you know
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.120]  a thousand little plants come up the first sun comes out in the summer and it's all
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:22.200]  dead that's not a place to put a swing set up for my kids that's not that's not a future
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.680]  is it see so i want real people i don't want fluff i don't want hype i don't want deception
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:34.960]  i want the diamonds i don't want the the the the chaff and that's why they're so angry
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.200]  is that can you imagine their full push and push notifications to millions of people saying
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.200]  anderson cooper is on with all the hype on every channel anderson cooper like like god
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:51.680]  was returning to earth like and they shoot it like it's low tech and they have like honking
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:13:00.880]  cars in the background like oh it's low tech four thousand viewers per twenty minutes ladies
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:07.120]  and gentlemen a teenager picking their nose has more viewers they're dead you can't make
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.200]  people watch it you can't make them listen and so they look at us despite everything
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.280]  they've done gaining hundreds of tv stations all this they don't know what to do so they
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.160]  want it all and they want it now so they're going to engage in fraud and bullying used
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.560]  to CNN would run months of propaganda to invade some terrible country now they run months of
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:35.560]  propaganda four months of every day shut down alex jones to get a couple strikes and freeze
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:43.560]  us live streaming they're pathetic it's not that i'm that strong it's that they're that
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:51.720]  weak they're pathetic but we still even republican congressman see it and say something nice
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:58.200]  about be all be nice it's like you're a trained seal it'd be like a mouse train a lion to
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:05.160]  grovel before it but it's like like a bacteria training a lion to bow before it it's it's
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:11.040]  it's a it's a hoax it's all a joke they're done unless they can cause a civil war unless
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.080]  they can cause garbage we'll go out to break with a clip of mark dies the full clips at
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.680]  mark dies dot com where he goes over the numbers of four thousand viewers on average during
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:24.000]  his twenty minute show the cost eighteen million dollars shot on an iphone is a sick joke showing
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  the disconnect of these people will come back with the next level of persecution actually
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.760]  like china's doing not letting you fly not letting you live in a country going after
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.240]  you with this global social score here's a clip yesterday anderson cooper kicked off
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.240]  his brand new facebook livestream which he's going to be doing five days a week which facebook
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.600]  is paying cnn to produce let's take a look and see how it went now as i said remarkable
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.480]  it didn't take long for democrats of chastise president trump probably no surprise there
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.480]  some republicans also condemned the president most notably senator john mccain said in
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.720]  a statement i want to read part of it to you you may be wondering what that noise is in
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.680]  the background and it's actually an audio track that they played throughout the entire
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:11.120]  broadcast tried to be like some cool hip millennial youtube vlogger which plays annoying background
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  music during their entire youtube video later in the show he was joined by jimacosta and
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.920]  as you can see by the live viewer count here they didn't even have 5000 people turning
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.800]  into the stream and look at this they're formatting the show vertically for mobile devices because
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.000]  apparently their audience doesn't know that you can turn your phone sideways and expand
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  it full screen when you're watching media later in the stream anderson decided to answer
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.440]  some audience questions to make the show interactive and by that time the viewership had dropped
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:46.920]  down to under 4000 people what story did you do that had a long lasting effect you can't

[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:24.880]  to cnn's so-called a reporter mr darcy who sent us a comment last night to see if we
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.720]  wanted to get a comment on the story he says does info wars or alex jones have a comment
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.240]  on facebook removing four videos from its pages so you can pretend like he's a journalist
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.000]  and not an anti-free speech hack that's a mr darcy you're asking me for comment about
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.400]  facebook removing videos that you and your organization lobby to be removed my comment
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:51.320]  is this cnn its parent company time Warner a part of the organization and i continue

[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:09.240]  to be bankrupted and for us to be de-platformed across the internet your activity is extremely
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.280]  criminal and unamerican it's i would add defamatory building a straw man so you can then have
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.400]  a public lynching your campaign against competing news organizations and the first amendment
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:26.320]  is outrageously anti-american and will not succeed long term america is aware and awake
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:33.040]  to you and cnn cnn is beyond fake news cnn is a criminal combine working destroy the first
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.960]  amendment you can send him any emails you want to go into a black hole the point is
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:46.680]  is that they're dead already politically i don't mean physically before they jones threatened
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:53.480]  darcy with death i mean politically they're dead there's no fruit off this tree and if
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.920]  you want to look at where we're going to be germany and australia and other places have
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:02.720]  great people in them but they arrest you if you criticize islam on facebook they hired
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.800]  former stasi especially in new zealand australia they're cracking down on people and we are
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:16.800]  joined by pastor logan robertson is born and raised in zealand he is grateful that he
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.040]  was raised in a loving christian home and was saved as a young child he's happily married
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.880]  for almost 12 years and the lord blessed him with five children but now it's in the news
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.320]  that he's been deported from his own country sent into the phantom zone deported new zealand
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.560]  pastor logan robertson now shows no remorse for harassing sissy muslims that's the media
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:47.920]  spin oh my god it's not the muslims killing us and so we've also got lauren southern and
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.960]  stefan malinu they're now calling for being banned they're not allowed to operate in australia
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:57.120]  either so this is happening but well a man with no country a stranger in a strange land
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.720]  pastor logan this is a short statement long statement coming up boil down for people what
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.160]  actually happened to you what's going on the next level of tyranny before we get into the
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.480]  specifics of you know all little fine details just the basics of what happened alright thanks
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:20.000]  for having me on um so on the earlier this month on the 4th of july we went to a mosque
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.200]  we were making a documentary expose in islam and we're asking the imam if we could do an
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.760]  interview with him once he you know he said to bring him back we're leaving there are
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:40.480]  some young teenagers yelled out um a few words to us when we were leaving and so i just i
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:46.320]  just turned around and asked them you know how old was aisha which was one of muhammad's
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.520]  many wives and he couldn't answer me so i called him a sissy and then we left the next
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.520]  day we had an interview set up at a different another mosque we went there and the media
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:07.200]  just turned up surrounded us um we didn't have our own interview obviously and the media
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.440]  just turned up after that the the next day the police arrest me they arrest three other
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:20.160]  men from our church then you know i i get out on bail then the border patrol turn up
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.680]  this is in australia the border patrol turn up take me from my house and then put me in
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:31.960]  a detention center for 12 days before they send me back to new zealand where i was born
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:37.640]  but i was as a new zealand citizen you're allowed to live in australia for as long as
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:43.560]  you like and you can work in australia but if you talk bad about islam you know you get
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.080]  sent back um i'm i'm not in new zealand at the moment i'm on a mission trip in the philippines
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:56.000]  but that that's the quick quick rundown it's just crazy because the headline is deported
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  new zealand password that means deported from australia to new zealand why do you think
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.200]  all the western world they cover up this latest islamic attack in toronto they cover it all
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:14.440]  up they're just obsessed the police the government with covering up for islam globally well i'm
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:19.760]  not a hundred percent sure why they do it but i think they just wanted to take over in the
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.760]  western countries i'm not a hundred percent sure why but the bible says in ephesians six
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:30.640]  that we wrestle not against flesh and blood very against the higher powers of this world
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.200]  and it's obviously the higher powers that are you know trying to promote islam and they
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:44.320]  don't want christians you know in the western countries any more describe what it's like
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:53.400]  though to to watch this invasion and just other observations yeah well in new zealand
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:27:01.640]  is is not as bad but australia you know they they let muslims in you know just freely like
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:08.840]  i believe there's 600 000 muslims in australia now and there's about 20 24 million people
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.320]  and but it's increasing you know day by day they're bringing in all the muslim refugees
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:21.840]  and you know parts of sydney is is pretty much sharia law there i watched a lady there
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.480]  was in there the other you know a few days ago and the police told her that she wasn't
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:32.480]  even allowed to you know talk to anybody in the streets there just because you know might
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:41.360]  cause um you know public disturbance just were talking to muslims so i'm not i'm not
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.080]  sure what it's like also read about just all the crimes being committed not just in australia
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.240]  but in europe you name it and then they just cover it up and a large portion of the muslims
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:58.000]  never get jobs that's right in australia a lot of them are unemployed and there are i
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:06.080]  i i know in malvern there is big you know gangs of um of muslims there from africa which
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.040]  cause a lot of problems and they you know they go to prison maybe for a little while
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.720]  or they get released on bail but they don't get sent back you know to their their country
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.720]  they're allowed to stay in australia we're about to go to break we're going to play
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.280]  some of these clips when we come back pretty powerful stuff let me ask you this am i wrong
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.080]  to say from what i read when i hear that australia and new zeal and starting to wake
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.000]  up though yeah i i believe there's a there's a lot of people that are waking up to this
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.040]  and you know hearing the truth about that you know it is a wicked false religion that

[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:02.000]  to pastor logan robertson who has been so demonized so misrepresented with with with
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:09.160]  what he's done pillar baptist org he has he there is an islamic invasion not not just
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:15.600]  of australia and new zealand but all over the philippines you know right into indonesia
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:24.320]  all of it is it is just massive and so he's been critical of it he went out to a mosque
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.480]  pointed out mohammed married a nine-year-old and then he was going to another mosque the
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.200]  next day and the police showed up like he was the devil because he was trying to proselytize
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.760]  and politely talk to play some of this audio and video for listeners of him showing up
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.520]  and then them deporting him even though under a british commonwealth he has a right to be
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:46.120]  there back to new zealand and then now he's in the philippines but let's go ahead and
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:52.120]  play this club here it is mohammed married a six-year-old he's a pedophile what do you
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.280]  want to achieve man we're making a documentary about your false religion that's what we're
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.720]  trying to do what's false about it what do you mean by that because they believe in work
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.960]  salvation they follow a prophet that was a pedophile that married a six-year-old and
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.960]  possibly made it that marriage when she was nine nine years old that's raping a child
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.600]  it's disgusting how many wives did you get so angry and raise your voice like that he's
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.400]  having a civil conversation he's having a civil conversation
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:22.560]  hey pause look at these leftist reporter hacks whether it's in germany or the us or australia
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.760]  they're all the same just hateful hatefully hate christians they hate bitter clingers
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.920]  but they love to defend the most radical forms of islam that kills more muslims than anybody
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.320]  else because i don't hate all muslims i don't whatever the point is the globalists just
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:41.640]  are absolutely bullying everybody to cover this up continue because i hate the religion
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:48.440]  i don't hate muslims i hate the religion oh hit pause they let muslims go on and say that christianities
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.000]  of false religion blah blah blah kill the infidels i'm not saying violence but then you have stuff
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.120]  like this oh they'll try to restrict it so so again why is the touchstone radical islam
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.880]  why can't people talk about it we'll discuss it but whether you agree with this pastor or not
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  should he then be deported he's not supposed to deport anybody member under the global system
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.120]  for this out of a british commonwealth to another which violates his rights but let's just uh
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:37.080]  uh let's uh go ahead and finish up with this club
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:45.960]  that's what you're doing we've seen the videos about the videos did you call me a terrorist i did not call me a terrorist
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.920]  i did not call me a terrorist you did man i did not you're so you're lying now you went into the
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.160]  show show us the video of me calling them a tiramisu call show me the what was your purpose of going
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.480]  to the mosque because i had a question we were setting up interviews for our new documentary
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.400]  what's documentary and the permission to go to a private property like to do the permission to
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:08.760]  come here you don't have permission to go to kind of rails can you wait there you don't have permission
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.280]  like it's like it's a police state so so it it goes on from there the islamists know they've got
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.520]  the government backing the media backing and then and then after the cameras are cut off get into what
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:27.400]  happened next um after after that we we left and we got pulled over just around the corner
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:33.560]  um they searched searched our car i'm not even like in new zealand they wouldn't be
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:40.840]  allowed to do that but in australia they searched our car they took all our camera equipment um
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:48.760]  and they let us go at that point after they you know and talk to us and talk about gear
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.760]  and then when did you get grabbed and arrested and taken out of the country
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:02.120]  uh that that was the next day the next morning i was arrested taken into the police station
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:09.160]  for a few hours and then they they let me out and they charged me for four four different accounts
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:17.160]  two for public nuisance one for trespass on private property and one for entering in with
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:23.240]  their tend to steal things from their mosque and then i had to walk home from the police
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.640]  station for three hours because they wouldn't give me a ride home and that's how it works though under
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.920]  i'm notice under the kind of commonwealth stuff it's it's it's it's exponential like they do one
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.720]  thing they do another because they've learned people don't resist if you just just keep doing it in
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:46.760]  waves to them right yeah and and then that evening i got home at roughly six p.m i sat down for a meal
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:54.920]  with my family put the kids to bed and then about eight o'clock border patrol stole my house just
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:02.520]  take me handcuff me take me to their their holding cell and that's right they won't take all these
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.560]  llamasists and everybody pouring in from north africa you name it just boom they don't even get
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:12.600]  jobs and just run around you though commonwealth citizen you are going to be so so the war patrol
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:19.640]  is for you not them yeah i believe sir i mean in the detention scenes prison that i was in
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:26.760]  there was maybe a hundred people there there was only maybe one muslim out of all of them
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.360]  most of them were just new zealanders getting sent back to the new zealand and then also other
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:42.200]  commonwealth countries england um island so well that's always the story uh europe's not even for
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:47.560]  europeans now i mean that's what we're told us it's bad i mean well they just announced yesterday
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:53.160]  the un wants 600 million people to enter the us the next 10 years and they're going to organize
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.280]  them into the weapon system a two to one vote to totally enslave her body and it's not even the
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.560]  folks being brought in are bad it's that they're being brought in by the globalist so they're
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:08.920]  controlled by them it's quite a quite a system yeah no yeah obviously i i love muslims and you
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:15.480]  know in fact yesterday i gave the the gospel to a muslim here in the philippines and she
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.520]  trusted jesus as the savior believed that he was the son of god so i love muslims it's just
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.800]  you know there are a few bad ones out there just love it in the air well sure i mean the
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.560]  globalists are definitely betting on it but but but so you're really committing the big sin
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:35.080]  though you're actually converting muslims christianity yeah yeah in fact we've had we've had
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:41.960]  quite a lot converted it all in the philippines yeah so the good news is they're not stopping
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:45.880]  your message you know but i mean let me guess do you feel even stronger under the suppression
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:54.840]  oh yeah i i'm obviously sad that this happens because i love living there but on the scheme of
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:01.400]  things i'm rejoicing the bible says to you know leap of joy when we're persecuted so i'm happy about
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:08.680]  it i'm sure god's god is going to turn it into good well the philippines just really under
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.920]  islamic attack for folks that don't know there's killings by islamists every day in the philippines
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:19.320]  they're really trying to take that area over yeah oh that that's on the island um of mind
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:25.960]  now on the south island that's that's actually where i am right now um where there's a large
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:32.840]  muslim population and it is there's martial law here at the moment um you know there's checkpoints
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:39.640]  everywhere um but these muslims haven't been here for a long time but they you know they're fighting
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:46.600]  no no out of north africa the middle east going back four hundred years they had a slave trade
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.240]  on ships all the way out to indonesia and back so yeah that's why that's all there
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:56.360]  um you know we learned the transatlantic slave trade from the islamist
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:04.040]  yeah and look that's fine i just always hear about whites invented slavery no the modern
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.760]  transatlantic slave trade of 600 years ago was literally learned from arab slave traders and
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.880]  then europe finally picked it up because slavery wouldn't be accepted in europe they would export
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:20.120]  the slaves to the new world so i always hear about all the black muslims join islam because they
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.520]  think it's anti-slavery but in in in all these african countries where the muslims run things
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.000]  they have reinstituted slavery and they say that blacks are subhuman i disagree with that
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:38.120]  yes sir and it's pretty amazing what you know that that that that like in in in north africa
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.280]  that that the the ahabias say that blacks really aren't human and actually can slave them
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.520]  yeah i mean obviously black people we love black people as well you know there's no
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:55.240]  no i know you don't i'm just saying under under the radical forms of islam the ahabias blacks
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:05.480]  can be put into slavery years ago info wars life created the powerful micho zx formula to help you

[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:16.680]  all right we have mike adams coming in here and you know i'm not good at hyping things i'm really
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.160]  not i tend to just say things upfront the most powerful stuff with no pomp and circumstance but
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.440]  mike adams wrote the report paul watson helped put it out we had people get into the president
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:31.320]  and then they shadow banned a bunch of conservative congressmen and women right after we told them
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:36.200]  it was happening they like completely shadow banned them like 97 percent and now congressman
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:41.320]  gauges i feel violated i feel raped good buddy i'm glad you now understand where we're at
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.880]  the CNN headline will be jones calls for congressmen to be raped i'm saying no i'm glad you now are
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:58.120]  awake so we've reached an epic point here and we do have the ear of patriots in the government
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:03.240]  and corporations and a lot of them are intimidated a lot of them you know we're specialists they do
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:06.840]  what they do and they work and they're they're conformist even though they're not bad people
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:13.800]  they're looking for unconformists like pastor robertson and and like you and like me to do this so
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.280]  so i'm going to explain this again just like everything i keep telling you comes true it's
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:24.120]  not that i'm that smart it's formulaic in fact this is so obvious that after they tried to ban us
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:30.200]  they try to ban tucker carlsson fox news steven krauter stefan malinu why because they're their
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:39.400]  listenerships going straight up and so when tucker carlsson comes out and says they're trying to
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:44.040]  ban alex jones they'll ban everybody they ban alex jones and they all attack him he knew what they do
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:49.880]  when he did that so i respect people that aren't cowards and carlsson isn't even doing that for me
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:50:00.600]  he's doing that for his kids i mean carlsson's a patriot you know his dad ran voice for america
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:05.880]  you know what that means and he knows a real clear and present danger to this country and
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.040]  it's only carlsson and maybe a lou dobbs and a sean hannity the i mean uh the laura ingrams and
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.760]  people turned against trump when he met with putin which he should have already done
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.280]  these people don't have the medal it takes we're not all just trying to get a bigger house or a
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:28.040]  bigger jet airplane we will lose everything this is a total takeover and i've got the articles
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:33.480]  the moment police try to stop far right activists lauren southern from walking past
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:42.280]  a mosque in australia because she might offend muslims there is this leftist sycophantic worship
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:50.280]  of radical islam and just the most disgusting prostration before it because it's part of a
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:58.440]  larger plan so just finishing up with that with pastor logan of pillar baptist.org watching
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:04.760]  them gang up on you watch them do all this and then watch them you know just the things they've
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:08.840]  done to australians in new zealanders the way they bullied the population i know they're great
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.240]  people there but i know they're close to getting control of their governments again that's what
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:19.160]  they're really afraid of uh so i just want to commend the work you've done and appreciate what
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:25.960]  you're doing hope folks will support you and and and you know get updates from you but what else do
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:30.360]  you want to add do you agree with what i've said disagree i mean what's the what's the essence of
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:36.440]  in your in your gut your spirit of what we face yeah well i can see there's a big like you're
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:44.920]  saying a censorship of the truth because i've done videos against the prime minister of new zealand
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:52.040]  which is a communist you know hippie jacinda ardern and when i put that video onto youtube
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:59.080]  you know straight away the views just they won't go up at all they'll just stay at like 200 to 300
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:05.320]  views but you can see that people are liking it you can see that there's um comments but they won't
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:10.440]  put the views up at all well they're shadow banning you they they because they know their idea is a
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:20.840]  failed system it's oppressive but but exactly yeah and also like there's also a a big legal battle
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:28.040]  that we have to now face and someone started a go fund me account for our church they it got up to
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:34.040]  $10,000 and then go find me shut it down because all the the left wingers you know does it keep
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:39.800]  harassing everybody always talks about hitler hitler hitler and they overuse it but hitler put
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:46.600]  people in economic ghettos first for four or five years till they were forgotten and weak then he
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.320]  shipped them off and that's what's happening to christians conservatives libertarians all the world
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:56.760]  we're being deplatformed and now it's the nra now it's going to be fox news so instead of rolling
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:07.320]  over to this we should say no yes sir yeah there's um just so you know on my own youtube and facebook
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:11.080]  they they they censor it all the time that they don't want the truth out there
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:20.920]  i i hear you're fighting the charges in australia um but just yes for people that don't know i mean
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:25.480]  describe describe because i saw the arrogant bearing of the islamists with the police the
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:30.040]  media i mean they they know they've got the establishment on their side how are the muslims
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:34.280]  taking it knowing the full night of the west is here to help them like a knife draw them across our
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:42.680]  neck yeah i'm not sure how they are but you know with the three other men in our church they i've
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:47.240]  i couldn't go to court because i was deported so they put a warrant out for my arrest now in australia
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:53.320]  now the other three men they're pleading not guilty it's also going to cost a lot of money to
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:59.240]  fight this but the the lawyer said that these charges are not from the police they're from
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.240]  higher up in government because the police would never charge you for these things normally
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.680]  but they still need to pay for it i mean the real people on trial should be the magistrates
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:12.280]  that took part in this criminal activity right yeah i mean i don't know why we have to end up paying
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:19.880]  for you know or our legal costs when it was if the media never turned up then none of this would
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.560]  have happened i'd still be in australia everything would be fine well exactly they showed up the
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.680]  police and everybody wanted to grovel and but see that's the issue as thomas everson said when
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.160]  the government fears the people there is liberty when the people for the government there is
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.360]  tearing and the fact that they would take peaceful pastors coming to cover a news thing
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:43.400]  that were invited to a mosque the mosque is inviting you in the fact that they would do all this
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:48.200]  shows the true criminal activity pillar baptist.org people should go there find out more what you're
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:53.880]  doing we look forward to talking to you again pastor god bless okay thank you and again whether
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.360]  you agree or disagree with what the media said about this guy and i find that all be a misrepresentation
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:04.760]  you should support the free speech issue in all of this now i haven't gotten to all the footage
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:11.960]  that we have today that's up on info wars.com and news wars.com of patriots being attacked by leftists
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:18.520]  all over the country it is exponentially uh getting worse right now and it is racial i love hispanic
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.400]  people i love white people up we're all the same i mean you could technically argue because i'm like
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:29.800]  a little bit native american hispanic hispanola is just was the island of uh that's uh now the
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:35.160]  Dominican republican Haiti it was called hispanola and then 500 years ago a sugarcane plantation so
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:40.520]  if you were like somebody out of that they would call you hispanic i think latino would be a better
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:45.320]  term which just means latin language but it doesn't matter the point is is that
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:53.320]  i find latinos and people if you actually talk to them easier to wake up to what's going on
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.240]  than than most groups on average so i don't want to make those groups an enemy that they
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.680]  they've had the kids they didn't deport their kids they're good people they're the future of america
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.920]  so let's let's let's not make them enemies but i got a good hundred videos i've seen
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.800]  where you get a group of hispanic people beating up white folks beating up women you name an enemy
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.360]  you know i would be really offended if i saw a bunch of white people beating up hispanics or vice
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:20.120]  versa um the hispanics are you know white and native american and sometimes a little bit of mix
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:25.640]  of african in there so you know we're all the same people and it's just really stupid and it's
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.400]  dumb and we're going to lose this fight against the globalists if we're fighting with each other
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:35.800]  over this crap but these folks have been told that donald trump hates them and so they go out to the
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:41.480]  donald trump star and you know they see guys in american flags they attack them and it's it's it's
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:50.520]  just total idiocy uh and pathetic and it's it's all being planned towards this fall for a big crisis
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.640]  and that's why they want to censor those of us they're exposing it because they want to take
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.720]  place so the country is in grave danger and i can set up here with a nice smile about all this
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.200]  and everything but uh you don't just think trump getting in was the beginning of the victory uh
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:07.320]  that's not going to happen once we take action trump winning was not the victory it was the beginning
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:13.560]  and um the globalists now are awake they're making their move and it's very sad to watch them
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:18.520]  in the footage i've got a black people beating up white people in california yesterday and
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:24.040]  hispanics attacking whites and just believing it's okay because you like america f america
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.280]  how they were trained to hate the country they want to be part of is the mind control in the
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.640]  essence of evil please don't forget we've got the new amazing krill oil fish oil and roll call

[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.400]  if you don't tell them about the verboten nature of the show and then hey they're trying to shut
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.960]  this down people won't understand what's happening the enemy will win and and and scumbags like
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:54.200]  brian stelter he thinks you're weak he's a little weak twisted evil person spiritually but he has
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:00.120]  the energy to dominate and he thinks it's a big joke that he sees more superior men and women
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.600]  under his control he can't believe that he's having such a heyday with you and it's only because
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:11.480]  you've been unconscious let's go out a little mayberry peace here then we'll come back from break
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:16.040]  mike adams who is taking action we really appreciate mike he took action he wrote the
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.600]  report paul got it out it got to the president now the domino is almost falling we've almost
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.680]  got the censorship exposed we're almost going to route these people but without you promoting it
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:30.520]  and god without me manning up it's my organizational skills are crap and getting the full force out
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.840]  because we've got the enemy's destruction in our hand but we don't launch it we just don't
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.280]  deliver it down the pike we will do it though god help me here it is
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.240]  the british are coming the british are coming
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:52.440]  now the ride of paul revere sent the nation on its ear and the shock that lexington heard
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:59.880]  around the world when the british fired in the early dawn the war of independence had begun the
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:08.040]  die was cast the rebel flag unfurled and on to concord march the fold to seize the arsenal there
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:15.720]  you know waiting folks searching all around till i malicious stopped them in their tracks at the
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:23.400]  old north bridge we turn them back chase those red ghosts back to boston town and the shot around
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:33.000]  the world was a start from the revolution the men men were ready on the move take your power take
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:40.600]  your gun report to general washington hurry man there's not an hour to lose what happened that
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.640]  they had planned if the british was ever to come over here that they had put a light up in this
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:52.840]  high church steeple and paul went down there to look and showing up there was the light burning
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:59.400]  brighter than paul he jumped on his old horse and he lit out he didn't know where he was going but
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.120]  he knew he had to go somewhere oh i wish you could have seen it that old horse with his ears laid
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.800]  back in his nostrils wide open a sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them cobblestones
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.840]  striking off sparks paul are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.360]  he says the british is coming the british is coming get you a gun we're gonna have us a revolution
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  and them farmers come up piling out of the hay like beat out of beehive minute men there's called
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:32.520]  what's that mean minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and when paul
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:37.480]  comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and hid out behind the weeds and
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:43.480]  walls and trees and everywhere and when the british come pranks and long haul dressed up and
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:48.920]  and in their red suits they let them have it it was a sight to see
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:01.960]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:07.320]  leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:14.440]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:21.160]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:27.160]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:33.800]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:40.280]  were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:46.520]  as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:53.000]  that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  water filtration system will purify it
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:13.000]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:26.280]  it was back on may 29th that rozan bar made the tweet about valerie jaret that put a screeching
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:32.840]  halt to her mega successful reboot that gave a voice to middle america and i was uh so sad
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:38.360]  that people thought it was racist and then i went into the whole thing about the whole
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:43.960]  discussion of racism and that blew my mind because it's so much a part of what the show
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:50.280]  i was doing was about and i'm like why can they not see my work and and then i got really messed
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:57.160]  up thinking in this world it seems as if words matter more than actions but in the real life
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:04.120]  world actions matter more than words and my actions over 30 years as an artist and a comedian
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:11.480]  and i've always been you know i love this we've got power towards all we've got all these videos
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:17.160]  out there just of the left screaming inward at the ice people all the rest of it the craziest
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:22.120]  race baiting white people are inherently evil and then rozan bar says that he's a nazi collaborator
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:27.240]  george soros and then she's got to apologize that she goes on hanity to fall on her sword over some
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:33.720]  stupid sitcom that a bunch of zombies watch i mean i'm just sick of it but but but here's
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:37.960]  the big article that went out a week and a half ago they got picked up now you see the president
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:42.200]  saying shadow banning is illegal he's going to investigate it congressman gates has gone from
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:48.280]  supporting it a week ago uh to saying it's terrible he feels violated emergency big text plot to kill
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:53.480]  free speech revealed we're going to retweet that at real alex jones because they hate it and then
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:59.160]  there is the master censorship plan decoded that mike adams put together and it's 50 something
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:04.440]  pages it got to the president so mike now i know for a fact got to the president you you see a week
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:09.880]  and a half later he's saying yesterday it's illegal the shadow ban so at least we're forcing it out in
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:15.320]  the open what they've been doing they were so arrogant to put shadow bans on all the republicans
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:20.600]  even though they have voting power they've now now begun to back off of that at least on the
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.840]  surface we know they'll creep back in later but this is a big deal thanks for coming in with us
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:29.960]  thank you alex thanks for having me here and what's extraordinary about what's happening today is
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:34.600]  that twitter now is denying that they're shadow banning the president even as they are shadow
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:38.840]  banning the president so they're they're saying that they're not shadow banning anybody but you
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.320]  just can't find their tweets unless you go directly to their page and look look for them
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:48.360]  really really hard that's shadow banning that that's i mean hey jack that's shadow banning
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:52.200]  they're in a state of denial alex and the thing is here's here's what really hit me in the last
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:57.480]  couple of days in listening to your show and going through some of what i've experienced is that
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:04.520]  these people on the left these tech giants they are part of a what they want to be a cultocracy
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:11.400]  a cult of fanaticism and they absolutely will not stop unless they are forced to stop and they're
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:17.160]  manned by a bunch of sjw is they they defame us it's not about us but they defame me say things i
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:21.320]  didn't say remove the videos and then facebook identically does the same thing well this is
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.440]  the other thing the aclu should should give you an award for being a champion of freedom of speech
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:32.200]  where's the aclu on all this you know where's jack on all this the thing is america owes you a debt
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.440]  of gratitude frankly for standing up for the freedom of speech because if they take out alex
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.600]  jones and they falsely accuse you like they did with that video they said that you pushed a child
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.880]  down wasn't even you in the video and then they ban your right to defend yourself if they take you
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.280]  out then they're going to take out fox news then they're going to take out all conservative
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.640]  lawmakers and by the way they're already saying that they're like foaming at the mouth what do
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.200]  you make though of anderson trooper having four thousand viewers when he did this 18 million
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:03.400]  dollar push on facebook they they push notification everybody and no one tuned in don't they get that
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.480]  even if they were to ban us everywhere people still hate them well this is the thing the only
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:12.760]  way that they can even have a voice that's relevant in the marketplace of free ideas is to ban all
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:18.120]  opposing opinions that's the point of banning you and me and others who have been banned remember
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:21.960]  i've been completely blacklisted off youtube for months i've been shadow banned by facebook and
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:26.920]  twitter and others as well the point is that if we are allowed to compete in a free marketplace of
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:34.840]  ideas we win paul joseph watson his ideas make sense he wins you win we win and if we can
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.560]  simply defend ourselves against the false accusations that we can set the record straight
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.680]  and then maybe that's the real answer here is yeah they are misrepresenting who we are building
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:50.920]  straw man then silencing us so we can't respond to their fraud and they're moving against everybody
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:59.800]  for civil unrest in the new year uh they are uh moving towards uh the midterms they're planning
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.800]  something but right this is election be calculating like i mean well yeah exactly this they wouldn't
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:06.440]  be doing something this risky if they didn't have something big plan remember that robert
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:11.320]  muller charged i think 12 or 13 russians with attempting to defraud the united states of america
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:16.440]  by interfering with elections what is it that twitter is doing facebook google they are doing
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:21.640]  what the russians never did but that robert muller accused the russians of doing facebook is doing it
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:25.640]  every day twitter is doing it every day they are defrauding the united states of america and frankly
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:30.600]  alex they are shredding they are ripping apart the culture of this country they are going to push
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:35.880]  us into an escalation that we want to avoid that they are pushing it because they have declared
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:40.520]  a kind of war this is the opening salvo of warfare against the american people they are
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:45.320]  disenfranchising half the population i can't believe i'm more animated right now than you are
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:49.400]  no no i'm just trying to shut up or i'll go wild like no you're right mike but but here's the thing
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:56.120]  it's it's so crazy that they're doing this and they're pulling on all the stops and they're
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:01.720]  but the good news is no one's watching them yeah yeah yeah there's no oversight and like i said
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:07.240]  they have decided in their minds that they absolutely will not stop unless you make them stop
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.200]  and that could be done by federal marshals it could be done by federal regulation maybe the
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.040]  president you know can can initiate some action well that's the beginning pulling their security
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:20.360]  clearances when you've got clapper and all these guys on the chi-com payroll on record
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.440]  shang overthrow the government go after conservatives i mean they're clearly seditious
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.080]  they're not trying to work within the government of the system they're trying to overthrow the
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.120]  election and you can't reason with these tech giants you can't reason with them there is no
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:40.120]  no circumstance under which they will voluntarily recreate a level playing field of ideas that
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.160]  will not happen this is what we must understand you can't appease them representative gates
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:50.840]  you can't appease these tyrants they are authoritarian cultists and they are fanatics
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.880]  they are driven by their fanaticism it's like a jihad against the freedom of of speech in this
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.400]  country that's what the left is doing today that's the only way to describe it well that's it this
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.600]  is the huge move against the first amendment yes a huge move against everything it's happening now
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.000]  and i can't even get conservatives to halfway wake up or even kind of figure anything out it's
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  going oh yeah because they were always censoring us and things but that was lowling and saying it was
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:19.640]  kind of low level now it's exponential this is the main assault and congressman gates we know
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.920]  he got the report we know he got talked to people asking be a champion against shadow banning
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:30.440]  this is wrong and he roger stone talked to roger songan to run for office to help him out and and
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.120]  roger's mad at him right now because gates got in the hearing and said well you're a private
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:38.040]  corporation you can do whatever you want really like a product a tnt keep you from calling your
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:44.760]  mom on the phone so so so until he got shadow banned now he says he feels violated yeah right
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:50.360]  why does he he thought he would join with them and they'd leave him alone no no they want pure
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.880]  voting blocks they want republicans out what did matt gates think why did he think if he sat there
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.960]  and threw me under the bus and went along with her bs when he knew it wasn't true that he'd be
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.120]  protected well he thought that he could appease them and that's what i'm trying to say they cannot
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:09.400]  be reasoned with these people are like fanatic terminators you can't reason with them and by
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:17.080]  the way imagine alex the outcry if they had selectively shadow banned lgbt people or african-american
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:22.360]  groups imagine the outcry if this was but as christians and conservatives and trump supporters
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:26.840]  and nationalists and then it's tanking facebook stock there's people get they're all leaving it's
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:31.160]  falling apart they're killing the nfl they're killing hollywood they're killing facebook on the
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.720]  altar of defeating us don't they get that we weren't going to change our view just so we can be
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.520]  promoted on facebook that's right they thought have lovian lee to get their casino gulag chips
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.280]  we would roll over to their ideology the last few years and they can't believe mike and their
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.680]  social engineering that's the big victory that we rejected it yeah right right well that's why
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:53.000]  they're so desperate at this point because they know that the spirit of freedom and liberty is
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.400]  rising up in the hearts and minds of the american people and we will not be silenced and we will
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:03.800]  not acquiesce to their twisted distorted delusional view of the world this left-wing cultism where they
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:09.240]  say you know a biological man should be able to declare himself a woman and beat women in the face
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:14.200]  on a mat in a high school wrestling team and win the state championship because he says he's a woman
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:19.640]  we reject that we reject that because we are rooted in logic and reason and reality economic
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:24.360]  reality biological reality but i agree but i mean when you've got millions of push notifications

[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:59.240]  to do this anymore okay mike's already published you know 20 30 best-selling books he's got big
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:05.720]  websites he's successful we're in a war they're trying to suppress everybody and because of
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:11.800]  television most people even if they're awake they're kind of an oh yeah this mode of they're
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:16.760]  gearing up for civil unrest they're gearing up to shut everything down they're admitting it's
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:22.600]  their plan they're a bunch of failure scum they shouldn't be able to dominate us so mike Adams
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:28.440]  your report the censorship master plan decoded it's linked in a paul joseph watson article
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:33.720]  or retweeted alex jones people to find it easily emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:39.080]  there's a petition in here that's only like 100 000 signatures uh to you know to reinstate gun
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:44.200]  the pedophile apologies 400 000 but doesn't matter the president's listening great job mike Adams
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:50.600]  getting a report out if people want a blueprint i can't believe that other people didn't put a blueprint
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:56.360]  out i can't believe that i literally got asked by high-level people in the government to do this
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:22:00.760]  do you think it makes me feel good that oh i'm special they're asking us to do it no it scares
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:06.600]  the living hell out of me that no one else seems to give a crap and that's why they want to shut
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:12.280]  down because we know what pieces of filth they are and we have the answers to defeat them the
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:18.360]  realization from this alex that you are alluding to is that no one is coming to save us there's
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:24.680]  not some great deity out there that's going to save us from this political situation we have to
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:29.800]  stand up and save ourselves and that's why you know just like you said alex we didn't sign up for
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:34.680]  this i don't want to be in this fight every day this is not the life that i want to live
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:39.160]  i was into just clean food and running a science lab and and helping people stay healthy that's
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:44.040]  really what i wanted to do but now they've turned us into warriors for the freedom of speech and we
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:49.480]  are on the front lines for whatever reason we find ourselves here and we're you know it's because
[02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:56.120]  nobody else will do it that's the thing yes and and you and i are like if no one will do it we
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:00.280]  will pick up the sword and we're not so sorry for ourselves when we when we do something it has
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:05.560]  instant effect and it's like if we got 10 more active we'd win in a day yeah we have total victory
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:10.760]  in our hands and people will just do it and we are fighting for the sustainability of civilization
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:15.960]  i mean make no mistake we cannot sustain ourselves as a globalist admit they're trying to destabilize
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:21.000]  civilization and collapse it that that's it freedom of speech is a pillar of sustainable
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.480]  civilization not even to mention a constitutional republic without freedom of speech without the
[02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:30.600]  open marketplace of ideas you can't have a nation that sustains itself you end up in collapse but
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:35.720]  that's what they want a merazuela they want that because they've organized it globally to extract
[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:41.000]  all the power during the collapse it's an admitted plan it's so diabolical and why doesn't the average
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.720]  person get they've been targeted at an exponential spiritual level on a resistant might see that
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:51.880]  that's i don't get that either because we are so awake it's so aware and it hits us so hard
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.520]  what is at stake it's like just the ability to see where this can go to project two years down the
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:02.440]  road and see the the hellhole of tyranny and authoritarianism that that vision just comes
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:07.640]  to mind and we fight against it let me ask you this question clearly i want you elaborate on this
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:11.240]  they're getting ready for something big trying to shut everybody down right now
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:16.120]  what do you think that is and what should we do because i can feel their energy i i can see their
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:20.600]  action i can i mean i know they're coming it's like we're being overrun by the enemy we have the force
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:25.720]  to absolutely repel them and defeat them but not if we're not aware well share with you my my worst
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:33.240]  case scenario i think they could do a nuclear false flag dirty bomb or nuclear attack oh don't
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:39.640]  put a passive to kill trumps out trump exactly it takes out trump they blame it on patriots or
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:44.360]  they blame it on trumps negotiations with north korea they could say it's north korea fighting
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  back or i ran or i ran exactly but they take out trump and they take out 200 000 americans at the
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.080]  same time and then they blame conservatives and then they use that to blacklist all conservatives
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:01.160]  all speech online and any dissenting views this is the plan they have to silence you alex and they
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:06.360]  have to silence me before exactly they wouldn't be taking the risk to shut us down when it wakes
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:11.800]  everybody up the strident effect if they weren't at a gut level i know i i think well before the
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:15.720]  election they're going to hit us and i agree i think it's i think it's going to be a biological
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.680]  or a nuclear event it's but i think they want nuclear to kill potas see that's the thing all
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.240]  they have to do is and and i'm not giving anybody ideas that they don't already know about oh absolutely
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.000]  kill trump every day their their death threats against trump every day the thing is these tech
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.720]  giants are complicit in this alex they are complicit in silencing these voices even while
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:39.560]  they're denying well they're completely coordinated yes clearly and ultimately i can tell you if
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:44.360]  hillard clinton had won the presidency they would have already seized your domain names they would
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:49.480]  not even be in for war well they said they were that it was part of the plan we were on the list
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.680]  my hand out in the wiki leagues that soros would run the internet and he pretty much does now 20
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.680]  thousand of his fact checkers are the ones that like say say i beat up a kid in missouri yeah and
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:05.480]  the thing is which is that such a bold lie mike it is like like they're acting like there's going
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:09.560]  to be no next month i mean you don't do stuff like that unless you don't think the future matters
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:13.720]  right right but that's that you're exactly right there's a point of desperation that they've reached
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:20.280]  because to them everything is contingent on what happens before the election and they're willing
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:25.800]  to literally kill or half killed i believe hundreds of thousands of americans to accomplish their goals
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:32.040]  of creating an authoritarian overlord society where there's no voice that is dissenting against
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:38.280]  the fanaticism of the left is allowed to even speak or to even exist that tucker carlson gets this
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:42.360]  but where are all the others where i was about to say tucker is going under massive attack i
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:46.520]  don't even know ed fox for doing this you think he wants to champion all the demonization of all
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:51.640]  shows no he gets he's next hell they're calling before this even happened for him to be removed
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.160]  the the reason i am here fighting for your voice alex is because i see the big picture i know what's
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:03.240]  at stake i know that none of us will be allowed to exist in a free society if they take away your
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:06.600]  first amendment they're going to take away your second amendment by the way they have admitted
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.880]  that they say they're going to take this it's all in the news they want crowded off they've already
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:16.280]  taken you off they want to mulling it off they want tucker off they want to shut handy off
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:23.720]  anybody that's loyal to america we're real that video is taken off 250 channels a day real that
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:28.920]  video the youtube alternative literally 250 new channels a day can we live stream on that yet
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:33.400]  not yet but that's i want to set it up that is already but we'll just leave youtube i talk to
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:38.200]  your crew all your videos are going live on there i mean the the recorded videos are going on there
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.720]  right now every day all of info wars videos will be on real dot video so if they ban you on youtube
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:47.320]  we've got an alternative that's the key and i'm losing money every day on that alex i hope to
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.480]  make it revenue neutral at some point but right now i'm losing money i don't care we have to have a
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:56.840]  platform well i agree soros used to put in a billion a year to bring down the us he put in
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:03.160]  was it 28 billion this year he put hat he they're all in we are they are now they're like oh you
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.160]  think you beat us full attack yeah and i'm telling people just vibe like a little bit of a jerk around
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.800]  the office i love everybody my idea the spiritual gut level is a man i'm trying to control myself
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.480]  because all my instincts and like everything is like on full combat mode and this is so far beyond
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:23.560]  you and or i uh having an ego in this or even i'm saying my my gut tells me this is it exactly this
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:30.280]  is we are fighting on the front lines for human human civilization to have a sustainable model
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:35.880]  of good ideas you can feel an army coming over the hill before they even show up and we can see
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.440]  them we already know you can feel it though they will collapse everything we value if we let them
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:47.080]  win everything they will destroy our civilization if we let them win that's what's at stake america
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:51.960]  is the prize we fall at all falls god oh my that's why i told roger stern election and i said this is

[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:55.160]  said cut that out but nobody cut that out so i apologize just remove that from the lineup
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:59.080]  can we just do that you know i'm sure we can get that done cruise great i'm just really
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:04.200]  spoiling here for a fight with what's going on with the globalist elijah schaefer and joy vila
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:11.240]  means no introduction she's gonna be coming on you know trumps um hollywood star got attacked by
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:16.440]  pickaxe and now folks come out and attack people that come out to it and it's all very racially
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:21.400]  charged against white people it's very very sad what the globalist created in this country so it's
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:27.160]  it's a really really becoming a problem uh might clearly the media all of its building towards this
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:31.160]  towards something big this late summer this fall do you agree with that and and what do you think
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:34.680]  is going to happen and how do we counter well they're absolutely building towards something we
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:39.960]  can't predict what it is but we know the purpose of it is to of course steal the election demonize
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:45.400]  all trump supporters and then bring in an authoritarian overlord type of society where
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:52.200]  only one official position is allowed to be spoken online about any given topic that's the key and
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:56.680]  it's the radical left that's going to determine what is allowed to be said about any given topic
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:02.440]  and their positions are a moving target because under community guidelines hey there's a viral
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:08.600]  video on abc nbc cbs of 11 year old hitting adults in the face a guy pushes him down we play it like
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:12.440]  everybody else does they what do you think that turns into child endangerment they don't let you
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.240]  see the video they just say endangered child it's all up to community guidelines what their little
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:22.440]  bots their little people their little george soros a media matters folks say oh and let's let's be
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:27.080]  honest their community guidelines are enforced by people who are delusional because they themselves
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.200]  the employees there who enforce these have been subject to the indoctrination and brainwashing
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:38.680]  attempts of a fake news media so this is circular reasoning they say we can ban you because our
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:44.760]  people say you're violating their guidelines but their guidelines are false guidelines where they
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:51.240]  hate america so if you love america or if you are against people being attacked because of
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:56.440]  trump supporters suddenly you're in violation that's what it has come to and we are we're we're
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:04.600]  not just at war with the tech giants we're at war against irrationality you see let's go ahead and
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:10.280]  play this if we have it bleep this is the hollywood star of donald trump has been pickaxed out yesterday
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:15.720]  and you've got a group of hispanic young people who believe that whites are nazis and the trumps
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:19.800]  are nazi so they've showed up you've got some trump supporters you hear people you know he's a
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:25.400]  marine he's marine that's just some things somebody's saying uh you know don't beat up the you know the
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:29.480]  marine it's sort of for radio listeners you'll hear that but you've got one person after another
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:33.560]  coming in and punching and attacking the two white guys who are evil because they're white
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.400]  we're not trying to be racially based we believe martin was the king of judgment content and what
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:43.000]  they actually do but this is what the left has created where they really believe uh that trumps
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.880]  the devil white people the devil this is the race-based politics the left is playing uh because
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:37:04.840]  this is the new system they're engaged in their globalism here's the club
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:20.840]  hey
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:31.080]  see at that point that man has the right to defend his life using whatever legal means
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:36.760]  are available to him oh it just goes on from here where the ride of passage is beat up a white guy
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:40.520]  and again i'm not going to hate these hispanic folks because they're in a racial attack on
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.600]  white people understand their brainwash but the same point doesn't matter if a whole mob of people
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:48.360]  coming down on you because you're wearing a trump shirt or american flag at a certain point you know
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.800]  i'm just glad nobody pulled a gun because uh you know a good 10 15 guys try to beat up each guy
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:59.480]  they stand their ground and uh you know that's gonna happen though that's gonna happen and you
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:03.800]  know legal doctrine in most areas of the country says that if you are being attacked by one person
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:08.120]  who is a member of a gang or a mob you have the right to stand your ground and defend yourself
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:13.560]  using even lethal force in defense of your life against that entire group that is legal doctrine
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:18.920]  in most areas of the country so it's going to happen the left is pushing it pushing it to that
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:24.680]  and the tech giants are part of it you see because they won't allow you to have a debate online
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.760]  they are pushing it into this kind of violence on the streets they're complicit in and by the way
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:36.360]  even local news admits that that the two marine corps veterans were attacked by a racial mob
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.440]  but they go oh that's okay it's cute they're trump people f them so
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:45.400]  well this will do a real shooting war which i don't want to happen what's the left gonna do when
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:49.080]  they get in their car in the morning and something happens i mean they don't understand like once you
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:54.360]  start a war with people who know how to engage in war they're they take our kindness for weakness
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:59.960]  it is we're here begging for people to to hold their fire do not escalate the violence and the
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.520]  left is trying to escalate it every single day who threw the first punch in that fight it was that
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:11.400]  radical left-wing hater that's who threw the first punch and don't they understand this is going to
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.440]  become a kinetic war if they keep pushing it in this direction even though we don't want to see that
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:23.400]  happen we don't want to have to defend our nation using the second amendment but guess what that's
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:28.280]  where they are pushing it to and it is sad and i pray for our country and i pray for the safety
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:33.000]  of our patriots i pray for the safety of our president and i don't know what else we can do
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.480]  alex we we are working to exercise our freedom of speech we are building platforms we are expanding
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:44.120]  we are trying to tell the truth we are trying to defend ourselves against these assaults we are
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:50.200]  trying to call for peace and civility in society and we are being attacked in every direction
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:56.680]  for every vector it and and the lies it doesn't even make me mad that they said i beat some kid
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.160]  out up in missouri and then i endangered children and take videos down or that i made fun of muslims
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:04.920]  when i just showed radicals lamas is pouring into europe or you know i showed them having two
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:08.280]  year olds put money in the g strings of men shaking their butts in their faces i think it's
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:16.680]  child abuse it's that they did all that and then they don't even show the video and then the people
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:23.080]  buy into it you know it's that they're willing to lie at that level you're like my god brian stelter
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:29.480]  and all these people really are sick but then anderson cooper has 4 000 viewers with his 18 million
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:35.560]  dollar show that's kind of the good news here is that is that no one is buying into this your

[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.800]  youtube channel and it's been bipartisan it's been showing a lot of hypocrisy of the left as well
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:19.880]  as some people on the right and we just basically where we were not instigating anything we wore
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:24.360]  trump hats trump shirt and we walked through the streets we engaged in beautiful conversation
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.000]  we landed at the star in hollywood which is where we had people taking selfies with us
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.280]  i got a six foot two cardboard cutout of the president himself it i was saying the national
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:40.520]  anthem we were happy people were loving and then this one thug came in right right so what
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:46.760]  so what happened is is that of course um these were obviously anti trump agitators who started
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:51.000]  pointing out the fact that our opinion mine and my security whose whites opinion didn't matter
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:57.880]  because we're white boys and then he had the audacity to actually call joy the n word and then
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:02.280]  he decided to justify that didn't matter because he could say whatever he wanted
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.960]  and that's basically right at that point joy got upset yeah i actually got in his face not
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:12.360]  confronting but i just said this is disrespectful you're disrespecting black americans americans
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:17.080]  you're disrespecting the president we're all here having fun there was every color at that star
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.640]  celebrating the president after it has been destroyed and we wanted to spread some love
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:26.200]  and we so i said get out of here you're not welcome here he started pulling down his pants and
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:31.400]  showing his butt there was underage girls there kids there he was getting in our face he kept calling
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.880]  us well this is incredible because i saw the video and i'm remembering this we bleeped it but but i
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.120]  mean exactly pulling their pants down yelling screaming calling people the n word they do this

[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:33.720]  centrist person that's pro free speech a bunch of their videos are up on info wars dot com

[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:46.600]  check those out uh on screen but i tell you mike adams is riding shotgun with us uh right now and
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:53.880]  and you you see this type of stuff going on and you see it unfolding and you see the left
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:58.680]  attacking everybody everywhere and they're so it's like a kkk member saying the fifties
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:03.800]  you know uh beating up a black person trying to go to vote or whatever they really believe
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:11.800]  they're on the right and they believe the bs and calling her the inward all these videos every day
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:18.200]  i see a new video uh where the left if it sees any black cops calls on that uh they attack women
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:22.040]  they attack children i mean what is going on with these people well and my question to joy here would
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:27.800]  be where are the leftists standing up for your right to exist as a citizen in this country as
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:33.000]  someone who is who has a human soul who has freedom to speak who has your own personal diversity
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.720]  and expression of who you are and there's not a single prominent leftist that has stood up for you
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:44.120]  why is that joy ridiculous i think it's really because of maxine water she is like the godmother
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.600]  of this violent leftist movement she's called for violence and attacks against trump supporters
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:56.360]  so people they will see me and i am a black and latina woman i'm in hollywood like you said i'm
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:01.880]  just being myself and yet they won't come to my defense because it is somehow justified to violently
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:07.480]  attack to have racial slurs to call me every name the book and elijah simply because we're trump
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:12.760]  supporters it's like that takes every human decency off the table and we're here for peace
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.960]  we wanted to have conversation we had amazing conversations with people across the aisle before
[02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:23.640]  this riot and this mob started and this guy was so violent he was hyped up on every drug in the book
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:28.520]  elijah tell him what happened after we started seeing the national anthem so the national anthem
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:34.360]  after we finished it actually most people started booing us and saying boo and i was like that's
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:38.680]  that's the national anthem and they were like well it's not for trump because we didn't sing the
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.920]  national anthem for trump we sing it because we're proud of our country yeah and they started
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:48.680]  booing us welcome to los angeles for seeing the national anthem here in on the streets and they
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:52.760]  were saying we don't want your kind here there's many people screaming we don't want your kind here
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:58.680]  it's like i gotta ask you it's like 30 textbook following what you'd imagine is some racist yeah
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:03.160]  exactly exactly it's like they're denying your right to exist do we have to drink
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.560]  at different fountains we're gonna isolate and segregate different cafes we don't shop at the
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:11.320]  same department stores it's like a new jim crow well that's another thing though the left doesn't
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:14.680]  want us in their businesses and stuff but they don't even know how to work or do anything they would
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:19.640]  all starve to death we weren't there that's true exactly yeah yeah well yeah i mean the violence
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:25.400]  the violence escalated actually because the guy did leave after i told him stop disrespecting america
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.160]  and stop calling us the n word because there was another older african-american gentleman there
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:34.280]  who also told him the same thing he was offended and and we both were like stop it this is not okay
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:39.720]  there's minors here put pull your pants up i mean he was showing us everything to everyone's
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:44.840]  but in front of children which is the he was simulating sex he was doing the ground you know
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:49.480]  he was getting in my face he's like i know you want it he's just gross everything gross person he came
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:55.880]  back so he left and then he came back with four other guys and continued to get in our faces and
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:00.840]  then that's when he was like oh you're not going to fight me yeah girl the hypocrisy of this though
[02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:06.600]  is that they are doing this what in in the name of what they call equality and tolerance they call
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:11.240]  themselves tolerant and they say that you joy that you are and then the media the control corporate
[02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:15.400]  media will then cover up what's really happening of course and actually all they're doing is that
[02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:20.040]  those those radical leftists are exposing like they're you know their inner pedophile or something
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:23.880]  and i noticed you guys have a bunch of videos like these i mean it seems like things are escalating
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:27.960]  but this whole summer rage i think they're trying to censor libertarians conservatives
[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:32.760]  ahead of something big what do you what do you think uh lydia and joy yeah so so what i think
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:40.600]  is this so last weekend uh last thursday i went to maxine waters office to go report on a protest
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:45.720]  that was happening there and i actually went this we can get into this too um because joy
[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:50.680]  is not my only friend of color um i have a friend named black mic you should can look him up on
[02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:55.160]  instagram he's blowing up official black mic he's like the male candace owens and if you see here
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:52:00.200]  we went to go report there and because i'm the wrong skin color now which is people say that this
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:05.320]  whole idea of racism towards white people isn't real but because i have blonde hair look i'm a
[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:10.760]  youth pastor he is a youth worship leader i've been to bible college i do global missions i've
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:15.480]  done in the philippines and mexico i mean i go all over the place i'm sharing the message of
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:21.240]  jesus and a love and a peace and they're calling me a white supremacist calling me kkk um they're
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:25.240]  going out there and then it's so funny because we're out there they accosted us they assaulted us
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:30.040]  to the point where a pastor tried to get us out because they came at us with bats and you know
[02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:34.840]  what that was not done because there's a bunch of angry black people in south central or whatever
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:41.400]  torrents area it's because maxine waters has called them to violent she's she's okayed this
[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:46.600]  and that's exactly what happened when we were on hollywood boulevard they actually brought a knife
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:51.640]  they stole his camera they stole three thousand dollar camera they stole it out of my cameraman
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:56.200]  and they punched our guard who's a veteran who's a military veteran he was he was trying to do
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:01.320]  crowd control and saying back up they didn't care we pulled them we go we go we go hey this guy is a
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:06.280]  marine has some respect and all the kids by the way these are generations z all there like probably
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:11.880]  20 25 kids are start saying who's 12 years old or nine years old he deserved it and stuff and
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:18.120]  that's the next generation of what they're trying to bring up our anti-american anti anti-moral
[02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:23.560]  anti-respect for for and this is the fight that broke out they literally he threw the first punch
[02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:29.000]  at our dear man his name is tony and he actually suffered his face got split open he's suffering
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:37.240]  from a concussion right now four guys four thugs on one yeah one conservative one conservative to
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:44.360]  beat off four guys yeah like he actually beat them up yeah what are you doing to protect your safety
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:48.840]  there i mean you what you're describing are incredible acts of violence and racism this is
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:54.600]  happen right but also the courage you've got to have to just wear trump gear on hollywood boulevard
[02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:59.080]  yeah no kidding right we're not inciting the violence we were smiling i was tough there was all
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:03.320]  those little girls there i said oh you look so pretty girls look so cute you want to take a picture
[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:09.080]  we had the trump stand-up alize and i'm making jokes family we're live streaming list by the way
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:15.320]  we have all of that footage on my periscope at joy underscore villa and on his youtube.com
[02:54:15.320 --> 02:54:19.000]  slash slightly offensive and watch the whole live stream the whole thing and we're gonna write
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.360]  articles about that as well we absolutely trump overall is doing a pretty good job but he
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:31.080]  needs to make a bigger deal out of this persecution the i mean it it needs to be done it's it's race
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:36.200]  based persecution suffering i mean this would be pro trump we're not it is all racial it's like
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:40.760]  f you you're a black person f you you're a white person it's like all it's all race based it's
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:46.200]  insane it's it's totally insane and look these these are are illegal acts of violence these are
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.680]  discriminatory acts they're violating the civil rights of both of your guests here right now
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:55.320]  these those attackers should be prosecuted and those who are complicit in that should be
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:00.120]  prosecuted that's my take right well let me ask you about this police report because it was what
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:04.840]  is it assault and burglary assault and burglary and we we want to push it as a hate crime because
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:09.400]  the point is that he was calling us out for being white and for being black and saying that we
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.240]  didn't matter and he was going to say whatever we don't belong yeah that our kind doesn't belong
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.840]  so if you're black you're wrong and if you're white you're wrong and and if you're latino you're
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:21.640]  wrong what where listen here's the deal he just he he means he follows steven colbert so let me
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:25.960]  ask you this question obviously this guy needs to be discovered we need to find out his identity
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:30.200]  we should have a hotline for that and the la pd won't prosecute him it's a serious issue
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:35.000]  because a lot of other folks punching people in the head as well yes there is there's there's too
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  much violence going on simply for wearing this red hat simply for being pro trump simply for
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:44.040]  wearing american flag nowadays you can get hurt and almost killed i mean i'm used to having death
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:48.280]  threats but walking down the street wearing a trump hat that should not be the norm yeah let's
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:54.440]  pull up joy vila in that great uh academy awards deal 2016 in the great red white blue dress i mean
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:58.600]  that really made him mad but i mean this is america people should be able to plus just since
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:03.000]  trump's been so successful with the economy and unemployment and something that you take it with
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:08.840]  less in their anger but no it's worse now because if he gets proven right it's over for them especially
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:13.320]  for minorities he's less than the burden we now have jobs you know my cousins who are black my
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:18.280]  cousins who are latino they have jobs now because of trump the economy is flourishing and prospering
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:22.200]  people are walking away from the democratic plantation and people are seeing that trump is
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.880]  a peacemaker he's going to make peace with major uh you know superpowers around the world so that
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:34.040]  america can be great again this is huge and also just to say to both of you you are so welcome here

[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:20.680]  globalist want to try to sew things up by the end of the year i think they're i think they're making
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:26.280]  their move oh yeah they're making their move i mean we've got socialism globalism coming out
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:31.720]  from every woodwork their their only message now is going to be violence and literally when i had
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:36.920]  conversations with a few leftists yesterday they said well donald trump incites violence i said
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:43.080]  how does he incite violence he just does so they're going to blame us for their violent actions i see
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:48.040]  a lot more from the left but i also see a lot of black and latinos running from the democratic
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:53.000]  plantation i see a lot of them being exposed and being exposed to the truth and say no i don't want
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:57.640]  to be a part of this party so it's up to the republicans and the trump lichens to say come on

[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:37.160]  live from the people's republic of california here in los angeles uh you know me as a frequent
[03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:42.440]  guest of alex i've talked about my film's dreams from my real father there's no place like utopia
[03:06:42.440 --> 03:06:48.920]  the new film the trump the art of the insults in the info store info wars store i'll be taking a lot
[03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:54.120]  of calls today i've been hosting for several months lots of great guests and i get about a hundred
[03:06:54.120 --> 03:06:58.840]  emails every time that i only took one phone call so i will be taking a bunch of calls later
[03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:06.440]  eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[03:07:07.160 --> 03:07:12.440]  and uh we'll talk about anything you want to talk about uh first i'm going to give some of my takes
[03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:20.680]  uh we got coming up next monday be sure to watch uh jz has produced a documentary on the trayvon
[03:07:20.680 --> 03:07:28.360]  martin case called uh rest in power about trayvon martin and what occurs to me is that the timing
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:35.800]  of this is quite suspect the midterms elections are coming up and jz was a big buddy of obama of
[03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:41.240]  course many parties to of course fiance lip sync the national anthem at the inauguration second
[03:07:41.240 --> 03:07:46.680]  inauguration so it occurs to me that this is a just a typical formula of the democrats they try
[03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:54.280]  to agitate uh or activate uh black people by controlling their emotions with something you
[03:07:54.280 --> 03:08:00.760]  know very incendiary about the tragic death of trayvon martin and uh let's take a quick
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:07.960]  reminder how the case started in the first place of course uh apparently trayvon martin was walking
[03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:14.440]  through this uh apartment complex neighborhood watch guy george zimmerman sees he's kind of hanging
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:20.680]  around and not going anywhere calls the cops gets out some point trayvon sucker punches him in the
[03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:28.440]  nose gets on top of him starts bashing his head in the cement zimmerman calls for help nobody
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:34.760]  comes to help him eventually he takes out a gun and shoots him uh he's very apologetic he's very
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:40.600]  sorry he puts his hand his puts himself in the hands of the police no lawyer he does a recreation
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:47.240]  he submits to interviews two weeks later the cops said that it was self-defense there's no evidence
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:54.520]  all the witnesses support zimmerman's account and the cops did their job it was you know zimmerman
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:00.600]  put himself in the justice system to be treated fairly but then the department of justice figured
[03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:05.640]  out way we've got the midterms coming we've got the actually presidential elections coming up in
[03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:12.760]  november and wouldn't this be really good to agitate people let's send the doj down there to
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:20.440]  help in fact the doj came down and organized protests and try to get a case against zimmerman
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:28.280]  put together and what they ignored was the reality of the situation is the local cops gave zimmerman
[03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:32.600]  justice they also ignored the fact that trevon martin when you looked at his life when you
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:37.240]  learned about his life he had a very typical experience of a lot of black people in this
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:45.480]  country he was a a student in high school no jobs and in the obama economy probably couldn't
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:50.120]  find a job as a high school student so a lot of kids like him are attracted to nonsense like
[03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:56.200]  buying and dealing drugs uh we saw in his text messages his uncle was selling him a gun
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:10:03.240]  uh involved in all kind of nonsense such that he ended up there in that in that situation a very
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:10.760]  tragic death and uh the democrats decided to essentially use that tragic death of mr martin
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:16.360]  as well as use the other this guy this democrat george zimmerman who was an obama supporter
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:22.760]  he'd helped black people the sherman warehouse he was someone who was an advocate uh for the
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:30.520]  underprivileged a hispanic guy and the democrats and obama just exploited the tragedy uh and this
[03:10:30.520 --> 03:10:35.080]  is just very typical so when you i encourage everyone to check it out on monday and i think
[03:10:35.080 --> 03:10:41.080]  there's a second installment the next week of jz's documentary i'll be watching rest in power
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:47.720]  and see what you think about it and we can talk about it next time now when i think of democrats
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:55.560]  that's lately i'm thinking of them as little children i call this segment children democrats
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:01.160]  children and adults i want to play a little bit of my trailer of there's no place like utopia
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:17.640]  we're gonna watch that and see what the mentality is
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:21.880]  oh we're glad you landed on us we've got a wizard here you can solve your problems because
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:27.560]  he's special you can keep your dot you can keep your plan
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:33.160]  uh people on uh welfare assistance here mostly that's the whole city
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:43.000]  we're gonna replace capitalism socialist to remake the world as it should be
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:48.680]  okay let's cut it off right there it's the kingdom of heaven on earth you get the idea of uh
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:53.960]  from there's no place like utopia so i think of democrats as as little kids little kind of like
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:58.840]  uh crying babies that kind of want to have everything their way they want to play all
[03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:04.200]  the time and they in this case i'd like to play government uh so i start to think of things like
[03:12:04.200 --> 03:12:09.240]  well what do little kids like to do what do they like to do number one they like to ride bikes
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:14.200]  let's take a look at john carrey riding a bike and how that worked out from trump the art of the
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:25.400]  insult john carrey okay john carrey in this film you'll see how much he likes to ride bikes and
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:32.200]  how trump reacted in trump the art of the insult uh he was in geneva what else do
[03:12:34.200 --> 03:12:39.400]  little kids like to do they like to play doctor obama care you know if you like your plan you
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:46.280]  can keep your plan let's play doctor we'll take 400 dollars from everyone who doesn't want to play
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:51.080]  and we'll give it to people who don't want to pay that's a fun game oh sorry there's no more
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:54.760]  insurance companies oh i'm sorry the price went up there's no more hospitals let's you know let's
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:13:00.600]  play another game uh let's look at john carrey playing on his bicycle let's play that from part
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:09.320]  of the insult nuclear policy went awry for us secretary of state john carrey police he falls
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:15.000]  he breaks his leg during the negotiation i swear to you i will never be in a bicycle race as long
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:23.240]  as i press okay so uh little children like to play doctor they like to ride bikes what else
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:28.280]  little children like cartoon characters cartoon characters very interesting for little children
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:35.960]  and i think that's why democrats like people like stalin and mao uh chavez of course uh
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:43.000]  castro the castro brothers che guavara you know obama was obsessed with going to cuba wanted
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:48.760]  to meet castro he wanted to have his picture with che guavara democrats and progressives
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:55.400]  love these funny strange cartoon characters like chavez mao stalin that's another thing
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:14:01.160]  that little children like uh little children also don't like authority they don't like adults
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:05.480]  getting in the way that's why they hate the police that's why they want to get rid of ice
[03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:10.040]  immigration enforcement if they get rid of immigration enforcement of course the next
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:15.240]  target is the police uh because they don't little kids don't like rules they want to get rid of the
[03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:22.360]  people that enforce the rules so i think what happened in 2016 is the adults showed up to the
[03:14:22.360 --> 03:14:28.360]  polls and we elected an adult trump came and said okay kids we need to put some order in the house
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:33.160]  let's get the economy moving let's fix foreign policy you guys have made a big mess it's time
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:38.600]  to clean up now of course the democrats they don't like these mean adults they're taking away our fun
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.080]  we wanted to play doctor we wanted to play diplomat we wanted to ride bikes so the democrats
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:48.600]  have a big tantrum they go out on the streets two million protesters when he's elected they say we
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:53.560]  don't want it we don't want to you know we don't want to play we're not going to play we're going
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:59.480]  to resist we're not going to play unless we can have our way our buddy our best friend James Hodgkinson
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:03.080]  is going to make a big mess we love destruction you know how little kids love destruction we're
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:09.000]  going to make a big mess until you get out of the room mom or dad we're going to knock it all down

[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:30.360]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[03:20:34.200 --> 03:20:39.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm joel gilbert hosting from the peoples republic of california
[03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:45.480]  here in los angeles thanks for being back with us here i will be taking a lot of calls shortly
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:20:52.280]  it's uh one eight hundred seven eight nine alex and uh we're talking about the all the lies of the
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:56.280]  children how democrats behave like children they like to play doctor they like to play diplomat
[03:20:56.280 --> 03:21:01.320]  they like to ride bikes they like to make a mess and if they can't get their way they uh resist
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:08.280]  and protest and have a tantrum another big thing that uh little children do is create big lies so
[03:21:08.280 --> 03:21:13.000]  the big lie is of course the russia hoax the book came out finally we've been hearing about
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:18.360]  greg jared from fox news called the russia hoax the elicit scheme to clear hillary clinton
[03:21:18.360 --> 03:21:25.080]  and frame donald trump now i've been thinking about how the democrats came up with his hoax
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:30.680]  and i think i have some good information and perspective that tells us reinforces the fact
[03:21:30.680 --> 03:21:36.120]  that it is a hoax you have to say well how did they come up with the idea to frame donald trump
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:41.720]  to say hey donald trump you're working for the russians now remember the russia the democrats
[03:21:41.720 --> 03:21:47.640]  have been up to their ears in russians and communists for 50 years also remember that
[03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:53.400]  socialism is a war on the individual it's a war on individualism and individual liberty
[03:21:53.400 --> 03:21:58.280]  it's about collectivism the collective idea is there's one set of rules and one set of beliefs
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:04.280]  and that's it if you don't believe in it you're crazy that's why they called it being anti-soviet
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:08.520]  in the soviet union if you didn't believe in the collective you're anti-soviet and you can
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:15.240]  end up in a gulag they send you away so democrats and progressives really don't have any new ideas
[03:22:15.240 --> 03:22:22.040]  since 1917 so they don't know how to think of ideas they're not creative uh they just say well
[03:22:22.040 --> 03:22:26.120]  the government's going to take all your property we're going to control all the industry we're
[03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:31.080]  going to have a police force to force you to go to work and we'll take all the money for ourselves
[03:22:31.880 --> 03:22:38.040]  and if you object it's the gulag you're going to the gulag so that's why during the cold war
[03:22:38.040 --> 03:22:43.640]  the the progressive love Joseph Stalin as a chronicler in my movie most people have seen
[03:22:43.640 --> 03:22:49.640]  also in full war store dreams from my real father i chronicled how frank marshall davis
[03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:56.280]  was one of the original black bolsheviks out of chicago he was sent to hawaii in 1948 on the
[03:22:56.280 --> 03:23:02.520]  orders of the kremlin to organize a dock worker strike to try to remove the u.s naval forces from
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:08.840]  hawaii which the soviets considered an obstacle to expansion in asia uh in the 60s the weather
[03:23:08.840 --> 03:23:16.120]  underground sds they loved russia they collaborated with cuban intelligence into the 80s ted kennedy
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:22.600]  it was revealed in the russian archives that ted kennedy tried to work with russian dictator former
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:29.720]  kgb head uh yury andropov to undermine ronald reagan it was in the archives we can pull up those
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:36.520]  that article of ted kennedy and you'll see that it's an actual document that he tried to get the
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:44.040]  russians to work with him to undermine reagan of course we know that bernie sanders obsessed with
[03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:49.720]  loving russia during the cold war the all the oppression the political prisoners bernie sanders
[03:23:49.720 --> 03:23:53.880]  thinks it's a great place to honeymoon he'll just go honeymoon in the soviet union you know
[03:23:53.880 --> 03:24:01.800]  you know so uh you see people showing up today you saw people showing up to the last few years
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:06.520]  a couple years ago to bernie sanders rallies he would say things like you know we're gonna
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:11.240]  break up the banks we're gonna break up the pharmaceutical companies that's pure communism
[03:24:11.240 --> 03:24:15.720]  it means the government's gonna control all these industries and of course state bureaucrats
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:21.560]  are not as skilled as entrepreneurs so all these businesses end up failing that's pure
[03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:26.200]  communism but people would clap people clap for bernie sanders even though they had no idea what
[03:24:26.200 --> 03:24:31.240]  he was talking about and that is a grave danger that people are voting for people like sanders
[03:24:31.240 --> 03:24:39.320]  and obama not knowing the evil idea they have in mind and you have to also say why did they come
[03:24:39.320 --> 03:24:44.440]  up with the russia hoax well because they thought of it because obama was controlled by putin let's
[03:24:44.440 --> 03:25:04.120]  take a quick look at this video obama medvedev back in 2012 a few months ago when you were asked
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:10.360]  what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing america you said russia not al-qaeda you said russia
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:15.720]  in the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know the cold war
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:23.080]  has been over for 20 years okay so that's that's obama let's cut it off that's obama showing
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:29.960]  that he's going to cooperate with russia and so you gotta ask when he tells medvedev i'll be more
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:34.680]  flexible after the election that should have been a special council uh trump never did anything like
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:41.480]  that but it shows he's under the control of putin because uh obama was the most pro russia president
[03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:47.880]  in his first term he canceled the missile defense shield in eastern europe he reset gave technology
[03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:53.560]  transfers to russia leaving from behind that means america does not lead the world lead the free
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:58.840]  world allowing russia to fill the vacuum in the balance of power they invaded karmia they set up
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:05.400]  a base in syria obama made the iran deal this is all pro russia it all benefits russia so obama
[03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:10.920]  was the most pro russia president and i think i even said at the national press club in 2012
[03:26:10.920 --> 03:26:16.040]  that it was dangerous for an american president to maintain a secret that if it came out it would
[03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:21.240]  ruin his political career if i could figure out that his real father was a russian agent uh frank
[03:26:21.240 --> 03:26:28.200]  marshal davis who radicalized him then the uh kgb that had a file on davis also figured it out so
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:33.640]  that's the real russia hopes and that's where the democrats got the idea from our guys been
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:39.560]  controlled by the russians we've been in bed with the russians wouldn't it be funny if we said that
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:44.680]  trump does that so that's how it all came about that's the mentality and that's their inability
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:50.680]  to come up with creative ideas they just had to say well here's what we do um you know and the
[03:26:50.680 --> 03:26:55.960]  reason they don't like russia today is because they're not communist they liked russia a lot better
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:00.200]  when they were communists when it was government control government owns all the property
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:05.560]  you don't agree with the government you go to prison that's when they were infatuated with russia
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:12.040]  they don't like putain because he's bringing back capitalism free markets traditional values
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:19.160]  and christianity they don't like that they don't like russia very much anymore so that's the real
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:23.560]  story of where the democrats are coming from with this whole russia idea and what's motivating them
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:30.520]  and where their ideas come from today they're back to being openly radical openly radical
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:35.480]  democrat party they were hiding it for a while we're going to take more a bunch of phone calls

[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:09.240]  i'd have two things the first is uh i think whether anyone comes from a christian perspective
[03:34:09.240 --> 03:34:16.520]  or their asia i think they should go to second cecelonian chapter two and read it in its entirety
[03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:24.280]  it explains a lot of i think what's happening current day um but really what i wanted to get to
[03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:35.640]  was i think the tripwire for um the deep state george soros the left of uh getting this war
[03:34:35.640 --> 03:34:41.720]  started that they want so badly is there going is it there's going to be a peaceful event that
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:48.520]  leftists will turn around and infiltrate and start a big fight and someone from out of nowhere
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:55.160]  is going to come from behind the conservative christian the the right crowd and it's going to
[03:34:55.160 --> 03:34:59.160]  be an ar-15 or something like that and there's going to be casualties okay all right thanks
[03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:03.480]  thanks for the call thanks for the call let me comment look the uh the democrats the uh
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:10.200]  progressives have always relied on strife on strife between communities on conflict
[03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:16.440]  so they can say well let me solve the problem for you if everybody's going to church and working and
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:21.400]  traditional values and people are happy there's no justification for radical change so they
[03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:27.720]  have to create chaos in order to justify uh that they can take power you mentioned that george soros
[03:35:27.720 --> 03:35:36.120]  of course longtime agitator funder uh originally a uh a nazi collaborator that uh people don't even
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:41.400]  know the the deep history of this he was one of the few nazi collaborators not to be executed by
[03:35:41.400 --> 03:35:46.200]  the soviets when he was captured lo and behold he shows up in london a few years later selling
[03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:55.000]  stolen art uh that was taken by the nazis from uh from jewish people uh the connection of how he
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:02.760]  survived and how he got so rich and how he you know embarked on a campaign to destroy western
[03:36:02.760 --> 03:36:08.440]  civilization literally starting with trying to collapse the british pound in the 80s uh i think
[03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:14.280]  has to be examined and tied back to his relationship with the russians when they captured him don't
[03:36:14.280 --> 03:36:20.120]  forget when he was 14 the nazis gave him a choice you can die or you can work for us so uh i wouldn't
[03:36:20.120 --> 03:36:25.240]  be surprised if that was the choice he was given by the the russians and that's why he's done everything
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:30.280]  he's done up to today let's go to westley in oregon westley i'm sorry yeah you're in oregon go ahead
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:40.840]  westley hello joel how are you doing hello all right yes sir go ahead just well first thing i'd like
[03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:47.000]  to say is i've bought products from info wars i have my alpha power student here i have my caveman
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:54.760]  and all that and i'm going to the rally on the fourth with my i stand with trump shirt and i just
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:37:00.280]  bought a hundred dollars worth of super blue crocs and whatnot but anyway the thing i wanted to talk
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:06.840]  about was i cannot even see donald trump's recent tweet on his twitter when i go directly to his
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:13.160]  twitter and i don't know if this is a new if this is happening everywhere but i only thing i can see
[03:37:13.160 --> 03:37:21.320]  for two days ago the russian hoax tweet that is the only thing i can see anyway all right let me
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:27.640]  comment look uh the democrats when they control the tools of state when they control the irs the
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:34.920]  fbi the doj they use the tools of state to control thought to control what people think control what
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:41.240]  they say control the agenda of course control the elections people forget 2012 was not a clean
[03:37:41.240 --> 03:37:46.920]  election obama used the irs to break up the tea party movement so he could win reelection because
[03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:54.200]  his economy and his ideas weren't working same thing repeat 2016 he used the doj fbi cia to try
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:38:00.520]  to defeat trump and in case he won to frame him so this is their playbook now now that they're out
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:05.880]  of power they're trying to use their connections and their sympathizers in industry whether it's
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:14.840]  a twitter google amazon i did a show earlier this year regarding amazon that amazon did not make money
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:21.800]  they just barely broke even until a couple years ago they paid bezos from the cia gave a 600 million
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:30.600]  dollar contract no bid illegal to bezos to design a website for the cia 600 million dollars he turned
[03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:36.280]  around a week later and bought the washington post for 250 million which of course is a big
[03:38:36.280 --> 03:38:40.200]  sympathizer and all of a sudden he's the richest guy in the world so don't think there's not a strong
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:46.200]  connection to the deep state what i call the police state and all these big industries uh
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:51.000]  especially the tech industries and uh twitter's just another one of them and they're going to use
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:58.520]  their tools to suppress the free speech suppress opinion that differs with them it's a very sick
[03:38:58.520 --> 03:39:05.240]  evil plan to destroy free speech to destroy the elements of the constitution that make america
[03:39:05.240 --> 03:39:10.040]  great and we're seeing this assault instead of coming from the government from obama and his
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:16.280]  deep state departments the oj it's coming from now it's transferred to the tech industry
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:21.160]  let's go to uh jim and rhoda island we got you on the alex jones show jim go ahead
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:29.000]  yes how you doing joe um i've got a quick question for you do you think the united states is an empire
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:35.240]  i think it's an empire i think after world war two the united states had been through
[03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:41.480]  two world wars in uh you know 25 years uh there was a decision that was made that the united states
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:49.960]  needs to uh project its power around the world in order to prevent uh dragging itself into another
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:57.080]  world war uh that meant stationing troops in germany uh facing down communist aggression in
[03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:05.560]  southeast asia trying to combat and prevent uh regional wars and regional madmen from dragging
[03:40:05.560 --> 03:40:10.760]  america into a world war so this is how i think that concept developed that america felt we're
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:17.080]  better off stationing and preventing conflicts and and fighting small conflicts than we are
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:22.120]  entering another world war so that's how the idea developed that america would project its power
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:29.000]  around the world to maintain the peace uh i think it can be thought of uh you know in that way i
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.240]  don't think it's an an empire is someone that really projects their power in order to control and
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:39.880]  take over uh countries and manage their affairs i think sometimes america has delved into that
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:45.240]  but it's not the the main goal is to is to maintain peace and security throughout the world
[03:40:45.240 --> 03:40:50.280]  for the benefit of the united states as well as as well as our allies uh let's go to uh
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:58.120]  uh why it in california by the way uh don't forget it's 1 800 789 alex taking calls the rest
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:04.600]  of the way 1 800 789 alex uh go ahead why it you're on the alex jones show yeah it is up to
[03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:09.560]  the i completely agree with you about these people being utter uh children it seems kind of hard to
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:15.240]  believe that they're in a sense even beating us at this point uh they have to destroy our free speech
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:21.800]  because in an open debate they just can't win adults or adults can't be beat by children
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:27.800]  and that's essentially what they're trying to do in their acting very childish and it's really sad
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:33.960]  it's like a it's like a 30-year-old it's like what used to be an 18-year-old is now 30-year-old
[03:41:33.960 --> 03:41:39.560]  we're like uh arrested development always if you know like look the the entire reaction to
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:45.240]  trump react being elected the next day they had a 2 million person tantrum um adana everybody
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:50.200]  else screaming oh well that's not my president i'm not going to play i'm not going to play anymore
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:56.120]  because you are now in in charge we liked it when we could play doctor we could play obama care we
[03:41:56.120 --> 03:42:02.680]  could play veterans administration we could play uh diplomats we could go play footsie with the
[03:42:02.680 --> 03:42:09.000]  russian we liked it when we were in control so the uh the entire what you hear now it's just
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:13.560]  every time adam schiff opens his mouth whose lips are moving he's lying and that's what little
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:19.240]  kids do they lie they don't cooperate they have a tantrum and uh that's what the democrat party
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:29.240]  has come to is just a group of lying uncooperative children that want to resist and refuse to
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:34.360]  participate unless they can control they don't like the adults are in the room donald trump's an
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:38.280]  adult they don't like it when there's adults around get rid of the police get rid of the

[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:30.760]  and that was never really highlighted but it it was a fact and it was very suspicious um also
[03:48:30.760 --> 03:48:37.560]  wanted to mention that my buddy was the news reporter who uh mis-recorded on that jeff bernside
[03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:43.720]  and he uh he uh he got fired because of it and um you know he was kind of a sacrificial lamb
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:50.040]  it seems and i just wanted to just pass that along okay thanks yeah look it was a very tragic
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:56.440]  story uh trevon martin 17 year old kid in high school he'd had uh been in and out of some trouble uh
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:49:01.000]  i guess this neighborhood had a lot of crime uh george zimmerman saw him kind of hanging around
[03:49:01.560 --> 03:49:06.040]  and he thought he better reported as he was told to do if people remember the case it's five year
[03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:13.160]  anniversary of that of that tragic tragic story and uh uh yeah apparently trevon martin had been in
[03:49:13.160 --> 03:49:21.080]  some trouble and when i look at his history it's very tragic and very similar to a lot of uh black
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:28.440]  youth that there's no employment uh i think he'd been in and out of drug issues uh suspended from
[03:49:28.440 --> 03:49:33.560]  school his parents were divorced very typical of what the democrat party has brought to the black
[03:49:33.560 --> 03:49:40.440]  community for 50 years they've been in control of these progressive cities for 50 60 years uh violent
[03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:48.360]  culture drug culture uh single women uh broken homes it was just very tragic you just got to
[03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:53.960]  wonder that if uh trevon martin had any opportunities what if what if uh donald trump was president
[03:49:54.600 --> 03:50:02.760]  uh and not obama during obama there were no jobs they were trying to uh you know bring in illegals
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:07.880]  knock down the borders to bring them into these urban communities to take jobs from black people
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:12.280]  to drive down the wages i wonder if donald trump was president trevon martin would have had some
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:17.560]  opportunity right now there's more jobs than there are people to fill them it was the opposite
[03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:22.920]  back in 2012 after four years of obama so you just wonder uh trevon martin is probably someone who
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:27.560]  would rather have a job but when i did my movie there's no place like utopia i went to south side
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:32.840]  chicago everybody there talked to a lot of black people on welfare and they didn't want to be on
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:37.320]  welfare they wanted a job but there was no opportunity so uh think about that when you
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:43.960]  watch it i would tune in uh to the uh bet or paramount network on monday uh for that jz
[03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:50.040]  documentary uh definitely watch it and see what kind of political agenda there is or if they really
[03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:58.360]  do tell the true story uh let's go to another caller uh adam in florida hey joe can you hear me
[03:50:59.240 --> 03:51:05.160]  yes sir go ahead hey it's a pleasure to talk to you i watched some of your film particularly
[03:51:05.160 --> 03:51:13.080]  dreams from my real father okay thanks it enjoyed it very much and i wanted to give kind of credit
[03:51:13.080 --> 03:51:18.760]  to obama where it's due because you know he's the only president i could remember that ever let me
[03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:26.200]  see naked pictures of his mother and um well yeah there are go ahead go ahead i wanted to
[03:51:26.200 --> 03:51:31.880]  ask you in particular though where did you get the original seed for that movie like you know like
[03:51:31.880 --> 03:51:40.840]  how did you get the idea that he might okay well thanks for asking like uh you know back in 2012 i
[03:51:40.840 --> 03:51:46.120]  was following info wars world net daily and i kept reading about the birth certificate everybody said
[03:51:46.120 --> 03:51:50.120]  where's the birth certificate where's the birth certificate and there was no answer and i always
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:54.760]  knew that if you if you don't know the answer to the question it means you're not asking the right
[03:51:54.760 --> 03:52:00.760]  question they're not asking the right question so i read obama's biography autobiography dreams
[03:52:00.760 --> 03:52:05.480]  from my father and throughout the entire book he talks about frank marshall davis frank is his go
[03:52:05.480 --> 03:52:11.640]  to guy this guy raised him and so i went and found a book by frank marshall davis called live in the
[03:52:11.640 --> 03:52:17.320]  blues and you open the book and there's 20 pictures of frank marshall davis he's the spitting image of
[03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:23.000]  barack obama he looks exactly like him and the kenyan looks nothing like obama so i realized at
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:28.280]  that moment i said look the where's the birth certificate is not the question the question is
[03:52:28.280 --> 03:52:34.760]  who's the real father if you answer that question you get an obama's entire political agenda obama
[03:52:34.760 --> 03:52:41.400]  was radicalized by frank marshall davis a soviet agent a russian spy who attempted to help overthrow
[03:52:41.400 --> 03:52:45.720]  united states government during the cold war this is the guy that raised barack obama now you
[03:52:45.720 --> 03:52:50.120]  understand the whole agenda so that's how i got into it it was just by following my interest so
[03:52:50.840 --> 03:52:56.120]  thanks a lot for asking and be sure to get that film in the info wars store let's go to john in
[03:52:56.120 --> 03:53:03.240]  arizona john in arizona you're on alex john show are you with us john
[03:53:05.960 --> 03:53:13.800]  okay hello are you there yes sir go ahead john
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:22.280]  okay i think we lost them we're gonna have to move on let's go to dan in texas dan in texas
[03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:29.320]  go ahead you're on the alex john show thank you sir i have a question we're tough we were tough with
[03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:35.000]  north korea but we're not really tough on mexico that the communist president that just got elected
[03:53:35.880 --> 03:53:42.600]  it's telling everybody's got both borders open come to america to have a new life you know that
[03:53:42.600 --> 03:53:48.520]  could be considered an act of war and maybe they build their own fence if they know that we're not
[03:53:48.520 --> 03:53:54.120]  gonna deal with it if they don't deal with it maybe we can just go in there and clean that place out
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:54:00.760]  the drugs and you know i would call them missiles coming here full of disease crap
[03:54:02.280 --> 03:54:07.640]  i mean what do you think about that well look uh the issue with the mexican border has simply
[03:54:07.640 --> 03:54:16.440]  been political will and the lack of enough republicans or anyone to want to go ahead and
[03:54:16.440 --> 03:54:20.840]  secure the border there's a number of reasons why democrats don't want to secure the border
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:26.360]  they need voters they can't fool the regular people can't fool all the people all the time
[03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:32.440]  they're a lot of black people are getting more successful the economy's helping they move out
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:39.400]  of the inner cities they want to replace them with these illegals and with voters from south america
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:44.520]  democrats have their agenda republicans the of course the department of chamber of commerce
[03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:50.760]  have liked the immigrants the illegal immigrants driving down wages also detrimental to minorities
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:55.160]  so you've had these strong interests that have been pushing against securing the border so the
[03:54:55.160 --> 03:55:01.400]  political will of the of donald trump that ran his campaign on you know build that wall and being
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:07.080]  elected to do so uh is battling it now having a battle with the old interests that don't want to
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:12.200]  secure the border so it could be done in in you know in a few weeks in a month in two months
[03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:16.760]  if he can garner the support so i think it's going to be up to the midterms if uh
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:22.280]  trump republicans are very successful in the midterms i think uh it's going to happen if they're
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:26.760]  not successful in the midterms i think we're looking at a screeching halt to much of the the
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:34.600]  trump agenda that people voted for uh let's go to uh liberty smith in oklahoma you're on the
[03:55:34.600 --> 03:55:42.360]  alex jones show hey jill how are you excellent thanks for being here good uh i just wanted to
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:47.880]  touch base on the soros thing that you were talking about a little bit earlier and my question is
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:56.680]  simply he's been doing all these things even in the united states why hasn't anybody picked up on
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:03.080]  prosecuting him look the short answer yeah i mean the short answer is money i mean
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:08.600]  i mean he gives hundreds of millions to all these leftist organization the tides foundation of
[03:56:09.480 --> 03:56:14.760]  every time there's some crazy leftist idea you start googling it on the web and you find out
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:19.720]  it's getting money from some other soros front group so the amount of money that he throws around
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:27.560]  into the legal system into uh you know foundations it's just incredible how much money he's able
[03:56:27.560 --> 03:56:33.640]  to put in people's pockets to to prevent to control the agenda look at hillary clinton how many crimes
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:39.880]  over the year she has a rap sheet you know 10 feet long uh but she's connected to that network so
[03:56:39.880 --> 03:56:46.520]  the uh amount of money coming in through the soros gang is uh much more significant than
[03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:52.200]  republicans giving money to some pack you know that they complain about citizens united the big deal
[03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:56.760]  is the social justice organizations and even if one of them gets shut down they just slither over
[03:56:56.760 --> 03:57:02.040]  to another one they're very formidable in washington with in the legal circles they're formidable in
[03:57:02.040 --> 03:57:10.440]  every state and uh it's the uh the amount of money he's able to put in and i think it it's
[03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:16.040]  very interesting to really look at his early history how did he get out of nazi europe uh
[03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:21.480]  being a nazi spy and how did why did the russians let him go and how to become so rich so quickly
[03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:24.920]  i think the answer is pretty obvious especially when you look what he's done and whose interest
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:29.640]  he's been serving uh for so many years uh thanks for being here today that's the last call on the
