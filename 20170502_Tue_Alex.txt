[00:00.000 --> 00:09.280]  Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling
[00:09.280 --> 00:15.520]  anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:15.520 --> 00:17.920]  To Turkey?
[00:17.920 --> 00:22.040]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:22.040 --> 00:25.840]  How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.600]  Islamic state-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new
[00:30.600 --> 00:33.160]  economically vital areas of the country.
[00:33.160 --> 00:39.000]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim el-Hajj, and of course he
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.240]  was on to the teeth by NATO.
[00:41.240 --> 00:45.680]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.160]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:50.160 --> 00:55.160]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.160]  States.
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.840]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal
[01:00.840 --> 01:03.960]  that the U.S. government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:03.960 --> 01:08.600]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.600]  on Iran.
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.400]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:14.400 --> 01:20.800]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.160]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package
[01:25.160 --> 01:29.960]  where we have the appropriate deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:29.960 --> 01:34.280]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.880]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the
[01:39.880 --> 01:45.160]  opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:45.160 --> 02:03.840]  As known as the Bilderberg Group, could their objective be world domination?
[02:03.840 --> 02:20.340]  The
[02:20.340 --> 02:29.340]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:29.340 --> 02:33.340]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[02:33.340 --> 02:39.340]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[02:39.340 --> 02:44.340]  Infoballers helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:44.340 --> 02:47.340]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:47.340 --> 02:52.340]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:52.340 --> 02:54.340]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:54.340 --> 02:56.340]  Alex Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:56.340 --> 03:01.340]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:01.340 --> 03:07.340]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:07.340 --> 03:10.340]  That's right, Alex Jones, public enemy number one.
[03:10.340 --> 03:14.340]  He had outlawed country back in the 70s and 80s.
[03:14.340 --> 03:17.340]  He had punk rocks saying they were outlaw.
[03:17.340 --> 03:22.340]  He had rock and roll stars saying they're outlaw because they beat their guitars up on stage.
[03:22.340 --> 03:27.340]  But I got to tell you, I'm not trying to be outlaw.
[03:27.340 --> 03:32.340]  But you don't get more rebel. You don't get more outlaw against the globalist.
[03:32.340 --> 03:39.340]  You don't get more outlander to the whole world government system than Info Wars.
[03:39.340 --> 03:42.340]  Because I won't be a slave. I won't roll over to the globalist.
[03:42.340 --> 03:48.340]  It's outrageous how criminal, how authoritarian, how dictatorial, how unelected, how illegitimate,
[03:48.340 --> 03:56.340]  how evil, and anti-human, and greedy, and hateful, and out of control.
[03:56.340 --> 03:58.340]  These arrogant globalists are.
[03:58.340 --> 04:07.340]  They're bravada, they're hubris, they're hutspa, they're false aplomb, is staggering.
[04:07.340 --> 04:12.340]  And all we got to do is call them on it. And they're saying, how dare you and your listeners,
[04:12.340 --> 04:16.340]  how dare you Americans and others around the world call us out.
[04:16.340 --> 04:22.340]  How dare you try to resist us? We will destroy you.
[04:22.340 --> 04:29.340]  History doesn't show that. Those that are destroyed are those that roll over.
[04:29.340 --> 04:34.340]  And those that are also destroyed are those that take on people who have right on their side.
[04:34.340 --> 04:40.340]  As the founder of the Texas Rangers said, a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man
[04:40.340 --> 04:46.340]  who's in the right, who keeps on coming, but I'm going to keep on coming.
[04:46.340 --> 04:51.340]  And whether I personally make it through all this in the weeks and years to come, doesn't really matter.
[04:51.340 --> 04:56.340]  As long as we persevere and are good example to others, we will be victorious.
[04:56.340 --> 05:01.340]  Incredible transmission straight ahead. Tell everybody, tune in now.
[05:01.340 --> 05:06.340]  December 23, 1776. These are the times that try men's souls.
[05:06.340 --> 05:11.340]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel in this crisis shrink from the service of their country.
[05:11.340 --> 05:16.340]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[05:16.340 --> 05:21.340]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us,
[05:21.340 --> 05:24.340]  that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[05:24.340 --> 05:30.340]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[05:30.340 --> 05:35.340]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed
[05:35.340 --> 05:39.340]  if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[05:39.340 --> 05:44.340]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax,
[05:44.340 --> 05:49.340]  but to bind us in all cases whatsoever. And if being bound in that matter is not slavery,
[05:49.340 --> 05:52.340]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth.
[05:52.340 --> 05:58.340]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[05:58.340 --> 06:01.340]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis
[06:29.340 --> 06:32.340]  Buses, 18 wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[06:32.340 --> 06:35.340]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[06:35.340 --> 06:39.340]  allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[06:39.340 --> 06:44.340]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.

[07:57.340 --> 08:26.340]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[08:28.340 --> 08:32.340]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns,
[08:32.340 --> 08:37.340]  Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[08:37.340 --> 08:43.340]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[08:43.340 --> 08:48.340]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[08:48.340 --> 09:00.340]  I am sworn upon the order of God, internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[09:00.340 --> 09:11.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[09:11.340 --> 09:18.340]  Well, the horrid communist occultic mayday has come and gone. Very eventful.
[09:18.340 --> 09:23.340]  It's now the second day of May 2017 on this Tuesday, global transmission.
[09:23.340 --> 09:29.340]  Another month or so will be halfway into 2017 as we accelerate into the future
[09:29.340 --> 09:34.340]  via the space time continuum at light speed.
[09:34.340 --> 09:38.340]  We're going to have wide open phones today and we have Owen Schroyer popping in in studio
[09:38.340 --> 09:43.340]  and also Millie Weaver who valiantly with the camera crew as well as Rob Dew went downtown yesterday
[09:43.340 --> 09:50.340]  while there was a mass stabbing during the anti-fascist communist celebration.
[09:50.340 --> 09:54.340]  That's right. The media is asking, oh, why did it happen? We don't know a motive.
[09:54.340 --> 10:02.340]  I don't know a motive of white people and Asians being stabbed by a black man at the antifa event.
[10:02.340 --> 10:10.340]  I wonder what that was all about. I have stacks of news with communism being celebrated around the world yesterday.
[10:10.340 --> 10:17.340]  Then I have stacks of news about people starving to death in Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, and it just makes you ask,
[10:17.340 --> 10:25.340]  why do people celebrate communism? Well, why is there a huge cult in Mexico worshipping the grim reaper? I don't know.
[10:25.340 --> 10:30.340]  I need to understand that.
[10:30.340 --> 10:35.340]  So many huge events, so many important things happening.
[10:35.340 --> 10:40.340]  Coming up, North Korea threatens the final doom of the United States and here's the problem.
[10:40.340 --> 10:48.340]  They don't have long range missiles. They've got submarines that are off our coast and that could nuke U.S. cities
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.340]  and that's why Trump is being forced to move and take action.
[10:51.340 --> 10:59.340]  The president is doing what he has to do and I support him with a situation on the Korean Peninsula.
[10:59.340 --> 11:05.340]  That said, we've got his new budget, twice the length of Obama's, quite large, has a lot of good things in it,
[11:05.340 --> 11:09.340]  has some bad things in it. I spent about an hour early this morning trying to go over it.
[11:09.340 --> 11:13.340]  The Democrats are celebrating it saying, oh, look, you're more Democrat than us.
[11:13.340 --> 11:19.340]  That's all their backhanded attacks with Trump working with them to get a budget through so there wouldn't be a government shutdown.
[11:19.340 --> 11:31.340]  But I know this. Trump is bringing back American pride. Trump is bringing back a sense of value and exceptionalism in our jobs and our industry
[11:31.340 --> 11:40.340]  and is promoting nationalism and sovereignty and local control and the local worker and the family.
[11:40.340 --> 11:47.340]  The globalists have been demoralizing the nation state for decades and Trump is an American president.
[11:47.340 --> 11:55.340]  He's calling the shots. He's in charge, not the bureaucracies, not the IMF, not the World Bank, not the World Trade Organization,
[11:55.340 --> 12:03.340]  not the import, export bank, not the TPP. And that's why, despite the fact that he's done deals with them to get stuff done,
[12:03.340 --> 12:09.340]  he's only the president. As Ron Paul said hundreds of times when he's running for president three times in the 1990s
[12:09.340 --> 12:13.340]  and then again in the 2000s twice, he kept saying on this show and others.
[12:13.340 --> 12:20.340]  He's coming on, I think, tomorrow. Look, under the Constitution, I can do a lot but not as much as you think.
[12:20.340 --> 12:24.340]  We're not going to reverse all this overnight and I'll tell you.
[12:24.340 --> 12:32.340]  The word is Kennedy, member of the Supreme Court, is about to step down that Trump was told it is imminent.
[12:32.340 --> 12:38.340]  That could be in the next month, but that's from Roger Stone directly from the president that they've received the letter
[12:38.340 --> 12:45.340]  that he is doing up. That is an exclusive. You know, just after we put that out, some of the mainstream news said,
[12:45.340 --> 12:49.340]  oh, the word is he may be. No, the word is he is.
[12:49.340 --> 12:54.340]  And then politics a month is imminent, but we're talking the next month or so.
[12:54.340 --> 13:00.340]  And so I was just really reflecting on the bad things Trump's doing, saying they want to go after Assange,
[13:00.340 --> 13:06.340]  you helped get him elected, knew he said, release more of the intel Assange, please.
[13:06.340 --> 13:12.340]  That's just betrayal. I don't like that. It's a big black guy for the president and for my confidence.
[13:12.340 --> 13:15.340]  But I look at some of the other stuff, the Syria thing was clearly a false flag.
[13:15.340 --> 13:17.340]  I don't know who did it, probably the jihadis.
[13:17.340 --> 13:22.340]  I know Trump had to kind of go along with that or he'd get blamed for going along with the chemical attack
[13:22.340 --> 13:27.340]  and being a Russian minion. So he did kind of kill that false agenda by doing that.
[13:27.340 --> 13:32.340]  But now Russian relations are falling apart. So you do one move like that and then, you know, things start unraveling.
[13:32.340 --> 13:39.340]  Even though it handled a bunch of other problems, it's like whack-a-mole. It starts a bunch of others.
[13:39.340 --> 13:44.340]  And then I see some of the other things, but I mean, when it comes to the border and the wall and the security
[13:44.340 --> 13:49.340]  and crushing ISIS and standing up against radical Islam and three trillion plus in the stock market
[13:49.340 --> 13:54.340]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of new jobs and hundreds of major companies coming back,
[13:54.340 --> 13:58.340]  even foreign countries coming in, it's amazing.
[13:58.340 --> 14:07.340]  Killing DPP, getting a good Supreme Court justice in, check to get another one in.
[14:07.340 --> 14:16.340]  Thank God we've got this respite and people that expect everything to be perfect are instant gratification folks.
[14:16.340 --> 14:21.340]  In fact, I was thinking about two weeks ago about instant gratification myself and so many others I know.
[14:21.340 --> 14:24.340]  I'm certainly not perfect here. I'm not, again, lecturing everybody.
[14:24.340 --> 14:28.340]  I'm just saying what I'd like to be better at, what I think you should try to be better at.
[14:28.340 --> 14:33.340]  And then we had a military guy calling who was so eloquent about the North Korea situation on Friday,
[14:33.340 --> 14:36.340]  and he said, you know, it's an instant gratification society.
[14:36.340 --> 14:42.340]  You're not going to get instant gratification and you're not going to get exactly what you want right when you want it,
[14:42.340 --> 14:49.340]  but you will get what you need. You can't always get what you want.
[14:49.340 --> 14:55.340]  No, you can't always get what you want, but you get what you need.
[14:55.340 --> 15:00.340]  And the spirit of Trump has them in a total complete hissy fit.
[15:00.340 --> 15:04.340]  So there's the big debate going on as Trump does his bad.
[15:04.340 --> 15:07.340]  Everybody's weaknesses, their family, mine is too.
[15:07.340 --> 15:13.340]  And I get that Ivanka can run around and do her own peacemaking and kind of maybe charm the left and not hating Trump so much
[15:13.340 --> 15:16.340]  if they can have a relationship with her or Kushner.
[15:16.340 --> 15:20.340]  And if that's all Trump was doing, I'd be for it.
[15:20.340 --> 15:23.340]  But the swamp isn't getting drained as fast as we need.
[15:23.340 --> 15:27.340]  I'm seeing the swamp get drained some, but it's kind of like a video game.
[15:27.340 --> 15:29.340]  Picture two different graphs.
[15:29.340 --> 15:33.340]  The swamps getting drained at, you know, say 10% every few months.
[15:33.340 --> 15:36.340]  And Trump's already drained it, maybe 20, 30%.
[15:36.340 --> 15:38.340]  But he's getting drained.
[15:38.340 --> 15:42.340]  As fast as he's having victories, he's starting to have defeats.
[15:42.340 --> 15:45.340]  So I look at the calculus, I look at the arithmetic, I look at the mathematics.
[15:45.340 --> 15:51.340]  I just did record it and it doesn't look good a year from now on the current trajectory he's on.
[15:51.340 --> 15:54.340]  He's already done devastating good to the globalist.
[15:54.340 --> 15:58.340]  He's done devastating harm to their operations.
[15:58.340 --> 16:06.340]  But I can look at the track this is on and first 70 days almost perfect.
[16:06.340 --> 16:07.340]  I couldn't believe it.
[16:07.340 --> 16:17.340]  It was like God's sin, just like he was unstoppable, infallible.
[16:17.340 --> 16:23.340]  And then by day 71 or two, we're now like 105 days in, 104 days in.
[16:23.340 --> 16:25.340]  The track started going off to the side.
[16:25.340 --> 16:29.340]  He's not going sideways yet, but he was going straight.
[16:29.340 --> 16:31.340]  Now the track's starting to go like that.
[16:31.340 --> 16:33.340]  And you know, you launch a rocket, it's going straight up.
[16:33.340 --> 16:39.340]  And a few degrees goes up, turns and crashes.
[16:39.340 --> 16:43.340]  So I hope you can get this gyros back in line.
[16:43.340 --> 16:49.340]  I hope you can get the avionics back in line because the missile's kind of going like this, the rocket's going like this.
[16:49.340 --> 16:53.340]  And if it keeps going like that, it's going to crash land.
[16:53.340 --> 16:56.340]  As we all know, missiles don't crash land.
[16:56.340 --> 16:59.340]  So that's the big issue we're going to be discussing here today.
[16:59.340 --> 17:03.340]  We're spending more on Facebook, I only mentioned this briefly actually.
[17:03.340 --> 17:21.340]  It really hit me last night how big this is that Facebook got caught in its internal high level memos running giant computer programs to prey on young people and to make them insecure and to make them controlled and to put them into control groups to dominate and manipulate their lives.
[17:21.340 --> 17:27.340]  Because I was reading the documents that news.co.au got and the media missed it as usual.
[17:27.340 --> 17:33.340]  They're saying leaked documents are real Facebook conducted research to target emotionally vulnerable and insecure youth.
[17:33.340 --> 17:37.340]  But it's also trendies and other insecure groups.
[17:37.340 --> 17:42.340]  And the key is it's to keep them insecure and keep them under a controlled paradigm.
[17:42.340 --> 17:45.340]  I shot a 30 minute video on it last night with Zimmerman.
[17:45.340 --> 17:47.340]  Facebook targeted insecure children and vulnerable trendies.
[17:47.340 --> 17:49.340]  Very powerful I think.
[17:49.340 --> 17:55.340]  But I'm going to get more into that today because I was thinking more about it this morning.
[17:55.340 --> 18:05.340]  It's the whole system, the whole worldview, the whole false paradigm cosmology of the globalist to create.
[18:05.340 --> 18:13.340]  Addled, stunted, cowardly, fearful group think followers.
[18:13.340 --> 18:15.340]  And that's why they hate me so much.
[18:15.340 --> 18:17.340]  And listen, I don't want to sit here and say, oh, I'm so big.
[18:17.340 --> 18:20.340]  Oh, look, they attacked me every night on the nightly news.
[18:20.340 --> 18:24.340]  Oh, every, every night on the late night shows.
[18:24.340 --> 18:27.340]  I tell you, this is about survival for myself and you and my family.
[18:27.340 --> 18:30.340]  I mean, I'm so committed to this.
[18:30.340 --> 18:34.340]  Things are so bad now that I've got just unlimited energy.
[18:34.340 --> 18:39.340]  I've never had so much energy because things have never been so good.
[18:39.340 --> 18:41.340]  Best of times, worst of times.
[18:41.340 --> 18:47.340]  The tale of two cities, one of my favorite quotes, the opening pages of that book, tale of two cities.
[18:47.340 --> 18:50.340]  But we just print me that opening page.
[18:50.340 --> 18:52.340]  Thank you.
[18:52.340 --> 18:54.340]  And that's where we are.
[18:54.340 --> 19:03.340]  We're in that moment, the Chinese proverb, the Chinese character, the Chinese symbol for opportunity is also uncertainty.
[19:03.340 --> 19:05.340]  May you live in interesting times.
[19:05.340 --> 19:10.340]  Don't we live in interesting times where they've got human animal clones all over the place.
[19:10.340 --> 19:13.340]  MIT admits it, but the media says I'm crazy.
[19:13.340 --> 19:21.340]  Or it's in Fox Business, lab grown meat coming to supermarket shelves.
[19:21.340 --> 19:24.340]  Mine has already got lab grown meat on its shelves.
[19:24.340 --> 19:29.340]  And for 20 years, they've been selling human baby milk produced by cows.
[19:29.340 --> 19:34.340]  Now the cows have human cells in their breasts that produce human milk.
[19:34.340 --> 19:38.340]  I mean, people say, okay, yeah, tell us something we don't know.
[19:38.340 --> 19:50.340]  They admitted and declassified two days ago that in the 1960s, they had cyborg cats with hidden microphones and stuff on them.
[19:50.340 --> 19:54.340]  And I mean, folks, imagine where we're at in 2017.
[19:54.340 --> 19:55.340]  That's all I'm saying.
[19:55.340 --> 19:57.340]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[19:57.340 --> 19:59.340]  We're not 1950 anymore.
[19:59.340 --> 20:21.340]  We'll be back.

[21:06.340 --> 21:09.340]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[21:09.340 --> 21:11.340]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[21:11.340 --> 21:16.340]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[24:22.340 --> 24:44.340]  It's a deftifying life I lead. I take my chances. I die for a living defeating the globalist.
[24:44.340 --> 24:54.340]  Yep, get Trump into office and watch all the globalists take it over and turn against us.
[24:54.340 --> 25:01.340]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that the fall guy bringing us in some old 80s flashbacks.
[25:01.340 --> 25:06.340]  Let's get serious right now. Coming up North Korea, coming up the mass stabbing in Austin, Texas
[25:06.340 --> 25:10.340]  that our crew happened to be down there covering right when it happened, incredible, really dangerous,
[25:10.340 --> 25:17.340]  familiar weaver and others. We've got a whole bunch of news dealing with the spending bill,
[25:17.340 --> 25:25.340]  a lot of news dealing with Facebook, surveilling the youth and trying to keep them depressed and controlling them.
[25:25.340 --> 25:31.340]  All that is coming up, but first I want to toot our horn and Mike Cernovich's horn again.
[25:31.340 --> 25:36.340]  The media is calling for his weekly pass he was given. We've gotten those as well.
[25:36.340 --> 25:42.340]  We're pending getting our regular passes, which are very hard to get at the White House with Jerome Corsi.
[25:42.340 --> 25:47.340]  The national media said that it was white power when he made the Trump symbol of AOK.
[25:47.340 --> 25:51.340]  We're going to handle it. Everything's being taken care of with finesse.
[25:51.340 --> 25:55.340]  Doesn't matter if that means it's handled. We've got it done. Everything's AOK.
[25:55.340 --> 26:03.340]  They say he's an evil white supremacist because he's pointed out that Antifa is attacking people all over the United States.
[26:03.340 --> 26:08.340]  And he was able to get that out in the briefing yesterday at the White House.
[26:08.340 --> 26:11.340]  Of course, they're also attacking people and killing people all over the world.
[26:11.340 --> 26:20.340]  But three folks, four folks got stabbed yesterday and one of them died just miles from where I sit at one of the loving Antifa events.
[26:20.340 --> 26:25.340]  But hey, that's more evil white people that are out of the way.
[26:25.340 --> 26:33.340]  Hip hip hooray, another liberal celebration of their nonviolent activity.
[26:33.340 --> 26:45.340]  And of course the person's mentally ill, but things like these mentally ill liberal demonstrations draw these folks like, you know what flies to something.
[26:45.340 --> 26:52.340]  Because it's true, modern liberalism is a mental disorder, as Michael Savage and many others have properly said.
[26:52.340 --> 27:03.340]  But something else, Cernovich and Paul Watson were right about last week was that McMaster, the guy that passed boots on the ground in Syria and does want a ground war.
[27:03.340 --> 27:10.340]  That was now in the news yesterday that sure enough McMaster does want a ground war in Syria, even though Trump has said that isn't going to happen.
[27:10.340 --> 27:15.340]  Our sources in the White House say that is the plan and that Trump's trying to block it.
[27:15.340 --> 27:26.340]  Meanwhile, making Afghanistan great again from Bloomberg. So last week we report on what's happening and that he does want more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.
[27:26.340 --> 27:33.340]  And then now, yesterday on May 1st, it comes out President Donald Trump will soon have decided what to do about Afghanistan.
[27:33.340 --> 27:43.340]  After weeks of wrangling inside his National Security Cabinet top officials on Friday agreed on the broad outlines of strategies to prosecute America's longest war and to continue it.
[27:43.340 --> 27:51.340]  And McMaster wants to expand it. So exactly what we told you internally at the White House last week that broke three days later in Bloomberg.
[27:51.340 --> 27:54.340]  Here is Mike Cernovich giving you the exclusive.
[27:54.340 --> 28:08.340]  So it really is mind blowing. So McMaster presented a $35 billion plan for Afghanistan at a principles meeting, which was with the whole National Security Council minus the president was there.
[28:08.340 --> 28:18.340]  McMaster wants to spend $35 billion in Afghanistan and he faced a lot of resistance and pushback from various officials there.
[28:18.340 --> 28:24.340]  McMaster said, I quote, we will create an inclusive government.
[28:24.340 --> 28:32.340]  The strategy has not been presented to the president because even the people at the principles meeting McMaster is out of his mind.
[28:32.340 --> 28:40.340]  McMaster is saying, what are you talking about? You want to do $35 billion in Afghanistan? What is that going to look like? Are we talking troop surges, another surge?
[28:40.340 --> 28:50.340]  Now, remember McMaster was a protégé of David Petraeus and Petraeus is indeed pulling the strings of McMaster and Petraeus was a big proponent of the surge.
[28:50.340 --> 29:02.340]  So McMaster is now going to present another massive $35 billion plan to Donald Trump to create a new regime in Afghanistan.
[29:02.340 --> 29:13.340]  That's last Friday when Mike Cernovich was on and they say a bare minimum of $23 billion in this principles meeting that broke in the big Bloomberg exclusive.
[29:13.340 --> 29:21.340]  And it goes on to say perhaps even more so you get exactly what was in the meeting and there was pushback against McMaster.
[29:21.340 --> 29:31.340]  General H.R. McMaster prevailed though we're now learning and that that is the plan to actually expand the Afghan war.
[29:31.340 --> 29:35.340]  Trump, even Alexander the Great had to pull out of Afghanistan.
[29:35.340 --> 29:45.340]  The British pulled out, the Russians pulled out, everybody pulls out because they're like cavemen and they never submit and they're always killing each other too.
[29:45.340 --> 30:09.340]  It's all tribal warfare so any victory will be Perik will be back.
[30:09.340 --> 30:15.340]  The American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[30:15.340 --> 30:19.340]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[30:19.340 --> 30:25.340]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[30:25.340 --> 30:30.340]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[30:30.340 --> 30:34.340]  If we are only free to make good decisions then we are not really free.
[30:34.340 --> 30:41.340]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints,
[30:41.340 --> 30:47.340]  random searches, mandatory identification cards and paramilitary police in our streets.
[30:47.340 --> 30:50.340]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[30:50.340 --> 30:55.340]  America was born of protests, revolution and mistrust of government.
[30:55.340 --> 31:00.340]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[31:00.340 --> 31:05.340]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:05.340 --> 31:08.340]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:08.340 --> 31:14.340]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:14.340 --> 31:20.340]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[31:20.340 --> 31:23.340]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:23.340 --> 31:28.340]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[31:28.340 --> 31:33.340]  Through the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[31:33.340 --> 31:38.340]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.340 --> 31:40.340]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.340 --> 31:44.340]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.340 --> 31:48.340]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.340 --> 31:55.340]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.340 --> 31:58.340]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[31:58.340 --> 32:27.340]  Nymphalwarstore.com

[32:35.340 --> 32:43.340]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more
[32:43.340 --> 32:48.340]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[32:48.340 --> 32:51.340]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Superblue that is spearmint free.

[33:01.340 --> 33:30.340]  This is our land. These are our people. The workers. The strivers. The builders. These are our people.
[33:30.340 --> 33:33.340]  Who are they?
[33:33.340 --> 33:39.340]  They are the dark armies. The dark, murdering armies was only honor.
[33:39.340 --> 33:42.340]  It's atrocity.
[33:42.340 --> 33:51.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:51.340 --> 33:58.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:58.340 --> 34:06.340]  You're watching us on television. You can see the Earth from space from the International Space Station.
[34:06.340 --> 34:13.340]  Yes, we live in a magical universe. Consciousness is the ultimate gift, is it not?
[34:13.340 --> 34:17.340]  All right, let me start running through the news here and then I'm going to open the phones up.
[34:17.340 --> 34:29.340]  Ellen shroyer has big news joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[34:29.340 --> 34:54.340]  They're all like runts and they're all really hateful and they're all really devilish and they're all really stupid running around promoting and celebrating communism.
[34:54.340 --> 35:06.340]  Before I go any further, I decided last week that we'll do a 30 hour broadcast that kicks off at 11am tomorrow and runs right through my regular show and right up into the evening.
[35:06.340 --> 35:12.340]  And we're going to have a whole bunch of amazing guests breaking news, special reports we're going to premiere, and so much more.
[35:12.340 --> 35:17.340]  But it's really an exercise in resistance where we're going to have the feed at infowars.com.
[35:17.340 --> 35:24.340]  We have the show, we have the feeds on YouTube, Facebook, you name it, and just share those links. Say this is the forbidden information.
[35:24.340 --> 35:29.340]  This is why the globalists are so afraid. This is the information that the New World Order is scared of.
[35:29.340 --> 35:33.340]  This is the video link. This is the audio link. They don't want you to see or hear.
[35:33.340 --> 35:39.340]  And instead of just a few million extra people tuning in or watching, we could have tens of millions.
[35:39.340 --> 35:42.340]  And that happens quite often when you get involved and you take action.
[35:42.340 --> 35:47.340]  So tomorrow, I'm calling and I put out two different names to the crew came up with both.
[35:47.340 --> 35:51.340]  We can kind of maybe show folks the graphics and then we've tweeted them out.
[35:51.340 --> 36:00.340]  And that's Defense of the West special 30 hour broadcast and Defense of Free Speech 30 hour broadcast.
[36:00.340 --> 36:06.340]  But the West is about free speech and the West is being absolutely taken down by the globalists.
[36:06.340 --> 36:11.340]  30 hour broadcast and defense of free speech.
[36:11.340 --> 36:17.340]  On my Twitter, I tweeted it out today. Please retweet that from real Alan Jones to everybody you know.
[36:17.340 --> 36:25.340]  This is an information war. Google is spending tens of millions of dollars admittedly to shut us down and block us.
[36:25.340 --> 36:36.340]  Facebook doesn't let us hardly share our information. You have to do it individually by hand sharing through your email, by posting on your Facebook wall,
[36:36.340 --> 36:44.340]  by sending it out on YouTube. And believe me, if they can take down info wars as they're trying to do every week with new operations against us.
[36:44.340 --> 36:51.340]  A lot of which I can't talk about on air at this time. But I've got people on it and we've got amazing intel.
[36:51.340 --> 36:59.340]  So a lot coming in the next few weeks and months that is going to be absolutely incredible to let folks know exactly what happened.
[36:59.340 --> 37:06.340]  We already have the Democrats caught doing it, the Justice Department caught doing it, the Pentagon through the CIA caught doing it, congressional hearings.
[37:06.340 --> 37:22.340]  We've got even more from the leaks we've got. But some of these leaks are very high level and we don't know how to present the information without burning who we got the information from.
[37:22.340 --> 37:36.340]  And we want to continue to have those sources. I mean, I've had a source on occasion, the president.
[37:36.340 --> 37:42.340]  But they've done their best to try to shut that down. Stone still is in regular communication. Me every once in a while.
[37:42.340 --> 37:53.340]  But Cernovich has a conduit, not the president, but right by the president. And that's why it's such dead on information to get. But then we have a lot of other conduits in the White House.
[37:53.340 --> 38:09.340]  And they're being run out right now. So I'm not releasing sources here. The enemy knows. And people been called on the carpet and they go, Oh, I'm bad because I'm exposing that George Soros is trying to infiltrate the White House.
[38:09.340 --> 38:19.340]  Oh, I'm bad because I'm exposing the Democrats are trying to get Trump to be pro gun control. I mean, the people are like, we're the ones defending the Republic.
[38:19.340 --> 38:28.340]  It's the White House getting overrun with globalists right now. And so they're really going after people, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not complaining about that.
[38:28.340 --> 38:43.340]  You have to understand the epic point we're at in history that separates the men from the boys. And if you will just give people links to stories you think are important and links to videos you think are important and point out this is the forbidden info.
[38:43.340 --> 38:52.340]  Historically, it's a major miscalculation to try to censor somebody who's got pertinent info unless you completely shut them down and are successful.
[38:52.340 --> 39:04.340]  And that's why they're going for broke. They've really taken a risk to doing this. Patriotism sovereignty nationalism is the new counterculture.
[39:04.340 --> 39:11.340]  Not the fake globalist leftist system, not the fake right wing blue blood rhino neocon system.
[39:11.340 --> 39:29.340]  So everybody has to decide who's side they're on right now and hang together or hang separate. But it's a war. And if you will just commit to spread the links, if you will just commit to spread the articles, if you'll commit to call C span and plug info wars.com.
[39:29.340 --> 39:44.340]  Or instead of saying Bill Clinton's a rapist, that's still happening every day at rallies all over the country. It's having a great effect. I get sent links every day at these Democrat, you know, events at these town halls with Democrats go busted by Soros paid to go in and scream anti America garbage.
[39:44.340 --> 39:50.340]  People are going to those and saying Bill Clinton's a rapist, Bill Clinton's a rapist, and they can't stand it.
[39:50.340 --> 39:58.340]  How about people start saying info wars.com is the tip of the spear info wars.com is what they don't want you to look at.
[39:58.340 --> 40:10.340]  They hate Alex Jones because he's not afraid to fight the NWO. They hate info wars because it supports the people visit info wars.com. It's the forbidden information.
[40:10.340 --> 40:21.340]  If you'll do that on C span, if you'll go to city council and do that, if you'll do that on national TV, when they're out there doing a live event or local TV, it will change the world.
[40:21.340 --> 40:34.340]  You are info wars. If you're a patriot, if you're pro gun, if you're pro sovereignty, if you're pro free market, if you're a Christian, a real Christian, non establishment, country club Christian, Christianoid, as my late uncle called them.
[40:34.340 --> 40:48.340]  If you really want to fight the globalist, if you really want to win, we're starting to win. That's why they're coming after us and they've picked info wars as target number one, the lead elephant.
[40:48.340 --> 40:59.340]  I spent a quarter million dollars on Russian Limbaugh show and barely got my money back when they were about to kick him off the air five years ago, six years ago, six, seven years ago.
[40:59.340 --> 41:09.340]  Didn't get to thank you. No, that's fine because I have instincts. I have honor and I knew even though I disagree with a lot of what Limbaugh said, he was better than New World Order.
[41:09.340 --> 41:13.340]  He would not to get this country. At least he was a patriot.
[41:13.340 --> 41:19.340]  I've done the same thing for everybody else when they're under attack. When Drudge is under attack by the Federal Elections Commission trying to shut him down.
[41:19.340 --> 41:25.340]  I come out and speak out against it or World Net Daily gets targeted or Bill O'Reilly as bad as he was.
[41:25.340 --> 41:35.340]  He was targeted because he was seen as a patriot, even though he really wasn't. He wouldn't fully sell out during the election and follow orders so he was destroyed.
[41:35.340 --> 41:52.340]  And if they can destroy info wars, ladies and gentlemen, which they're openly saying they want to do with the member of the New York Federal Reserve Board suing me with George Soros' law firm prosecuting and all the other dirty tricks.
[41:52.340 --> 42:00.340]  And the media clearly manipulating and influencing what happened in my custody case and all of it.
[42:00.340 --> 42:09.340]  That's only the surface. You only see the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Believe me, below the surface it's Piranha Ville.
[42:09.340 --> 42:18.340]  But you know what? As fast as they eat my flesh, that's how Providence works. It's just replaced. And you know what? Stronger. Stronger.
[42:18.340 --> 42:27.340]  It's incredible. I am so much stronger than I was even a month ago that I can't even believe it. It's amazing.
[42:27.340 --> 42:32.340]  And so as fast as they're tearing me down, God's building me back up. And that's because of your prayers.
[42:32.340 --> 42:44.340]  And that's the number one thing I need is your prayers and your support in the public because if they can destroy me and make an example out of info wars, they can intimidate everybody else.
[42:44.340 --> 42:59.340]  I'm seen as the tiger they got by the tail. And they think that if they can not even destroy me but make people think I've been destroyed, it can be an example of cowardice for everybody else.
[42:59.340 --> 43:06.340]  That's all they're doing. If you let one aunt stand up, we actually have that video. We ought to come in with that and play that in a while.
[43:06.340 --> 43:23.340]  If you let one aunt stand up, they might all stand up. Those little puny aunts outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, it's over for us, says the old grasshopper.
[43:23.340 --> 43:28.340]  So that's where we stand. I want to take first-time callers on any of the issues I've raised.
[43:28.340 --> 43:33.340]  What you think of the Trump budget, what you think of where Trump's going, maybe you agree, maybe you disagree.
[43:33.340 --> 43:41.340]  He's an American president. He's returning our sovereignty. He's returning our wealth. He's returning our honor.
[43:41.340 --> 43:50.340]  But he's starting to slide. He's for real. But the swamps draining him. What do we do? We don't desert him. We're loyal opposition.
[43:50.340 --> 43:56.340]  We know he's better than Democrats. We know he's going to give us good Supreme Court justices. That alone right there is good.
[43:56.340 --> 44:03.340]  And we stay there as loyal opposition so that we're there at those rallies and we're there on Twitter and we're there in the media.
[44:03.340 --> 44:13.340]  With such a hue and cry through talk radio and c-span in every system that where our voices can be heard in the White House switchboard so that he knows to stay in the courts and we're behind him.
[44:13.340 --> 44:22.340]  They think Trump's an idiot because he actually cares about America. He's not a sociopath. He actually wants wealth and prosperity. His businesses are based on a service economy.
[44:22.340 --> 44:32.340]  Trump feels pathetic when he sees people poor. He sees the economy slowing down. He wants prosperity and he knows he's tied to you.
[44:32.340 --> 44:45.340]  And he knows his destiny is tied to delivering the return of the Republic and the new American century, not of the neocons of war and death, but the new American century of prosperity and Americana and soft power.
[44:45.340 --> 44:56.340]  800-25-99231. 800-25-99231. 800-25-99231 is the toll free number.
[44:56.340 --> 45:04.340]  I'm going to hit North Korea. Some of the anti-foss stuff and then your phone calls. But let me just briefly, again, talk about the financial support.
[45:04.340 --> 45:14.340]  Support our local affiliates. Support their sponsors. That's critical. Spread the word. Don't take it for granted. You're hearing us in Los Angeles or Chicago right now.

[46:16.340 --> 46:24.340]  Never tried, including other fluoride-free toothpaste. A little goes a long way. I look forward to brushing knowing it helps increase the good bacteria.
[46:24.340 --> 46:30.340]  Thus improving health via several routes.
[46:30.340 --> 46:40.340]  Bad breath killer. Raymond says, wow, no fluoride. Works great on cleaning teeth. And is a bad breath killer. Mouth madness.
[46:40.340 --> 46:51.340]  I can notice a difference in freshness of breath, as well as gum health. Better than any toothpaste on the market. I just bought the bubblegum flavor for my son. Thank you, Infowars.

[52:24.340 --> 52:26.340]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[52:26.340 --> 52:30.340]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[52:30.340 --> 52:31.340]  That's amazing.
[52:31.340 --> 52:35.340]  Really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[52:35.340 --> 52:42.340]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys. I love the info wars through and I just want to, yeah,

[52:56.340 --> 53:01.340]  So win, win, infowarslife.com.
[53:26.340 --> 53:30.340]  7, 8, 8, 6, 3, 6, 5, 3. Go Berkey.com.
[53:56.340 --> 54:01.340]  That's advertise.gcnlive.com.
[54:27.340 --> 54:31.340]  All right, I'm going to your phone calls and then interspersed.
[54:31.340 --> 54:35.340]  I've got more clips of Trump's speeches he's been giving talking about turning the economy back on.
[54:35.340 --> 54:44.340]  We've got breakdowns on his budget bill that would have a spending freeze for the first time in decades on the IRS.
[54:44.340 --> 54:46.340]  So there is some good news there.
[54:46.340 --> 54:50.340]  Bad news that McMaster is getting Trump to escalate the Afghan war.
[54:50.340 --> 54:57.340]  It is a mixed bag, but we are getting better Supreme Court justices and the economy is being turned back on.
[54:57.340 --> 55:01.340]  And NAFTA and Gad are getting renegotiated and TPP is dead.
[55:01.340 --> 55:05.340]  So how do you throw the baby out with the bathwater? You can't.
[55:05.340 --> 55:10.340]  You put pressure on Trump and his administration where he's wrong or where you think he's wrong.
[55:10.340 --> 55:13.340]  And then you support the things he's doing that are good.
[55:13.340 --> 55:17.340]  But the word is the new Obamacare bill is better than the last one.
[55:17.340 --> 55:20.340]  But still the Freedom Caucus is not going for it.
[55:20.340 --> 55:21.340]  And I back them on that.
[55:21.340 --> 55:30.340]  We need to gut that monster and not give the Republican establishment some of the screw jobs they wanted that they wrote into Obamacare.
[55:30.340 --> 55:32.340]  That's what makes me so mad at liberals.
[55:32.340 --> 55:40.340]  The Republican establishment, the horrible globalist blue bloods, helped write Obamacare 20 years ago in Massachusetts meant Romney.
[55:40.340 --> 55:45.340]  And it was written by the insurance companies to make you go into the market, make you buy it.
[55:45.340 --> 55:49.340]  And then Obama added a bunch of socialist stuff on top of it, made it even worse.
[55:49.340 --> 55:57.340]  So at Bankrupted Healthcare, that Ezekiel Emanuel and Jonathan Gruber admitted on C-SPAN and Fox News,
[55:57.340 --> 56:07.340]  was the plan to fully destroy it and have socialist single payer with fascism on top where the big banks run it
[56:07.340 --> 56:12.340]  and the insurance companies run it and shut down all the small insurers and then really gouge you.
[56:12.340 --> 56:16.340]  Make you buy a product with no competition.
[56:16.340 --> 56:19.340]  That's why the mega banks support centralization.
[56:19.340 --> 56:20.340]  They want monopolies.
[56:20.340 --> 56:22.340]  They want a monopoly of the media.
[56:22.340 --> 56:26.340]  They want to call old media they don't control fake because we're not fake.
[56:26.340 --> 56:33.340]  They want to say we're Russian agents with no proof in Congress because they're the globalist agents.
[56:33.340 --> 56:34.340]  They're the enemies.
[56:34.340 --> 56:37.340]  They're the people selling out America.
[56:37.340 --> 56:38.340]  They're the traders.
[56:38.340 --> 56:41.340]  They're the plague.
[56:41.340 --> 56:45.340]  You guys print me, tell it to your cities.
[56:45.340 --> 56:48.340]  Best of Times, Worst of Times, the first opening page of that book, please.
[56:48.340 --> 56:49.340]  Thanks.
[56:49.340 --> 56:50.340]  I want to read the trailer as the play.
[56:50.340 --> 56:51.340]  I got to do that every few months on air.
[56:51.340 --> 56:53.340]  Cicero.
[56:53.340 --> 56:54.340]  It was the best of times.
[56:54.340 --> 56:55.340]  It was the worst of times.
[56:55.340 --> 56:56.340]  It was the age of wisdom.
[56:56.340 --> 56:58.340]  It was the age of foolishness.
[56:58.340 --> 56:59.340]  It was the epoch of belief.
[56:59.340 --> 57:02.340]  It was the epoch of incredulity.
[57:02.340 --> 57:03.340]  It was the season of light.
[57:03.340 --> 57:05.340]  It was the season of darkness.
[57:05.340 --> 57:06.340]  It was the spring of hope.
[57:06.340 --> 57:09.340]  It was the winter of despair.
[57:09.340 --> 57:11.340]  The period.
[57:11.340 --> 57:13.340]  We had everything before us.
[57:13.340 --> 57:15.340]  We had nothing before us.
[57:15.340 --> 57:17.340]  We were all going direct to heaven.
[57:17.340 --> 57:20.340]  We were all going direct the other way.
[57:20.340 --> 57:29.340]  In short, the period was so far like the present period that some of the noisiest authorities
[57:29.340 --> 57:37.340]  insisted on it being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only.
[57:37.340 --> 57:39.340]  Mark, print me that.
[57:39.340 --> 57:40.340]  I'm not reading it 20 yards away.
[57:40.340 --> 57:41.340]  Thank you.
[57:41.340 --> 57:42.340]  We're going to come back and I promise.
[57:42.340 --> 57:51.340]  I promise on a stack of King James Version Bibles with a little red bookmark felt hanging
[57:51.340 --> 57:56.340]  between it that we will go to Mark, Ben, Ken, Beth, Levi, and others.
[57:56.340 --> 58:02.340]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99-231.
[58:02.340 --> 58:06.340]  I don't tend to harp on the fact we're under attack, but now that we're under such sustained
[58:06.340 --> 58:09.340]  continual attack, I just want to say again, you are the resistance.
[58:09.340 --> 58:13.340]  That's not me patting you on the head so you feel powerful or you feel included.
[58:13.340 --> 58:17.340]  You are what they're scared of.
[58:17.340 --> 58:20.340]  And they're scared of any focal point where you're able to be heard.
[58:20.340 --> 58:26.340]  I suggest you be heard now more than ever, and I suggest you use our videos, our articles,
[58:26.340 --> 58:33.340]  our intel, our films that are all free online as weapons of truth against the enemy and lies.
[58:33.340 --> 58:36.340]  Have you told somebody to tune in to Info Wars today?
[58:36.340 --> 58:39.340]  It's time to get aggressive or roll over in the ditch and die.
[58:39.340 --> 58:41.340]  And we're starting to win, so let's go full power.
[58:41.340 --> 58:43.340]  That's why the enemy's fighting so hard.
[58:43.340 --> 58:45.340]  Hour 2 and T-minus 70.
[58:45.340 --> 59:14.340]  Here are some of the best pictures at GCN Live.com today.
[59:15.340 --> 59:18.340]  Here are some of the best pictures at GCN Live.
[59:45.340 --> 59:48.340]  Today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[59:48.340 --> 1:00:16.340]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:00:18.340 --> 1:00:22.340]  Listen to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:22.340 --> 1:00:25.340]  Our revenge is that we survive.
[1:00:25.340 --> 1:00:29.340]  Our revenge is that we make it to the future.
[1:00:29.340 --> 1:00:37.340]  The ultimate act of domination is to exterminate a culture, to exterminate an idea, to exterminate the genetics of a people.
[1:00:37.340 --> 1:00:41.340]  Why are they banning Seco de Mayo's celebrations if you're not Hispanic?
[1:00:41.340 --> 1:00:46.340]  Why are they saying it's cultural appropriation if you like Jimi Hendrix music and you're not black?
[1:00:46.340 --> 1:00:51.340]  Why are they banning at colleges everywhere Mexican-themed parties and saying they're racist?
[1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:54.340]  Because they're killing real multiculturalism.
[1:00:54.340 --> 1:00:59.340]  I go eat sushi, it's not appropriating Japanese cuisine, I like some sushi.
[1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:02.340]  Some of it I don't like, a lot of it I love.
[1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:07.340]  I don't appropriate Chinese food because I hate Chinese, it's delicious.
[1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:12.340]  I don't appropriate Mexican food because I hate Mexicans, it's delicious.
[1:01:12.340 --> 1:01:17.340]  Frankly, I probably eat more Mexican food than anything else. I cook Mexican food at my house.
[1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:24.340]  I eat more peppers than most Mexicans I know. Is that a hatred of Mexicans? No, that's called going local.
[1:01:24.340 --> 1:01:35.340]  Cowboy hats came from Spain, from the Cowboys, the Lariots, the ropes, that all was in Mexico, all the way down to Chile.
[1:01:35.340 --> 1:01:43.340]  There's the average person in Texas who sees Mexicans walking around with cowboy hats and they go, look at those Mexicans dressed like Cowboys.
[1:01:43.340 --> 1:01:46.340]  I've actually heard that from ignorant people that weren't real Cowboys.
[1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:51.340]  Why are those Mexicans dressed like Cowboys? Because they invented it.
[1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:59.340]  That's what multiculturalism is. America is multiculturalism and they're using our strength against us with their false multiculturalism.
[1:01:59.340 --> 1:02:06.340]  That's coming up with Owen Schreuer. But right now, I'm going to Ben next segment because he was talking about Netflix and Bill Nye population control.
[1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:15.340]  I saw articles about that two days ago. I didn't watch the video. I can't stand his condescension, his fake professor face, the little white lab coats.
[1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:20.340]  He says arrest people that disagree with climate change. I'm going to go to you next segment because we're going to get that clip, Ben.
[1:02:20.340 --> 1:02:23.340]  But yeah, it's sick. Tell us what you saw coming up.
[1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:30.340]  But right now, let's talk to Mark in the great state of Pennsylvania where El Presidente gave an amazing speech this Wednesday.
[1:02:30.340 --> 1:02:32.340]  Go ahead.
[1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:34.340]  Hi, Alex. Pleasure to speak with you.
[1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:35.340]  Thank you.
[1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:38.340]  Pleasure to speak with you, sir.
[1:02:38.340 --> 1:02:44.340]  Trump and his White House with the budget that they're going to put through today or try to put through and have him sign.
[1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:48.340]  Do you think he has them playing and do his hand?
[1:02:48.340 --> 1:02:54.340]  I mean, literally with the money, he's given them $1 trillion for a few months time.
[1:02:54.340 --> 1:03:01.340]  And I just wonder if he has the Democrats actually playing into his hand. What's your thoughts on that?
[1:03:01.340 --> 1:03:10.340]  Well, he wants prosperity. He knows the global economy is stalling. It was set in every major financial periodical to really start going downhill this year.
[1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:15.340]  And so he's trying globally to get the European stock market up, which finally started going up to get ours up.
[1:03:15.340 --> 1:03:22.340]  It's been meteoric to get jobs going, to get multinational investment going both ways, two-way streets.
[1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:29.340]  And so he's done an amazing global economic turnaround in just 104 days in office that's unprecedented.
[1:03:29.340 --> 1:03:36.340]  But we're not out of the proverbial forest yet. We're not out of the tall trees yet.
[1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:44.340]  So we've got to really get behind Trump's economic agenda that Ron Paul said a month ago on the show is, quote, amazing.
[1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:50.340]  Say what you want about Trump and some of his issues that I disagree with greatly. He's doing great things for our economy.
[1:03:50.340 --> 1:03:58.340]  And so, yes, I think given the Democrats some of what they want on spending, freezing the IRS, getting border security money basically doubled.
[1:03:58.340 --> 1:04:04.340]  It's overall a big spending bill. But if the economy gets going again, we'll be able to pay off that debt.
[1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:08.340]  If we don't, it's going to stall out and we're never going to pay these debts.
[1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:16.340]  So overall, I am giving Trump cautious, cautious support at this point. What do you think?
[1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:24.340]  Well, I agree with you. And also earlier, you had stated to stay on Trump with things that we disagree with.
[1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:32.340]  And I want all the info warriors out there do not let the Susan Rice scandal and everything go down because that's going to lead to Pitogate.
[1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:36.340]  That's going to break open tremendous doors.
[1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:41.340]  You know, I agree with you. Trump needs to be on the offense more. They try to say he was this Russian spy and he leaked.
[1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:46.340]  And then they're the ones that are on the payroll of foreign governments that leaked. Great points, Mark. Thank you for calling.
[1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:52.340]  I'm going to move quick today. I'm going to be a good boy and go to your calls quickly. Ben's up next. Then Ken, Beth, Levi and many others.
[1:04:52.340 --> 1:05:02.340]  I'm Alex Jones. The enemy hates us for a reason because we know how to take them down. Infowars.com.
[1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:09.340]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation,
[1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:16.340]  not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:20.340]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:25.340]  Are you ignorant of the private federal reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[1:05:25.340 --> 1:05:32.340]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:37.340]  What kind of leverage do these people and the federal reserve have over the American people?
[1:05:37.340 --> 1:05:41.340]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[1:05:41.340 --> 1:05:44.340]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[1:05:44.340 --> 1:05:49.340]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:55.340]  Join the Infowars. Spread the information. Educate yourself and others. The truth shall set you free.
[1:05:55.340 --> 1:06:20.340]  Infowars.com. I'm David Knight.
[1:06:25.340 --> 1:06:32.340]  This is why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:38.340]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:45.340]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:45.340 --> 1:06:53.340]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.

[1:07:56.340 --> 1:08:01.340]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:11.340]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
[1:08:11.340 --> 1:08:17.340]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[1:08:17.340 --> 1:08:22.340]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:27.340]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:32.340]  It's not about food, it's about keeping those ants in line.
[1:08:32.340 --> 1:08:44.340]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[1:08:44.340 --> 1:08:47.340]  Alright, I'm going right back to your calls.
[1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:54.340]  Ben and Erica and Ken and Beth and Levi, we're going to go to all of you here in just a few minutes.
[1:08:54.340 --> 1:09:04.340]  First off, CNN calls Trump a liar, a racist. CNN gives the questions to Hillary Clinton in all three debates
[1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:10.340]  and gets caught doing it. CNN got caught in the WikiLeaks trying to rig the polls,
[1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:14.340]  sometimes giving her 30-plus points ahead of what she really had.
[1:09:14.340 --> 1:09:20.340]  So CNN openly run by the Democratic Party and George Soros and other financial interests
[1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:29.340]  banned, over the weekend, this ad from running that Donald Trump's presidential campaign paid for.
[1:09:29.340 --> 1:09:33.340]  CNN said they didn't run it because of fake news graphic.
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:42.340]  So they're allowed to call everybody fake. Trump fake, Alex Jones fake, InfoWars fake, everything's fake.
[1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:51.340]  And then when the President talks about fake news, they're not going to carry an ad even though he pays for it.
[1:09:51.340 --> 1:09:57.340]  Why would Trump even want them to run his ad? They have almost no viewers.
[1:09:57.340 --> 1:10:03.340]  But here's the bottom line. This ad is about buoying national sovereignty.
[1:10:03.340 --> 1:10:06.340]  It's about believing in America. It's about confidence.
[1:10:06.340 --> 1:10:12.340]  We have the industry. We have the infrastructure. We have the know-how. We have the people.
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:19.340]  We can rebuild America. We can make it better, faster, stronger.
[1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:23.340]  Yes, that's a ripoff of the 1970s bionic man.
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:33.340]  We can rebuild her, bigger, faster, stronger, America, barely alive.
[1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:39.340]  We can rebuild her. We're going to do it, but we have to be realistic.
[1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:46.340]  We have to be pragmatic and we have to move against the enemy and realize we have the light in the dark of the night.
[1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:52.340]  Then I'm going to your phone calls and Bill Nye, whose show is called Bill Nye Saves the World.
[1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:55.340]  I'm going to talk about that in a moment because here's the deal.
[1:10:55.340 --> 1:11:02.340]  I'm shooting a video and already shot part of it yesterday to debunk the new movie coming out with Al Gore.
[1:11:02.340 --> 1:11:05.340]  His Inconvenient Truth Part 2.
[1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:11.340]  And I was going to call it Al Gore Saves the World. That was the name of the special report.
[1:11:11.340 --> 1:11:15.340]  I didn't know Bill Nye had a failed show on what Netflix.
[1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:20.340]  I didn't know Bill Nye had three stars out of ten. I didn't know that he even said that,
[1:11:20.340 --> 1:11:23.340]  but they've scripted it where they're saviors of the earth.
[1:11:23.340 --> 1:11:28.340]  You let them have full control of your life and they'll save you.
[1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:34.340]  But I told dude, the name's going to be Al Gore Saves the World.
[1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:37.340]  I had no idea that was the name of Bill Nye's, but that's...
[1:11:37.340 --> 1:11:40.340]  I mean, I saw the ad when I went and saw The Promise.
[1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:44.340]  Excellent movie, historical movie about the Armenian Genocide Friday night.
[1:11:44.340 --> 1:11:48.340]  I went and saw it with my wife and son.
[1:11:48.340 --> 1:11:54.340]  And I'm sitting there watching it.
[1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:58.340]  It was an amazing film. And then I thought about the ad for Inconvenient Lie.
[1:11:58.340 --> 1:12:03.340]  I mean, Inconvenient Fraud, Inconvenient Eugenics Extermination Operation.
[1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:06.340]  I'm sorry. An inconvenient way to get you to try to kill yourself.
[1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:09.340]  Basically, Al Gore can have all the resources for his pig like self.
[1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:12.340]  I'm sorry. I said I'd get to the breakdown of that when we go to the next caller.
[1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:14.340]  Ben in Florida.
[1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:23.340]  First, let's get to the banned ad that you're not supposed to see talking about the first hundred days of Donald John Trump.
[1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:32.340]  And here it is. The first hundred days of Donald John Trump.
[1:12:32.340 --> 1:12:38.340]  Of Donald Trump, sworn in as president 100 days ago, America has rarely seen such success.
[1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:41.340]  A respected Supreme Court justice confirmed.
[1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:44.340]  Companies investing in American jobs again.
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:47.340]  America becoming more energy independent.
[1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:50.340]  Regulations that kill American jobs eliminated.
[1:12:50.340 --> 1:12:54.340]  The biggest tax cut plan in history. You wouldn't know it from watching the news.
[1:12:54.340 --> 1:12:59.340]  America is winning and President Trump is making America great again.
[1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:02.340]  I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
[1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:06.340]  Now let's go through that ad one more time and I'm going to stop and start it.
[1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:08.340]  It's only 30 seconds long.
[1:13:08.340 --> 1:13:10.340]  Totally true. Totally accurate.
[1:13:10.340 --> 1:13:15.340]  And he shows mainstream news that's all attacked the president over and over again
[1:13:15.340 --> 1:13:20.340]  and who are rooting for the country to fail and are in major financial publications admitting
[1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:25.340]  that they're globally trying to kill our stock market show that the Trump Revolution stops
[1:13:25.340 --> 1:13:29.340]  because they can't deal with the American system of prosperity and free market.
[1:13:29.340 --> 1:13:31.340]  Nobody can compete with it so they want to kill it.
[1:13:31.340 --> 1:13:33.340]  So let's go through the ad one more time.
[1:13:33.340 --> 1:13:37.340]  Donald Trump sworn in as president 100 days ago.
[1:13:37.340 --> 1:13:39.340]  Back it up.
[1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:41.340]  Sworn in 100 days ago.
[1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:44.340]  Back it up five seconds. Absolutely true.
[1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:46.340]  That's documented.
[1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:48.340]  Sworn in 100 days ago. Where are we now?
[1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:50.340]  Three plus trillion in the stock market.
[1:13:50.340 --> 1:13:52.340]  300 plus billion and that's an old number.
[1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.340]  New jobs coming in.
[1:13:54.340 --> 1:13:56.340]  Absolute.
[1:13:56.340 --> 1:13:58.340]  Better than we've seen in a decade.
[1:13:58.340 --> 1:14:00.340]  Numbers at restaurants.
[1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:04.340]  Retail is still doing bad but that's because people are moving towards almost only shopping online.
[1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:06.340]  Delivery business is way up.
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:10.340]  So that's kind of like horses getting replaced with cars.
[1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:12.340]  That's why the retail is falling apart.
[1:14:12.340 --> 1:14:14.340]  Let's continue.
[1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:17.340]  Donald Trump sworn in as president 100 days ago.
[1:14:17.340 --> 1:14:20.340]  America has rarely seen such success.
[1:14:20.340 --> 1:14:22.340]  A respected Supreme...
[1:14:22.340 --> 1:14:24.340]  Never seen such success.
[1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:26.340]  Shows him signing all these orders.
[1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:28.340]  Turning our jobs back on.
[1:14:28.340 --> 1:14:30.340]  Killing one sided trade deals.
[1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.340]  Getting us out of TPP.
[1:14:32.340 --> 1:14:34.340]  Getting Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court.
[1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:36.340]  Let's continue.
[1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:38.340]  Court justice confirmed. Companies investing in American jobs again.
[1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:40.340]  Back it up ten seconds.
[1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.340]  500,000 plus jobs created.
[1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:44.340]  It's way, way more than that.
[1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:46.340]  Because you've got 300 trillion.
[1:14:46.340 --> 1:14:50.340]  300 billion already in new investment announced.
[1:14:50.340 --> 1:14:52.340]  By Softbank and the list goes on and on.
[1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:54.340]  By Fiat. By Chrysler.
[1:14:54.340 --> 1:14:56.340]  By Ford. By Hasbro.
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:14:58.340]  By Mattel.
[1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.340]  By all these other...
[1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:02.340]  Misabishi.
[1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:04.340]  Samsung.
[1:15:04.340 --> 1:15:06.340]  I mean I can't even list them all.
[1:15:06.340 --> 1:15:08.340]  It's incredible. The power plants turned back on.
[1:15:08.340 --> 1:15:10.340]  Let's continue. Go.
[1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:13.340]  America has rarely seen such success.
[1:15:13.340 --> 1:15:16.340]  A respected Supreme Court justice confirmed.
[1:15:16.340 --> 1:15:19.340]  Companies investing in American jobs again.
[1:15:19.340 --> 1:15:22.340]  America becoming more energy independent.
[1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:24.340]  He's done pipeline in.
[1:15:24.340 --> 1:15:26.340]  They don't even have time to mention the coal.
[1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:28.340]  Worth trillions to us just in the next decade.
[1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:30.340]  Absolutely clean.
[1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:32.340]  Cheaper energy on and on and on.
[1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:34.340]  Giving all those miners their jobs back.
[1:15:34.340 --> 1:15:36.340]  Let's continue.
[1:15:36.340 --> 1:15:38.340]  America eliminated.
[1:15:38.340 --> 1:15:40.340]  10 seconds. This is so much truth.
[1:15:40.340 --> 1:15:42.340]  A slash. Just trillions in regulations that were only designed
[1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.340]  to ship our jobs overseas
[1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:46.340]  written by the globalist for a 10 to 21
[1:15:46.340 --> 1:15:48.340]  to pick the winners and losers.
[1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:50.340]  Continue. Justice confirmed.
[1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:52.340]  Companies investing in American jobs again.
[1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:54.340]  America becoming more energy independent.
[1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:56.340]  Regulations that kill American jobs
[1:15:56.340 --> 1:15:58.340]  eliminated.
[1:15:58.340 --> 1:16:00.340]  The biggest tax cut plan in history.
[1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:02.340]  It is one of the biggest tax cuts
[1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:04.340]  in modern history.
[1:16:04.340 --> 1:16:06.340]  I guess because technically the numbers
[1:16:06.340 --> 1:16:08.340]  are bigger than ever because of inflation
[1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:10.340]  but it's not as big as the Kennedy tax cut
[1:16:10.340 --> 1:16:12.340]  that was 50% for the main tax brackets
[1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:14.340]  30% for the rich. It's not the biggest
[1:16:14.340 --> 1:16:16.340]  in history. But it is the biggest
[1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:18.340]  I guess number wise technically
[1:16:18.340 --> 1:16:20.340]  but not in the real
[1:16:20.340 --> 1:16:22.340]  numbers adjusted
[1:16:22.340 --> 1:16:24.340]  for inflation. Let's continue.
[1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:26.340]  Know it from watching the news.
[1:16:26.340 --> 1:16:28.340]  America is winning and President Trump
[1:16:28.340 --> 1:16:30.340]  is making America great again.
[1:16:30.340 --> 1:16:32.340]  I'm Donald Trump and I approve this
[1:16:32.340 --> 1:16:34.340]  message. But they didn't
[1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:36.340]  like the little bit of criticism
[1:16:36.340 --> 1:16:38.340]  of CBS, ABC, CNN
[1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:40.340]  saying fake news. No, you're not
[1:16:40.340 --> 1:16:42.340]  going to say that. They bring out the term.
[1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:44.340]  Hillary creates it. They brand
[1:16:44.340 --> 1:16:46.340]  Alex Jones with it. The dark heart
[1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:48.340]  they swear to get into office and shut us down
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:50.340]  in 2017.
[1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:52.340]  They fail and they're still there
[1:16:52.340 --> 1:16:54.340]  though at the State Department with the new office
[1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:56.340]  trying to shut us down.
[1:16:56.340 --> 1:16:58.340]  Now, Ben
[1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:00.340]  let's shift gears. Ben in
[1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:02.340]  Florida
[1:17:02.340 --> 1:17:04.340]  wants to talk about the Netflix
[1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:06.340]  show Bill Nye and the show is called
[1:17:06.340 --> 1:17:08.340]  Bill Nye Saves the World.
[1:17:08.340 --> 1:17:10.340]  Now that's what all this
[1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:12.340]  environmentalism is about. How Al Gore
[1:17:12.340 --> 1:17:14.340]  saves the world. Lord Rothschild saves
[1:17:14.340 --> 1:17:16.340]  the world. Bill Nye saves the world.
[1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.340]  So you're not allowed to question them.
[1:17:18.340 --> 1:17:20.340]  You're not allowed to say they're wrong. You're not allowed to say the
[1:17:20.340 --> 1:17:22.340]  sun drives climate. When they said it was
[1:17:22.340 --> 1:17:24.340]  going to be global freezing in the 70s and 80s
[1:17:24.340 --> 1:17:26.340]  and it was global warming in the 90s and 2000s
[1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:28.340]  and now the earth is starting to cool off
[1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:30.340]  again because of the sun.
[1:17:30.340 --> 1:17:32.340]  Different cycles. So now
[1:17:32.340 --> 1:17:34.340]  they want to arrest you. 15 state
[1:17:34.340 --> 1:17:36.340]  attorney generals led by Cuomo,
[1:17:36.340 --> 1:17:38.340]  that governor, want you arrested
[1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:40.340]  if you question. And Bill Nye
[1:17:40.340 --> 1:17:42.340]  has come out and said he wants to
[1:17:42.340 --> 1:17:44.340]  look at having people arrested because we're involved
[1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:46.340]  in fraud. We have to pay carbon
[1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:48.340]  taxes to Al Gore's carbon trading
[1:17:48.340 --> 1:17:50.340]  company. We've got to pay it to George
[1:17:50.340 --> 1:17:52.340]  Soros's carbon trading company. We've got to
[1:17:52.340 --> 1:17:54.340]  let them pick which jobs and businesses can
[1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:56.340]  operate or we're killing
[1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:58.340]  it.
[1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:00.340]  So I'm going to go to this call and when I come back
[1:18:00.340 --> 1:18:02.340]  I'm going to play a few clips from his failing
[1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:04.340]  show and where he said arrest people
[1:18:04.340 --> 1:18:06.340]  that don't agree with him. So he's an authoritarian
[1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:08.340]  know-it-all arrogant
[1:18:08.340 --> 1:18:10.340]  pseudo-intellectual
[1:18:10.340 --> 1:18:12.340]  twit
[1:18:12.340 --> 1:18:14.340]  with a non-threatening bowtie.
[1:18:14.340 --> 1:18:16.340]  Now people that drive Creeper
[1:18:16.340 --> 1:18:18.340]  vans wear those folks. He is a Creeper.
[1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:20.340]  And I was going to have somebody in casting
[1:18:20.340 --> 1:18:22.340]  for the last season of
[1:18:22.340 --> 1:18:24.340]  True Detective, which is an excellent
[1:18:24.340 --> 1:18:26.340]  series. Takes a lot to make me watch TV
[1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:28.340]  and it was excellent.
[1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:30.340]  Then I'd cast him as the bad guy, wouldn't you?
[1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:32.340]  Just a little opinion, side piece.
[1:18:32.340 --> 1:18:34.340]  Total Creep. Let's go ahead
[1:18:34.340 --> 1:18:36.340]  and go to Ben in Florida.
[1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:38.340]  Ben, what do you think of Bill Nye? You say
[1:18:38.340 --> 1:18:40.340]  you've been watching the show.
[1:18:40.340 --> 1:18:42.340]  Yes, sir.
[1:18:42.340 --> 1:18:44.340]  I want to say that Bill Nye, obviously
[1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:46.340]  this is a guy with a God complex,
[1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:48.340]  okay? He calls himself the science guy
[1:18:48.340 --> 1:18:50.340]  but in reality he's the globalist guy.
[1:18:50.340 --> 1:18:52.340]  He's the largest guy.
[1:18:52.340 --> 1:18:54.340]  In the 427 edition of this show,
[1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:56.340]  the Netflix show you had just referenced,
[1:18:56.340 --> 1:18:58.340]  he actually asked with a straight face
[1:18:58.340 --> 1:19:00.340]  ballot whether or not
[1:19:00.340 --> 1:19:02.340]  children in, quote,
[1:19:02.340 --> 1:19:04.340]  developed countries should be penalized
[1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:06.340]  for having, quote, too many
[1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:08.340]  children, okay? And I should say
[1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:10.340]  families rather. Families in developed
[1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:12.340]  countries should be penalized for having too many
[1:19:12.340 --> 1:19:14.340]  children. And his guest, a doctor
[1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:16.340]  responded by saying
[1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:18.340]  it's something we should consider.
[1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:20.340]  These people believe they're God.
[1:19:20.340 --> 1:19:22.340]  They want to control the world and not
[1:19:22.340 --> 1:19:24.340]  they want to control how many children you have
[1:19:24.340 --> 1:19:26.340]  based on discredited, fake, scientific
[1:19:26.340 --> 1:19:28.340]  facts and propaganda like climate
[1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.340]  change. It makes me sick to my stomach
[1:19:30.340 --> 1:19:32.340]  and it's to make every one of you listeners
[1:19:32.340 --> 1:19:34.340]  out there sick to your stomach as well.
[1:19:34.340 --> 1:19:36.340]  Well, let me tell you why I want to hire
[1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.340]  four or five more great investigative
[1:19:38.340 --> 1:19:40.340]  journalists and video editors so that
[1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:42.340]  they're investigative journalists that also
[1:19:42.340 --> 1:19:44.340]  have the skill to go in and put a piece
[1:19:44.340 --> 1:19:46.340]  together so we can monitor movies, TV
[1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:48.340]  shows, so-called news shows
[1:19:48.340 --> 1:19:50.340]  and analysis to show the lies.
[1:19:50.340 --> 1:19:52.340]  I knew he'd call for arresting people
[1:19:52.340 --> 1:19:54.340]  he disagrees with. Here it is, Bill Nye.
[1:19:54.340 --> 1:19:56.340]  The science guy has opened criminal charges
[1:19:56.340 --> 1:19:58.340]  in jail time for climate change to centers.
[1:19:58.340 --> 1:20:00.340]  No, we believe climate change. In fact,
[1:20:00.340 --> 1:20:02.340]  it's always changing. You said global freezing
[1:20:02.340 --> 1:20:04.340]  and global warming.
[1:20:04.340 --> 1:20:06.340]  So that's what he wants to do.
[1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:08.340]  And I haven't seen the show
[1:20:08.340 --> 1:20:10.340]  but I need to have the crew that can go
[1:20:10.340 --> 1:20:12.340]  into Netflix and watch the 427
[1:20:12.340 --> 1:20:14.340]  show, I guess that aired last week
[1:20:14.340 --> 1:20:16.340]  where he calls for population control.
[1:20:16.340 --> 1:20:18.340]  I know he's called for that in his writings
[1:20:18.340 --> 1:20:20.340]  but again, Bill Gates,
[1:20:20.340 --> 1:20:22.340]  people like Warren Buffett,
[1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:24.340]  people like Ted Turner
[1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:26.340]  who has five kids, they're all going to have
[1:20:26.340 --> 1:20:28.340]  kids. The Communist Chinese
[1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:30.340]  elite, they have four or five kids.
[1:20:30.340 --> 1:20:32.340]  It's just the general public that can only
[1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:34.340]  have one child. And this is total
[1:20:34.340 --> 1:20:36.340]  and complete elitism. And remember
[1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.340]  how long I warned people
[1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:40.340]  20 years ago about the one child policy
[1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:42.340]  coming here and now you see it
[1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:44.340]  being promoted everywhere. They want taxes
[1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:46.340]  on people that have more than one child.
[1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:48.340]  I've been confronted many times
[1:20:48.340 --> 1:20:50.340]  for my three children, now four children
[1:20:50.340 --> 1:20:52.340]  when I'm at Whole Foods.
[1:20:52.340 --> 1:20:54.340]  Why do you have so many kids? These are
[1:20:54.340 --> 1:20:56.340]  uptight, upset, angry people
[1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:58.340]  that don't have children and who've
[1:20:58.340 --> 1:21:00.340]  been taught to hate people that do.
[1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:02.340]  They're monitored and controlled and socially
[1:21:02.340 --> 1:21:04.340]  engineered by Facebook to keep them desperate,
[1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:06.340]  to keep them alone and to keep them hateful.
[1:21:06.340 --> 1:21:08.340]  And so that's all they've got is
[1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.340]  hate for those of us that have a life force.
[1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:12.340]  And as I've said, Al Gore
[1:21:12.340 --> 1:21:14.340]  scripts himself as the savior of the
[1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:16.340]  world. I didn't know Bill Nye, and I guess
[1:21:16.340 --> 1:21:18.340]  the crew's seen it, has a show
[1:21:18.340 --> 1:21:20.340]  called Saviour of the World. How sickening.
[1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:24.340]  Absolutely. And you said it earlier.
[1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.340]  He cloaks himself with this
[1:21:26.340 --> 1:21:28.340]  non-threatening sort of
[1:21:28.340 --> 1:21:30.340]  personality.
[1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:32.340]  Oh, Bill Nye.
[1:21:32.340 --> 1:21:34.340]  Let me just flip your throat.
[1:21:36.340 --> 1:21:38.340]  Candy, getting the creeper van.
[1:21:38.340 --> 1:21:40.340]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:21:40.340 --> 1:21:42.340]  And then he sits there.
[1:21:42.340 --> 1:21:44.340]  What do you think about, maybe we should
[1:21:44.340 --> 1:21:46.340]  control how many people children have in the
[1:21:46.340 --> 1:21:48.340]  developed world. You don't get to tell us
[1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:50.340]  how many kids we can have. You piece of trash.
[1:21:50.340 --> 1:21:52.340]  Let me have one child
[1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:54.340]  policy.
[1:21:54.340 --> 1:21:56.340]  We'll drop by like China
[1:21:56.340 --> 1:21:58.340]  and kill your newborn baby in a bucket of water
[1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:00.340]  or maybe melt it down and sell it
[1:22:00.340 --> 1:22:02.340]  fat for women for college
[1:22:02.340 --> 1:22:04.340]  and injections.
[1:22:04.340 --> 1:22:06.340]  But see, it's okay if Apple
[1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:08.340]  has mobile execution centers
[1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.340]  or supports China's mobile
[1:22:10.340 --> 1:22:12.340]  execution centers, never criticizes that
[1:22:12.340 --> 1:22:14.340]  and has suicide nets around the
[1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:16.340]  Foxcom factories
[1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:18.340]  and drugging and forced abortion
[1:22:18.340 --> 1:22:20.340]  because it's liberal, because the Apple
[1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:22.340]  board has Al Gore on it
[1:22:22.340 --> 1:22:24.340]  or at least it at the time, and then it's
[1:22:24.340 --> 1:22:26.340]  trendy because Al Gore
[1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:28.340]  talks in this real
[1:22:28.340 --> 1:22:30.340]  slow kind of
[1:22:30.340 --> 1:22:32.340]  southern MPR voice
[1:22:32.340 --> 1:22:34.340]  so why don't you just give in.
[1:22:34.340 --> 1:22:36.340]  Oh, and I love Al
[1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:38.340]  Gore on the new trailer for his new
[1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:40.340]  fiction movie, an inconvenient BS part
[1:22:40.340 --> 1:22:42.340]  2 says,
[1:22:42.340 --> 1:22:44.340]  humanity will survive.
[1:22:44.340 --> 1:22:46.340]  We will come together. The whole
[1:22:46.340 --> 1:22:48.340]  fake environmental movements about anti-human
[1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:50.340]  eugenics and population reduction
[1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:52.340]  and ignoring genetic engineering
[1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:54.340]  chimeras, toxic waste dumping,
[1:22:54.340 --> 1:22:56.340]  geoengineering, all the things
[1:22:56.340 --> 1:22:58.340]  that are killing our earth. So it ignores
[1:22:58.340 --> 1:23:00.340]  all the real stuff and focuses on the garbage.
[1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:02.340]  Ben?
[1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:04.340]  It's a fundamental
[1:23:04.340 --> 1:23:06.340]  hatred for human life and what
[1:23:06.340 --> 1:23:08.340]  they do is they use this fake
[1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:10.340]  environmental movement as an
[1:23:10.340 --> 1:23:12.340]  excuse, as a pretext
[1:23:12.340 --> 1:23:14.340]  to push population control, to push
[1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:16.340]  this idea that, hey, we got to control how many
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:18.340]  children we have, as if we live in a communist
[1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:20.340]  nation. But he's wearing
[1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:22.340]  a bow tie. It's okay. God bless
[1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:24.340]  you, Ben. Thanks for monitoring this. Sure enough
[1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:26.340]  it's confirmed Christian news.
[1:23:26.340 --> 1:23:28.340]  Bill Nivell, Science Guy.
[1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:30.340]  Let me talk about him. Bill Guy,
[1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:32.340]  hi. I'm
[1:23:32.340 --> 1:23:34.340]  real tall, the bow tie.
[1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:36.340]  Don't matter. I look kind of creepy.
[1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:38.340]  I like to meet with David Rockefeller.
[1:23:38.340 --> 1:23:40.340]  Bill Nivell, the Science Guy.
[1:23:40.340 --> 1:23:42.340]  Science is real and it says
[1:23:42.340 --> 1:23:44.340]  you die. Carbon credits,
[1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:46.340]  calorie rationing.
[1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:48.340]  We decide where you live and when you
[1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:50.340]  do. It's liberal.
[1:23:50.340 --> 1:23:52.340]  We're the saviors. Bill Nivell, the Science Guy,
[1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:54.340]  suggests parents
[1:23:54.340 --> 1:23:56.340]  should be penalized for having extra
[1:23:56.340 --> 1:23:58.340]  kids and the West
[1:23:58.340 --> 1:24:00.340]  is bad in his Netflix show
[1:24:00.340 --> 1:24:02.340]  called Bill Guy.
[1:24:02.340 --> 1:24:04.340]  Nivell saves the world.
[1:24:04.340 --> 1:24:06.340]  On April 21st,
[1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:08.340]  I guess you saw it on April 27th.
[1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:10.340]  Let's go ahead now and play
[1:24:10.340 --> 1:24:12.340]  Bill Nivell talking about, well,
[1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:14.340]  maybe we should lock people up.
[1:24:14.340 --> 1:24:16.340]  I mean, that's liberal.
[1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:18.340]  Here it is.
[1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:20.340]  We interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
[1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:22.340]  the environmentalist here at the People's
[1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:24.340]  Climate March in 2014,
[1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:26.340]  September. He said that
[1:24:26.340 --> 1:24:28.340]  the climate deniers his
[1:24:28.340 --> 1:24:30.340]  word and energy CEOs belong
[1:24:30.340 --> 1:24:32.340]  at the Hague with three square meals and a
[1:24:32.340 --> 1:24:34.340]  cot with all the other war criminals.
[1:24:34.340 --> 1:24:36.340]  What is your thought on that? Do you think
[1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:38.340]  some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm
[1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:40.340]  sure both sides, but some of the rhetoric on
[1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:42.340]  your side gets too carried away? I mean,
[1:24:42.340 --> 1:24:44.340]  what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war
[1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:46.340]  criminals? We'll see what happens.
[1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:48.340]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from
[1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:50.340]  Enron?
[1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:52.340]  Interesting. Okay, right, so we'll see
[1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:54.340]  what happens. Was it appropriate
[1:24:54.340 --> 1:24:56.340]  to jail people from the cigarette
[1:24:56.340 --> 1:24:58.340]  group who insisted that this
[1:24:58.340 --> 1:25:00.340]  addictive product was not addictive
[1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:02.340]  and so on? And you think about
[1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:04.340]  in these cases, for me
[1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:06.340]  as a taxpayer and voter,
[1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.340]  the doubting, the
[1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:10.340]  introduction of this extreme doubt,
[1:25:10.340 --> 1:25:12.340]  will you go with extreme doubt, the climate
[1:25:12.340 --> 1:25:14.340]  change is affecting my quality
[1:25:14.340 --> 1:25:16.340]  of life as a public citizen.
[1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:18.340]  So I can see where
[1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:20.340]  people are very concerned about this and are
[1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:22.340]  pursuing criminal investigations
[1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:24.340]  as well as
[1:25:24.340 --> 1:25:26.340]  as well as engaging
[1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:28.340]  in discussions like this.
[1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:30.340]  Very, very arrogant,
[1:25:30.340 --> 1:25:32.340]  meant to sound reasonable,
[1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:34.340]  pausing, talking real
[1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:36.340]  slowly. Let me do a Bill Nye act
[1:25:36.340 --> 1:25:38.340]  for you real quick. Bill Nye
[1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:40.340]  thinks you're a booby.
[1:25:40.340 --> 1:25:42.340]  Do you know
[1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:44.340]  where the idea for the
[1:25:44.340 --> 1:25:46.340]  carbon credit trading plan came
[1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:48.340]  from? The same
[1:25:48.340 --> 1:25:50.340]  place Bill Nye
[1:25:50.340 --> 1:25:52.340]  just used as an example
[1:25:52.340 --> 1:25:54.340]  of why they should be able to criminally
[1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:56.340]  indict people that don't believe in
[1:25:56.340 --> 1:25:58.340]  man-made global warming
[1:25:58.340 --> 1:26:00.340]  or anthropogenic warming.
[1:26:00.340 --> 1:26:02.340]  Okay?
[1:26:02.340 --> 1:26:04.340]  Let me just act real smart. Okay,
[1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:06.340]  I've got a big bow tie, okay? You've got to
[1:26:06.340 --> 1:26:08.340]  be really smart to wear one of these, alright?
[1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:10.340]  Now listen, I'm Bill Nye, okay?
[1:26:10.340 --> 1:26:12.340]  Did you know,
[1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:14.340]  Bill Nye, that Enron
[1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:16.340]  and Kinley that you just used as an example
[1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:18.340]  are the ones that came up in 1987
[1:26:18.340 --> 1:26:20.340]  with the carbon
[1:26:20.340 --> 1:26:22.340]  credit trading plan that they met with Al Gore
[1:26:22.340 --> 1:26:24.340]  then senator about
[1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:26.340]  before he was vice president? Did you know
[1:26:26.340 --> 1:26:28.340]  the whole plan got launched by Kinley
[1:26:28.340 --> 1:26:30.340]  who had fake trading desk
[1:26:30.340 --> 1:26:32.340]  and fake computer programs
[1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:34.340]  and they would charge Californians up to $2 billion
[1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:36.340]  extra a day for electricity
[1:26:36.340 --> 1:26:38.340]  and would have fake rolling blackouts
[1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:40.340]  to create the view of artificial scarcity.
[1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:42.340]  Did you know that you could search that
[1:26:42.340 --> 1:26:44.340]  and find that congressional hearings, Bill Nye?
[1:26:44.340 --> 1:26:46.340]  Or did you probably know that, don't you?
[1:26:46.340 --> 1:26:48.340]  That's right, you're so smart.
[1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:50.340]  You're so cool, Bill Nye.
[1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:52.340]  And so, thank God you're here.
[1:26:52.340 --> 1:26:54.340]  Oh, and the cigarette companies
[1:26:54.340 --> 1:26:56.340]  like the Liberals and Ever Bernays
[1:26:56.340 --> 1:26:58.340]  getting liberal women
[1:26:58.340 --> 1:27:00.340]  to smoke cigarettes
[1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:02.340]  so millions and millions died.
[1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:04.340]  Millions others were maimed
[1:27:04.340 --> 1:27:06.340]  making it trendy to smoke cigarettes, kind of the whole
[1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:08.340]  same PR campaign, which we're not involved in.
[1:27:08.340 --> 1:27:10.340]  Totally separate deals. Just
[1:27:10.340 --> 1:27:12.340]  scientists and citizens and
[1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:14.340]  astrophysicists and others saying
[1:27:14.340 --> 1:27:16.340]  the sun's the main driver of climate on Earth.
[1:27:16.340 --> 1:27:18.340]  The only other heat source
[1:27:18.340 --> 1:27:20.340]  is tectonic magma flows
[1:27:20.340 --> 1:27:22.340]  and limited amounts of volcanic gassing
[1:27:22.340 --> 1:27:24.340]  into the atmosphere and
[1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:26.340]  fissures in the crust
[1:27:26.340 --> 1:27:28.340]  in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans
[1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:30.340]  that do add some heat to the planet.
[1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:32.340]  But it's less than $1 billion
[1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:34.340]  if you look up the statistics
[1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:36.340]  of the actual heat of the Earth
[1:27:36.340 --> 1:27:38.340]  that's translated to the surface. It's the sun, Bill.
[1:27:38.340 --> 1:27:40.340]  The sun. Science is real, Bill.
[1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:42.340]  Bill.
[1:27:42.340 --> 1:27:44.340]  Bill.
[1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:46.340]  Listen to me, Bill. Listen to me.
[1:27:46.340 --> 1:27:48.340]  You know it's a eugenics program
[1:27:48.340 --> 1:27:50.340]  to tax the carbon cycle.
[1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:52.340]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and air. Oxygen.
[1:27:52.340 --> 1:27:54.340]  Everyone knows oxygen, water
[1:27:54.340 --> 1:27:56.340]  and sunlight are good.
[1:27:56.340 --> 1:27:58.340]  But carbon dioxide sounds like monoxide.
[1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:00.340]  We can get most people
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:02.340]  90% even at UT. We've done this.
[1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:04.340]  So have Penn and Teller.
[1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:06.340]  So has Mark Dice. To sign.
[1:28:06.340 --> 1:28:08.340]  Let me get back in character. To sign
[1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:10.340]  petitions to band by hydrogen monoxide.
[1:28:10.340 --> 1:28:12.340]  And the hydrogen monoxide,
[1:28:12.340 --> 1:28:14.340]  Bill Nye
[1:28:14.340 --> 1:28:16.340]  is the name for water.
[1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:18.340]  H2O.
[1:28:18.340 --> 1:28:20.340]  Did you know that, Bill Nye?
[1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:22.340]  Without sunlight and water and carbon
[1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:24.340]  dioxide and water, we're all dead, sweetheart.
[1:28:26.340 --> 1:28:28.340]  And I know you want to tax water, too.
[1:28:28.340 --> 1:28:30.340]  You want to tax everything. You want to be God.
[1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:32.340]  And you want to be able to monitor and
[1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:34.340]  track all use and have us on
[1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:36.340]  carbon credits and ration
[1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:38.340]  calories. So all the poor people
[1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:40.340]  who've been taught to be poor
[1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:42.340]  and be taught to hate wealth and think it's cool
[1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:44.340]  that everybody else is poor because misery
[1:28:44.340 --> 1:28:46.340]  loves company. But then the elites
[1:28:46.340 --> 1:28:48.340]  get off their jumbo jets
[1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:50.340]  with 10 planes backing them up
[1:28:50.340 --> 1:28:52.340]  and over 500 men in the detail
[1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:54.340]  in South Africa and Durban
[1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:56.340]  and Obama can say
[1:28:56.340 --> 1:28:58.340]  two years ago, huh
[1:28:58.340 --> 1:29:00.340]  if you have air conditioners or cars, they can't do
[1:29:00.340 --> 1:29:02.340]  a good Obama imitation. You know
[1:29:02.340 --> 1:29:04.340]  if you got air conditioners
[1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:06.340]  in cars, the earth's going to heat up
[1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:10.340]  all over. I'm sorry, you can't have it.
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:12.340]  Oh, that's Bill Nye
[1:29:12.340 --> 1:29:14.340]  destroyed. Bill Nye
[1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:16.340]  is the destroyer of humanity.
[1:29:16.340 --> 1:29:18.340]  Bill Nye is not the savior
[1:29:18.340 --> 1:29:20.340]  of the world. Bill,
[1:29:20.340 --> 1:29:22.340]  he signed on to the globalists that said the future
[1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:24.340]  didn't need us. Their white papers are all public.
[1:29:26.340 --> 1:29:28.340]  That they all meet Silicon Valley 20 years ago
[1:29:28.340 --> 1:29:30.340]  and decided to launch a world government program
[1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:32.340]  that was already in pace.
[1:29:32.340 --> 1:29:34.340]  Everybody drugged up, dumbed down and slowly poisoned
[1:29:34.340 --> 1:29:36.340]  and in fact, we're pretty much unconscious
[1:29:36.340 --> 1:29:38.340]  when you finally kill us.
[1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:40.340]  Then you plan to recycle our bodies as fertilizer
[1:29:40.340 --> 1:29:42.340]  for yourselves and grow your crops.
[1:29:42.340 --> 1:29:44.340]  Those are white papers. Bill, I know all about
[1:29:44.340 --> 1:29:46.340]  UNECO science, boy.
[1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:48.340]  Bill Nye is an enemy of humanity
[1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:50.340]  if there ever was one. We'll be back.
[1:29:50.340 --> 1:29:52.340]  We're on the march. The empire's
[1:29:52.340 --> 1:29:54.340]  on the run.
[1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:56.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[1:29:56.340 --> 1:30:06.340]  Radio Network.
[1:30:26.340 --> 1:30:28.340]  Today, everything the government does
[1:30:28.340 --> 1:30:30.340]  at every level is concealed from us.
[1:30:30.340 --> 1:30:32.340]  We have trade deals to manage our economy
[1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:34.340]  that not even our elected representatives
[1:30:34.340 --> 1:30:36.340]  are allowed to see. Later in life,
[1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:38.340]  Patrick Henry looked back and said,
[1:30:38.340 --> 1:30:40.340]  when the American spirit was in its youth,
[1:30:40.340 --> 1:30:42.340]  the language of America was different.
[1:30:42.340 --> 1:30:44.340]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[1:30:44.340 --> 1:30:46.340]  Today, our primary concern
[1:30:46.340 --> 1:30:48.340]  is safety and comfort.
[1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:50.340]  Today, our primary concern
[1:30:50.340 --> 1:30:52.340]  is safety and comfort.
[1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:54.340]  Today, our primary concern
[1:30:54.340 --> 1:30:56.340]  is safety and comfort
[1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:58.340]  when we should be demanding liberty.
[1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:26.340]  Renfowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:30.340]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.

[1:31:34.340 --> 1:31:36.340]  to friends and family and neighbors in your community

[1:31:38.340 --> 1:31:40.340]  people at the same time.
[1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:41.340]  Another win-win.

[1:33:01.340 --> 1:33:05.340]  Music
[1:33:05.340 --> 1:33:09.340]  Hi, I'm Bill Nye. Why don't you kill yourself? I'm a good guy.
[1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:13.340]  I'm more in a better time.
[1:33:13.340 --> 1:33:17.340]  Let's let those rest.
[1:33:17.340 --> 1:33:21.340]  The elite need more living space. Catch you subhumans just kill yourselves.
[1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:25.340]  We're the liberals. More abortion.
[1:33:25.340 --> 1:33:29.340]  More genetic engineering. No carbon dioxide that plants
[1:33:29.340 --> 1:33:33.340]  breathe and produce oxygen. Even though the Earth is one of the lowest levels of carbon
[1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:37.340]  dioxide in its whole history. No, not the carbon dioxide. We need to be like
[1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:41.340]  Mars and lose our atmosphere. Please, Bill Nye,
[1:33:41.340 --> 1:33:45.340]  save us.
[1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:49.340]  Music
[1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:53.340]  Passion please. Crumbling away.
[1:33:53.340 --> 1:33:57.340]  You'll get what you want, Alex.
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:01.340]  You'll get what you want. Stephen Hawking said we have to leave Planet Earth today, Steve.
[1:34:01.340 --> 1:34:05.340]  Oh, but Val Gorsuch is in his new movie, An Inconvenient Load of BS Part 2.
[1:34:05.340 --> 1:34:09.340]  We ain't getting on no rocket chip to Mars.
[1:34:09.340 --> 1:34:13.340]  We're not going to get on airplanes either. We're not going to have calculators. We're not going to have
[1:34:13.340 --> 1:34:17.340]  genetic engineering. We're not going to, oh no, to space is like, we're at the
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:21.340]  top of the mountain and we have like 100 yards. You're already gone 18,000 feet.
[1:34:21.340 --> 1:34:25.340]  We've got 100 yards to life extension. 100 yards to giant
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:29.340]  space colonies with gravity. 100 yards to get past the globalist.
[1:34:29.340 --> 1:34:33.340]  That's the little problem. There's a 14-foot vampire standing right in
[1:34:33.340 --> 1:34:37.340]  the archway. Trying to block our way to the next level.
[1:34:37.340 --> 1:34:41.340]  We got to roll up our sleeves and say it's clobbering time.
[1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:45.340]  Because we may think we're not big and strong, but that vampire, we look like Ben Grimm
[1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:49.340]  from the Fantastic Four to that vampire. And it's time to
[1:34:49.340 --> 1:34:53.340]  get him upside the head, isn't it, Owen? Well, and Trump is talking about the best way for us to do it
[1:34:53.340 --> 1:34:57.340]  now, at least I think. I don't know what your thoughts on this, Alex, are, but 2018
[1:34:57.340 --> 1:35:01.340]  electing the right people to your local government, to Congress,
[1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:05.340]  getting out some of these swamp creatures, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer. Let's call it
[1:35:05.340 --> 1:35:09.340]  Operation Total Victory. Yeah. Because we need
[1:35:09.340 --> 1:35:13.340]  a complete freedom caucus. I mean, Paul Ryan. Okay, get
[1:35:13.340 --> 1:35:17.340]  them out. Vote them out. And here's my big problem. Bye-bye, blue eyes.
[1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:21.340]  Here's my problem, Alex. Where are the people right now challenging these people?
[1:35:21.340 --> 1:35:25.340]  There's only one person whose boots are on the ground, whose campaigning right now,
[1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:29.340]  who's going to destroy Maxine Waters for the first time in 35 years,
[1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:33.340]  this woman. This crazy dingbat who spends three hours a day on a
[1:35:33.340 --> 1:35:37.340]  frickin' wig doesn't even live in her own dick. Because you believe that Pelosi didn't know
[1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:41.340]  that it was President Trump again? No, I can perfectly believe that. These are mentally
[1:35:41.340 --> 1:35:45.340]  changed people. They ought to be drug tested. And I don't even care. Do as many drugs as
[1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:49.340]  you want. Just let the American people know if you're on Prozac all day long. Let the
[1:35:49.340 --> 1:35:53.340]  people know whatever is making Nancy Pelosi a, I mean, she's
[1:35:53.340 --> 1:35:57.340]  demented, Alex. This is just great. Your hate has made you powerful.
[1:35:57.340 --> 1:36:01.340]  Hey, tell us what you've got coming up. I want to go to these calls, then into
[1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:05.340]  North Korea, then into the stabbing, then into Antifa. We're going to have Millie Weaver
[1:36:05.340 --> 1:36:09.340]  in here at the bottom of the next hour, who was down in the middle of it. Rob Dew was as well. Total insanity
[1:36:09.340 --> 1:36:13.340]  with just their behavior. This guy, mentally ill guy, got kind of caught up in
[1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:17.340]  all this stereo, went out and stabbed some people. The answer is obviously band knives.
[1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:21.340]  So that's all coming up. Drugs is linked to our story. Air Force
[1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:25.340]  prepped second missile test off California as North Korea threatens to nuke us
[1:36:25.340 --> 1:36:29.340]  with subs reportedly off our coast. The Pentagon says it's a real threat.
[1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:33.340]  We're going to be talking about that all here in a moment after we take calls. But tell us
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:37.340]  the big stories you've got coming up. Here they are right here. Well, you know, you covered
[1:36:37.340 --> 1:36:41.340]  the CNN 100 day ad that we played a second ago.
[1:36:41.340 --> 1:36:45.340]  I don't know. None of that was false. The whole thing was true.
[1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:49.340]  Did you know, though, that CNN banned that? Yes.
[1:36:49.340 --> 1:36:53.340]  From being played. I couldn't believe when I read that story. So we know
[1:36:53.340 --> 1:36:57.340]  about the mainstream media censoring. We know about Google trying to censor us, YouTube trying to
[1:36:57.340 --> 1:37:01.340]  censor us. We know that all this is going on. That's one part of the censorship
[1:37:01.340 --> 1:37:05.340]  equation. That's not the full equation. There's another equation here, and this story tells
[1:37:05.340 --> 1:37:09.340]  it all. Baylor students protest Mexican themed
[1:37:09.340 --> 1:37:13.340]  frat fiesta demand mandatory diversity training.
[1:37:13.340 --> 1:37:17.340]  You've been talking about this, Alex. The globalists believe that the people will
[1:37:17.340 --> 1:37:21.340]  eventually embrace their slavery as in they'll like it. They'll want it.
[1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:25.340]  This is the mental slavery being embraced. The Baylor students.
[1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:29.340]  This isn't coming from the staff, which we see all the time. This isn't coming from
[1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:33.340]  the administration, which we see all the time. We've already seen that. We know about that.
[1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:37.340]  This is the students. This is self-censorship.
[1:37:37.340 --> 1:37:41.340]  By the way, by the way, I had a Hawaiian themed
[1:37:41.340 --> 1:37:45.340]  party. How dare you at my house because I love the food and love the
[1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:49.340]  tiki torches at night. And I'm actually going to have gas tiki torches put into my backyard
[1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:53.340]  because I like it. I like Hawaiian food.
[1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:57.340]  I love the Hawaiian culture. I have a St. Louis lapel pen on. Does that
[1:37:57.340 --> 1:38:01.340]  mean I hate everyone else that isn't from St. Louis? Is that what it means? That's probably what it means, right?
[1:38:01.340 --> 1:38:05.340]  It's over. I hate everybody unless you're from St. Louis. Well,
[1:38:05.340 --> 1:38:09.340]  Daria said it right. They're killing true multiculturalism. They don't want us having
[1:38:09.340 --> 1:38:13.340]  fun celebrating each other's cultures. I mean, it's like you go to the
[1:38:13.340 --> 1:38:17.340]  Broken Spoke, one of the oldest young dance halls here in Austin, where people like George
[1:38:17.340 --> 1:38:21.340]  Strait got discovered. You go into the people from China, Japan, they love country music.
[1:38:21.340 --> 1:38:25.340]  George Strait sells more in Japan. They almost does here. There's folks from Eastern Europe,
[1:38:25.340 --> 1:38:29.340]  people from Africa, and they're wearing cowboy hats and boots. People don't go, what the hell
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:33.340]  are you doing wearing our Texas garb? You want to put down Texas?
[1:38:33.340 --> 1:38:37.340]  No, it's enjoying a culture. It's like you go to Japan, you sit there
[1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:41.340]  at the dinner and drink sake. You're not. How dare you wear
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:45.340]  a cowboy hat? That's offensive. I hate
[1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:49.340]  rabbits. I'm the roughest Tutankhamere
[1:38:49.340 --> 1:38:53.340]  west of the Pecos, and I'm going to kill you.
[1:38:53.340 --> 1:38:57.340]  I went to, well I went to the
[1:38:57.340 --> 1:39:01.340]  University of Missouri Columbia for the first two years. I hate
[1:39:01.340 --> 1:39:05.340]  rabbits. They made you go to stupid little things. You had to learn about this
[1:39:05.340 --> 1:39:09.340]  training, that training, and sensitivity. We hated it. I didn't want to go to that crap.
[1:39:09.340 --> 1:39:13.340]  But it's trolling for the people. It's trolling for the politically
[1:39:13.340 --> 1:39:17.340]  correct people so that it wrecks every business, every office, and then those people
[1:39:17.340 --> 1:39:21.340]  get ostracized because they're so mentally ill that literally they think
[1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:25.340]  any jokes, any comments, anything is sexist, anything is racist.
[1:39:25.340 --> 1:39:29.340]  You must be trying to screw them over because you don't like them. And then it actually
[1:39:29.340 --> 1:39:33.340]  handicaps people, whether they're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, that buy into this.
[1:39:33.340 --> 1:39:37.340]  Notice though, you never see almost ever Asians at these political correctments.
[1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:41.340]  They're busy getting the straight A's to go be the number one richest group in America.
[1:39:41.340 --> 1:39:45.340]  Learning five different languages. Yeah, because they're busy. They want success. They come from
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:49.340]  countries that are super populated where people starve to death on the street.
[1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:53.340]  So they're here because mama paid $10,000 and worked like a slave to get them
[1:39:53.340 --> 1:39:57.340]  here. And they're here to get straight A's, 4.0's to end up making $2 million
[1:39:57.340 --> 1:40:01.340]  a year. Asians in every category, the first five, six
[1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:05.340]  levels of the wealthiest people in America are different Asian groups. Why is that?
[1:40:05.340 --> 1:40:09.340]  Oh, there was no glass ceiling for them. Yeah, Gavin McGinnis. Because they are about
[1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:13.340]  business. Sorry, go ahead. Gavin McGinnis actually brought that down how if you want to talk about
[1:40:13.340 --> 1:40:17.340]  the privileged class, it's actually Asians. But the privileges you just work hard and
[1:40:17.340 --> 1:40:21.340]  you have a good life. But Alex, think about this. So these are the students,
[1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:25.340]  okay? These kids are students right now. This is unheard of even from my generation.
[1:40:25.340 --> 1:40:29.340]  I'm 27. Even people of my age, this is absurd. We wouldn't ever ask
[1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:33.340]  to be put into some sort of diversity training. This is madness.
[1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:37.340]  Okay, but in 20, 30 years, Alex, okay, you're going to be having
[1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:41.340]  that Hawaiian themed party. I'm going to be at your party. Hopefully I'm going to be enjoying
[1:40:41.340 --> 1:40:45.340]  a mai. And I'm going to have my lay on and everything. My tie. We're going to be having my tie.
[1:40:45.340 --> 1:40:49.340]  We're going to be having a good time. There'll be a tiki torch going, but that neighbor, that neighbor
[1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:53.340]  that went to Baylor. Oh, see, he's going to have to call the government. You're
[1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:57.340]  going to need diversity training, Alex. You're going to need some. We have the little plastic flowers
[1:40:57.340 --> 1:41:01.340]  around our necks. How dare you? It's a pool party. I'm calling the police because I went to
[1:41:01.340 --> 1:41:07.340]  Baylor in the year 2017 and I had diversity training, you see. And I know
[1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:13.340]  it when I see a party that's racist and you, sir, are having an Hawaiian themed party that is racist.
[1:41:13.340 --> 1:41:17.340]  By the way, costume parties are fun. Toga parties are not to put down the Greeks.
[1:41:17.340 --> 1:41:21.340]  It's because you get the girls in the shorter little outfits. I mean, that's what
[1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:25.340]  those are really about. The Mexican theme parties, I've been to a bunch of those. They have nothing
[1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:29.340]  to do, but it's meant to make everybody that's Adam feel weird. Hey, we're having a Mexican
[1:41:29.340 --> 1:41:35.340]  style party and it means fajitas. It means tequila. It means having fun. And I guess you could say
[1:41:35.340 --> 1:41:39.340]  culturally, the Mexicans have fun. I like to go down to Cancun and have fun. Is that bad that the
[1:41:39.340 --> 1:41:45.340]  Mexicans know how to have a party? Well, I've had pinatas at many of my kids' birthday parties. I had
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:49.340]  pinatas when I was a kid. Not because I hated Mexicans. It's fun to have kids over and beat,
[1:41:49.340 --> 1:41:53.340]  you know, a effigy of something and have candy and toys fall out.
[1:41:53.340 --> 1:41:57.340]  So there was a thing just down the street from me yesterday. I went to the groceries. There was a little
[1:41:57.340 --> 1:42:01.340]  party going on. They were banging a little pinata. Kids were all having a good time.
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:05.340]  I didn't drive by and think, oh my gosh, how offensive to Mexicans!
[1:42:05.340 --> 1:42:09.340]  You know, we've got to have a, because we have off the stall. I mean, I know I've gotten Hawaiian food catered in her too.
[1:42:09.340 --> 1:42:11.340]  It's so good. Twice now.
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:15.340]  Well, let's just have Mexican food catered in here with one of the food trucks.
[1:42:15.340 --> 1:42:19.340]  We'll all have a party on Facebook live some dinner up here and everybody will get
[1:42:19.340 --> 1:42:23.340]  rides home. We'll get rideshare or whatever. But whoever wants to drink, we'll buy the tequila
[1:42:23.340 --> 1:42:27.340]  and we'll show people how you have a Mexican party. So, but here's what I'm worried about, Alex.
[1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:31.340]  I'm actually worried about this growing
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:35.340]  roots and affecting us down the road where you literally, okay, this is in the universities
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:39.340]  now, but I'm afraid it's going to infiltrate our daily lives. This false narrative that
[1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:43.340]  we'll take that strain. Exactly. Take that strange, strange foods guy. I forget his name. I like
[1:42:43.340 --> 1:42:47.340]  a show. I watch Latina, but I watch that. He goes all over the world, all over the place. Anthony Bourdain.
[1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:51.340]  Cultural. That's another guy. Cultural food.
[1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:55.340]  And he goes and looks at different cultures and it's all about the culture and you're not
[1:42:55.340 --> 1:42:59.340]  expropriating when you get the recipe and people enjoy that. That's multiculturalism. That's learning
[1:42:59.340 --> 1:43:03.340]  about people's culture. We cook Mexican food at least two nights a week. It has
[1:43:03.340 --> 1:43:07.340]  nothing. This is so mentally ill that I have to say we're not racist
[1:43:07.340 --> 1:43:11.340]  because I like to make tacos. I mean, should I be driving
[1:43:11.340 --> 1:43:15.340]  around Austin, Texas, seeing all these Mexican places, telling if it's not a Mexican
[1:43:15.340 --> 1:43:19.340]  owner, if it's a, if there's a white worker there that they need to go to diversity? Listen, I told you, I was
[1:43:19.340 --> 1:43:23.340]  it about two years ago with my son at Barton Springs and there were
[1:43:23.340 --> 1:43:27.340]  two Hispanic guys and a white guy that were obviously baked in a
[1:43:27.340 --> 1:43:31.340]  smoking pot that you tell they were stoned and they're hopping around the water right in front of me about 10 feet away.
[1:43:31.340 --> 1:43:35.340]  I'm sitting on the grass and they're like, dude, man, I'm hungry. I want some Chinese food.
[1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:39.340]  And he goes, oh dude, you're not supposed to say Chinese. You're just supposed to say Asian.
[1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:43.340]  And they were like real scared. Everybody's hopping around. I mean, Barton's was totally
[1:43:43.340 --> 1:43:47.340]  full of people. It's the middle of the summer. There was probably a thousand people there and I'm sitting there going,
[1:43:47.340 --> 1:43:51.340]  do I say something to these guys? It's the same thing. Oh, it's the
[1:43:51.340 --> 1:43:55.340]  you know, Oriental New Year or the Chinese New Year.
[1:43:55.340 --> 1:43:59.340]  Oh, no, don't say the, say the Asian New Year. Now you can't even say
[1:43:59.340 --> 1:44:03.340]  the Chinese New Year because if saying Chinese is racist,
[1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:07.340]  they're making words evil. So that's the story. It's
[1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:11.340]  an attack on reality, Alex. And here's, and here's what I'm worried about. Okay, so this is what I'm seeing
[1:44:11.340 --> 1:44:15.340]  on social media from accounts that aren't
[1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:19.340]  necessarily tied into one person. They're just kind of general accounts. Like, look,
[1:44:19.340 --> 1:44:23.340]  they have some of the reporters that were down covering my, my
[1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:27.340]  chesty battle at Daily Beast and Buzzfeed. We're actually having
[1:44:27.340 --> 1:44:31.340]  discussions is milk races? Do people like it? Because it's white. And they
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:35.340]  weren't joking. They were serious, but they knew it was
[1:44:35.340 --> 1:44:39.340]  bull, but it was about making their liberal readers get more brainwashed. It's
[1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:43.340]  about praying on their cult. These are, these are like gang members that pray
[1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:47.340]  on their mind control victims. And this the writers know it's bull, but they want to see
[1:44:47.340 --> 1:44:51.340]  how screwed up they can get you just like the Facebook document show. They want to
[1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:55.340]  make you insecure, make you pathetic, make you feel small, and then feed
[1:44:55.340 --> 1:44:59.340]  on you. I want to make you feel strong because you are. But this false narrative
[1:44:59.340 --> 1:45:03.340]  infiltrates into our realities and gets spun like this. Alice, this is
[1:45:03.340 --> 1:45:07.340]  what I'm noticing people want to say. They want to spin it and they say
[1:45:07.340 --> 1:45:11.340]  that we hate immigrants. Anytime they make some sort of political point, they
[1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:15.340]  make it and spin it so that it appears that the opponents hate
[1:45:15.340 --> 1:45:19.340]  immigrants. That was never the story. The other Washington
[1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:23.340]  times, milk, the new symbol of racism and Donald Trump's America. But that's what I'm saying. The Trump
[1:45:23.340 --> 1:45:27.340]  movement was never anti-immigrant. The Trump movement wanted the immigration
[1:45:27.340 --> 1:45:31.340]  law followed. It was about sovereignty and we're not under globalism
[1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:35.340]  where you can't go. I'm Chinese or I'm Mexican or I'm German and I'm going to come here
[1:45:35.340 --> 1:45:39.340]  and you're going to pay for my baby day one. And if you don't, you're a racist. It's like I can't come to
[1:45:39.340 --> 1:45:42.340]  your country and do that. If anything, the Trump movement was
[1:45:42.340 --> 1:45:47.340]  Who bought them TVs? Tell me that. We want immigration. We want legal immigration. We want people to go through
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:51.340]  the process so we can keep this country strong and not have it be infiltrated by people that
[1:45:51.340 --> 1:45:55.340]  hate this country because those people exist. But that's not it. Here's the other one. You're
[1:45:55.340 --> 1:45:59.340]  well aware of this, Alex. You deny climate change.
[1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:03.340]  No, I don't. Exactly. But that's what they say.
[1:46:03.340 --> 1:46:07.340]  See, that's how they spit it. It's your manmade global warming and the carbon taxes you want
[1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:11.340]  when China and India and others have no carbon controls. It'll make carbon actually go up
[1:46:11.340 --> 1:46:15.340]  which you claim is so bad. And this is how they... And they go, no, no, no. They go, science, science,
[1:46:15.340 --> 1:46:19.340]  science, science, science. I'm saving the earth. And I go, no, you're scripting yourself
[1:46:19.340 --> 1:46:23.340]  and casting yourself as the savior. You're an occult. They go, science, science, science,
[1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:27.340]  science, science. So this is how they frame... Bill Nye says, slit your wrist for mommy.
[1:46:27.340 --> 1:46:33.340]  Bill Nye. Mommy Earth. Bill Nye, the creeperzoid. I'm ranting. Go ahead. Sorry.
[1:46:33.340 --> 1:46:38.340]  No, I'm sorry. It's just Bill Nye is unbelievable. But this is how they infiltrate false narratives
[1:46:38.340 --> 1:46:42.340]  into people's realities. And they just kind of give it just a little twist, just a little twist.
[1:46:42.340 --> 1:46:47.340]  And when you don't do the research, you buy it to say, oh, Alex Jones, he doesn't believe in climate change.
[1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:51.340]  But everybody knows the climate change is known. It was first ice age, then it was global warming,
[1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:56.340]  then it was blah, blah, blah. We're saying you're full of bull. The only constant is change.
[1:46:56.340 --> 1:47:01.340]  And they take our line and go, you don't believe in change. We go, we always believe in change.
[1:47:01.340 --> 1:47:06.340]  Shut up, racist. You need to be arrested. You're racist against the earth. Al Gore will save us.
[1:47:06.340 --> 1:47:12.340]  Bill Nye will save us. There's no need to fear. Bill Nye and Al Gore are here.
[1:47:12.340 --> 1:47:19.340]  Bill Nye and Al Gore. Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse.
[1:47:19.340 --> 1:47:24.340]  I said that actually they should go back and start playing an inconvenient truth in the schools again
[1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:29.340]  just to show how wrong these people are. Because he said by 2013, Florida will be flooded.
[1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:34.340]  And so will California. Oh, they also showing the new ad for the inconvenient load of BS Part 2.
[1:47:34.340 --> 1:47:41.340]  Yeah, we had to change our lives this time. He goes, I predicted in my film that areas of lower Manhattan would flood
[1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:47.340]  every decade on average, a hurricane hits it and that area floods. They hadn't put the drains in yet on the construction site.
[1:47:47.340 --> 1:47:51.340]  Hurricanes are actually down. Of course it flooded. It's always hit. He says, hurricanes are up.
[1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:58.340]  Hurricanes are at a global low for 67 years weather channel. It's a fact. There's always been big blows.
[1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:05.340]  There's always been typhoons. There's always been hurricanes.
[1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:09.340]  Are you anti-climate change right now? I am anti-BS is what I am.
[1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:18.340]  What do we do? How do we beat these lies that infiltrate people's realities? It's a lie.
[1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:26.340]  I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.
[1:48:26.340 --> 1:48:32.340]  That's what, imagine this, George Soros' law firm is suing me for a member of the Federal Reserve Board
[1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:37.340]  who's suing me saying refugees never bring in disease and refugees never write.
[1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:40.340]  I see stories every day.
[1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:44.340]  The point is, this is up what, like 10 times in Minnesota?
[1:48:44.340 --> 1:48:48.340]  It shows they're not that powerful that they're having to do this to us and we're only getting bigger.
[1:48:48.340 --> 1:48:52.340]  And then all these timid people go, are you going down? Are you collapsing? No.
[1:48:52.340 --> 1:48:56.340]  Our audience that's hardcore is only making us stronger in the face of this.
[1:48:56.340 --> 1:48:59.340]  And no matter what happens, it's the animating contest of liberty.
[1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:05.340]  Now I'm going to go to Bright and you know what's the admiral of the Water Don't Rise Over Bear Creek.
[1:49:05.340 --> 1:49:12.340]  We're going to go to Ken, Beth, Levi, and then we're going to go to Eric and we're going to go to Michelle and many others.
[1:49:12.340 --> 1:49:23.340]  But before I go any further, briefly, our amazing Made in America, organic, high quality, fluoride free with peppermint, tea tree oil, iodine and nano silver.

[1:50:06.340 --> 1:50:10.340]  And if they can shut us down or slow us down in the quick stand, they're winning.

[1:52:00.340 --> 1:52:06.340]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:52:06.340 --> 1:52:09.340]  and became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[1:52:09.340 --> 1:52:12.340]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com.
[1:52:12.340 --> 1:52:17.340]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom
[1:52:17.340 --> 1:52:22.340]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[1:52:22.340 --> 1:52:26.340]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:30.340]  that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:33.340]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:52:33.340 --> 1:52:38.340]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[1:52:38.340 --> 1:52:43.340]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:52:43.340 --> 1:52:46.340]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:52:46.340 --> 1:52:49.340]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were,
[1:52:49.340 --> 1:52:53.340]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were
[1:52:53.340 --> 1:52:54.340]  and this is a big part of it.
[1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:57.340]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself

[1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:57.340]  Thank you for joining us today.
[1:54:58.340 --> 1:54:59.340]  Here's that again.
[1:54:59.340 --> 1:55:00.340]  It took me a while to understand this,
[1:55:00.340 --> 1:55:05.340]  but I had some friends that came in town this weekend and we met out at a bar and they were sitting there and they were like,
[1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:12.340]  man Owen, we sat down here for two minutes and it wasn't long before both bartenders were looking at us funny.
[1:55:12.340 --> 1:55:15.340]  Everybody at the side of the bar was looking at us funny because they're conservatives.
[1:55:15.340 --> 1:55:16.340]  They don't mind speaking their mind.
[1:55:16.340 --> 1:55:17.340]  They're people that like talking their mind.
[1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:24.340]  So here in Austin, beyond just the liberal people that you can't have a conversation with because you're going to end up offending them,
[1:55:24.340 --> 1:55:28.340]  there's nobody is from here, okay? Nobody in Austin is from Austin.
[1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:33.340]  So there's no real culture and everybody that moves here is some form of a socialite.
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:34.340]  They're posers.
[1:55:34.340 --> 1:55:37.340]  So yeah, so they don't actually have anything to do.
[1:55:37.340 --> 1:55:39.340]  They don't make their own meals.
[1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:40.340]  They don't cook meals.
[1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:41.340]  They don't have a garden.
[1:55:41.340 --> 1:55:43.340]  Most of them are here on debt trying to be trendy.
[1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:45.340]  They all fled from Hollywood.
[1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:50.340]  So they run around all day doing the little trendy activity, whatever the latest trendy thing is to do,
[1:55:50.340 --> 1:55:54.340]  go to a little coffee shop and all this stuff and they run around, drive around, they cause all the traffic,
[1:55:54.340 --> 1:55:56.340]  and they have no culture.
[1:55:56.340 --> 1:56:03.340]  They walk into me and laugh at me.
[1:56:03.340 --> 1:56:04.340]  It's true though.
[1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:06.340]  I had two gay guys yesterday walking to me and target.
[1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:08.340]  Let's buy my daughter some baby allowed toys.
[1:56:08.340 --> 1:56:09.340]  She likes them.
[1:56:09.340 --> 1:56:13.340]  And these two gay guys, they look like...
[1:56:13.340 --> 1:56:15.340]  Who are the guys from the Fred Flintstone?
[1:56:15.340 --> 1:56:17.340]  Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
[1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:18.340]  Barney Rubble.
[1:56:18.340 --> 1:56:19.340]  And I'm not bashing because they were gay.
[1:56:19.340 --> 1:56:21.340]  They look like my son goes.
[1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:23.340]  They look like Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone.
[1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:27.340]  After they pointed at us and started laughing, and I walked right by and they kept laughing.
[1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:29.340]  And I went, yeah, I'm Alex Jones.
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:31.340]  I don't dislike you and they just couldn't even talk.
[1:56:31.340 --> 1:56:32.340]  But that's the thing.
[1:56:32.340 --> 1:56:35.340]  Liberals will point and laugh like it hurts me.
[1:56:35.340 --> 1:56:36.340]  Like it does something.
[1:56:36.340 --> 1:56:41.340]  They're like carpetbaggers from some failed place running here and then they laugh at me.
[1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:42.340]  Because that's what the media does.
[1:56:42.340 --> 1:56:44.340]  The media points and laughs at you.
[1:56:44.340 --> 1:56:47.340]  So then they see that and they think that that's how they empower themselves.
[1:56:47.340 --> 1:56:49.340]  But like I said, they don't have...
[1:56:49.340 --> 1:56:51.340]  Alex, look, I'm from St. Louis.
[1:56:51.340 --> 1:56:52.340]  It's not the most conservative area.
[1:56:52.340 --> 1:56:54.340]  Some areas of St. Louis are very liberal.
[1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:55.340]  I just didn't know Fred Flintstone was gay.
[1:56:55.340 --> 1:56:57.340]  I thought you were Fred Flintstone.
[1:56:57.340 --> 1:56:58.340]  And St. Louis continues to...
[1:56:58.340 --> 1:56:59.340]  They elect a lot of Democrats.
[1:56:59.340 --> 1:57:01.340]  But let me tell you, here's the biggest difference.
[1:57:01.340 --> 1:57:05.340]  If I go out in St. Louis and me and you were sitting down having a conversation,
[1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:08.340]  we could be in the most liberal area of town surrounded by Democrats.
[1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:10.340]  But nobody would care.
[1:57:10.340 --> 1:57:12.340]  Nobody would be offended by what we're saying.
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:14.340]  Nobody would stare at us in jeer and say,
[1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:15.340]  What's wrong with those people?
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:16.340]  That's what they do.
[1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:20.340]  Listen, they walk up since the Trump thing and literally get in my face like,
[1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:21.340]  I'm not human.
[1:57:21.340 --> 1:57:22.340]  I can't deal with it, man.
[1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:24.340]  I can't go out and I can't have a conversation.
[1:57:24.340 --> 1:57:26.340]  Owen, Owen, Owen.
[1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:27.340]  Listen, you know why it is.
[1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:29.340]  You're a good-looking guy, bro.
[1:57:29.340 --> 1:57:32.340]  And most of these people, I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic, are ugly.
[1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:33.340]  They're ugly.
[1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:34.340]  They're stupid.
[1:57:34.340 --> 1:57:36.340]  They have no future.
[1:57:36.340 --> 1:57:39.340]  They've all got all these giant loans, two, three fake degrees.
[1:57:39.340 --> 1:57:40.340]  They're miserable.
[1:57:40.340 --> 1:57:43.340]  Wait till you get a good-looking wife and a bunch of good-looking kids.
[1:57:43.340 --> 1:57:46.340]  They will come over and get in your face, bro.
[1:57:46.340 --> 1:57:48.340]  They don't like success.
[1:57:48.340 --> 1:57:52.340]  What if I went out and talked like this and told everybody that I thought Trump was bad?
[1:57:52.340 --> 1:57:55.340]  Yes, they used to walk around like, oh, my God.
[1:57:55.340 --> 1:57:57.340]  I look, oh, look, you have to judge people.
[1:57:57.340 --> 1:57:58.340]  Exactly.
[1:57:58.340 --> 1:57:59.340]  They're cult members.
[1:57:59.340 --> 1:58:00.340]  They're grandparents.
[1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:01.340]  That's what it is.
[1:58:01.340 --> 1:58:02.340]  That's what it is.
[1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:04.340]  They are judgmental and they are entitled people.
[1:58:04.340 --> 1:58:06.340]  They'll walk right across the road.
[1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:09.340]  There'll be a car going down the road 40 miles an hour heading right to them.
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:10.340]  They'll have a knowing.
[1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:11.340]  They're grandparents.
[1:58:11.340 --> 1:58:13.340]  They'll walk right across the road because they're entitled.
[1:58:13.340 --> 1:58:19.340]  Their grandparents were super right-wing Pharisees that would get really mad at their parents.
[1:58:19.340 --> 1:58:22.340]  You know, saying, if you play with yourself, you're going to go blind or telling them to
[1:58:22.340 --> 1:58:25.340]  go into the bathrooms dirty and bad like Sigmund Freud thought.
[1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:30.340]  These are all really uptight freaked out people saying they're liberal, saying they're cutting edge,
[1:58:30.340 --> 1:58:35.340]  saying they're trendy, and really, they're neurotic basket cases looking at real liberals like us
[1:58:35.340 --> 1:58:37.340]  and they don't know what to do, but it doesn't matter.
[1:58:37.340 --> 1:58:38.340]  Just watch.
[1:58:38.340 --> 1:58:40.340]  We'll change the world like we always do.
[1:58:40.340 --> 1:58:42.340]  You'll sit there and try to stop us and you'll fail.
[1:58:42.340 --> 1:58:43.340]  I promise.
[1:58:43.340 --> 1:58:46.340]  In 70 seconds, Ken, Beth, and Levi.
[1:58:46.340 --> 1:58:47.340]  Yeah.
[1:58:47.340 --> 1:58:48.340]  Yeah.
[1:58:48.340 --> 1:58:49.340]  You did it.
[1:58:49.340 --> 1:58:53.340]  Today we call it bone broth.
[1:58:53.340 --> 1:58:58.340]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our
[1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:00.340]  modern diets of processed junk.
[1:59:00.340 --> 1:59:03.340]  We are now introducing Caveman by M4sLive.com.
[1:59:03.340 --> 1:59:08.340]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[1:59:08.340 --> 1:59:12.340]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:13.340]  Caveman.
[1:59:13.340 --> 1:59:18.340]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior
[1:59:18.340 --> 1:59:21.340]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:24.340]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:59:24.340 --> 1:59:29.340]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[1:59:29.340 --> 1:59:34.340]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the
[1:59:34.340 --> 1:59:35.340]  blood for the body.
[1:59:35.340 --> 1:59:37.340]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:59:37.340 --> 1:59:42.340]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[1:59:42.340 --> 1:59:44.340]  to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:59:44.340 --> 1:59:45.340]  And this is a big part of it.
[1:59:45.340 --> 1:59:49.340]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in
[1:59:49.340 --> 2:00:18.340]  InforWarsLife.com today.
[2:00:20.340 --> 2:00:23.340]  You got a hold of me.
[2:00:23.340 --> 2:00:25.340]  You know what feels so good?
[2:00:25.340 --> 2:00:29.340]  I have more friends, real people, not fake people that I've ever had.
[2:00:29.340 --> 2:00:32.340]  It is so good that all the trash hates me.
[2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:36.340]  I got no friends because they read the papers.
[2:00:36.340 --> 2:00:41.340]  No, I got so many friends because they read the papers and they hate the papers.
[2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:43.340]  It's good to see MSM lose its power, isn't it?
[2:00:43.340 --> 2:00:44.340]  And they don't get it.
[2:00:44.340 --> 2:00:49.340]  The more they've hit us, we have record traffic and record revenue coming in right now to
[2:00:49.340 --> 2:00:50.340]  fund the operation.
[2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:51.340]  I'm not sure when it'll sink in.
[2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:54.340]  I'm really not sure when the death of the mainstream media will sink in.
[2:00:54.340 --> 2:00:57.340]  They've been operating as walking dead for years now.
[2:00:57.340 --> 2:01:00.340]  So it still hasn't sunk in, but it will.
[2:01:00.340 --> 2:01:01.340]  It will.
[2:01:01.340 --> 2:01:04.340]  It didn't with Hillary, but next time.
[2:01:04.340 --> 2:01:06.340]  Oh, oh, misogynism.
[2:01:06.340 --> 2:01:08.340]  That's what, I mean at least during the campaign Joe Biden.
[2:01:08.340 --> 2:01:09.340]  2009 climate change.
[2:01:09.340 --> 2:01:13.340]  At least Joe Biden was honest and said, I know we don't really like her and we kind of forced
[2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:14.340]  her on him.
[2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:15.340]  You've got to go ahead and vote for her.
[2:01:15.340 --> 2:01:17.340]  Now it's, oh, we didn't vote for her because she's a woman.
[2:01:17.340 --> 2:01:19.340]  I'd vote for a woman in one second like LePen.
[2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:23.340]  We didn't vote for Hillary because she's a creepy master criminal.
[2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:24.340]  That's simple.
[2:01:24.340 --> 2:01:25.340]  Let's go to phone calls.
[2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:30.340]  Ken in the great state of Texas, then Beth in the amazing state of Virginia, and then
[2:01:30.340 --> 2:01:33.340]  Levi in the unbelievably beautiful state of Washington.
[2:01:33.340 --> 2:01:34.340]  Ken, you're on the air.
[2:01:34.340 --> 2:01:35.340]  Go ahead.
[2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:37.340]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:01:37.340 --> 2:01:42.340]  As much as I'd like to make my point, it's a pleasure to listen to you when you're on
[2:01:42.340 --> 2:01:43.340]  the air and in the zone.
[2:01:43.340 --> 2:01:44.340]  Thank you, brother.
[2:01:44.340 --> 2:01:50.840]  I was calling about the wall and the Democrats were celebrating that Trump didn't get funding
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:51.840]  for it.
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:55.340]  And I had written an article years ago about the wall and immigration.
[2:01:55.340 --> 2:01:59.340]  I'd never sent it to any politicians because none of them would do anything about it.
[2:01:59.340 --> 2:02:03.340]  I could tell, you know, but the, everybody knows what a coyote is on the border.
[2:02:03.340 --> 2:02:04.340]  Yes.
[2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:09.340]  And a coyote is a mafia that transports people and drugs across the border and they pay for
[2:02:09.340 --> 2:02:10.340]  it.
[2:02:10.340 --> 2:02:17.340]  If a simple solution to this would be if the American government become a coyote and
[2:02:17.340 --> 2:02:22.460]  people that are in America that are working paying taxes legally, not illegally, but paying
[2:02:22.460 --> 2:02:29.500]  taxes, if they simply paid a fee to the American government, say $1,500 a year, instead of paying
[2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:37.340]  a coyote $8,000 to get them across the border, they pay a flat tax, they pay $1,500 a year.
[2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:40.340]  That funds the wall and we know who's here.
[2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:42.340]  That's a good idea.
[2:02:42.340 --> 2:02:43.980]  We can just put fines.
[2:02:43.980 --> 2:02:48.980]  We can put fines on illegals if they've committed a crime and then, and then pay for it.
[2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:54.260]  There's so many ways you can have a entry fee that you build the wall for.
[2:02:54.260 --> 2:02:58.420]  And so again, the fact he hasn't killed Obamacare, it took Obama two plus years to pass it.
[2:02:58.420 --> 2:03:00.340]  We're a hundred days in and he hadn't gotten repealed.
[2:03:00.340 --> 2:03:01.420]  They're calling him a loser.
[2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:02.420]  It's all spent.
[2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.580]  Well, I'm not the biggest wall guy to be honest with you.
[2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:05.740]  I don't care if it gets built or not.
[2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:09.740]  I think just in for sure, but it's a symbol, it's a symbol and it does have it does have
[2:03:09.740 --> 2:03:10.740]  effectiveness.
[2:03:10.740 --> 2:03:13.500]  I'm not saying it won't be effective, but keep in mind, everybody keeps saying, oh, there's
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:15.660]  no funding for the wall, no funding for the wall.
[2:03:15.660 --> 2:03:21.580]  What did Trump say his entire campaign, Mexico will pay for the wall, Mexico will pay for
[2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:22.580]  the wall.
[2:03:22.580 --> 2:03:24.380]  This wasn't Mexico's proposed budget.
[2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:25.660]  This wasn't the United States.
[2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:27.500]  So maybe he's just following through with that word.
[2:03:27.500 --> 2:03:29.100]  He's not going to make us pay for it.
[2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:30.100]  Absolutely.
[2:03:30.100 --> 2:03:31.100]  There was an article on him.
[2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:35.860]  Senator Paul's teaching a class on dystopia and it's making the liberals mad and there's
[2:03:35.860 --> 2:03:37.660]  a bunch of new articles on infowars.com.
[2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:39.140]  They're constantly getting posted.
[2:03:39.140 --> 2:03:41.020]  So will the crew print me all the way to the left?
[2:03:41.020 --> 2:03:45.380]  The left is the only the only political entity that gets to tell you about dystopia.
[2:03:45.380 --> 2:03:46.380]  Don't you see Alex?
[2:03:46.380 --> 2:03:48.340]  The right can't do that.
[2:03:48.340 --> 2:03:49.820]  Only the left because it's the right.
[2:03:49.820 --> 2:03:50.820]  That's the dystopic.
[2:03:50.820 --> 2:03:51.820]  Absolutely.
[2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:52.820]  Can anything else?
[2:03:52.820 --> 2:03:59.380]  Yeah, this way, Mexico does in effect pay for the wall.
[2:03:59.380 --> 2:04:02.500]  Pay your ID again for folks that may have missed it.
[2:04:02.500 --> 2:04:03.500]  Okay.
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:04.500]  It's very simple.
[2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:11.060]  If the American government say Texas, Arizona, they get $500 for the state for letting them
[2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:12.060]  come through their state.
[2:04:12.060 --> 2:04:14.260]  A thousand dollars goes to the government.
[2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:18.300]  We process the people, they pay a flat tax, now they're paying a tax.
[2:04:18.300 --> 2:04:19.300]  We know who's here.
[2:04:19.300 --> 2:04:24.060]  If they commit a crime, they're never allowed to come back into the country again.
[2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:27.020]  If they're working paying taxes, I'm a contractor in Austin.
[2:04:27.020 --> 2:04:28.820]  I've listened to you for years.
[2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:32.060]  I've got people that work for me that have been paying taxes.
[2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:35.340]  They're here illegally, but they've got a driver's license.
[2:04:35.340 --> 2:04:37.580]  They're paying taxes, but they're scared to death.
[2:04:37.580 --> 2:04:40.780]  They're afraid they're going to be shipped back home.
[2:04:40.780 --> 2:04:42.580]  And they say, oh, we want some opportunities.
[2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:43.980]  Oh, I agree.
[2:04:43.980 --> 2:04:48.100]  We should make it easy for hardworking, good people to legally be here and then kick all
[2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:50.140]  the criminals out no matter where they come from.
[2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:51.780]  And that's the type of reform we need.
[2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:55.140]  The problem is the Democrats and Republicans always add a bunch of garbage to it.
[2:04:55.140 --> 2:04:56.140]  That's why it hadn't happened yet.
[2:04:56.140 --> 2:04:57.580]  But that is what Trump's planning.
[2:04:57.580 --> 2:04:58.580]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:58.580 --> 2:05:01.740]  Here are 10 great points.
[2:05:01.740 --> 2:05:06.220]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed
[2:05:06.220 --> 2:05:11.220]  by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
[2:05:11.220 --> 2:05:15.420]  and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among
[2:05:15.420 --> 2:05:20.900]  men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of
[2:05:20.900 --> 2:05:25.780]  government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
[2:05:25.780 --> 2:05:31.020]  to abolish it and to institute new government.
[2:05:31.020 --> 2:05:32.020]  Independence isn't a day.
[2:05:32.020 --> 2:05:36.020]  It's a mindset, an attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[2:05:36.020 --> 2:05:38.180]  I will not be your slave.
[2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:43.860]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[2:05:43.860 --> 2:05:49.100]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:50.660]  Slaves are never safe.
[2:05:50.660 --> 2:05:53.820]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[2:05:53.820 --> 2:05:58.140]  Be your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[2:05:58.140 --> 2:06:01.300]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[2:06:01.300 --> 2:06:04.900]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[2:06:04.900 --> 2:06:06.780]  in stock at Infowars.com.
[2:06:06.780 --> 2:06:08.940]  Research across the board is clear.
[2:06:08.940 --> 2:06:12.900]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[2:06:12.900 --> 2:06:14.300]  clots and heart attacks.
[2:06:14.300 --> 2:06:18.900]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[2:06:18.900 --> 2:06:21.380]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:26.140]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[2:06:26.140 --> 2:06:28.540]  iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:06:28.540 --> 2:06:33.300]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[2:06:33.300 --> 2:06:35.820]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:06:35.820 --> 2:06:40.460]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[2:06:40.460 --> 2:06:45.380]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver and more, due to requests from listers who found that
[2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:47.900]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:51.860]  We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.

[2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:11.460]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in
[2:07:11.460 --> 2:07:16.940]  healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes,
[2:07:16.940 --> 2:07:20.340]  cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[2:07:20.340 --> 2:07:23.620]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:26.260]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[2:07:26.260 --> 2:07:29.460]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[1:52:26.020 --> 2:08:36.800]  see, hit shows with big actors like Woody Harrelson and others like crew detective
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:42.580]  where there's elites in Louisiana Mississippi running child kidnapping rings where they
[2:08:42.580 --> 2:08:47.200]  torture them to death and there's a giant cover up going on and oh that's the big hit
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:53.580]  show and you've got all these different elites caught involved in satanic rituals in Europe
[2:08:53.580 --> 2:08:56.020]  You've got Trump involved in this giant roundup of these people,
[2:08:56.020 --> 2:08:58.820]  but almost no attention of it ending up mainstream news.
[2:08:58.820 --> 2:08:59.740]  And then here's the article.
[2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:03.260]  I saw this a few weeks ago, but I wanted time to vet it, research it,
[2:09:03.460 --> 2:09:05.100]  check into it. Paul Watts has done it.
[2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:07.100]  It's got a lot of credibility.
[2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:11.020]  X banker claims he was invited to take part in child sacrifice rituals.
[2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:13.940]  These people were Luciferians, powerful video.
[2:09:14.340 --> 2:09:15.860]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:18.780]  And then I'm going to get Millie Weaver in here on the Antifa rioters
[2:09:18.780 --> 2:09:20.580]  yesterday in Austin, a former Dutch banker.
[2:09:20.580 --> 2:09:20.900]  Oh yeah.
[2:09:20.900 --> 2:09:25.180]  Oh, the Dutch area, they've caught people with the kids in cages, the slaves.
[2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:26.460]  It's really come out there.
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:28.220]  The police have done investigations.
[2:09:28.220 --> 2:09:31.660]  They've found people with the kids, but then the investigations get shut down.
[2:09:31.860 --> 2:09:34.780]  A former Dutch banker has given a sit down interview during what she claims
[2:09:35.020 --> 2:09:37.540]  that he was invited by members of the financial elite to participate in child
[2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:39.620]  sacrifice rituals.
[2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:42.620]  Ronald Bernard was successful entrepreneur who ran a number of businesses
[2:09:42.620 --> 2:09:44.420]  before entering the world of finance upon doing so.
[2:09:44.420 --> 2:09:47.100]  He was told by his peers to put his.
[2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:49.500]  Conscience in the freezer.
[2:09:49.500 --> 2:09:52.340]  I was training to become a psychopath and I failed.
[2:09:53.340 --> 2:09:54.340]  That's exactly right.
[2:09:54.340 --> 2:09:56.500]  He breaks down in this interview and starts crying.
[2:09:57.060 --> 2:10:01.140]  Bernard's background checks out his profile by the dole, the Devolt's
[2:10:01.140 --> 2:10:03.340]  crot article from 2017.
[2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:07.140]  He goes on to describe how a leader saw the people as useless parasites
[2:10:07.620 --> 2:10:12.500]  and were completely content to crash economies, destroy companies
[2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:13.580]  and enrich themselves.
[2:10:13.580 --> 2:10:16.820]  Bernard then relates how he was invited to participate in occult satanic
[2:10:16.820 --> 2:10:17.820]  rituals with other elites.
[2:10:17.820 --> 2:10:21.700]  I've been invited to go be part of the Hellfire Club at Oxford.
[2:10:21.900 --> 2:10:24.540]  He describes scenes from the movie with Tom Cruise.
[2:10:24.540 --> 2:10:25.700]  I can't think of it right now.
[2:10:25.900 --> 2:10:26.900]  Eyes wide shut.
[2:10:26.900 --> 2:10:26.900]  Yeah.
[2:10:27.100 --> 2:10:30.580]  You know, I'm the only person interviewing the last 15 years, Vivian Kubrick.
[2:10:31.980 --> 2:10:35.020]  And when I interviewed her and she was getting ready to come to Austin and spill
[2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:36.020]  the guts.
[2:10:36.420 --> 2:10:37.620]  All hell broke loose.
[2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:41.820]  Sleeper cells inside the operation, government stuff.
[2:10:41.820 --> 2:10:45.100]  I mean, I can't get into it all at this time and then she just disappeared.
[2:10:45.100 --> 2:10:46.900]  Haven't heard from her.
[2:10:46.900 --> 2:10:51.780]  I'm not a liberator to get into it all, but she kind of co-directed his last
[2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:54.780]  four or five movies at the score for Full Metal Jacket.
[2:10:55.020 --> 2:10:56.020]  He was, he was her main.
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:11:00.380]  He was his, he was her favorite family of the other daughter and the mom and Vivian
[2:11:00.380 --> 2:11:01.380]  Kubrick.
[2:11:01.380 --> 2:11:05.860]  And that's, but I mean, I almost, I've never broken confidence with people.
[2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:09.740]  And I almost want to tell people the stuff she told me, but I just can't do it.
[2:11:10.100 --> 2:11:14.100]  And I almost, just for safety's sake, need to, but it was, uh, I was, uh,
[2:11:14.100 --> 2:11:22.100]  to, but it was, uh, the shining was real in that those were experiences he had.
[2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:24.100]  Basically, I'm not going to get into all of it.
[2:11:24.660 --> 2:11:26.100]  She didn't tell me I couldn't talk about that.
[2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:30.100]  The shining was real, but also, um, Dr.
[2:11:30.100 --> 2:11:35.660]  Strangelove was basically real and Eyes Wide Shut was basically real.
[2:11:36.900 --> 2:11:40.220]  And I'm not allowed to say why I know that.
[2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:44.660]  Well, I think that, and this is just my, I mean, all the stuff she told me, I'm sorry.
[2:11:44.660 --> 2:11:47.620]  And I could check it out with some other Hollywood folks and some other top level
[2:11:47.620 --> 2:11:51.220]  musicians that, that actually knew about it, but it's, it's unbelievable.
[2:11:51.220 --> 2:11:55.660]  If it makes it to Hollywood, if it makes it to the movies, if it makes it to our minds,
[2:11:55.660 --> 2:11:59.820]  if we can conceive it in our heads, I'm to the point now where I believe it's
[2:11:59.820 --> 2:12:02.220]  probably physically manifested itself at this point.
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:02.700]  Well, here's the deal.
[2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:08.700]  Her dad rushed up against it in the fifties, back when he was putting paths to
[2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:12.460]  glory out in all those famous films and Spartacus and all that.
[2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:16.140]  And he was like, whoa, and he, that's why he went basically hid in the British
[2:12:16.140 --> 2:12:18.300]  countryside and was like a recluse after that.
[2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:20.020]  And then they came after him.
[2:12:20.380 --> 2:12:23.180]  Well, you know, the way they came after him is the same stuff they're doing to me, man.
[2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:24.860]  It is hardcore.
[2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:29.900]  Just kind of on the same topic, which is a bit off topic, but you know, uh, Ridley
[2:12:29.900 --> 2:12:33.900]  Scott, the director of the new Prometheus movie, Alien Covenant.
[2:12:34.140 --> 2:12:35.980]  I know you're, I was a fan of the Prometheus movie.
[2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:36.940]  I know you like to talk about it.
[2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:38.940]  He says that aliens are real and they're coming.
[2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:43.580]  So I said that when the first film came out four years ago, people didn't believe me.
[2:12:43.580 --> 2:12:44.300]  That's what the elites believe.
[2:12:44.300 --> 2:12:45.900]  And I said, this is what the elites believe.
[2:12:46.220 --> 2:12:46.460]  Yeah.
[2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:47.340]  I've got the name of the video.
[2:12:47.340 --> 2:12:49.340]  It's something like secrets of Prometheus revealed.
[2:12:49.340 --> 2:12:52.940]  And I said, this is this whole program and they believe this is what happens.
[2:12:52.940 --> 2:12:55.020]  They believe we were actually, we are aliens.
[2:12:55.020 --> 2:12:56.860]  I'm not saying all this for the media picks it up.
[2:12:56.860 --> 2:13:01.100]  This is what they believe and they believe they're in contact with them interdimensionally.
[2:13:02.860 --> 2:13:04.380]  And it's not even in another dimension.
[2:13:04.380 --> 2:13:08.860]  They're communicating transdimensionally over the space time continuum through fold space,
[2:13:09.820 --> 2:13:11.660]  which they've now mathematically proven is there.
[2:13:11.660 --> 2:13:16.060]  So they're in the third dimension, but they're transmitting through a higher dimension
[2:13:16.060 --> 2:13:19.180]  that our brains able to basically periscope up into.
[2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:25.020]  And then they're giving humanoids on this planet the dark technology to actually build
[2:13:25.020 --> 2:13:28.060]  and the construct to the whole system set up when they get here.
[2:13:28.060 --> 2:13:32.940]  And it might make sense how people end up looking the way they look like a George Soros or a John
[2:13:32.940 --> 2:13:37.420]  Kerry or a Hillary Clinton just looking absolutely sick.
[2:13:37.420 --> 2:13:40.860]  I mean, they look like they've been through the Crypt Keeper's dungeon.
[2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:44.780]  Oh, and by the way, before I go to more calls, guys pull up because that's the Daily Mail right
[2:13:44.780 --> 2:13:46.700]  there and also a bunch of other animals have it.
[2:13:46.700 --> 2:13:48.860]  Aliens are real and will probably destroy us all.
[2:13:48.860 --> 2:13:53.180]  Director Ridley Scott said, now he's saying that in 2017, May 2nd.
[2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:54.860]  That's today. I didn't even know that it came out.
[2:13:54.860 --> 2:13:55.900]  Print that for me.
[2:13:55.900 --> 2:13:57.340]  I put out three, four years ago.
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:03.420]  This was four years ago when Prometheus, which is, you know, Genesis came out.
[2:14:03.420 --> 2:14:05.100]  And that's the Genesis of it.
[2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:06.460]  I'm explaining this is the real Genesis.
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:07.420]  This is what they believe.
[2:14:07.420 --> 2:14:13.020]  Let's pull up my YouTube video of this title, Secrets of Prometheus Reveal or leaked.
[2:14:13.020 --> 2:14:13.660]  Pull it up.
[2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:15.020]  You watch that.
[2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:20.300]  And I say exactly what Ridley Scott saying in that film.
[2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:21.420]  Now let's scroll down.
[2:14:21.420 --> 2:14:22.700]  Secrets of Prometheus leaked.
[2:14:22.700 --> 2:14:23.420]  Let's click on that.
[2:14:24.940 --> 2:14:26.380]  And let's click on the viewfinder.
[2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:27.900]  Let's click on the actual word.
[2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:30.540]  It says YouTube there on the lower right-hand side for TV viewers.
[2:14:30.540 --> 2:14:30.780]  Thank you.
[2:14:30.780 --> 2:14:31.580]  That old student.
[2:14:31.580 --> 2:14:34.060]  Only has 887,000 views.
[2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:39.420]  This is literally what the elite actually believe what I've been told by the highest levels.
[2:14:39.420 --> 2:14:43.900]  And then I was told a month before the letter came that you're going to be invited to Oxford.
[2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:47.500]  And if you're invited, speaking to the Oxford faculties,
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:50.140]  something that presidents do, it's a big honor, big deal.
[2:14:50.140 --> 2:14:55.100]  But I said, really, this offer is for you to then go into the caves underneath
[2:14:55.100 --> 2:14:58.300]  and be in the first level satanic sex orgy ritual.
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:01.180]  And we think you got what it takes.
[2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:02.460]  We think you're hardcore enough.
[2:15:02.460 --> 2:15:04.140]  You're going to find what's really going on.
[2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:06.060]  And you've got to be willing to do this.
[2:15:06.060 --> 2:15:10.060]  And I told this high-level Hollywood person, household name, not Charlie Sheen, folks.
[2:15:10.060 --> 2:15:11.340]  It's a director.
[2:15:11.340 --> 2:15:13.020]  I said, not going to do it.
[2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:13.580]  Thanks a lot.
[2:15:13.580 --> 2:15:14.620]  They said, it's a big honor.
[2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:15.900]  You do this.
[2:15:15.900 --> 2:15:16.940]  You don't have to do the other rituals.
[2:15:16.940 --> 2:15:18.220]  And I said, I know where this leads.
[2:15:18.220 --> 2:15:18.860]  OK.
[2:15:18.860 --> 2:15:21.660]  So then Oxford invited me and I said, no, I'm not going.
[2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:24.860]  Cambridge then sends a letter a month later and says,
[2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:28.860]  oh, if you know the other side of this, we're actually the good guys
[2:15:28.860 --> 2:15:29.980]  and are trying to get out of this.
[2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:31.100]  And I just said, I'm not coming.
[2:15:31.740 --> 2:15:35.740]  So I've had the literal high-level Illuminati invite me to their meetings.
[2:15:35.740 --> 2:15:38.380]  And I've told everybody that people are starting to finally listen.
[2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:41.020]  But I had them when I was in high school, they were trying to get me.
[2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:42.620]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:46.300]  No, I mean, it's and that's because they're getting, they believe,
[2:15:46.300 --> 2:15:50.220]  and I believe it now because they're getting higher order information.
[2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:55.660]  I think that the key here is for people to understand that this is how
[2:15:55.660 --> 2:15:58.540]  dude, they had people back in time trying to stop me.
[2:15:58.540 --> 2:16:00.460]  I don't know how all this works, but I'm telling you.
[2:16:00.460 --> 2:16:01.340]  But that's what I'm saying.
[2:16:01.340 --> 2:16:03.340]  People and whether this is going on or not.
[2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:04.700]  But see, there's good in the universe.
[2:16:04.700 --> 2:16:05.500]  There's free will.
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:06.620]  So they couldn't stop me.
[2:16:06.620 --> 2:16:06.860]  Sorry.
[2:16:06.860 --> 2:16:07.900]  But this is what they believe.
[2:16:07.900 --> 2:16:08.700]  That's the key here.
[2:16:08.700 --> 2:16:09.100]  It's not.
[2:16:09.100 --> 2:16:12.140]  It's not about whether you're saying you believe this or, you know,
[2:16:12.140 --> 2:16:13.660]  this is how they think.
[2:16:13.660 --> 2:16:15.020]  This is what they're thinking.
[2:16:15.020 --> 2:16:16.860]  This is how they're operating.
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:20.060]  This is how these elite social groups are operating.
[2:16:20.060 --> 2:16:21.020]  That's the key.
[2:16:21.020 --> 2:16:22.700]  That's what people need to have sink in.
[2:16:23.340 --> 2:16:25.580]  That's what people cannot come to grips with.
[2:16:25.580 --> 2:16:28.540]  They cannot come to the terms with that reality.
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:30.380]  The secret societies actually exist.
[2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:32.220]  And they're tapped into something they don't want you to know about.
[2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:35.420]  They're tapped in anything and they have these crazy beliefs
[2:16:35.420 --> 2:16:37.260]  that most of the average humans would just laugh.
[2:16:37.260 --> 2:16:41.180]  I told people four years ago, Ridley Scott believes in aliens
[2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:44.620]  and has been given high level stuff basically from Oxford.
[2:16:44.620 --> 2:16:46.220]  And that's where he was hooked up.
[2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:47.980]  And this is a revelation.
[2:16:47.980 --> 2:16:50.620]  And when the next movie comes out, he's going to tell you it's all real.
[2:16:50.620 --> 2:16:51.820]  I said that four years ago.
[2:16:51.820 --> 2:16:52.700]  He just did it today.
[2:16:52.700 --> 2:16:54.620]  You people, people are going to want you to start talking
[2:16:54.620 --> 2:16:55.820]  about aliens more now.
[2:16:55.820 --> 2:16:56.780]  Now that you're talking about it.
[2:16:56.780 --> 2:16:59.500]  You know, you know, that's how it goes.
[2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:00.220]  All right, we got to take these calls.
[2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:02.700]  I went from being, I went from, yeah, I'm going to get into it.
[2:17:02.700 --> 2:17:03.660]  No, here we go.
[2:17:04.300 --> 2:17:05.180]  I apologize.
[2:17:05.180 --> 2:17:07.900]  We're going to send you Beth because I think it's good for women.
[2:17:07.900 --> 2:17:09.100]  Women are mainly buying it.
[2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:11.260]  The conservatism is the new counterculture.
[2:17:11.260 --> 2:17:13.580]  Paul Joseph Watson shirt for you holding an hour.
[2:17:13.580 --> 2:17:15.580]  When you hold an hour now, you get a free shirt.
[2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:17.180]  If you'll give us your address and want that, Beth,
[2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:18.700]  you can have an interstitial if you'd like.
[2:17:18.700 --> 2:17:20.220]  Beth, thank you for holding like a true trooper.
[2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:20.540]  Go ahead.
[2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:24.860]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[2:17:24.860 --> 2:17:30.220]  So, you know, speaking of shirts, I just want to say that I actually just ordered
[2:17:30.220 --> 2:17:35.260]  about $100 worth of shirts because I have family who's coming in from California.
[2:17:35.820 --> 2:17:41.100]  And my sister and I have decided that our, our desires to trigger them.
[2:17:41.100 --> 2:17:46.300]  So every single day that they're here, we will be wearing an info ward.
[2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:47.900]  By the way, I didn't know you were going to say that.
[2:17:47.900 --> 2:17:48.780]  We didn't screen your call.
[2:17:48.780 --> 2:17:51.340]  So we're going to send you, because you did that.
[2:17:51.340 --> 2:17:52.300]  Harmon, make sure we get it.
[2:17:52.300 --> 2:17:53.100]  Make sure we do it, guys.
[2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:54.060]  Send it to Nico.
[2:17:54.060 --> 2:17:55.500]  We're going to send you five shirts.
[2:17:55.500 --> 2:17:56.540]  You tell us the five you want.
[2:17:56.540 --> 2:17:56.940]  Go ahead.
[2:17:58.060 --> 2:17:58.860]  Holy cow.
[2:17:58.860 --> 2:17:59.660]  Thanks, man.
[2:17:59.660 --> 2:18:00.380]  That's awesome.
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:00.860]  You bet.
[2:18:02.860 --> 2:18:08.540]  So, you know, I, I, I'm not exactly sure why I called.
[2:18:08.540 --> 2:18:11.580]  I just really feel like I need to get my voice out there.
[2:18:11.580 --> 2:18:19.260]  But, you know, I, I've been thinking long and hard about this and Trump is fighting with us.
[2:18:19.260 --> 2:18:26.860]  People seem to think he's going against us, you know, he's handing us everything that we need,
[2:18:26.860 --> 2:18:29.580]  that he needs us to help him with.
[2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:31.820]  So for example, look at the taxes.
[2:18:31.820 --> 2:18:32.620]  Look at what he's doing.
[2:18:32.620 --> 2:18:37.180]  He's giving us a $24,000 tax credit as married couple.
[2:18:37.180 --> 2:18:43.900]  Now, if you really think about it, with a tax credit that high as a married couple and people
[2:18:43.900 --> 2:18:50.460]  are making such low amounts of money, it's almost impossible to feed the beast when it comes to taxes.
[2:18:51.020 --> 2:18:57.900]  So here you are, you're making, you know, the minimum amount of $32,000 a year for the lower
[2:18:57.900 --> 2:18:58.620]  tax bracket.
[2:18:58.620 --> 2:19:05.740]  You're getting $24,000 tax credit, very minimal amount of money is going to the beast.
[2:19:05.740 --> 2:19:09.900]  To the beast, which is exactly what Trump has always done with his taxes.
[2:19:09.900 --> 2:19:12.700]  He goes out and he does such good for people.
[2:19:12.700 --> 2:19:15.180]  He gives people a place to live.
[2:19:15.180 --> 2:19:23.820]  He gives, he takes money from all these elite with his hotels and all these books so that
[2:19:23.820 --> 2:19:27.260]  we know the way he thinks and all this amazing things.
[2:19:27.260 --> 2:19:28.300]  And exactly.
[2:19:28.300 --> 2:19:29.020]  I'm going to hold you over.
[2:19:29.020 --> 2:19:29.820]  You're such a good caller.
[2:19:29.820 --> 2:19:30.940]  I want to pop in on this.
[2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.380]  He needs us to feel confident and power.
[2:19:34.380 --> 2:19:38.220]  He's promoting Americana, giving his confidence, moving to get the taxes cut,
[2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:41.420]  getting the small businesses going, saying we're a country again.
[2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:44.460]  That fundamentally is high noon to the globalist fan parks.
[2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:46.380]  So stay there, Beth, and then leave out next segment.
[2:19:46.380 --> 2:19:51.180]  You'll get in and we'll get to Michael, Eric, Victor, everybody straight ahead.
[2:19:51.180 --> 2:19:53.260]  And we've got so much more coming up today.
[2:19:53.260 --> 2:19:55.340]  There is so much, so much to get to.
[2:19:55.340 --> 2:19:59.100]  We've got that article about the elite banker, mainstream news,
[2:19:59.100 --> 2:20:01.180]  about the satanic sacrifices of children.
[2:20:01.180 --> 2:20:06.060]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers

[2:20:30.300 --> 2:20:32.220]  It's called the Deep State.
[2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:37.020]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[2:20:37.020 --> 2:20:41.100]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[2:20:41.100 --> 2:20:46.700]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[2:20:46.700 --> 2:20:52.380]  Newsmax, Lutobs, and Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere

[2:21:28.860 --> 2:21:31.180]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[2:21:34.140 --> 2:21:37.820]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:42.780]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad
[2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:44.700]  bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:21:44.700 --> 2:21:49.260]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[2:21:49.260 --> 2:21:52.140]  peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.

[2:24:20.220 --> 2:24:21.580]  So we got big news.
[2:24:21.580 --> 2:24:31.900]  Colbert, it's on drudgerport.com, red linked, has made a homophobic slur at President Trump.
[2:24:32.540 --> 2:24:36.940]  I don't think it's homophobic, but people have the right to be critical of whoever they want
[2:24:37.740 --> 2:24:41.420]  to sit there and call somebody a you know what sucker.
[2:24:42.620 --> 2:24:45.820]  I mean that's just a point of saying there's somebody that's subservient.
[2:24:45.820 --> 2:24:47.660]  Doesn't mean male or female.
[2:24:47.660 --> 2:24:51.820]  But he called Trump Vladimir Putin's
[2:24:55.580 --> 2:24:56.540]  bleep holster.
[2:24:57.180 --> 2:24:58.220]  Is Johnson holster?
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:24:59.260]  Is Johnson holster.
[2:25:00.060 --> 2:25:01.660]  So that's not anti-gay.
[2:25:01.660 --> 2:25:03.980]  He's saying he's serving him.
[2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:09.660]  Just like when I called Congressman Peter Schiff the same thing.
[2:25:10.220 --> 2:25:13.180]  It had nothing to do with gay people or heterosexual.
[2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:17.340]  It meant he was worshiping the New World Order.
[2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:19.420]  It means he's like saying you're a brown-noser.
[2:25:20.300 --> 2:25:20.940]  Okay.
[2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:22.380]  And I don't use these gross terms on air.
[2:25:22.380 --> 2:25:25.820]  It's mainly a family show.
[2:25:25.820 --> 2:25:28.380]  It's just that I'm not defending Colbert.
[2:25:28.380 --> 2:25:29.260]  He's lied about me.
[2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:29.900]  He's attacked me.
[2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:30.860]  He's done terrible things.
[2:25:31.580 --> 2:25:34.460]  But I love how they eat their own to have like you were saying earlier,
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:36.780]  this super extreme political correctness.
[2:25:36.780 --> 2:25:40.620]  That's funny to call the president on a comedy show.
[2:25:40.620 --> 2:25:42.860]  Vladimir Putin's weenie holster.
[2:25:42.860 --> 2:25:44.300]  I mean, I don't agree with it.
[2:25:44.300 --> 2:25:45.020]  It's not true.
[2:25:45.020 --> 2:25:47.260]  It's a load of bull, but he's got a right to say it.
[2:25:47.260 --> 2:25:50.140]  And it's not meant to be offensive on anybody except the president.
[2:25:50.140 --> 2:25:51.660]  And the president's a public figure.
[2:25:52.380 --> 2:25:57.820]  So grow up everybody about us and about Schiff and about Colbert.
[2:25:57.820 --> 2:26:00.140]  I mean, I was attacked all over the national news for that.
[2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:02.140]  My homophobic rant wasn't.
[2:26:02.140 --> 2:26:02.460]  Go ahead.
[2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:04.780]  Well, don't forget about the Jimmy Kimmel skit too,
[2:26:04.780 --> 2:26:06.940]  which I actually, I thought it was kind of funny,
[2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:09.020]  even though it was totally bogus and ludicrous.
[2:26:09.020 --> 2:26:11.260]  Here's my thought process on this now, Alex,
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:14.060]  because it has gotten to a point where it's so ridiculous.
[2:26:14.060 --> 2:26:16.780]  I just, I just say, wow, thank you guys.
[2:26:16.780 --> 2:26:17.900]  You guys are promoting us.
[2:26:17.900 --> 2:26:18.780]  Thank you so much.
[2:26:19.340 --> 2:26:21.740]  And I'll pretend to believe this, even though it's not true.
[2:26:22.060 --> 2:26:23.820]  They're actually fans of yours, Alex.
[2:26:23.820 --> 2:26:25.100]  They're actually fans of yours.
[2:26:25.100 --> 2:26:26.380]  They want people to know about you.
[2:26:26.380 --> 2:26:28.780]  They just can't, they just can't let people know that.
[2:26:28.780 --> 2:26:32.540]  So instead they attack you to draw attention instead of saying, wow,
[2:26:32.540 --> 2:26:33.500]  I really like Alex Jones.
[2:26:33.500 --> 2:26:33.980]  He's right.
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:35.420]  They attack you to draw attention.
[2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:37.740]  I know for a fact, that's the case with Kimmel,
[2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:39.100]  but I don't want to get him in trouble.
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:40.220]  I don't know about Colbert.
[2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.940]  I think Colbert has got to believe the stuff he's spewing, man.
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:44.140]  But that's what I'm saying.
[2:26:44.140 --> 2:26:46.620]  At the end of the day now, it's come to a point where
[2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:50.620]  your audience is only going to continue to grow because they're
[2:26:51.100 --> 2:26:54.060]  putting you into, they're injecting you into the stream
[2:26:54.060 --> 2:26:55.180]  where you didn't exist before.
[2:26:55.180 --> 2:26:55.660]  That's right.
[2:26:55.660 --> 2:26:57.020]  I'm getting to people in the matrix.
[2:26:57.020 --> 2:26:59.180]  They're trying to inoculate people in the matrix
[2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:00.860]  when they first hear about us, not listen to us,
[2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:02.540]  but instead it's sending more of them to us.
[2:27:02.540 --> 2:27:05.100]  So I wonder, what are they going to do as everything they do fails?
[2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:07.260]  Let's go back to Beth who was making great points about
[2:27:07.260 --> 2:27:10.540]  Trump needs us to get behind his agenda, not turn on him,
[2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:13.340]  because he's not delivering everything perfectly.
[2:27:13.340 --> 2:27:14.940]  This is not instant gratification.
[2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:17.100]  The globalist hate him more than ever.
[2:27:17.100 --> 2:27:18.460]  They won't run his ads.
[2:27:18.460 --> 2:27:19.660]  They're trying to impeach him.
[2:27:19.660 --> 2:27:21.100]  They're saying kill him.
[2:27:21.100 --> 2:27:23.500]  They hate him for a reason because they know
[2:27:23.500 --> 2:27:25.100]  he wants America to be great.
[2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:26.860]  Does it mean he's not a big strong man?
[2:27:26.860 --> 2:27:27.980]  Does it mean he doesn't have problems?
[2:27:27.980 --> 2:27:29.420]  I hate what he's doing with Russia and stuff.
[2:27:30.460 --> 2:27:31.100]  Go ahead, Beth.
[2:27:32.380 --> 2:27:33.580]  Yeah, Alex, I agree.
[2:27:33.580 --> 2:27:36.060]  You know, whatever's going on internationally,
[2:27:36.060 --> 2:27:38.780]  I do believe that there is an agenda behind it.
[2:27:38.780 --> 2:27:42.540]  You know, he did tell us when he, after the election
[2:27:42.540 --> 2:27:44.060]  and he went on air with you,
[2:27:44.940 --> 2:27:47.020]  he did tell us to give him a year.
[2:27:47.580 --> 2:27:51.420]  You know, there's a lot of doubt going on out there.
[2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:56.620]  The man has to play the game to not lose his life,
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:27:58.540]  and they don't want him to lose his life
[2:27:58.540 --> 2:28:00.860]  because that is going to start a civil war.
[2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:04.620]  And when the civil war starts, they know they have failed
[2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:06.060]  and we are going to kick their butts
[2:28:06.060 --> 2:28:07.180]  and we're going to take them all out.
[2:28:07.180 --> 2:28:08.300]  We're going to take our country back.
[2:28:08.300 --> 2:28:10.540]  You know, I'm glad that you bring that up the civil war thing
[2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:12.780]  because as Antifa continues to ramp up,
[2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:14.060]  now they're putting out videos of them.
[2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:15.820]  Apparently they've gotten their arms,
[2:28:15.820 --> 2:28:16.940]  their hands on some firearms,
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:18.460]  and they're learning how to shoot guns.
[2:28:18.460 --> 2:28:19.900]  They're going to bring in the police state.
[2:28:19.900 --> 2:28:21.980]  This is something that InfoWars covered at nauseam
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:23.580]  for years and years, how the police state,
[2:28:23.580 --> 2:28:24.620]  they want to bring this in.
[2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:25.820]  Now you've got the mayor of Baltimore
[2:28:25.820 --> 2:28:27.580]  calling for the federalization of the police there.
[2:28:27.580 --> 2:28:28.060]  They need the help.
[2:28:28.060 --> 2:28:28.620]  Exactly.
[2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:31.420]  They attack the police, they bring in a police state,
[2:28:31.420 --> 2:28:33.980]  then they federalize the police, put in their own people,
[2:28:33.980 --> 2:28:36.220]  and now the police state they help build is using against us.
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:37.980]  And then they get us to get behind it
[2:28:37.980 --> 2:28:39.980]  because they use the radical communists,
[2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:41.740]  the radical leftists out in the streets
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:42.780]  to actually promote violence.
[2:28:42.780 --> 2:28:44.700]  But here's the thing about Trump in the first year
[2:28:44.700 --> 2:28:46.460]  and his four years of presidency.
[2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:48.620]  We're in the first quarter right now.
[2:28:48.620 --> 2:28:50.460]  We've got a pretty good team, all right?
[2:28:50.460 --> 2:28:51.500]  If you've got a good team-
[2:28:51.500 --> 2:28:53.420]  He's already put three touchdowns on the board.
[2:28:53.420 --> 2:28:55.260]  Even if you're behind in the first quarter,
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:28:56.300]  you can still come back to win.
[2:28:56.300 --> 2:28:57.900]  But he's already ahead.
[2:28:57.900 --> 2:29:00.940]  I think that the problem right now is that
[2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:03.660]  we the people are looking for something else.
[2:29:03.660 --> 2:29:05.900]  We put so, we invested so much into the-
[2:29:05.900 --> 2:29:06.860]  He's not a God.
[2:29:06.860 --> 2:29:08.140]  And we've got Trump in.
[2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:10.220]  And now we're sitting here just expecting Trump to do everything.
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:10.700]  And he can't.
[2:29:10.700 --> 2:29:12.620]  He's got his hands tied on certain things.
[2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:13.500]  He's got other people-
[2:29:13.500 --> 2:29:14.860]  A total government rebellion.
[2:29:14.860 --> 2:29:17.660]  And but the key is he's doing a lot of great things.
[2:29:17.660 --> 2:29:19.900]  And we need to be critical when he's doing bad things,
[2:29:19.900 --> 2:29:21.260]  but we also need to be very, very supportive
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:22.140]  when he's doing good things.
[2:29:22.140 --> 2:29:22.780]  Thank you, Beth.
[2:29:22.780 --> 2:29:23.660]  Well, you're awesome.
[2:29:23.660 --> 2:29:24.460]  I'll give us your info.
[2:29:24.460 --> 2:29:26.460]  We're going to send you five shirts of your choice.
[2:29:26.460 --> 2:29:27.500]  So give us your email and number.
[2:29:27.500 --> 2:29:29.660]  I'm going to give it to Tim Prujaye and to Weldon Henson
[2:29:29.660 --> 2:29:30.780]  today to make sure that happens.
[2:29:30.780 --> 2:29:32.700]  We have to drain the swamp in 2018.
[2:29:32.700 --> 2:29:34.300]  That is the biggest thing we can do for Trump.
[2:29:34.300 --> 2:29:37.980]  Omar Navarro is paving the way right now in Maxine Waters District.
[2:29:37.980 --> 2:29:40.700]  Anybody who wants to win against Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi,
[2:29:40.700 --> 2:29:41.740]  look at Omar Navarro.
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:43.020]  He's paving the path.
[2:29:43.020 --> 2:29:43.900]  Absolutely.
[2:29:43.900 --> 2:29:45.740]  We need to take down these big globalists.
[2:29:45.740 --> 2:29:46.460]  Thank you, Beth.
[2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:46.700]  All right.
[2:29:46.700 --> 2:29:49.580]  We've got big news on the Satanic rituals and whistleblowers.
[2:29:50.300 --> 2:29:51.660]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.660 --> 2:29:52.860]  The empire's on the road.
[2:29:52.860 --> 2:29:53.420]  Straight ahead.
[2:29:54.140 --> 2:29:54.860]  Straight ahead.
[2:29:54.860 --> 2:29:55.420]  And then we've got-
[2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:56.140]  G-C-N radio.
[2:29:56.140 --> 2:29:58.460]  A Millie Weaver coming in on what she witnessed yesterday
[2:29:58.460 --> 2:29:59.660]  with the anti-fascism.
[2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:03.900]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[2:30:03.900 --> 2:30:08.460]  where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[2:30:08.460 --> 2:30:12.140]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties,
[2:30:12.140 --> 2:30:13.900]  or in his possessions.
[2:30:13.900 --> 2:30:17.260]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[2:30:17.260 --> 2:30:19.580]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[2:30:19.580 --> 2:30:22.220]  And how do we remove that power from Washington
[2:30:22.220 --> 2:30:25.020]  to our local communities to the individual?
[2:30:25.020 --> 2:30:26.780]  That is the ultimate concern.
[2:30:26.780 --> 2:30:29.260]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[2:30:29.260 --> 2:30:33.020]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[2:30:33.020 --> 2:30:35.500]  It was why the anti-federalists opposed the Constitution.
[2:30:35.500 --> 2:30:37.900]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution
[2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:39.740]  to abuse that concentration of power.
[2:30:39.740 --> 2:30:41.740]  But as James Madison also pointed out,
[2:30:41.740 --> 2:30:44.380]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[2:30:44.380 --> 2:30:46.460]  A people who mean to be their own governors
[2:30:46.460 --> 2:30:49.820]  must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[2:30:49.820 --> 2:30:52.620]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[2:30:52.620 --> 2:30:55.260]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[2:30:55.260 --> 2:30:58.940]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[2:30:58.940 --> 2:31:01.180]  Friend4wars.com, I'm David Knight.

[2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:29.100]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[2:31:29.100 --> 2:31:31.500]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system
[2:31:31.500 --> 2:31:33.260]  to DNA production and eyesight,
[2:31:33.260 --> 2:31:35.980]  bio-truth selenium is also the perfect supercharger
[2:31:35.980 --> 2:31:38.300]  to survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[2:31:38.300 --> 2:31:41.340]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[2:33:18.300 --> 2:33:20.540]  And now, Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.540 --> 2:33:23.420]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[2:33:23.420 --> 2:33:28.460]  The great Jimi Hendrix, bringing us in all along the Watchtower.
[2:33:28.460 --> 2:33:30.460]  Thank you very much.

[2:39:22.460 --> 2:39:24.460]  Thank you.
[2:39:52.460 --> 2:39:54.460]  Thank you.
[2:40:22.460 --> 2:40:24.460]  Thank you.
[2:40:52.460 --> 2:40:54.460]  Thank you.
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:24.460]  Thank you.
[2:41:52.460 --> 2:41:54.460]  Thank you.
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:24.460]  Thank you.
[2:42:52.460 --> 2:42:54.460]  Thank you.
[2:42:54.460 --> 2:43:22.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:22.460 --> 2:43:30.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:32.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:34.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:34.460 --> 2:43:36.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:40.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:40.460 --> 2:43:42.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.460]  Thank you.
[2:43:44.460 --> 2:43:45.780]  everything and telling people how to talk?
[2:43:45.780 --> 2:43:47.340]  No, no, no, that's where it comes from.
[2:43:47.340 --> 2:43:48.420]  Look how helpless this guy is.
[2:43:48.420 --> 2:43:50.220]  Do you see how a lot of this is out of ignorance in 90s?
[2:43:50.220 --> 2:43:53.060]  See how many terms can be reappropriated?
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:55.060]  Not when it's used by the same group, no.
[2:43:55.060 --> 2:43:55.900]  Yeah.
[2:43:55.900 --> 2:43:56.900]  Do you think these guys are Nazis?
[2:43:56.900 --> 2:43:58.780]  I don't see anybody wearing swastikas or anything.
[2:43:58.780 --> 2:44:00.980]  They're daily storming, man.
[2:44:00.980 --> 2:44:02.100]  One guy in a t-shirt.
[2:44:02.100 --> 2:44:04.100]  I see a bunch of people covering their faces
[2:44:04.100 --> 2:44:05.900]  saying they want a communist revolution.
[2:44:05.900 --> 2:44:07.900]  And a ban-free speech.
[2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:09.020]  It's about equality.
[2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:11.900]  Why are you more concerned with that than Nazis?
[2:44:11.900 --> 2:44:12.700]  We went to war.
[2:44:12.700 --> 2:44:13.700]  Nazis, Nazis.
[2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:15.420]  We went to World War II.
[2:44:15.420 --> 2:44:19.540]  And tons of Americans died to defeat the Nazis.
[2:44:19.540 --> 2:44:20.420]  And then you're just.
[2:44:20.420 --> 2:44:24.340]  And so obviously, the communist regime of Russia
[2:44:24.340 --> 2:44:26.460]  did have a part in taking down the Nazi regime.
[2:44:26.460 --> 2:44:27.940]  But why do you think there, you really
[2:44:27.940 --> 2:44:30.900]  think there's Nazis in America right now?
[2:44:30.900 --> 2:44:32.540]  And these people aren't really the Nazis
[2:44:32.540 --> 2:44:34.180]  that you're walking with.
[2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:35.140]  Those are the Nazis.
[2:44:35.140 --> 2:44:36.700]  Yeah, the ones that are covering their faces
[2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:38.300]  and beating people up, yes.
[2:44:38.300 --> 2:44:39.500]  Yeah, them around here.
[2:44:39.500 --> 2:44:40.260]  Them around here.
[2:44:40.260 --> 2:44:41.780]  You might have covered their faces except these people.
[2:44:41.780 --> 2:44:43.820]  Poor guy, he's the only guy that was a crib baby.
[2:44:43.820 --> 2:44:44.540]  I'm not being mean.
[2:44:44.540 --> 2:44:46.540]  I mean, I've learned they have shriveled brains.
[2:44:46.540 --> 2:44:47.420]  They weren't even love.
[2:44:47.420 --> 2:44:48.140]  I've talked to them.
[2:44:48.140 --> 2:44:50.300]  They were all like, yeah, you never knew my mom.
[2:44:50.300 --> 2:44:51.180]  I was in the war formation.
[2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:52.620]  I'm not putting war formation people down.
[2:44:52.620 --> 2:44:53.980]  It's just, that's what they, I'm telling you,
[2:44:53.980 --> 2:44:55.460]  these are unformed people.
[2:44:55.460 --> 2:44:56.380]  Yeah.
[2:44:56.380 --> 2:44:57.700]  I was like, no.
[2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:00.020]  That means everyone should have the exact same standard
[2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:02.620]  of living after.
[2:45:02.620 --> 2:45:03.420]  Like North Korea?
[2:45:03.420 --> 2:45:05.220]  It's going to work then.
[2:45:05.220 --> 2:45:06.620]  Who's going to do anything?
[2:45:06.620 --> 2:45:08.140]  Redistribution.
[2:45:08.140 --> 2:45:10.180]  Redistribution, big government.
[2:45:10.180 --> 2:45:11.460]  Big government can solve everything.
[2:45:11.460 --> 2:45:13.140]  You get big enough?
[2:45:13.140 --> 2:45:13.700]  Yeah.
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:14.820]  Don't talk to them.
[2:45:14.820 --> 2:45:15.380]  Yeah.
[2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:19.220]  Except for the people in the big government,
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:21.660]  they always end up getting more perks, more money.
[2:45:21.660 --> 2:45:24.260]  Every communist country like Cuba and North Korea
[2:45:24.260 --> 2:45:26.220]  have hereditary dictators.
[2:45:26.220 --> 2:45:26.660]  Yes.
[2:45:26.660 --> 2:45:28.340]  In Venezuela, they worship the state
[2:45:28.340 --> 2:45:29.620]  and everything is collapsing.
[2:45:29.620 --> 2:45:30.740]  When we show people our articles,
[2:45:30.740 --> 2:45:32.460]  gentrification is death.
[2:45:32.460 --> 2:45:34.500]  No food, no medicine, no respite.
[2:45:34.500 --> 2:45:36.180]  A starving boy's death in Venezuela.
[2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:39.060]  New York Times doesn't criticize communism.
[2:45:39.060 --> 2:45:41.860]  Starving Venezuelans dying for eating poisonous yucca
[2:45:41.860 --> 2:45:43.620]  sold in black market.
[2:45:43.620 --> 2:45:47.580]  Yes, the people of Venezuela are literally starving to death.
[2:45:47.580 --> 2:45:48.780]  We're living in the end time.
[2:45:48.780 --> 2:45:51.020]  Starving Venezuelans giving away children to survive.
[2:45:51.020 --> 2:45:54.340]  Our poorest people get all the food they want.
[2:45:54.340 --> 2:45:57.100]  Video, Cuba May Day mob attacks protesters waving
[2:45:57.100 --> 2:45:57.980]  American flag.
[2:45:57.980 --> 2:45:59.180]  Yeah, they want to ban free speech.
[2:45:59.180 --> 2:46:00.980]  We could probably roll some of that.
[2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:03.900]  Look at this, flipping off the small memorial
[2:46:03.900 --> 2:46:06.460]  for victims of communism in DC.
[2:46:06.460 --> 2:46:09.460]  Total scum, images of North Korea.
[2:46:09.460 --> 2:46:11.300]  Kim Jong-un doesn't want you to see
[2:46:11.300 --> 2:46:12.700]  haunting pictures inside North Korea
[2:46:12.700 --> 2:46:14.340]  taken by the photographer who has now
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:16.580]  been banned from the rogue state for life.
[2:46:16.580 --> 2:46:18.540]  You got to go look at those photos for yourself.
[2:46:18.540 --> 2:46:20.940]  You want to see what it's like to be a starving slave,
[2:46:20.940 --> 2:46:22.020]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2:46:22.020 --> 2:46:23.140]  OK, it just goes on.
[2:46:23.140 --> 2:46:25.260]  North Korea's Kim Jong-un is starving his people
[2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:26.900]  to pay for nuclear weapons.
[2:46:26.900 --> 2:46:28.540]  On and on and on.
[2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:31.460]  That's right, they had such bad famines in North Korea.
[2:46:31.460 --> 2:46:34.980]  And people want to leave so bad that literally they
[2:46:34.980 --> 2:46:38.140]  had to put a minefield all around the borders
[2:46:38.140 --> 2:46:40.420]  so that when people would try to escape,
[2:46:40.420 --> 2:46:42.820]  they have to risk running through a minefield.
[2:46:42.820 --> 2:46:46.100]  And they can't get to China because of the Yalu River.
[2:46:46.100 --> 2:46:47.700]  Just like in East Germany, they had
[2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:50.260]  to build a wall to keep the people in.
[2:46:50.260 --> 2:46:53.260]  But again, everybody knows that, except a bunch
[2:46:53.260 --> 2:46:56.540]  of spoiled rotten kids with government programs
[2:46:56.540 --> 2:46:58.260]  paying for their worthless educations,
[2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:00.820]  walking around wearing stuff capitalism built for them,
[2:47:00.820 --> 2:47:03.100]  where they can have thousands of different types of iPhone
[2:47:03.100 --> 2:47:07.300]  cases, or glasses, or prosthesis, or cars, or food.
[2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:08.740]  And literally, in communist countries,
[2:47:08.740 --> 2:47:10.620]  there's nothing idiot.
[2:47:10.620 --> 2:47:12.820]  Let's go to a phone call here.
[2:47:12.820 --> 2:47:14.740]  Levi, you've been holding like a trooper.
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:16.140]  That's why you get any T-shirt you
[2:47:16.140 --> 2:47:17.700]  wish from m4store.com.
[2:47:17.700 --> 2:47:19.220]  Get your name and address if you'd like.
[2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:22.180]  And we will send you that free shirt from m4store.com
[2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:23.300]  for holding more than an hour.
[2:47:23.300 --> 2:47:24.140]  Levi, you're a trooper.
[2:47:24.140 --> 2:47:26.460]  Go ahead.
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.220]  Yeah, thank you.
[2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:31.100]  I just wanted to start off by saying the products,
[2:47:31.100 --> 2:47:35.180]  caveman, super blue, super male vitality, amazing products.
[2:47:35.180 --> 2:47:35.540]  Thank you.
[2:47:35.540 --> 2:47:38.500]  Worked like a charm.
[2:47:38.500 --> 2:47:40.940]  My question would be a couple of weeks ago,
[2:47:40.940 --> 2:47:43.100]  you had Daniel Estolin on.
[2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:50.820]  And he had mentioned that some of his Bilderberg sources
[2:47:50.820 --> 2:47:54.700]  had said that the Rothschilds were backing Trump.
[2:47:54.700 --> 2:47:56.420]  And at first, they kind of felt like, well,
[2:47:56.420 --> 2:47:57.900]  well, that's kind of cool.
[2:47:57.900 --> 2:47:59.140]  The elites are backing him.
[2:47:59.140 --> 2:48:00.860]  But then I started to think, but are
[2:48:00.860 --> 2:48:04.420]  they backing him to fuel both sides of the war?
[2:48:04.420 --> 2:48:06.020]  Or are they co-op?
[2:48:06.020 --> 2:48:08.260]  Well, I would just say they're totally backing him.
[2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:10.380]  The Rothschilds are a big group.
[2:48:10.380 --> 2:48:12.140]  But clearly, Jared Kushner and others
[2:48:12.140 --> 2:48:14.460]  are connected into all that that's admitted.
[2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:18.060]  He's connected into, I mean, really, a mafia group
[2:48:18.060 --> 2:48:19.460]  that they're constantly getting indicted
[2:48:19.460 --> 2:48:20.820]  and going to prison for stuff.
[2:48:20.820 --> 2:48:22.780]  So I just think that's a small part of the overall Trump
[2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:23.260]  operation.
[2:48:23.260 --> 2:48:25.180]  Trump is trying to bring prosperity.
[2:48:25.180 --> 2:48:26.620]  The globalist wants austerity.
[2:48:26.620 --> 2:48:28.340]  He wants our country to be powerful.
[2:48:28.340 --> 2:48:30.300]  He wants our country to grab control of globalism
[2:48:30.300 --> 2:48:31.900]  and use it for Americana.
[2:48:31.900 --> 2:48:32.540]  Is that perfect?
[2:48:32.540 --> 2:48:34.740]  No, but it's better than globalism.
[2:48:34.740 --> 2:48:37.060]  And I'm supporting it because he wants prosperity
[2:48:37.060 --> 2:48:39.620]  for the general public and wants to be the king of that,
[2:48:39.620 --> 2:48:41.180]  not the king of slavery.
[2:48:41.180 --> 2:48:43.540]  But go ahead.
[2:48:43.540 --> 2:48:44.140]  Oh, yeah.
[2:48:44.140 --> 2:48:46.620]  And so I mean, I was just wondering
[2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:49.540]  if they were maybe funding both sides of the war, essentially,
[2:48:49.540 --> 2:48:50.740]  to come out on top.
[2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:52.780]  Sure, I mean, the Rothschilds have always done that
[2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:54.140]  and been involved in a lot of stuff.
[2:48:54.140 --> 2:48:56.260]  But I mean, you talk about the Rothschilds, Rothschilds
[2:48:56.260 --> 2:48:59.260]  own the Economist magazine.
[2:48:59.260 --> 2:49:02.220]  And they attacked Trump in that, in my self, mercilessly.
[2:49:02.220 --> 2:49:05.020]  So I'm not saying I totally agree with what, well, I mean,
[2:49:05.020 --> 2:49:06.020]  that's the smart guy.
[2:49:06.020 --> 2:49:07.460]  But I just don't take it, you know.
[2:49:07.460 --> 2:49:08.780]  And I don't take everything he says
[2:49:08.780 --> 2:49:10.700]  like it's from the word of God or anything.
[2:49:10.700 --> 2:49:12.260]  I think it's a more complex issue.
[2:49:12.260 --> 2:49:13.580]  There are a lot of elites that are actually
[2:49:13.580 --> 2:49:15.260]  getting behind Trump now that he's having success,
[2:49:15.260 --> 2:49:17.180]  saying maybe prosperity is the way to go,
[2:49:17.180 --> 2:49:18.420]  because the world population is not
[2:49:18.420 --> 2:49:20.740]  going to buy globalism and forced austerity
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:23.500]  and human extermination that Bill Nye, the science guy
[2:49:23.500 --> 2:49:24.620]  in Al Gore are pushing.
[2:49:24.620 --> 2:49:26.820]  What's really happening is globalism is failing.
[2:49:26.820 --> 2:49:28.700]  So a lot of the elites are rethinking it
[2:49:28.700 --> 2:49:32.420]  and maybe saying maybe we should go with Americana in 1776,
[2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:35.500]  but let's destroy Alex Jones, one of the flashpoints of it,
[2:49:35.500 --> 2:49:37.540]  because we don't want him part of any system
[2:49:37.540 --> 2:49:39.420]  to keep us honest into the future.
[2:49:39.420 --> 2:49:40.700]  They want to co-op things.
[2:49:40.700 --> 2:49:43.500]  I am a zealot for Renaissance and human empowerment.
[2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:45.180]  I believe in humanity.
[2:49:45.180 --> 2:49:49.620]  I don't believe we're pathetic and always going to be fallen.
[2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:50.980]  I believe we're rising.
[2:49:50.980 --> 2:49:51.820]  Thank you so much.
[2:49:51.820 --> 2:49:52.780]  Great points at Levi.
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:53.980]  Get his address and info.
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:56.140]  Send him a free shirt of his choice.
[2:49:56.140 --> 2:49:57.580]  Speaking of that, I'm going to come back
[2:49:57.580 --> 2:49:59.860]  and get to this clip of the banker.
[2:49:59.860 --> 2:50:02.300]  Claims he was involved and take part in child sacrifice.
[2:50:02.300 --> 2:50:05.620]  We'll do a few segments on that ahead of Watson coming.
[2:50:05.620 --> 2:50:08.060]  And we'll finish a few calls as well with Watson,
[2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:10.300]  because this is his article on infowars.com.
[2:50:10.300 --> 2:50:12.900]  But briefly, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste
[2:50:12.900 --> 2:50:14.580]  made to America by the biggest manufacturer
[2:50:14.580 --> 2:50:16.620]  of fluoride-free organic toothpaste.
[2:50:16.620 --> 2:50:18.900]  Private labels it for us with added iodine,
[2:50:18.900 --> 2:50:20.540]  colloidal silver, and tea tree oil.
[2:50:20.540 --> 2:50:22.420]  It's concentrated.
[2:50:22.420 --> 2:50:23.780]  My dad designed it and he's a dentist.
[2:50:23.780 --> 2:50:25.500]  He said, why have the fillers that most of them have?
[2:50:25.500 --> 2:50:26.460]  This doesn't have fillers.
[2:50:26.460 --> 2:50:28.100]  InfoWars are none of our products too.
[2:50:28.100 --> 2:50:28.940]  It's great.
[2:50:28.940 --> 2:50:29.780]  I love it.
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:30.940]  I absolutely love it.
[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:33.580]  I'm so glad I threw out my old toothpaste
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:35.540]  and I only use this stuff now.
[2:50:35.540 --> 2:50:37.700]  Well, it's more than 25% off right now

[2:50:46.900 --> 2:50:49.820]  53% off on the bone broth caveman ultimate paleo.
[2:50:49.820 --> 2:50:51.060]  It was supposed to go away today,
[2:50:51.060 --> 2:50:52.140]  but they didn't take it down.
[2:50:52.140 --> 2:50:52.980]  It's about to sell out.
[2:50:52.980 --> 2:50:53.820]  That's fine.
[2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:55.100]  But the special's still up there on that as well
[2:50:55.100 --> 2:50:56.300]  and that helps fund the operation.
[2:50:56.300 --> 2:50:58.100]  And we have a 30 hour broadcast.
[2:50:58.100 --> 2:51:00.100]  We kick off tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.

[2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:02.020]  After being sold out for months,

[2:52:06.140 --> 2:52:09.020]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week.
[2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:10.980]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.
[2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:13.500]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[2:52:13.500 --> 2:52:15.980]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[2:52:15.980 --> 2:52:18.020]  Research across the board is clear.
[2:52:18.020 --> 2:52:19.340]  In fact, it's certified.
[2:52:19.340 --> 2:52:21.060]  When bacteria infect your gums,
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:22.380]  it can enter your bloodstream.
[2:52:22.380 --> 2:52:24.460]  And if you contribute to blood clots and heart attacks,

[2:52:36.340 --> 2:52:37.900]  so the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:52:37.900 --> 2:52:40.500]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[2:52:40.500 --> 2:52:43.620]  used in biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria

[2:53:08.180 --> 2:53:09.700]  But the symptoms are there.
[2:53:09.700 --> 2:53:12.420]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[2:53:12.420 --> 2:53:14.660]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[2:53:14.660 --> 2:53:16.660]  are just a few of these that can alert you

[2:54:08.780 --> 2:54:12.700]  with him to finish your calls and cover his story.
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:15.380]  It's up on infowars.com right now.
[2:54:15.380 --> 2:54:18.540]  Ex-banker involved in global currency exchanges
[2:54:18.540 --> 2:54:19.660]  says he was invited to take part
[2:54:19.660 --> 2:54:21.220]  in child sacrifice rituals.
[2:54:21.220 --> 2:54:22.340]  He's very credible.
[2:54:22.340 --> 2:54:23.460]  He is who he says he is.
[2:54:23.460 --> 2:54:25.220]  It's in major newspapers in the Netherlands.

[2:54:29.300 --> 2:54:31.260]  He breaks down crying during it
[2:54:31.260 --> 2:54:33.980]  but it starts with a lot of hot women, drugs
[2:54:33.980 --> 2:54:37.540]  and it's, hey, pedophilia, then it's kill kids.
[2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:38.460]  These are animals.
[2:54:38.460 --> 2:54:40.540]  You've got to train yourself that they're animals.
[2:54:40.540 --> 2:54:42.740]  You've got to basically lose your soul to be part of this.
[2:54:42.740 --> 2:54:43.940]  You're a psychopath in training.
[2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:45.660]  This is everything we've told you.
[2:54:45.660 --> 2:54:47.140]  It's what's an eyes wide shut.
[2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:49.540]  It's what we've exposed, Millie Weaver.
[2:54:49.540 --> 2:54:51.260]  Yeah, it's pretty disturbing, Alex.
[2:54:51.260 --> 2:54:53.740]  And it actually fits a lot of what we did,
[2:54:53.740 --> 2:54:55.780]  this investigative report called
[2:54:55.780 --> 2:54:57.220]  the dark side of the occult
[2:54:57.220 --> 2:54:59.100]  and how we kind of really broke down
[2:54:59.100 --> 2:55:01.900]  into why they do these child sacrifices
[2:55:01.900 --> 2:55:05.140]  and how there are these ancient alchemical manuscripts
[2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:07.500]  that talk about drinking children's blood
[2:55:07.500 --> 2:55:10.620]  and that being basically the elixir of life,
[2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:12.860]  the philosopher's stone in the sense that
[2:55:12.860 --> 2:55:16.260]  they thought that they could achieve immortality
[2:55:16.260 --> 2:55:18.700]  and that they could maintain their youth and vigor.
[2:55:18.700 --> 2:55:21.500]  And if you actually look at it today, what do you see?
[2:55:21.500 --> 2:55:23.940]  We've actually seen that there are studies now
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:26.900]  where the elite can partake as the test subject
[2:55:26.900 --> 2:55:31.900]  and pay $8,000 to receive blood transfusion from babies.
[2:55:32.020 --> 2:55:33.660]  Yes, this is going on right now.
[2:55:33.660 --> 2:55:34.780]  That's mainstream news.
[2:55:34.780 --> 2:55:36.300]  I mean, that's the big field that Peter Thiel
[2:55:36.300 --> 2:55:38.780]  is talking about promoting and pushing,
[2:55:38.780 --> 2:55:40.700]  but doing it not from kids,
[2:55:40.700 --> 2:55:44.460]  but from other sources of younger folks that volunteer for it.
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:45.980]  But it is vampirism.
[2:55:45.980 --> 2:55:48.540]  Let's go ahead and roll a few minutes of this report
[2:55:48.540 --> 2:55:50.660]  up on infowars.com.
[2:55:50.660 --> 2:55:52.740]  This is Dutch banker.
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:54.860]  You can find out his name and more information
[2:55:54.860 --> 2:55:57.980]  on infowars.com, but here's Bernard.
[2:55:57.980 --> 2:56:00.140]  To put it carefully,
[2:56:00.140 --> 2:56:01.700]  most of these people followed
[2:56:01.700 --> 2:56:03.980]  a not very mainstream religion.
[2:56:03.980 --> 2:56:06.940]  So you have Catholics, Protestants,
[2:56:06.940 --> 2:56:09.340]  all sorts of religions.
[2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:13.220]  These people, most of them, were Luciferians.
[2:56:13.220 --> 2:56:16.980]  And then you can say religion is a fairy tale.
[2:56:16.980 --> 2:56:18.540]  God doesn't exist.
[2:56:18.540 --> 2:56:20.020]  None of that is real.
[2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:24.100]  Well, for these people, it is truth and reality.
[2:56:24.100 --> 2:56:26.220]  And they served something immaterial,
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:27.780]  what they called Lucifer.
[2:56:29.580 --> 2:56:32.660]  And I also was in contact with those circles.
[2:56:32.660 --> 2:56:36.500]  Only I laughed at it because to me they were just clients.
[2:56:36.500 --> 2:56:40.980]  So I went to places called churches of Satan.
[2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:43.780]  So now we are talking about Satanism.
[2:56:43.780 --> 2:56:44.780]  Yes.
[2:56:44.780 --> 2:56:49.660]  So I visited these churches just as a visitor dropped by.
[2:56:49.660 --> 2:56:51.620]  And then they were doing their holy mass
[2:56:51.620 --> 2:56:56.300]  with naked woman and liquor and stuff.
[2:56:56.300 --> 2:56:59.260]  And it just amused me.
[2:56:59.260 --> 2:57:01.980]  I didn't believe in any of this stuff
[2:57:01.980 --> 2:57:05.980]  and was far from convinced if any of this was real.
[2:57:05.980 --> 2:57:08.620]  It was just as spectacle to you.
[2:57:08.620 --> 2:57:09.620]  Yes.
[2:57:09.620 --> 2:57:11.980]  In my opinion, the darkness and evil
[2:57:11.980 --> 2:57:14.180]  is within the people themselves.
[2:57:14.180 --> 2:57:16.460]  I didn't make the connection yet.
[2:57:16.460 --> 2:57:18.380]  So I was a guest in those circles
[2:57:18.380 --> 2:57:21.860]  and it amused me greatly to see all those named women
[2:57:21.860 --> 2:57:22.700]  and the other things.
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:29.700]  It was the good life.
[2:57:29.700 --> 2:57:33.580]  But then at some point, I was invited,
[2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:35.700]  which is why I'm telling you all this,
[2:57:35.700 --> 2:57:38.700]  to participate in sacrifices abroad.
[2:57:47.700 --> 2:57:49.700]  And he breaks down.
[2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:53.700]  That was the breaking point.
[2:57:53.700 --> 2:57:55.700]  Wasn't funny anymore.
[2:57:55.700 --> 2:57:59.700]  Children.
[2:57:59.700 --> 2:58:03.700]  You were asked to do that?
[2:58:03.700 --> 2:58:04.700]  Yes.
[2:58:04.700 --> 2:58:06.700]  And I couldn't do that.
[2:58:10.700 --> 2:58:14.700]  Would you like to stop for a moment, by the way?
[2:58:14.700 --> 2:58:15.700]  No.
[2:58:15.700 --> 2:58:18.700]  And then I started to slowly break down.
[2:58:21.700 --> 2:58:24.700]  At a con, I was asked to do that.
[2:58:24.700 --> 2:58:28.700]  At a con, I lived through quite a lot as a child myself
[2:58:28.700 --> 2:58:32.700]  and this really touched me deeply.
[2:58:32.700 --> 2:58:33.700]  All right.
[2:58:33.700 --> 2:58:34.700]  We're going to be back.
[2:58:34.700 --> 2:58:35.700]  Everything changed.
[2:58:35.700 --> 2:58:38.700]  With the fourth hour, do you have a soul?
[2:58:38.700 --> 2:58:41.700]  It's not too late to resist this force.
[2:58:41.700 --> 2:58:43.700]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[2:58:43.700 --> 2:58:45.700]  Paul Watson, myself and Millie Wheeler.
[2:58:45.700 --> 2:58:46.700]  Spread the word.
[2:58:46.700 --> 2:58:47.700]  We're resisting.
[2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:55.700]  We're fighting back.
[2:59:17.700 --> 2:59:19.700]  We're fighting back.
[2:59:19.700 --> 2:59:48.700]  We're fighting back.
[2:59:48.700 --> 2:59:50.700]  A total 360 win.
[2:59:50.700 --> 3:00:18.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:18.700 --> 3:00:23.700]  Yali Weber.
[3:00:23.700 --> 3:00:25.700]  You grew up in Los Angeles.
[3:00:25.700 --> 3:00:28.700]  You could tell me about your sister getting sucked into
[3:00:28.700 --> 3:00:31.700]  some of this less or magic desecration of Christ
[3:00:31.700 --> 3:00:32.700]  stuff that she witnessed.
[3:00:32.700 --> 3:00:34.700]  I grew up in a very wealthy area and it was just
[3:00:34.700 --> 3:00:37.700]  prolific satanism by billionaires and folks and this
[3:00:37.700 --> 3:00:39.700]  were very beautiful women.
[3:00:39.700 --> 3:00:42.700]  People with helicopter pads at their houses.
[3:00:42.700 --> 3:00:43.700]  You name it.
[3:00:43.700 --> 3:00:48.700]  And I got sucked into it three, four times and I would not be part of it.
[3:00:48.700 --> 3:00:51.700]  And then all hell would break loose.
[3:00:51.700 --> 3:00:55.700]  And then I kind of brushed into some of it in Hollywood, but it's just prolific.
[3:00:55.700 --> 3:00:58.700]  And they're testing to see if you're evil if you have no soul.
[3:00:58.700 --> 3:01:00.700]  But you were going to speak to that.
[3:01:00.700 --> 3:01:05.700]  Yeah, well, my sister described it to me because she went there thinking that she was going to go to her friend's church.
[3:01:05.700 --> 3:01:09.700]  And little did she know that their church was something really disgusting.
[3:01:09.700 --> 3:01:17.700]  And so she went there and the way she described it was, she just said it looked like a bunch of weird, dweeby nerds there all dressed in black.
[3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:21.700]  And they, it looked like a Catholic, somewhat like a Catholic church setup.
[3:01:21.700 --> 3:01:28.700]  But instead they had a big fat naked woman dancing around trying to seduce a guy dressed up like Jesus.
[3:01:28.700 --> 3:01:31.700]  And then she ended up like seducing him and kissing him.
[3:01:31.700 --> 3:01:35.700]  And then they all took like a mask to it, like how you would see it like a Catholic.
[3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:37.700]  Which is low level blasphemy.
[3:01:37.700 --> 3:01:39.700]  And she said she didn't take the mask.
[3:01:39.700 --> 3:01:44.700]  She was really freaked out and she, you know, never went to anything like that ever again.
[3:01:44.700 --> 3:01:46.700]  Well, that was just a nerd group.
[3:01:46.700 --> 3:01:49.700]  But you were telling me you personally though ran into some other stuff too.
[3:01:49.700 --> 3:01:51.700]  Yeah, you know, there's all kinds of stuff.
[3:01:51.700 --> 3:02:00.700]  I mean, I've had, I've heard and had people tell me about blood drinking parties where you can hire blood prostitutes.
[3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:03.700]  Oh, hell, they have that in the New York Times and say it's super trendy.
[3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:05.700]  Yeah, they, they, oh my God, it's a trendy.
[3:02:05.700 --> 3:02:14.700]  They have blood prostitutes and they're basically people that their blood's clean and that they will basically be like here, hook me up.
[3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:16.700]  You know, and they get paid to give people their blood.
[3:02:16.700 --> 3:02:20.700]  And these old guys all sit around and drink these young women's blood.
[3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:22.700]  Usually it's usually women, but I don't know.
[3:02:22.700 --> 3:02:24.700]  It's all about selfishness.
[3:02:24.700 --> 3:02:31.700]  Yeah, it's, it's sucking the life energy out of the youth, out of the young people and stealing it for your own.
[3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:32.700]  It's really selfish.
[3:02:32.700 --> 3:02:34.700]  Good luck with that.
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:37.700]  And you know, it's true life energies by laying yourself down.
[3:02:37.700 --> 3:02:39.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:02:39.700 --> 3:02:40.700]  Self-sacrifice.
[3:02:40.700 --> 3:02:47.700]  That's what we learned from, from Jesus was self, you know, self-sacrifice, not stealing from others and stealing their life force.
[3:02:47.700 --> 3:02:54.700]  And that's what we've seen with these abortion clinics where you've seen these fetuses being harvest for stem cells.
[3:02:54.700 --> 3:02:57.700]  And they're also put into pills for rich women to eat them.
[3:02:57.700 --> 3:03:02.700]  I mean, there's every level of this or that the Pepsi flavor testing systems is made out of fetal tissue.
[3:03:02.700 --> 3:03:08.700]  I mean, this is, this is turning us into a commodity heating the hospitals with babies, bodies.
[3:03:08.700 --> 3:03:10.700]  And remember, we told you this before it was in the news.
[3:03:10.700 --> 3:03:13.700]  Now it's all out in the news and it's like funny people think.
[3:03:13.700 --> 3:03:14.700]  Yes.
[3:03:14.700 --> 3:03:15.700]  And it's not new.
[3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:17.700]  The elite have been doing this for centuries.
[3:03:17.700 --> 3:03:25.700]  And the ultimate Satanism is warping our genetics, turning us into a new species and abomination, a new alien life form, which the elite believe they're doing.
[3:03:25.700 --> 3:03:26.700]  I don't believe that.
[3:03:26.700 --> 3:03:30.700]  Now Ridley Scott comes out four years after I told you, Prometheus is what he really believes.
[3:03:30.700 --> 3:03:35.700]  It's the elite highest level of Illuminati religion is they believe that they're actually fallen ones.
[3:03:35.700 --> 3:03:36.700]  Their genetics are pure.
[3:03:36.700 --> 3:03:38.700]  All the rest of ours aren't.
[3:03:38.700 --> 3:03:39.700]  We need to be exterminated.
[3:03:39.700 --> 3:03:41.700]  It's the opposite of the Noah story that we have the good genetics.
[3:03:41.700 --> 3:03:42.700]  We're not evil.
[3:03:42.700 --> 3:03:45.700]  It's the psychopaths trying to inbreed to make the super humans.
[3:03:45.700 --> 3:03:46.700]  There it is.
[3:03:46.700 --> 3:03:48.700]  Aliens are real and we'll just probably destroy it.
[3:03:48.700 --> 3:03:50.700]  It says director Ridley Scott.
[3:03:50.700 --> 3:03:52.700]  Now I told people four years ago, that's his secret belief.
[3:03:52.700 --> 3:03:56.700]  So I was told by that, by that, by people that work with it.
[3:03:56.700 --> 3:03:59.700]  It's all secretive to the guys in a space cult.
[3:03:59.700 --> 3:04:05.700]  Well, you know, if you want to check out more guys, Google this, Alex Jones, the elite are a space cult.
[3:04:05.700 --> 3:04:09.700]  Or Lucifer wants the elite to build a spaceship to escape Earth.
[3:04:09.700 --> 3:04:12.700]  All these attacks on me, I'm telling you what they really believe.
[3:04:12.700 --> 3:04:13.700]  I don't believe it.
[3:04:13.700 --> 3:04:14.700]  Sorry.
[3:04:14.700 --> 3:04:15.700]  Go ahead.
[3:04:15.700 --> 3:04:16.700]  Yeah.
[3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:20.700]  No, the crazy part, which even this guy here talks about this ex banker, they believe it to them.
[3:04:20.700 --> 3:04:21.700]  It's real.
[3:04:21.700 --> 3:04:28.700]  So to those of you who are, you know, atheists or whatever out there and you're like, well, this is just all silly because I don't believe in any of it.
[3:04:28.700 --> 3:04:29.700]  Right.
[3:04:29.700 --> 3:04:30.700]  Well, they believe it.
[3:04:30.700 --> 3:04:31.700]  And to them, it's real.
[3:04:31.700 --> 3:04:32.700]  Yeah.
[3:04:32.700 --> 3:04:35.700]  I mean, I mean, there are people in New Guinea that are headhunters and want to eat your liver.
[3:04:35.700 --> 3:04:36.700]  You say, well, I don't believe in headhunters.
[3:04:36.700 --> 3:04:37.700]  They believe in you.
[3:04:37.700 --> 3:04:38.700]  Yeah.
[3:04:38.700 --> 3:04:40.700]  It's like, oh, the devil doesn't exist.
[3:04:40.700 --> 3:04:41.700]  Okay.
[3:04:41.700 --> 3:04:47.700]  There are people that manifest that archetype that want to kidnap your kid, torture them with their own personal enjoyment.
[3:04:47.700 --> 3:04:50.700]  And to us, it's horrible thinking of a kid begging for mommy or daddy.
[3:04:50.700 --> 3:04:51.700]  They call it music.
[3:04:51.700 --> 3:04:57.700]  They just, oh, they sit in the dungeons and just hear them beg and it makes them feel so good because they're demons.
[3:04:57.700 --> 3:04:59.700]  We'll be back with Paul Watson.
[3:05:27.700 --> 3:05:33.700]  To tell you all that they mean, the unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[3:05:33.700 --> 3:05:45.700]  Every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:47.700]  But these are some of the things they do.
[3:05:47.700 --> 3:05:49.700]  They build your basic character.
[3:05:49.700 --> 3:05:53.700]  They mold you for the future roles as a custodian of the nation's defense.
[3:05:53.700 --> 3:05:58.700]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.
[3:05:58.700 --> 3:06:23.700]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:30.700]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[3:06:30.700 --> 3:06:34.700]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[3:06:34.700 --> 3:06:44.700]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[3:06:44.700 --> 3:06:47.700]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:06:47.700 --> 3:06:55.700]  I know a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[3:06:55.700 --> 3:07:18.700]  You're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infowarslife.com today.
[3:07:18.700 --> 3:07:27.700]  If you ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[3:07:27.700 --> 3:07:35.700]  I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[3:07:35.700 --> 3:07:42.700]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[3:07:42.700 --> 3:07:45.700]  So obviously a superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[3:07:45.700 --> 3:07:55.700]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[3:07:55.700 --> 3:08:01.700]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win win infowarslife.com.
[3:08:01.700 --> 3:08:18.700]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:23.700]  We're doing a 30 hour broadcast that kicks off tomorrow. Paul can't do it.
[3:08:23.700 --> 3:08:31.700]  I don't know if I can tell you why, but let's just say the evacuation of Europe has begun from the Islamic invasion.
[3:08:31.700 --> 3:08:42.700]  We joke about it, but Paris continues to burn. It has gotten so crazy. Paul is supposed to host this hour, but I swore to go to Michael and Eric and Victor and Dominique before Paul takes over.
[3:08:42.700 --> 3:08:48.700]  But Paul, I'm hosting with myself and Millie Weaver right now. You've got the big story on infowars.com. He's in major newspapers.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:55.700]  He is who he says a big currency banker. This is how the elites do it. And he says it was a sacrifice of children and he couldn't be part of it.
[3:08:55.700 --> 3:09:02.700]  This is amazing. So you're going to play that clip and go over that. This is a big story. Paul is on infowars.com.
[3:09:02.700 --> 3:09:06.700]  It's a huge story, Alex, and it's got no mainstream media coverage whatsoever.
[3:09:06.700 --> 3:09:12.700]  Imagine my shock despite the fact that it's been knocking around for about a week now or more.
[3:09:12.700 --> 3:09:22.700]  You've got quite a lot of views on YouTube, but again, no mainstream media coverage. Look into the background of this guy. There's a profile of him in a major Dutch mainstream publication.
[3:09:22.700 --> 3:09:27.700]  So he is who he says he is. He is a banker. He's a former entrepreneur, successful businessman.
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:29.700]  He comes off as very credible.
[3:09:29.700 --> 3:09:34.700]  Exactly. If you read one of the quotes towards the end, he actually sounds like you.
[3:09:34.700 --> 3:09:43.700]  Directly. One of his quotes is like these people absolutely hate humans. They want to destroy us. He sounds like Alex Jones at the end of it.
[3:09:43.700 --> 3:09:49.700]  Well, that's the thing. These globalists act like they're aliens. They think they're channeling aliens. I don't know if it's true or not.
[3:09:49.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  Ridley Scott has come out and said this now because I've been involved in Hollywood. I've been involved in some of the elites trying to recruit me.
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:10:02.700]  It's the same deal. They go, the public aren't humans. You're a human. Get in with this. It'll advance your consciousness.
[3:10:02.700 --> 3:10:08.700]  But you've got to learn their animals. You've got to learn to do bad things. And then you'll be strong. It's like in Revenge of the Sith.
[3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:15.700]  Palpatine says, go kill all the baby jet eyes and then only then you'll be powerful enough. That's what they actually teach. It's black magic.
[3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:20.700]  And it's everywhere it goes on. It's happening, Paul.
[3:10:20.700 --> 3:10:27.700]  No, every time they investigate ritual abuse of children, it always leads back to the elites. I made a 14 minute video on it.
[3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:33.700]  Note that the media never talked about that. They didn't touch it, but they'll bang on about pizza gate all day.
[3:10:33.700 --> 3:10:44.700]  In that video, I documented all the examples, admitted court cases, people convicted in Portugal, France, Spain, United Kingdom, all these other countries where it's on the record.
[3:10:44.700 --> 3:10:48.700]  This is the quote where he sounds exactly like you.
[3:10:48.700 --> 3:10:57.700]  So the people who do not, the people do underestimate the severity of this because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts.
[3:10:57.700 --> 3:11:06.700]  It hates creation. It hates life. And it will do anything to destroy us completely. And the way to do that is to divide humanity, divide and conquer is their truth.
[3:11:06.700 --> 3:11:14.700]  So he's talking about the culprits behind this child abuse, absolutely despised humanity. That's why they have no sympathy.
[3:11:14.700 --> 3:11:23.700]  They have no remorse. And that's how psychologically they can get away with it without going through the terror of all the remorse that any normal person would go through.
[3:11:23.700 --> 3:11:32.700]  Let me read this quote again. This is one of the most important articles you've ever written. The people who do not underestimate the severity of this are but a few.
[3:11:32.700 --> 3:11:39.700]  Because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts. It hates creation. It hates life. And it will do nothing.
[3:11:39.700 --> 3:11:48.700]  It will do anything to destroy us completely. And the way to do this is to divide humanity, divide and conquer is their truth. He added.
[3:11:48.700 --> 3:11:57.700]  Now I butchered that and it's so important. I'm going to read it again. The people who do not underestimate the severity of this are but few.
[3:11:57.700 --> 3:12:07.700]  Because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts. It hates creation. It hates life. And it will do anything to destroy us completely.
[3:12:07.700 --> 3:12:14.700]  And the way to do that is to divide humanity, divide and conquer is their truth. He added. This is amazing. And we know this goes on.
[3:12:14.700 --> 3:12:22.700]  In fact, in the Netherlands, that's where they've caught the psychopaths with the whole dungeons full of kids to the elites and always get shut down. Paul.
[3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:31.700]  I remember Jimmy Savile over in the UK, a big children's entertainer close links with the royal family and the elite for decades and decades.
[3:12:31.700 --> 3:12:39.700]  It was only after his death, despite the fact that people were talking about it back in the seventies, that his rampant pedophilia came out.
[3:12:39.700 --> 3:12:52.700]  And of course, he was involved, according to reports, made by the victims in child abuse, satanic ceremonies. They didn't kill children in those ceremonies, but they tied them up, raped them, engaged in a cult chance.
[3:12:52.700 --> 3:13:01.700]  He was surrounded by people who were more powerful than him in that ceremony. So we know they're into this. This is not a conspiracy theory.
[3:13:01.700 --> 3:13:14.700]  Every single major pedophile bust leads back to judges, top police officers, celebrities, politicians, people in academia. Every single time we've documented it, it's on the record.
[3:13:14.700 --> 3:13:21.700]  It's in the video embedded at the end of this article, which the media then touch, even though they attack you on everything else.
[3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:27.700]  That's right. And that's why they're coming after us as they know we've got their number. They were unable to recruit me and many others.
[3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:32.700]  Paul Everly asked this. I know you've been invited to a lot of elite parties and hung out with some of the most powerful people in the media.
[3:13:32.700 --> 3:13:36.700]  But have you had anybody try to get you into weird stuff yet?
[3:13:36.700 --> 3:13:44.700]  No, there was some Scientology thing that they approached me, but that was years ago. It wasn't anything weird, but it was just Scientologists trying to recruit people.
[3:13:44.700 --> 3:13:52.700]  And people tell me that if you mess with Scientologists, then they definitely mess with you back. So I'm not getting involved in any of that.
[3:13:52.700 --> 3:13:59.700]  It's well known in London that all the rich Saudi Muslims come over and have gay orgies. That's an open secret.
[3:13:59.700 --> 3:14:03.700]  Not that I attend gay orgies, but I've heard it on The Great Rock Star.
[3:14:03.700 --> 3:14:09.700]  I was out there once with a rock star and there was a bunch of people there and it was like one of the most famous record executives ever.
[3:14:09.700 --> 3:14:17.700]  It was like the major newspapers were like the most beautiful wife you could imagine. And then he's sitting there with his Saudi prince who was in normal American-sized clothes.
[3:14:17.700 --> 3:14:25.700]  And I don't think I'm very that good looking. You talk about a joke. And the guy goes, I got a jumbo jet. Fly around the world with me. Let's go have a good time.
[3:14:25.700 --> 3:14:31.700]  And I'm like, no. And then I'm walking out of the restaurant and the rock star, they're like, hey, come to us with this hotel party with all these women.
[3:14:31.700 --> 3:14:36.700]  And I'm like, no, I'm married anyways. And the rock star goes, yeah, I'm going home. I'm going to sleep. Do not go with them.
[3:14:36.700 --> 3:14:41.700]  No kidding. But I mean, it is just totally rampant. But for these rich guys, it was just a joke.
[3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:46.700]  Let's go see if we can have women lure Alex over here, you know, you know, be part of some party. I was like, no, no, thanks.
[3:14:46.700 --> 3:14:48.700]  But that's how quick this happens.
[3:14:48.700 --> 3:14:51.700]  That's right. And it's completely all over Hollywood too.
[3:14:51.700 --> 3:14:57.700]  During the research for this occult little investigative report we put together, we actually found...
[3:14:57.700 --> 3:14:58.700]  Wasn't little. It was big.
[3:14:58.700 --> 3:14:59.700]  Yeah, it was pretty big.
[3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:09.700]  Okay. James Franco, for example, helped produce a little mini film with Kenneth Anger, who is a big open occultist Aleister Crowley follower.
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:15.700]  And so, I mean, we also saw the Maria Abramovic who pals around with all these celebrities.
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:16.700]  Spirit cooking.
[3:15:16.700 --> 3:15:22.700]  Exactly. And we even have seen photo shoots with, what is it? One of those Kim Kardashian girls.
[3:15:22.700 --> 3:15:28.700]  I think it was Kendall Jenner doing a photo shoot in a Maria Abramovic style performance.
[3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:32.700]  Look at all the Hollywood stuff in the Grammys and Emmys. It's just everywhere.
[3:15:32.700 --> 3:15:37.700]  It is. And you know, what they're doing in these performance arts, it's like Luciferian light.
[3:15:37.700 --> 3:15:39.700]  They're testing their willpower in the sense that...
[3:15:39.700 --> 3:15:41.700]  They're conditioning people.
[3:15:41.700 --> 3:15:45.700]  Can they lay there and let anyone do anything to them? Do they have the willpower?
[3:15:45.700 --> 3:15:48.700]  And to them, do with that will is the law of the land.
[3:15:48.700 --> 3:15:54.700]  So that's why they do these grotesque rituals. They eat human feces. They drink urine.
[3:15:54.700 --> 3:15:56.700]  It's about the exercise of raw power.
[3:15:56.700 --> 3:16:02.700]  That's right. And to them, that's their strength. And that's why that guy was talking about training to be a psychopath.
[3:16:02.700 --> 3:16:07.700]  Because of them, if they can block out all sympathy, all human emotion and just do anything...
[3:16:07.700 --> 3:16:12.700]  And that's what the modern environmentalism is. Hate yourself. Al Gore and Bill Nye will save you.
[3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:15.700]  Don't have kids. Die. Commit suicide for the earth, for the elite.
[3:16:15.700 --> 3:16:18.700]  Kill yourself. Kill yourself. Kill yourself. Kill yourself.
[3:16:18.700 --> 3:16:22.700]  It's inverting our life force and saying, we're not going to space. We're killing the space program.
[3:16:22.700 --> 3:16:26.700]  Notice Trump's bringing it back. That's why they hate Trump because he's not a Satanist.
[3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:30.700]  Donald Trump. Not a Satanist. Donald Trump doesn't want you poor empathetic.
[3:16:30.700 --> 3:16:34.700]  I promise to take a few calls here, Paul. We're going to skip this break so we have more time.
[3:16:34.700 --> 3:16:38.700]  Let's go ahead and go to Michael in Texas. You're on the air worldwide.
[3:16:38.700 --> 3:16:41.700]  You held over an hour. You get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[3:16:41.700 --> 3:16:45.700]  John Harmon's got a lot of work to do sending us your name and address and what you want.
[3:16:45.700 --> 3:16:51.700]  But every time I do that now, people get a free shirt from infoworkstore.com. Michael, go ahead.
[3:16:51.700 --> 3:16:55.700]  It's Michelle. Michelle, I'm sorry. I can't read the board.
[3:16:55.700 --> 3:16:58.700]  It's okay. Hi, Alex. Hi, Millie. Hi, Paul. Hi.
[3:16:58.700 --> 3:17:03.700]  Hi, Wayne and Justin. My question is fully off topic.
[3:17:03.700 --> 3:17:11.700]  I read on today Trump's agenda that he was taking a phone call from Putin and I wanted your thoughts on that.
[3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:17.700]  Putin and Trump need to be meeting earlier, but they've so intimidated Trump administration to not meet with him.
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:22.700]  He's an agent. He should trump that whole thing, Trump intended, pun intended, and just get it out in the open and say,
[3:17:22.700 --> 3:17:26.700]  so what? They're becoming more Americana than we are. We don't need war with Russia.
[3:17:26.700 --> 3:17:29.700]  We need to do trade deals with them, but the globalists don't want that.
[3:17:29.700 --> 3:17:31.700]  So that's my thought. Paul, Millie.
[3:17:31.700 --> 3:17:35.700]  Well, Trump just recently met with China. It's called diplomacy.
[3:17:35.700 --> 3:17:42.700]  Exactly. And the president leads one of the branches of the government that's supposed to meet with people. Paul Watson.
[3:17:42.700 --> 3:17:47.700]  Well, Obama met with Medvedev. Hillary Clinton met Vladimir Putin.
[3:17:47.700 --> 3:17:50.700]  It doesn't mean he's conspiring with Russia if he talks to people.
[3:17:50.700 --> 3:17:54.700]  The thing that concerns me is this New York Times thing today about Ivanka Trump,
[3:17:54.700 --> 3:18:01.700]  where it says she's literally like reading and checking off on executive orders before they get passed.
[3:18:01.700 --> 3:18:06.700]  She's basically embedded herself deep in the administration, despite the fact she has no cabinet position.
[3:18:06.700 --> 3:18:08.700]  It's like she's the vice president now.
[3:18:08.700 --> 3:18:14.700]  They're calling it Javonka, Jared Kushner, who by the way, has now got business dealings with George Soros.
[3:18:14.700 --> 3:18:20.700]  It's just come out. Javonka and Ivanka, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump now literally just crafting policy.
[3:18:20.700 --> 3:18:24.700]  We know Ivanka is a globalist. She's hanging around with Lagarde and Angela Merkel.
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:32.700]  She's pushing mass refugee programs that have destroyed societies in European countries or in the process of doing so.
[3:18:32.700 --> 3:18:36.700]  That's concerning. Nobody voted for Ivanka Trump.
[3:18:36.700 --> 3:18:39.700]  Or Javonka, for that matter, for Jared Kushner.
[3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:45.700]  And if you expand on that, there's 666 building and all the failures he's involved in.
[3:18:45.700 --> 3:18:47.700]  It's about her West Wing agenda.
[3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:54.700]  I mean, look at her right there. It's almost like she's got her dad under her control or something. This is weird.
[3:18:54.700 --> 3:18:59.700]  Well, the thing that concerns me is that she has differing beliefs regarding climate change,
[3:18:59.700 --> 3:19:09.700]  regarding the whole green energy movement, whereas Trump ran on the fact that he was going to bring back the coal industry.
[3:19:09.700 --> 3:19:13.700]  Exactly. And look, if his daughter wants to have those other views, that's her issue.
[3:19:13.700 --> 3:19:18.700]  But that's not who we voted for.
[3:19:18.700 --> 3:19:22.700]  Okay, thank you so much. Michelle, anything else?
[3:19:22.700 --> 3:19:30.700]  Yeah, it also came to light that Jared Kushner did not disclose some business ties he had with Russia and he needs to go now.
[3:19:30.700 --> 3:19:37.700]  Russia and China, absolutely. Little Kushner needs to sprout some wings and fly away like a happy little creature.
[3:19:37.700 --> 3:19:40.700]  Back to, I guess, prison where his daddy's at or everybody else.
[3:19:40.700 --> 3:19:46.700]  Let's talk to Eric in California. You're on the air. Eric, go ahead.
[3:19:46.700 --> 3:19:47.700]  Hi, this is Eric.
[3:19:47.700 --> 3:19:49.700]  I can't get any names right today.
[3:19:49.700 --> 3:19:54.700]  My eyes are going out. Erica, Erica, Erica, what a beautiful name. Go ahead.
[3:19:54.700 --> 3:19:59.700]  Thank you so much. And it is such an honor to be talking to you and everybody over there.
[3:19:59.700 --> 3:20:05.700]  Info wars, I have to say, I'm so excited. I can't even believe I'm talking to you right now.
[3:20:05.700 --> 3:20:09.700]  And I just thank you guys so much and everybody there for the hard work that you guys are doing.
[3:20:09.700 --> 3:20:13.700]  You broke me out of the matrix. It's so clear what's going on to me now.
[3:20:13.700 --> 3:20:19.700]  And I, you know, out here in Bakersfield, California, we're a very conservative town surrounded by liberals.
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:26.700]  And it's so hard to speak out when I talk to people about things going on like controls. They look at me like I'm crazy.
[3:20:26.700 --> 3:20:30.700]  I don't even know who to talk to. I kind of feel alone out here sometimes.
[3:20:30.700 --> 3:20:33.700]  But for the most part, Bakersfield is very conservative.
[3:20:33.700 --> 3:20:37.700]  Well, I'm glad you raised that because I've been meaning for Rob doing others and myself to do it.
[3:20:37.700 --> 3:20:42.700]  I've never seen the lack of aerosol spraying and geoengineering since Trump got in.
[3:20:42.700 --> 3:20:45.700]  I mean, because it's been going on for almost 20 years.
[3:20:45.700 --> 3:20:48.700]  It's a secret geoengineering program, part of its public.
[3:20:48.700 --> 3:20:55.700]  Anybody can Google geoengineering, Council on Foreign Relations, geoengineering Bill Gates, geoengineering, energy department.
[3:20:55.700 --> 3:21:03.700]  It's going on manipulating our atmosphere with barium, salts, aluminum dioxide and stuff added to jet fuel and also radioactive isotopes.
[3:21:03.700 --> 3:21:09.700]  What's amazing is that I've never seen this many blue skies since like 1992.
[3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:14.700]  On these days now in Texas, total blue skies since Trump got elected.
[3:21:14.700 --> 3:21:19.700]  And the question is, have they killed the geoengineering program that was Lord knows what?
[3:21:19.700 --> 3:21:22.700]  Keep going, ma'am. I'm going to get Paul Watson to take on that.
[3:21:22.700 --> 3:21:27.700]  Okay. No, it's happening every day out here, every day.
[3:21:27.700 --> 3:21:31.700]  You open my eyes to it. And when I first heard about it and I start, I'm very observant.
[3:21:31.700 --> 3:21:37.700]  I have a degree in psychology. I'm a stay-at-home mom now of two and it kills me anymore.
[3:21:37.700 --> 3:21:40.700]  I can't even run outside. The air is so bad.
[3:21:40.700 --> 3:21:46.700]  And I want to shout from the top of my lungs to tell people, look up, stop looking down at your phones.
[3:21:46.700 --> 3:21:49.700]  Look what's going on, but people are so complacent out here.
[3:21:49.700 --> 3:21:52.700]  It's happening every day, Alex, every single day.
[3:21:52.700 --> 3:21:55.700]  I don't even want to go outside running anymore.
[3:21:55.700 --> 3:21:57.700]  Thanks to your nutraceuticals.
[3:21:57.700 --> 3:21:59.700]  I mean, it's really helped me a lot.
[3:21:59.700 --> 3:22:04.700]  I've had, I mean, I bought iodine, vitamin B12, silver bullet, DNA, force or toothpaste.
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:08.700]  I mean, I bought so many of your products that have really helped me out a lot,
[3:22:08.700 --> 3:22:10.700]  but people don't know what's going on.
[3:22:10.700 --> 3:22:15.700]  There's people coughing and sneezing and sick and flu and fever.
[3:22:15.700 --> 3:22:17.700]  And I want to tell people it's the control.
[3:22:17.700 --> 3:22:21.700]  It is. Well, let me tell you, GMO is causing a lot of autoimmune shutdowns and problems.
[3:22:21.700 --> 3:22:28.700]  It's a cocktail. And then you add the geoengineering that later rains down thousands of miles away.
[3:22:28.700 --> 3:22:32.700]  And then you add the most important thing, China is totally dirty.
[3:22:32.700 --> 3:22:36.700]  The biggest industrial base ever, dirty plants, everything.
[3:22:36.700 --> 3:22:39.700]  Its jet stream rains down all over the United States.
[3:22:39.700 --> 3:22:43.700]  In fact, Texas, Louisiana and the Mississippi are the worst.
[3:22:43.700 --> 3:22:45.700]  That's one reason I may have to leave Texas at least part of the time.
[3:22:45.700 --> 3:22:47.700]  It's not just allergies.
[3:22:47.700 --> 3:22:54.700]  The jet stream goes from like 30,000, 35,000 feet down to ground level in different areas of the North America.
[3:22:54.700 --> 3:22:57.700]  And then so used to 100 years ago, there'd be a big volcano.
[3:22:57.700 --> 3:23:02.700]  People have allergies. They call it the Vogue for a couple of years from it for thousands of miles away.
[3:23:02.700 --> 3:23:07.700]  Well, forget the Vogue like some people in Hawaii have when the volcano is going on the big island.
[3:23:07.700 --> 3:23:09.700]  They get it on, you know, islands away.
[3:23:09.700 --> 3:23:13.700]  This is global smog raining down.
[3:23:13.700 --> 3:23:16.700]  So it's not just the chemtrails, but if the crew will do this for new viewers,
[3:23:16.700 --> 3:23:23.700]  type in geoengineering or climate engineering CFR or Smithsonian.
[3:23:23.700 --> 3:23:27.700]  You'll get mainstream articles admitting they're doing it, but they call it testing.
[3:23:27.700 --> 3:23:30.700]  Paul Watson, your take on this. Thank you so much, Erica.
[3:23:30.700 --> 3:23:32.700]  Paul, just getting your name wrong.
[3:23:32.700 --> 3:23:35.700]  She was talking about meeting people of like mind.
[3:23:35.700 --> 3:23:41.700]  You can do that in any area. Just get on the Internet, organize a range to meet in a bar,
[3:23:41.700 --> 3:23:43.700]  just go to forums, start a Facebook page.
[3:23:43.700 --> 3:23:49.700]  It's easy. It's this atomized idea that we're all just individuals floating around cyberspace.
[3:23:49.700 --> 3:23:54.700]  There are other people in your area who believe the same thing and it's so easy to meet up with them.
[3:23:54.700 --> 3:23:56.700]  Then you can form a group of friends.
[3:23:56.700 --> 3:24:01.700]  That turns into an activist movement in your local area and you can actually have an effect on policy.
[3:24:01.700 --> 3:24:05.700]  It's so easy. There's no excuse to not be doing that kind of thing.
[3:24:05.700 --> 3:24:09.700]  That's right. If people just search engine CFR calls for geoengineering.
[3:24:09.700 --> 3:24:11.700]  Bill Gates involved in geoengineering.
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:13.700]  Bill Gates wants to control hurricanes.
[3:24:13.700 --> 3:24:17.700]  You'll get all the articles do buy controlling the weather.
[3:24:17.700 --> 3:24:23.700]  China controlling the weather and they've got these antennas that with the aluminum dioxide,
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:26.700]  they're able to then create nuclei by projecting up into it.
[3:24:26.700 --> 3:24:30.700]  There you go. On the regulation of geoengineering, CFR.
[3:24:30.700 --> 3:24:33.700]  We have a 1979 global treaty on weather weapons.
[3:24:33.700 --> 3:24:36.700]  This is real, folks. Great, great point, Paul.
[3:24:36.700 --> 3:24:42.700]  Yeah, well, you know, maybe they're cloud seeding or putting these chemtrails in the atmosphere
[3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:47.700]  either to prevent the drought or cause the drought.
[3:24:47.700 --> 3:24:50.700]  They admit it's a weather weapon. They're actually testing the weapons.
[3:24:50.700 --> 3:24:54.700]  Exactly. So, or, you know, who knows the health hazards.
[3:24:54.700 --> 3:24:57.700]  They said they were trying to stop global warming but the sun cooled off.
[3:24:57.700 --> 3:25:03.700]  But all the scientists say when they spray this, the UV goes under, can't bounce out and it actually heats the earth.
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:06.700]  So they've been trying to heat the earth but the sun cooled off so it didn't work.
[3:25:06.700 --> 3:25:10.700]  Paul, why do you think they're trying to heat the earth?
[3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:13.700]  I don't know if they're trying to heat the earth.
[3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:17.700]  I mean, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on but as Millie said earlier, you know,
[3:25:17.700 --> 3:25:21.700]  Ivanka's coming with this big global warming push.
[3:25:21.700 --> 3:25:24.700]  It's literally in direct opposition to what Trump's doing.
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:28.700]  Well, I talk to the geoengineers and I've talked to the planetologists basically.
[3:25:28.700 --> 3:25:33.700]  I've talked to the astrophysicists and they say you put up these clouds and even BBC says
[3:25:33.700 --> 3:25:38.700]  they made the earth 21 times, 30 times percent darker, 21 to 30 percent darker
[3:25:38.700 --> 3:25:41.700]  and that that actually creates more heat on the planet's surface
[3:25:41.700 --> 3:25:44.700]  because then the radiation goes in and doesn't reflect back up.
[3:25:44.700 --> 3:25:45.700]  You understand?
[3:25:45.700 --> 3:25:48.700]  UV goes through but then doesn't bounce back off.
[3:25:48.700 --> 3:25:50.700]  You understand what I'm saying?
[3:25:50.700 --> 3:25:52.700]  No, yeah, I understand.
[3:25:52.700 --> 3:25:57.700]  People have bought so much into this idea of some type of climate change or global warming or global cooling
[3:25:57.700 --> 3:26:01.700]  to where people living in the colder regions like Colorado say,
[3:26:01.700 --> 3:26:08.700]  look, see, it's snowing into March, it's global cooling climate change and then you have people in California
[3:26:08.700 --> 3:26:11.700]  where it's nice and warm and hot saying, hey, it's global warming.
[3:26:11.700 --> 3:26:13.700]  It's called weather guys.
[3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:15.700]  Exactly and now they're calling it climate change.
[3:26:15.700 --> 3:26:17.700]  Paul, I'm going to take one more call and hand the baton to you.
[3:26:17.700 --> 3:26:20.700]  I'm sorry to all the folks that have been holding but I'm going to go to Victor in a moment.
[3:26:20.700 --> 3:26:23.700]  Sorry for barging in on your hour today but it's hard to get you to do the show.
[3:26:23.700 --> 3:26:25.700]  It was great having you here in Texas.
[3:26:25.700 --> 3:26:28.700]  Did you enjoy yourself and then tell us what's coming up in the next half hour?
[3:26:28.700 --> 3:26:33.700]  Well, Alex, I'm going to dip into a Buzzfeed article because I'm doing a video on it
[3:26:33.700 --> 3:26:39.700]  but they've basically come out and said that people are responding to this dear white people Netflix series
[3:26:39.700 --> 3:26:42.700]  and saying what would happen if they did a dear black people.
[3:26:42.700 --> 3:26:46.700]  So they focused in on this tweet which said, dear black people,
[3:26:46.700 --> 3:26:51.700]  I'm sorry for our history of oppression and genocide as if that's what white people would say.
[3:26:51.700 --> 3:26:56.700]  There's such a fundamental historical misunderstanding of the history of slavery.
[3:26:56.700 --> 3:27:00.700]  Literally every single race enslaved people.
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:03.700]  And in fact, it was white British people, Alex,
[3:27:03.700 --> 3:27:09.700]  that literally used to risk their lives and gone raid Arab slave owners in African countries
[3:27:09.700 --> 3:27:12.700]  and free black slaves in Africa.
[3:27:12.700 --> 3:27:14.700]  That was white British people.
[3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:15.700]  But they don't care.
[3:27:15.700 --> 3:27:18.700]  They want to create white guilt so we do whatever we're told.
[3:27:18.700 --> 3:27:19.700]  Yeah.
[3:27:19.700 --> 3:27:21.700]  But every single race has had slaves.
[3:27:21.700 --> 3:27:28.700]  The very origin of the term comes from slabs who are enslaved white people enslaved by Muslims in Spain.
[3:27:28.700 --> 3:27:29.700]  And I love the message.
[3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:36.700]  Dear white people, welcome to the revolution with a bunch of people whose histories are even greater in slavery,
[3:27:36.700 --> 3:27:39.700]  running their mouths and then demonizing us for somebody's past crimes.
[3:27:39.700 --> 3:27:43.700]  That's like if your neighbor did something, you go to jail, your grandfather did something.
[3:27:43.700 --> 3:27:44.700]  You're a bad person.
[3:27:44.700 --> 3:27:46.700]  What the hell is this?
[3:27:46.700 --> 3:27:47.700]  It's really bizarre.
[3:27:47.700 --> 3:27:52.700]  They want people to pay reparations when wasn't that kind of what the Civil War was.
[3:27:52.700 --> 3:27:58.700]  I mean, do you know how many people died, lost limbs and everything in fought to help free the slave?
[3:27:58.700 --> 3:28:00.700]  And again, they open wounds.
[3:28:00.700 --> 3:28:07.700]  All these liberal sides put white people in blackface and then simulate racism and stuff to open the wound
[3:28:07.700 --> 3:28:09.700]  and totally manipulate people.
[3:28:09.700 --> 3:28:12.700]  But then some of the minorities think, oh, they're being honored now.
[3:28:12.700 --> 3:28:14.700]  They're being brought forward and people care about them.
[3:28:14.700 --> 3:28:18.700]  No, it's the corporate weaponizers that want everybody divided and each other's throats.
[3:28:18.700 --> 3:28:20.700]  Let's talk to Victor and Florida last caller.
[3:28:20.700 --> 3:28:21.700]  I've got time to go to.
[3:28:21.700 --> 3:28:22.700]  I've already hogged Paul's time.
[3:28:22.700 --> 3:28:24.700]  Go ahead.
[3:28:24.700 --> 3:28:25.700]  Yes, hi.
[3:28:25.700 --> 3:28:27.700]  Good afternoon, my fellow warriors.
[3:28:27.700 --> 3:28:34.700]  I just wanted to first of all say, you know, I know that there's a lot of the globalists out there listening.
[3:28:34.700 --> 3:28:41.700]  And, you know, I just want them to know that their time is coming to an end, you know, and, you know, you know,
[3:28:41.700 --> 3:28:48.700]  my my lovely AR 15 here is ready for whatever is to come.
[3:28:48.700 --> 3:28:52.700]  I'm hoping for the best, obviously, as we all are.
[3:28:52.700 --> 3:28:59.700]  But as things are progressing, it seems like, you know, we never know what's going to happen next.
[3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:06.700]  It was really crazy as I was on hold, you know, I was holding the longest, obviously.
[3:29:06.700 --> 3:29:11.700]  I everybody brought up a topic that I was actually going to touch up on.
[3:29:11.700 --> 3:29:17.700]  So I know for a fact that we are this movement.
[3:29:17.700 --> 3:29:18.700]  We're safe movement.
[3:29:18.700 --> 3:29:23.700]  It is a spiritual awakening of it.
[3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:24.700]  And that unifies us.
[3:29:24.700 --> 3:29:28.700]  I wanted to show a video of white people and black people saving other people together.
[3:29:28.700 --> 3:29:29.700]  That's what it's.
[3:29:29.700 --> 3:29:30.700]  We're all people.
[3:29:30.700 --> 3:29:31.700]  We've got to transcend this and come together.
[3:29:31.700 --> 3:29:32.700]  Beautiful testimony.
[3:29:32.700 --> 3:29:34.700]  Victor info wars.com spread that link.
[3:29:34.700 --> 3:29:35.700]  It's being censored.
[3:29:35.700 --> 3:29:36.700]  The enemy hated.
[3:29:36.700 --> 3:29:37.700]  Great job, Millie.
[3:29:37.700 --> 3:29:41.700]  Paul Watson's coming up from London, England, straight ahead on the other side.
[3:29:41.700 --> 3:29:43.700]  We have a 30 hour broadcast kicking off tomorrow.
[3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:46.700]  And we also need your support info wars.com.
[3:29:46.700 --> 3:29:48.700]  Thank you all for making it possible.
[3:29:48.700 --> 3:29:50.700]  God bless you all.
[3:29:50.700 --> 3:29:54.700]  We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[3:29:54.700 --> 3:30:01.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.700 --> 3:30:06.700]  Constitutional convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the preceding citizens
[3:30:06.700 --> 3:30:10.700]  gathered outside independence hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:14.700]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we got?
[3:30:14.700 --> 3:30:16.700]  A republic or a monarchy?
[3:30:16.700 --> 3:30:19.700]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[3:30:19.700 --> 3:30:23.700]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[3:30:23.700 --> 3:30:26.700]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[3:30:26.700 --> 3:30:32.700]  A republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[3:30:32.700 --> 3:30:37.700]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[3:30:37.700 --> 3:30:42.700]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[3:30:42.700 --> 3:30:48.700]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[3:30:48.700 --> 3:30:50.700]  It is a case of majority over man.
[3:30:50.700 --> 3:30:54.700]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[3:30:54.700 --> 3:30:58.700]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[3:30:58.700 --> 3:31:25.700]  This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[3:31:28.700 --> 3:31:30.700]  The best job you can to purify your air.
[3:31:30.700 --> 3:31:38.700]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[3:31:38.700 --> 3:31:40.700]  The general public doesn't.
[3:31:40.700 --> 3:31:44.700]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steel at $300 for $500.
[3:31:44.700 --> 3:31:48.700]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:31:48.700 --> 3:31:54.700]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:31:54.700 --> 3:32:00.700]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowars.com.
[3:32:24.700 --> 3:32:31.700]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:31.700 --> 3:32:34.700]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[3:32:34.700 --> 3:32:38.700]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:38.700 --> 3:32:45.700]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:32:45.700 --> 3:32:52.700]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[3:33:01.700 --> 3:33:10.700]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:10.700 --> 3:33:14.700]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:14.700 --> 3:33:26.700]  And we're live. It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday edition by talking about a plus speed article.
[3:33:26.700 --> 3:33:31.700]  I'm going to do a video about this tonight and we'll be up till 2am once again.
[3:33:31.700 --> 3:33:39.700]  The headline is people promptly responded with dear black people after dear white people was dubbed a double standard.
[3:33:39.700 --> 3:33:45.700]  Now, because they're referring to the Netflix series, dear white people, which we've had articles before.
[3:33:45.700 --> 3:33:48.700]  I haven't seen it, so I'm not going to comment on that specifically.
[3:33:48.700 --> 3:33:50.700]  I don't know what it was in it.
[3:33:50.700 --> 3:33:51.700]  Haven't watched it.
[3:33:51.700 --> 3:34:01.700]  This is what I am going to comment on the fact that Buzzfeed is once again pushing divisive race baiting crap and casual anti white racism,
[3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:07.700]  which we saw earlier in the story that Alex talked about with affinity magazine, which has a history of that.
[3:34:07.700 --> 3:34:10.700]  Now Buzzfeed is back at it once again.
[3:34:10.700 --> 3:34:11.700]  Why is this a concern?
[3:34:11.700 --> 3:34:13.700]  Because this has become cute.
[3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:16.700]  This has become the last acceptable form of racism.
[3:34:16.700 --> 3:34:21.700]  And it's actually emboldening real white supremacists.
[3:34:21.700 --> 3:34:27.700]  They actually look reasonable in comparison to the people spouting this nonsense.
[3:34:27.700 --> 3:34:34.700]  I mean, just to give you an example from literally 10 minutes ago, somebody sent me a tweet which said, quote,
[3:34:34.700 --> 3:34:37.700]  and this is somebody attacks me on Twitter.
[3:34:37.700 --> 3:34:38.700]  Good afternoon.
[3:34:38.700 --> 3:34:41.700]  Twitter is run by white liberals who sympathize with Nazis.
[3:34:41.700 --> 3:34:44.700]  Quote, I'm still pro white genocide.
[3:34:44.700 --> 3:34:50.700]  This guy got 78 retweets and 303 likes for that tweet.
[3:34:50.700 --> 3:34:53.700]  This is a sentiment that dominates the left.
[3:34:53.700 --> 3:34:55.700]  The far left is obsessed with this.
[3:34:55.700 --> 3:34:59.700]  The more quote center left never disavows it.
[3:34:59.700 --> 3:35:00.700]  They legitimize it.
[3:35:00.700 --> 3:35:07.700]  This has to be spoken out against because it's actually emboldening race supremacists on both sides,
[3:35:07.700 --> 3:35:13.700]  which means you're going to get more violence, more racial tension, more riots, more murders.
[3:35:13.700 --> 3:35:14.700]  This is what's going to happen.
[3:35:14.700 --> 3:35:18.700]  So now Buzzfeed is on that train again.
[3:35:18.700 --> 3:35:24.700]  So basically someone reacted to this Netflix DIY people show on Twitter with the following tweet.
[3:35:24.700 --> 3:35:29.700]  He said, quote, imagine if there was a show called the black people.
[3:35:29.700 --> 3:35:30.700]  So again, it's this idea.
[3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:38.700]  Imagine if you reverse the roles, if it was white people lecturing black people about their supposed infabilities or whatever.
[3:35:38.700 --> 3:35:40.700]  That's what the original tweet was about.
[3:35:40.700 --> 3:35:43.700]  And that's why Buzzfeed wrote this article about it.
[3:35:43.700 --> 3:35:49.700]  So then a guy on Twitter called Reggie, a black guy responded with the tweet, quote,
[3:35:49.700 --> 3:35:52.700]  dear black people, I'm sorry your skin color makes me see you as a threat.
[3:35:52.700 --> 3:35:53.700]  That was another tweet.
[3:35:53.700 --> 3:35:59.700]  And then he responded by basically saying, I'm sorry for our history of oppression and genocide.
[3:35:59.700 --> 3:36:06.700]  So he's speaking as the white person saying, I'm sorry for our history of oppression and genocide.
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:09.700]  And he told Buzzfeed, the guy who made this tweet, quote,
[3:36:09.700 --> 3:36:14.700]  I was trying to help him understand how the history of this country shaped racism to only go one way
[3:36:14.700 --> 3:36:18.700]  and that the double standard lacks historical context.
[3:36:18.700 --> 3:36:23.700]  So this guy is saying that if you complain about a show called dear white people,
[3:36:23.700 --> 3:36:28.700]  you'll complain your sentiment lacks historical context,
[3:36:28.700 --> 3:36:35.700]  which is pretty ironic because the left has no idea whatsoever of the historical context of slavery.
[3:36:35.700 --> 3:36:37.700]  No idea whatsoever.
[3:36:37.700 --> 3:36:47.700]  So again, the word slave is derived from slav as in slavic white people who were taken as slaves by Muslims in Spain.
[3:36:47.700 --> 3:36:50.700]  During the ninth century.
[3:36:50.700 --> 3:36:58.700]  So the very origin of the term slave is derived from white people being enslaved by brown people.
[3:36:58.700 --> 3:36:59.700]  Okay.
[3:36:59.700 --> 3:37:07.700]  And again, every single race has enslaved members of another race throughout history.
[3:37:07.700 --> 3:37:13.700]  Every single race or at least enslaved members of a different social caste.
[3:37:13.700 --> 3:37:20.700]  So you can't pin this all on white people and to do so is not only incredibly historically inaccurate,
[3:37:20.700 --> 3:37:23.700]  it's completely racist.
[3:37:23.700 --> 3:37:27.700]  So again, the Barbary slave trade, I've talked about it over and over again,
[3:37:27.700 --> 3:37:38.700]  ran for about 200 years, 1.25 million white Christian Europeans abducted by Arab slave masters.
[3:37:38.700 --> 3:37:47.700]  1.25 million white Christian Europeans abducted and they were sold into slavery in North Africa.
[3:37:47.700 --> 3:37:52.700]  That's white people being enslaved by brown people once again.
[3:37:52.700 --> 3:37:58.700]  But I don't sit here and whine and bitch and moan about it and blame all Muslims who are living today
[3:37:58.700 --> 3:38:04.700]  for something that their ancestors did hundreds of years ago, which they have nothing to do with whatsoever.
[3:38:04.700 --> 3:38:05.700]  Okay.
[3:38:05.700 --> 3:38:07.700]  I don't write whiny little Buzzfeed articles about it.
[3:38:07.700 --> 3:38:16.700]  I don't demand reparations from Muslims in the UK because their ancestors hundreds of years ago were involved in the slave trade.
[3:38:16.700 --> 3:38:17.700]  That's unfair.
[3:38:17.700 --> 3:38:21.700]  That's actually racist to collectivise people in that way.
[3:38:21.700 --> 3:38:22.700]  But that's what the left does.
[3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:26.700]  That's what Buzzfeed does over and over again.
[3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:32.700]  The Barbary slave trade was far more brutal than the transatlantic slave trade.
[3:38:32.700 --> 3:38:39.700]  That's not to say that transatlantic slaves, black people from Africa being brought to America weren't treated badly.
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:40.700]  It was horrible.
[3:38:40.700 --> 3:38:42.700]  All slavery is horrible.
[3:38:42.700 --> 3:38:51.700]  But the Barbary slave trade was particularly brutal because they actually enslaved black people as well as white people
[3:38:51.700 --> 3:38:56.700]  and castrated young black boys so they couldn't have children.
[3:38:56.700 --> 3:39:03.700]  They literally amputated the scrotum and penis of young black boys so they couldn't have children.
[3:39:03.700 --> 3:39:10.700]  Again, this is Arab slave traders doing this in the Middle East, in North African countries.
[3:39:10.700 --> 3:39:12.700]  The Barbary slave trade, okay?
[3:39:12.700 --> 3:39:15.700]  But again, I don't see Buzzfeed.
[3:39:15.700 --> 3:39:23.700]  I don't see this guy who made the original tweet, Reggie, bitching and whining about Arabs living today and saying that they're racist
[3:39:23.700 --> 3:39:26.700]  if they say something on Twitter.
[3:39:26.700 --> 3:39:33.700]  And again, you look at the history of slavery, white people were the first people in history legally to end slavery.
[3:39:33.700 --> 3:39:42.700]  William Wilberforce campaigned for the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 in Great Britain.
[3:39:42.700 --> 3:39:47.700]  We were the first to end slavery in the world.
[3:39:47.700 --> 3:39:55.700]  White people, white British people, who also, by the way, literally risked their lives in the years after that act was passed
[3:39:55.700 --> 3:40:03.700]  to conduct raids on African countries like Zanzibar to free black slaves from their Arab captors.
[3:40:03.700 --> 3:40:11.700]  So not only were white people enslaved by Arabs, not only did white people pass the first laws to end slavery and free black slaves,
[3:40:11.700 --> 3:40:18.700]  but white people literally risked their lives to free black slaves from their Arab captors.
[3:40:18.700 --> 3:40:20.700]  This is called history, okay?
[3:40:20.700 --> 3:40:23.700]  Buzzfeed asks for historical context.
[3:40:23.700 --> 3:40:29.700]  When people make these tweets, I'm giving you some historical context.
[3:40:29.700 --> 3:40:37.700]  You had the Civil War in America where hundreds of thousands of white Americans died partly to end slavery.
[3:40:37.700 --> 3:40:47.700]  And of course, you have the situation today where 46 million people in the world today are enslaved, living under slavery.
[3:40:47.700 --> 3:40:51.700]  That is the most ever in human history.
[3:40:51.700 --> 3:40:56.700]  And where are they enslaved in Germany, in America, in the UK?
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:01.700]  No, in Middle Eastern and African countries, not in any white countries.
[3:41:01.700 --> 3:41:07.700]  46 million people. I don't see Buzzfeed bitching and whining about that.
[3:41:07.700 --> 3:41:14.700]  Do you? No, because they can't blame it on white people, because they can't be racist with it.
[3:41:14.700 --> 3:41:23.700]  So again, virtually every single racial group in history has been guilty of enslaving people from other racial groups or social castes.
[3:41:23.700 --> 3:41:27.700]  They all did it throughout history.
[3:41:27.700 --> 3:41:32.700]  That's not to say that it justifies any of it. It's all equally horrible.
[3:41:32.700 --> 3:41:37.700]  And it's good that Britain was the first to end it in 1833.
[3:41:37.700 --> 3:41:42.700]  It's bad, but it still exists in many Middle Eastern countries.
[3:41:42.700 --> 3:41:50.700]  We had the video a few weeks ago of the maiden Q8, the black maiden Q8, who was literally hanging from a window.
[3:41:50.700 --> 3:41:51.700]  She was a slave.
[3:41:51.700 --> 3:41:54.700]  Reports she was trying to commit suicide.
[3:41:54.700 --> 3:41:58.700]  It still exists in many Middle Eastern and North African countries.
[3:41:58.700 --> 3:42:04.700]  46 million people are enslaved, but Buzzfeed doesn't give a damn about that.
[3:42:04.700 --> 3:42:13.700]  So this contemporary narrative, the only white people to blame for slavery, again, it's not only completely wrong historically, completely wrong.
[3:42:13.700 --> 3:42:26.700]  It's also racist because they're collectively trying to demonize white people today because of their skin color, blaming them for the sins of their ancestors, which they had nothing to do with.
[3:42:26.700 --> 3:42:27.700]  Okay?
[3:42:27.700 --> 3:42:31.700]  Arabs living today aren't to blame for what Arabs did 300 years ago.
[3:42:31.700 --> 3:42:34.700]  White people are not to blame for what white people did 300 years ago.
[3:42:34.700 --> 3:42:38.700]  Black people are not to blame for what black people did 300 years ago.
[3:42:38.700 --> 3:42:40.700]  That's collectivization.
[3:42:40.700 --> 3:42:42.700]  That's actually racist.
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:46.700]  So they say, oh, reverse racism doesn't exist.
[3:42:46.700 --> 3:42:50.700]  You have to have institutional power to be racist.
[3:42:50.700 --> 3:42:53.700]  So there's this whole, oh, black people can't be racist towards white people.
[3:42:53.700 --> 3:42:56.700]  Well, who has the institutional power?
[3:42:56.700 --> 3:42:59.700]  Who owns and runs the media?
[3:42:59.700 --> 3:43:03.700]  Who owns and runs the cultural institutions in the West?
[3:43:03.700 --> 3:43:09.700]  Well, of course, they're almost exclusively dominated and controlled by the left.
[3:43:09.700 --> 3:43:22.700]  They have the institutionalized power, and now they're using it to flow this cute, trendy, anti-white racism, which is emboldening actual white supremacists.
[3:43:22.700 --> 3:43:32.700]  Now you're slowly beginning to see a growth in actual white supremacist groups, which in the past decade before that, 15 years had been on the decline.
[3:43:32.700 --> 3:43:40.700]  I mean, the KKK is basically defunct, but now you're seeing all these new white supremacist groups cropple and black supremacist groups.
[3:43:40.700 --> 3:43:50.700]  As in Black Lives Matter, the ideological guru of which is a convicted terrorist on the FBI's top 10 most wanted terrorist list,
[3:43:50.700 --> 3:43:54.700]  Asasa Shakur, she's a convicted cop killer.
[3:43:54.700 --> 3:44:00.700]  That's who Black Lives Matter supporters chan at their rallies, her name.
[3:44:00.700 --> 3:44:06.700]  They also walked down the street chanting, what do we want dead cops? When do we want it now?
[3:44:06.700 --> 3:44:13.700]  Xavier Johnson, the guy in Dallas who killed the Dallas cops, gunned them down in cold blood.
[3:44:13.700 --> 3:44:18.700]  Did it because of quote Black Lives Matter and because he hated white people.
[3:44:18.700 --> 3:44:22.700]  Okay, this mindset is causing death.
[3:44:22.700 --> 3:44:24.700]  It's causing riots.
[3:44:24.700 --> 3:44:29.700]  It's causing increased racial tension across the board.
[3:44:29.700 --> 3:44:34.700]  But it's being mainstreamed by the left. That's again the difference. I talk about it over and over.
[3:44:34.700 --> 3:44:41.700]  Not denying that there are far right fringe extremists who are violent and have absolutely horrible beliefs.
[3:44:41.700 --> 3:44:47.700]  We had the guy in New York recently, you traveled all the way to New York, the white supremacist just to kill a black guy.
[3:44:47.700 --> 3:44:56.700]  Horrible individual should be executed. That's an example of a far right fringe extremist should be disavowed and is disavowed.
[3:44:56.700 --> 3:45:02.700]  The left doesn't disavow any of this. They celebrate it. They embrace it.
[3:45:02.700 --> 3:45:09.700]  It's all over Twitter. People have sent out tweets where they switch the word white and black.
[3:45:09.700 --> 3:45:16.700]  Literally calling for all white people to be killed as I read a few minutes ago, somebody calling for white genocide.
[3:45:16.700 --> 3:45:22.700]  Those people don't get suspended. They don't get banned. That's cute. That's the acceptable face of modern racism.
[3:45:22.700 --> 3:45:28.700]  So again, the left legitimizes this. They embrace it. They never disavow it.
[3:45:28.700 --> 3:45:33.700]  And it's leading to more chaos. It's leading to more LA riots.
[3:45:33.700 --> 3:45:41.700]  They had a poll last week out of LA which showed more people in LA than any time before believed that new riots are right around the corner.
[3:45:41.700 --> 3:45:44.700]  Precisely because of all this race baiting.
[3:45:44.700 --> 3:45:55.700]  You have cities like Baltimore where black on black murders are completely through the roof in the past two, three years since the start of black lives matter,
[3:45:55.700 --> 3:46:00.700]  which doesn't give a damn about black people killing each other.
[3:46:00.700 --> 3:46:04.700]  So they've created this whole race narrative, the Ferguson effect.
[3:46:04.700 --> 3:46:13.700]  Police don't even want to go into these ghetto areas anymore because they're increasingly being targeted by these gang members and other criminals.
[3:46:13.700 --> 3:46:19.700]  So that leads to more shootings, more sense of lawlessness, more black on black murders.
[3:46:19.700 --> 3:46:27.700]  So since the start of black lives matter, more black people are killing black people than at any time in years and years and years.
[3:46:27.700 --> 3:46:37.700]  That's the effect it's had. And it's all being bolstered by this anti-white racist narrative by the likes of Buzzfeed, by the likes of MTV News and others.
[3:46:37.700 --> 3:46:48.700]  And this is just the latest example of that. Again, blaming white people for slavery when every single race throughout history was involved in the slave trade.
[3:46:48.700 --> 3:46:53.700]  And in fact, white people were the first in the world to put an end to it.
[3:46:53.700 --> 3:46:56.700]  It still exists today, but not in any white countries.
[3:46:56.700 --> 3:47:01.700]  And Buzzfeed will never talk about that, will they?
[3:47:01.700 --> 3:47:02.700]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:47:02.700 --> 3:47:09.700]  Of course, we had Affinity magazine putting out this tweet, which Alex talks about earlier white people aged like bananas.
[3:47:09.700 --> 3:47:15.700]  You could say, well, don't get triggered by that. It's just a lame joke. You go back through their history.
[3:47:15.700 --> 3:47:20.700]  Look at their other headlines. Straight white men are the root of our problems.
[3:47:20.700 --> 3:47:24.700]  Dear white people, your dictionary definition of racism is wrong.
[3:47:24.700 --> 3:47:28.700]  And dear white people stop crying about reverse racism. It doesn't exist.
[3:47:28.700 --> 3:47:34.700]  That's right. It doesn't exist. It's just racism. And you're being racist. This is all over the left.
[3:47:34.700 --> 3:47:39.700]  They embrace it. It's a big problem. It's going to cause more violence. It's going to cause more riots.
[3:47:39.700 --> 3:47:45.700]  It's going to cause more racial tension. It has to stop right now.
[3:47:45.700 --> 3:47:49.700]  Now, speaking of that, we had the incident in Austin, Texas yesterday.
[3:47:49.700 --> 3:47:52.700]  The stabbing. This is out of Gateway Pondit.
[3:47:52.700 --> 3:47:58.700]  Kill frat boys, anarchist terrorized college with calls to make their lives hell.
[3:47:58.700 --> 3:48:06.700]  We flash back to this article from April 25th, because again, we're talking about the motive of this killer, which hasn't come out yet.
[3:48:06.700 --> 3:48:12.700]  They deleted all his social media presence within minutes. Could this have some kind of connection?
[3:48:12.700 --> 3:48:17.700]  In the past week, vandals have repeatedly defaced property at the prestigious University of Texas, Austin,
[3:48:17.700 --> 3:48:25.700]  spray-painting a hammer and sickle symbol and words like rapist, racist, and kill frat boys on at least four fraternity houses.
[3:48:25.700 --> 3:48:32.700]  So that was going on just about a week before the stabbing attack took place.
[3:48:32.700 --> 3:48:38.700]  This article out of Gateway Pondit also reports the University of Texas' stabber reenacted white genocide.
[3:48:38.700 --> 3:48:41.700]  Oh, well, what do you know?
[3:48:41.700 --> 3:48:45.700]  He was radicalized by this anti-white agenda.
[3:48:45.700 --> 3:48:51.700]  Kendrick's white was taken into custody after he went berserk with a machete on the campus of UT.
[3:48:51.700 --> 3:48:56.700]  Again, one dead, three injured. The one dead was a Trump supporter, according to some reports.
[3:48:56.700 --> 3:49:04.700]  But in 2012, before white was a student at UT Austin, he made a 14-minute poorly produced video at his home,
[3:49:04.700 --> 3:49:12.700]  which shows Kendrick's white and his classmates reenacting the murder of white people by Haitian political figure Dutty Buchman.
[3:49:12.700 --> 3:49:17.700]  The video is chilling and over the top with excessively violent moments.
[3:49:17.700 --> 3:49:27.700]  So years before the stabbing, about five years before, he's reenacting white genocide in his own class with his classmates.
[3:49:27.700 --> 3:49:33.700]  The video entitled Haitian Revolution is a chilling precursor to the type of violence that white would act on later.
[3:49:33.700 --> 3:49:40.700]  The Haitian Revolution involved a specific targeting and killing of white women and children.
[3:49:40.700 --> 3:49:48.700]  Austin police still say they don't know his motivation, so it remains to be seen. We'll keep an eye on it.
[3:49:48.700 --> 3:49:54.700]  Daily Caller reports fraternity suspended for throwing a Mexican-themed party wearing sombreros.
[3:49:54.700 --> 3:49:59.700]  You can't do that anymore. That's racist. You can't not look people in the eye. That's racist.
[3:49:59.700 --> 3:50:04.700]  Can't eat Asian food. That's racist. Can't drink milk. That's racist. Can't do the OK sign.
[3:50:04.700 --> 3:50:07.700]  That's racist. You can't wear a sombrero.
[3:50:07.700 --> 3:50:12.700]  Many students and administrators at Baylor University are fiercely denouncing a campus fraternity.
[3:50:12.700 --> 3:50:19.700]  How dare they dress up for throwing a Mexican-themed party over the weekend which features sombreros and Mexican-related attire.
[3:50:19.700 --> 3:50:25.700]  Alright, so I guess now you've got to ban cowboy hats because if somebody who's not white wears a cowboy hat,
[3:50:25.700 --> 3:50:28.700]  they're culturally appropriating white people and that's racist.
[3:50:28.700 --> 3:50:31.700]  Oh, but their own rules don't apply to themselves, so it's not.
[3:50:31.700 --> 3:50:38.700]  OK, just whatever you do, if you're white, you're racist. Deal with it.
[3:50:38.700 --> 3:50:47.700]  Absolutely incredible and again another example of this narrative continuing to affect popular culture and modern discourse.
[3:50:47.700 --> 3:50:51.700]  It's going to lead to more riots. It's going to lead to more bloodshed.
[3:50:51.700 --> 3:51:01.700]  We'll be back with the final segment of The Fourth Hour of the Alex Jones Show Live after the break. Don't go away.
[3:51:01.700 --> 3:51:05.700]  Extendulite really works. Just listen to what some people have to say.
[3:51:05.700 --> 3:51:11.700]  About six months ago, my wife bought Extendulite. She didn't tell me she was giving it to me.
[3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:17.700]  So after about three days, I said maybe the weather's changed or something, I said my legs feel really good.
[3:51:17.700 --> 3:51:21.700]  And she goes, well, I've been giving you this stuff and it was the Extendulite.
[3:51:21.700 --> 3:51:28.700]  And you know that I'm about 75% better. I can actually climb stairs now and I can get up out of chairs.
[3:51:28.700 --> 3:51:34.700]  I can even get down and, you know, I got to work under a table or a computer table and work on a computer.
[3:51:34.700 --> 3:51:38.700]  I can actually get back up off the floor. You know what? It's an amazing product.
[3:51:38.700 --> 3:51:42.700]  I can't believe I didn't think anything short of having surgery was going to help.
[3:51:42.700 --> 3:51:47.700]  Extendulite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[3:51:54.700 --> 3:52:12.700]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diet of processed junk.
[3:52:12.700 --> 3:52:22.700]  We are now introducing Caveman by M4slive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[3:52:22.700 --> 3:52:29.700]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[3:52:29.700 --> 3:52:38.700]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[3:52:38.700 --> 3:52:46.700]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[3:52:46.700 --> 3:52:54.700]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[3:52:54.700 --> 3:53:22.700]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself, M4slive.com today.

[3:54:00.700 --> 3:54:15.700]  To put it carefully, most of these people followed not very mainstream religion. So, you have Catholics, Protestants, all sorts of religions. These people, most of them, were Luciferians.
[3:54:15.700 --> 3:54:31.700]  And then you can say, religion is a fairy tale, God doesn't exist, none of that is real. Well, for these people, it is truth and reality, and they served something immaterial, what they called Lucifer.
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:42.700]  And I also was in contact with those circles, only I laughed at it because to me they were just clients. So, I went to places called Churches of Satan.
[3:54:42.700 --> 3:54:57.700]  So, now we are talking about Satanism. Yes. So, I visited these churches, just as a visitor, dropped by, and then they were doing their holy mass with naked woman and liquor and stuff.
[3:54:57.700 --> 3:55:06.700]  And it just amused me. I didn't believe in any of this stuff and was far from convinced if any of this was real.
[3:55:06.700 --> 3:55:24.700]  It was just a spectacle to you. Yes, in my opinion, the darkness and evil is within the people themselves. I didn't make the connection yet, so I was a guest in those circles and it amused me greatly to see all those named women and the other things.
[3:55:24.700 --> 3:55:46.700]  But then at some point, I was invited, which is why I am telling you all this, to participate in sacrifices abroad.
[3:55:54.700 --> 3:56:12.700]  That was the breaking point. Children. You were asked to do that? Yes. And I couldn't do that.
[3:56:12.700 --> 3:56:32.700]  Would you like to stop for a moment, by the way? No. And then I started to slowly break down. I lived through quite a lot as a child myself and this really touched me deeply.
[3:56:32.700 --> 3:56:52.700]  Everything changed. But that is the world I found myself in. And then I started to refuse assignments within my job. I could no longer do it, which made me a threat.
[3:56:52.700 --> 3:57:08.700]  I was no longer capable of functioning optimally. My performance started to shake and I had refused tasks. I had not participated. The purpose of the whole thing, eventually, in that world, is that they have everybody in their pocket.
[3:57:08.700 --> 3:57:20.700]  You need to be susceptible to blackmail. And blackmailing me proved to be very hard if I look back on it. They wanted to do that through those children. And that broke me.
[3:57:20.700 --> 3:57:28.700]  Is that you are not telling me something new, what they also do in politics?
[3:57:28.700 --> 3:57:38.700]  If you Google this, you'll find enough worldwide witness accounts to know this isn't to what Disney fairy tale.
[3:57:38.700 --> 3:57:52.700]  Unfortunately, the truth is that worldwide they have been doing this for thousands of years.
[3:57:52.700 --> 3:57:54.700]  That's pretty good. What else you got to say?
[3:57:54.700 --> 3:58:10.700]  This is the intelligence you get from these people. This is funny.
[3:58:10.700 --> 3:58:26.700]  I want to remind you, go to infowarsstore.com. Get the conservatism. It's the new counterculture t-shirt. It's selling out.
[3:58:26.700 --> 3:58:50.700]  This is G.C.N. The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
