[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:32.200]  I always love surprises today's radio show will be extremely power packed we got David
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.960]  Ike joining us today from the United States John in New Mexico we got Max Kaiser on the
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.400]  death of the dollar that now seems to be imminent and then Alan Watt of cutting through the
[00:45.400 --> 00:53.280]  matrix all three today if that isn't a power-packed informative lineup I don't know what is so
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.320]  coming up David Ike Max Kaiser and Alan Watt on the show but all of that is overshadowed
[01:00.320 --> 01:15.280]  by the dollar plunging the record lows gold surging surging right up to 1048 dollars and
[01:15.280 --> 01:21.520]  change today and that's the last time I checked an hour ago before I worked on other news
[01:21.520 --> 01:29.960]  stories here at the office now we've got articles posted that make the point the dollar tumbling
[01:29.960 --> 01:39.800]  and gold exploding gold rising like a Saturn rocket into the sky is not cause for celebration
[01:39.800 --> 01:45.280]  I will assure you I would have loved to have been wrong about all of this I would have
[01:45.280 --> 01:53.640]  loved to not have read Club of Rome and UN documents and George Soros statements and
[01:53.640 --> 01:57.040]  seen what the globalist had done in third world countries over and over again and first
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.200]  world nations I would have loved for them to be liars but they are not liars I mean they
[02:02.200 --> 02:05.800]  lie to the public about general everyday issues but when they write their own policy
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.000]  reports they talk about how we're scum and slaves and all the things they're doing to
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.040]  us and how stupid we are and how they're going to hurt us real bad and it's a religion
[02:16.040 --> 02:29.440]  and a masochistic religion of enslavement and domination and they think of you as lower
[02:29.440 --> 02:39.880]  as the lowest of the low and when you listen to the news or listen to news radio it is
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.960]  just almost all complete government worship and propaganda you know you don't trust people
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.640]  in private business you don't trust neighbors you don't know you know there's a lot of swindlers
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.080]  and scammers and liars and unethical people out there of every stripe why do we just suddenly
[02:56.080 --> 03:00.960]  love and worship governments stomping around in black uniforms the truth is we don't everybody
[03:00.960 --> 03:05.600]  knows the government's corrupt but a lot of people are cowards and they just worship government
[03:05.600 --> 03:13.560]  worship corruption worship power thinking if they grovel that somehow they'll end up winning
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.600]  they're so self centered that they destroy their own future they think they get ahead
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.800]  by groveling the tyranny when in truth they destroy the society they live in and they
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.440]  miss out on what it is to truly be a human being so we're going to break all this down

[08:20.600 --> 08:37.080]  welcome welcome my friends it's a very sad day for our country
[08:38.840 --> 08:43.480]  but at the same time at least we were aware of it tens of millions of us were aware of who the
[08:43.480 --> 08:49.000]  enemy was what they're doing who they are what makes them tick and why they're doing what they're
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.440]  doing at least we know that and record numbers of free human beings across the planet know of the
[08:56.440 --> 09:02.760]  eugenics wars they know of the new world order and they are learning more every day once you have
[09:02.760 --> 09:09.080]  a taste of the truth no amount of smiling info babes looking into the teleprompters with sexual
[09:09.080 --> 09:15.720]  desire will manipulate you anymore you will break your conditioning though it is mind control i was
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.200]  jogging on the treadmill this morning again watching the different info babes on fox and
[09:20.200 --> 09:25.880]  cnn and the way they smile the way they laugh and the way they blink their eyes and the way i mean
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.000]  it's like when a woman when you're sitting there at a candlelight dinner with your wife or girlfriend
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.320]  and there's that real moment of falling into each other's eyes like looking into pools of water
[09:37.320 --> 09:45.320]  and there's that tension where you know the woman is just ready to go and you're ready to go
[09:47.160 --> 09:51.000]  and they sit there and their coach this has been admitted for more than a decade
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.200]  before it was the main fatherly authority figure that you could trust but now they found it's even
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.240]  more effective to just go with women good-looking women because they found women like to watch
[10:01.240 --> 10:08.520]  good-looking women and men like to watch good-looking women and they still have younger you know 35
[10:08.520 --> 10:14.600]  cool guys on during the day for the women they have shows that are it's all geared around women
[10:14.600 --> 10:20.840]  80 plus percent of advertising targets women hitler said first you get the women then you've
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.280]  got the children so follow the men it's not that women are bad or stupid it's that women are the
[10:26.280 --> 10:35.400]  center of the household women are the cornerstone of the family and the truth is where women go
[10:35.400 --> 10:41.160]  society follows and then it's men who go out and defend the women and defend the children
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.960]  and you've got to have somebody who makes decisions and splits second crisis so societally in every
[10:47.960 --> 10:54.120]  culture it's been the man is quote the leader but in true dynamic societies women have and always
[10:54.120 --> 11:00.120]  will be the center of society so they've turned them against men another divide and conquer tactic
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.960]  they brought them in as the house slaves 61 percent of college graduates in the u.s or women
[11:05.960 --> 11:10.760]  women only have a six percent unemployment rate men have an 11 percent that's the fed zone numbers
[11:10.760 --> 11:17.720]  it's actually double so it's 12 percent for women and 20 or higher for men and this is a
[11:17.720 --> 11:26.920]  celebration of evil men are reduced to mindless brett farve fans or john elway fans and that's
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.800]  their manhood that's who they are they've had they've been totally emasculated they wear the
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.080]  tribal jersey of their tribe they don't actually go out and conquer they don't actually go out
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.960]  and business and succeed they don't invent they don't actually trailblaze and explore and do what
[11:41.960 --> 11:50.200]  men are supposed to do no no they look at their devils that jump over the defensive line they
[11:51.480 --> 11:54.120]  cheer on the track star they cheer on
[11:56.600 --> 11:59.560]  the championship goalie or the golf player
[12:03.480 --> 12:05.560]  that's what's really happening that's what's really going on
[12:05.560 --> 12:13.160]  and if you realize that and and and understand that it's scientific they have a woman on high
[12:13.160 --> 12:24.360]  def tv looking at you trained batting the eyes looking uh like they are opening to you looking
[12:24.360 --> 12:32.040]  like they are totally into you it's like a snake hypnotizes a bird and and i catch myself consciously
[12:32.040 --> 12:40.680]  while i'm jogging watching it and the woman is making the sexual desire signals and i catch myself
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.160]  smiling back at them and i'll guarantee you you catch yourself doing it too
[12:47.480 --> 12:53.160]  and then i watch the flirtation moves of men at women with the men they have on the shows
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.520]  it's a fashion show you've seen how a fashion model walks out and the way she looks at you
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.560]  sexually with desire you ever watch the fashion models victoria secret runway show before the
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.840]  super bowl or whatever and how it's a confident look of sexual power and desire well they've
[13:12.840 --> 13:20.840]  gone a level closer to like doe-eyed just take me ravage me i'm here i mean do you like scientifically

[17:38.120 --> 17:44.200]  everything he did from the united states in england the united states went further than hitler up until
[17:44.200 --> 17:50.440]  world war two you think hitler's the only one that euthanized retarded children you think hitler's
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.760]  the only one that killed people in institutions and sterilized and forced abortions and killed
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.880]  babies or poor people he got it all from the us and that was in the nurenberg defense at nurenberg

[18:16.440 --> 18:21.720]  houses and admittedly society's always been trashy and always had problems but they've
[18:21.720 --> 18:27.240]  done everything they can to make us more dumb more trashy and and hey i talked to yuppies they go
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.880]  yeah you know you go to a water park or you go to the gym you look at all the dumb trash everywhere
[18:31.880 --> 18:37.800]  you know maybe it's a good idea to get rid of them what you don't understand is the elite actually
[18:37.800 --> 18:44.120]  want to get rid of you number one if you got a high IQ and you've got the genes they think are
[18:44.120 --> 18:51.560]  powerful because there is some truth to all of it they want you dead number one they want you
[18:51.560 --> 18:57.240]  co-opted or dead do you understand that so get that through your head that's what i explained to jesse
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.480]  ventura i was doing this interview with him for his tv show about eugenics and he's like yeah but
[19:01.480 --> 19:05.240]  there are too many people and we're a parasite we're a disease and i said jesse how many friends
[19:05.240 --> 19:10.120]  you say you've had lately even young people you know dying of brain disorders he goes an awful lot
[19:10.120 --> 19:18.760]  and i said buddy and i said you are you got good instincts but i said i can give you the documents

[19:22.840 --> 19:27.960]  and you know things are changing you know everybody's sick or getting sick and i said you know this
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.920]  is for you and it's one thing to make a statement about there's too many people and you don't want
[19:32.920 --> 19:38.600]  to look at the you know dumb trash walking around the point is ladies and gentlemen that dumb trash
[19:38.600 --> 19:44.200]  could be lifted up you have to try to rise humanity up not just decide it's trash and that
[19:44.200 --> 19:49.960]  our species isn't special and then decide that every child isn't special every child is special
[19:49.960 --> 19:57.080]  they do have the the spark of creativity and innate dynamic life form humanity is amazing

[33:26.680 --> 33:32.200]  they began to research that they obsessed over that they funded at the keiser vilham institute in
[33:32.200 --> 33:38.280]  germany and the big royal academies in england and the colesprings harbert where ibm ran at
[33:38.280 --> 33:47.880]  eugenics operations from day one under the nazi thomas watson this is their system and they've
[33:47.880 --> 33:54.280]  always had this plan and they see you as dumb animals and their comment is look at them they

[33:59.400 --> 34:06.440]  they uh they follow along with all our propaganda and so that means that if they're able to be

[34:44.280 --> 34:52.600]  mobsters that really own it it's the same elementary system of the power behind the throne and you
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.800]  don't trust your neighbors and you don't trust people in business and rightfully so but then you
[34:57.800 --> 35:04.920]  totally trust the government which is the most elite most wicked most vicious people in history
[35:04.920 --> 35:11.640]  that have proven themselves willing to be completely ruthless not just willing they enjoy it
[35:16.840 --> 35:22.360]  they enjoy what they're doing to you let me just mention david ikes coming up in 25 minutes

[35:26.760 --> 35:30.200]  max keiser on the dollar degenerating into into hell
[35:30.200 --> 35:40.040]  hell and then i've got all this other insane news i've got john elway the former superbowl qb
[35:42.440 --> 35:52.040]  in a disgusting colorado version of the myac report but this is a public dhs slash myac for the public
[35:54.200 --> 35:58.520]  this is made public for the general population to watch and it says if you're in somebody's
[35:58.520 --> 36:06.200]  garage or house and you see guns call the police on them they're terrorist and why do you think people
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.280]  like jt code and others have been on this show and it was admitted in the local news
[36:12.760 --> 36:17.720]  people are in your garage or in your house they see reloading i mean i see reports every day or
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.840]  two and i'm not looking for them in michigan and in massachusetts and in texas and in everywhere
[36:22.840 --> 36:29.000]  but i've seen a lot of cases in colorado where the carpet cleaner the century 21 person
[36:30.040 --> 36:38.520]  the cable guy they will see a gun case and they call the cops on you they will see reloading
[36:38.520 --> 36:44.680]  and call thinking you're al-qaeda and that's in this video it says even if you see guns
[36:44.680 --> 36:55.960]  uh it says uh it it's just so sick and it shows somebody creeping around on the airport trying
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.600]  to take a picture with their iphone of the security checkpoint well i just did that the other day
[37:00.600 --> 37:06.120]  right in front of them it's interesting i wanted to show the thug searching an old lady
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.200]  but but the point is is that they say if you're in a national park taking photos you're a terrorist
[37:12.200 --> 37:19.560]  and it tells citizens to tattle on you now when you go to these i i wonder if john elway knows
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.320]  that when you go to one of the actual little training terror seminars they have these tv ads
[37:25.320 --> 37:31.000]  they run they have a terror museum in denver it was saying all about al-qaeda
[37:33.560 --> 37:39.320]  and you just look at the frat boy arrogance and the wannabe dominance and just just just
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.800]  the look on his face when he's doing this the worship of the police state and the worship
[37:43.800 --> 37:48.520]  of spying on your neighbors let me tell you it just made me sick i i don't ever want i already
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.560]  saw him in a shriner's ad where he's acting real punk like with timberlake to each other and they're
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.880]  being real rude to each other and it was just real had mind control written all over it and
[37:57.880 --> 38:01.000]  i didn't like him when i saw that and now i see this and it's just like uh
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.760]  look but again the cops just love it the citizens just love it hey it's john elway
[38:08.760 --> 38:13.640]  he says is my neighbor taking photos and stuff
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.920]  it's amazing and it says if you see anybody trespassing in a field call the police on they're
[38:22.920 --> 38:28.040]  probably terrorists so now people call the cops on you when you're even in your own field if they
[38:28.040 --> 38:33.560]  don't know you in rural areas of texas now if you try to walk from one of your pieces of property
[38:33.560 --> 38:38.680]  to the other on the highway cops will stop and ask why you have a shotgun well jackass uh
[38:41.160 --> 38:49.640]  i'm out here uh walking from one dove field to the next and and listen my uncle no criminal record
[38:49.640 --> 38:57.320]  literally Dudley do right worships the police one of several uncles i have my dad's brother
[38:58.680 --> 39:09.000]  he was driving with the tags on it a bump they uh that my uncle Leonard who's really bad off
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.920]  with pancreatic cancer right now and this is about a year ago probably the last time he'll go deer
[39:12.920 --> 39:16.760]  hunting and he said he was real sick and he said i don't i don't want to have to drive into town to
[39:16.760 --> 39:20.760]  the processor because they usually gut it themselves kind of mistakes but he wanted it made in the
[39:20.760 --> 39:26.120]  sausage and stuff so so so that you know they gutted it but didn't chop it all up and he was
[39:26.120 --> 39:33.480]  going to drive it into fairfield which again my family founders of the town you know in the
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.160]  freestone county historical society in the book they put out founders of it the browns the johnson's
[39:39.160 --> 39:48.840]  the jones's been there since the early 1830s mexican land grants it doesn't matter they pulled my uncle
[39:48.840 --> 39:57.320]  over highway patrol get him out shove him up against the car telling me he's a criminal don't

[44:05.400 --> 44:10.520]  they arrest people in the imaginary show who got guns because it's based in new york where the

[44:47.880 --> 44:50.840]  they're gonna cut all the government i watch this cnn piece today
[44:54.360 --> 44:58.120]  and it said should we pay for illegal alien self-care or should they just die
[44:58.840 --> 45:02.760]  and they cut to this guy going he's gonna be dead if he doesn't get dialysis then they admitted
[45:02.760 --> 45:07.560]  he's getting dialysis but they spun it and lied and said oh well this day because he didn't bring
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.120]  his paperwork he got turned away from the new clinic folks the illegal aliens get free health
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.200]  care everywhere everybody gets free health care it's called charity it's called law hospitals are

[45:34.920 --> 45:39.320]  corrupt they're lobbying for the government takeover health care just like the oil companies are
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.160]  lobbying for the global carbon tax it's the opposite of what you're told in the news
[45:45.160 --> 45:49.560]  and they show the illegal alien and they say there's seven million here there's more like 30
[45:49.560 --> 45:55.160]  the government admits 14 to 16 seeing in lies and they say well he'll just be dead in three months

[46:01.560 --> 46:05.960]  free ticket back to mexico he admitted oh i won't get health care in mexico you think anybody whether

[46:33.080 --> 46:37.400]  we gave to banks was loaned back to us in interest that's why they doubled your credit card rate to
[46:37.400 --> 46:41.640]  30 percent and the federal law doesn't stop that like they keep saying oh that's just for now it
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.920]  just says they got to tell you how they're raping you at the top of the statement you paid tax money
[46:46.920 --> 46:52.520]  to the banks and credit card companies so they could double to loan sharking rates of 30 percent
[46:54.440 --> 46:57.880]  they're going to bankrupt everything and it's going to be just like mexico
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.360]  where everybody's living in shacks you're not it's it but it was like will he die oh we better

[47:51.800 --> 47:56.440]  you'll get thousands of new articles a day and everyone says the dollar's dead i don't believe
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.040]  that's the case it's like a basketball it's going to bounce a few more times or a dead cat bounce but
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.000]  it's going to continue to lose value and gold's going to continue to go up and down but overall
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.680]  on the trend straight up and the stock market's going to go up you know why because you're buying
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.160]  those stocks with the value dollars don't you that's why gold's going up the stock market didn't go up
[48:17.160 --> 48:25.720]  gold didn't go up the dollar went down comprende you got it you could comprehend it it's all you
[48:25.720 --> 48:37.640]  yuppies out there think you know everything and uh well let's bring ted anerson up ted i haven't
[48:37.640 --> 48:44.120]  looked the last hour last time i checked gold was uh i know i went to a hot a day of 1048
[48:44.120 --> 48:51.560]  dollars and 24 cents what is it right now uh last time i looked at dollars it was 1041 70 and hit a
[48:51.560 --> 48:59.640]  high in the trading market here in the united states at 1045 50 i'd hit that 1048 uh best i can tell
[48:59.640 --> 49:10.360]  in the in the in the asian market so well wall street journal says um says 1046 80 and then i've
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.680]  got another one here it's why i'm confused why they all say different numbers here's here's afp
[49:14.680 --> 49:22.280]  in commodity trading gold struck another record high of 1048 43 show whatever it's very high
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.920]  right yeah it is it's high and uh and you got to remember a lot of the services out there
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.000]  only measure what's going on in the new york commodities exchange it's called the comics
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.320]  but that doesn't mean that that's the only commodities exchange in the world
[49:37.320 --> 49:43.720]  as soon as ours closes in the evening the london exchange is open so is the uh tokyo exchange
[49:43.720 --> 49:47.960]  and so on and so forth uh you'll see the asian markets going up you know that's where that's
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.280]  where most of the bull market is coming from right now the united states market tries to
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.920]  suppress gold and bring it back down and the asian market just pushes it right back up
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.640]  and we could see that we see in the trend even on the daily charts it hammers down hammers up
[50:01.640 --> 50:05.560]  hammers down hammers up from the analyst i've read over the years they're saying that's a
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.880]  surefire sign of manipulation well the funny thing is alex that article came out in the
[50:09.880 --> 50:14.440]  independent talking about the of arab's having a secret meeting with russia
[50:14.440 --> 50:19.800]  and also uh and with you know with russia and um i just can't remember all the nations that

[50:24.680 --> 50:29.160]  but now there was a big cover-up story that came out here just right after that so now
[50:29.160 --> 50:33.720]  there there you know they're trying to control the media to tell us oh no this this meeting
[50:33.720 --> 50:38.600]  really didn't happen but the truth of the matter is the market saying it did happen you know though
[50:38.600 --> 50:43.320]  no none of that matters our whole future being destroyed the dollar imploding that doesn't
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.880]  matter what matters is i talked about about john elway because he said we need to come in our houses

[55:23.640 --> 55:28.360]  here yesterday that i believe this morning you told me you can't offer anymore you had gold you
[55:28.360 --> 55:35.160]  bought at the 990 991 level you were selling it in the market when it was 940 it's still up there
[55:35.160 --> 55:40.040]  and rising uh what's the latest buys you've done of gold and silver because that people are buying
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.680]  stuff you bought a month ago cheaper i know you bought some other stuff that's inexpensive compared
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.080]  to what the market is a great deal still tell folks about the deals you've got today well yeah the
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.640]  inventory is moving up just a little bit at this point just because i'm you know my lowest stuff
[55:53.640 --> 56:00.040]  is gone but i do still have francs at 236 excuse me you're well hold on you're still you do still
[56:00.040 --> 56:04.360]  have something from yesterday's ultra low deal well i'll tell i'll talk about that in a second the
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.440]  francs have just edged out three bucks a piece okay it's not the same okay they've gone up three
[56:08.440 --> 56:13.800]  bucks yep and the british sovereign too they're at 291 they're at 288 so yeah there was definitely
[56:13.800 --> 56:19.320]  a price increase in that particular arena the things that i still have at the yesterday's prices
[56:19.320 --> 56:27.000]  the silver walking liberty halves at 869 i haven't moved my Lakota prices yet there's still a 2230
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.040]  and the ten dollar liberty is still at 818 so there are still some things that you can buy at
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.800]  yesterday's price level but the market is very strong we had a lot of people buying yesterday
[56:37.800 --> 56:47.720]  and and all i can say is that you know with the with the price at 1047 1048 that's going to bring
[56:47.720 --> 56:52.440]  that support level up i don't know if i'll have another opportunity to buy again in that 900
[56:52.440 --> 56:58.040]  dollar level so you know i alex i all i can say is that these opportunities to buy low are are
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.240]  slipping away quickly i'm watching the same thing happened that occurred here just a year ago when

[1:00:55.640 --> 1:01:00.760]  bringing in of the global currency which is going to be an str bank to bank that he wrote about
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:07.000]  more than 12 years ago what obama is doing what he's bringing in how they announced the internet's
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.840]  being turned over to a private global corporation the dollar is being shut down obama is now the
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:18.840]  head of the united nation security council the real body with power all these things are happening
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:26.120]  and the the great changes upon us as they expand the tyranny but in the middle of the darkness
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:30.440]  the awakening is exponential i'm seeing that everyone i talked to seeing it but david ike
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:37.480]  seeing it around the world and uh a real focal point of this and do we salute him david ike
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:42.840]  thank you for coming on this right okay this is a quick segment you've got the floor i would
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:48.200]  imagine you'd like to talk about the dollar first then we'll get into the larger clash of the
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:53.720]  titans the clash of liberty and tyranny that we're beginning to see happen yeah well the the crash of
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:58.200]  the dollar has been planned for a long long long long time it's all part of what i've been talking
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:05.320]  about for many many years which is how they're using america to destroy america uh the idea was for
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:13.560]  america to be pulled into overseas wars that that that that stretches them militarily stretches
[1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:20.040]  them financially uh crash the economy because if you're a superpower and you have the military
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:26.200]  and financial might to say no to a world government then the world government's not a tyranny
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:33.640]  across the world it wants every single country subjugated therefore any uh superpower with
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:40.120]  financial and military might to stand alone or stand its ground has to go and this is what we're
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:45.720]  seeing we're seeing the the use of america to destroy america in one way america is being
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:52.440]  used in terms of its military to expand the uh the agenda of conquest and control but at the
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:58.840]  same time it's being destroyed in the process and uh we're now seeing uh countries that have
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:05.240]  been reports in the uh british media this week like china and japan and russia and even the the uh
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:11.560]  the arab countries starting to really move uh towards disconnecting the dollar from being
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:17.720]  the oil currency and the reserve currency and you know the american economy like the british
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:23.800]  one actually is is it reminds me of you know in those cartoons when there's a chase going on
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:29.800]  and eventually the all the people in the chase run over the edge of the cliff and for a while
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:34.440]  they keep running because they don't realize they've run out of land and then someone looks down
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:40.440]  realizes the land is gone and then that uh you know awareness just and they all fall and crash down
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:47.240]  into the into the ravine and and if if people just looked at what the british and american economy
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:55.720]  are standing on at this time it's fresh air it's simple uh illusion it there's nothing there that's
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:04:01.320]  holding it uh together and i've been saying alex in september when they they crashed it first of
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:08.680]  all that there's a three stage process here first crash the economy september 2008 make everyone
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:16.440]  see there's a big problem which needs a solution the solution is stage two and that is throwing
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:23.080]  enormous cuckoo land amounts of money hosing money at the the cause of the problem the bank so it
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:30.520]  disappears in in a great black hole and the idea of stage two is to empty the barrels of government
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:37.320]  in terms of having any response uh to the economic situation that they're facing in other words empty
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:43.320]  their pockets end their credit lines and then stage three which is waiting in the wings and that's to
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:50.360]  crash the economy in it on an even bigger scale than in september 2008 at which point there's no
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:55.160]  response from governments because they have no response to the barrage stay there let's come back
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:05:00.280]  let's come back to bring in the international banking card controlled by the house of rough child the

[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:28.280]  we'll tell you about the events here in the united states and arizona mexico other places
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:33.080]  he's going all over the world big awakening happening but for stations just joined us
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:38.120]  recap david the controlled implosion of the dollar that you've been writing about for over a decade
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:43.560]  the globalist have bragged that to make way for world government and i hear a brag about this on
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:48.440]  npr that we can't have a high standard of living that that hurts the environment to have more than
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:56.520]  one child our carbon footprint babies are bad and uh at the un climate summit in 92 morey strong said
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:02.760]  we must destroy industrial society so they always said they wanted to have a fiat banking system
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:08.280]  get everybody so in debt that there's more debt than there is real tangible assets in the world
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:13.800]  and now they've got conservatively according to economists we've had on between 500 and a thousand
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:20.040]  times more fiat debt they've made that the banks used to buy things than there are real assets in
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:26.760]  all the world at their highest value so this is a complete fraud a total ponzi scheme and here's
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:33.320]  afp agency french press us economic decline forges new world order hundreds of other headlines
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:38.360]  about how good the new world order is how america is now going to get it how the arabes and russian
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:44.040]  china are teaming up but meanwhile the same central banks that own them the global controllers
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:49.080]  they're orchestrating all this so david break down the three phases you talk about starting
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:55.560]  last year with the controlled banking implosion stealing the 23.7 trillion uh saying that it was
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:10:00.680]  going into the secret coffers never spending it on the mortgages and now where we're going from here
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:06.040]  yeah well like i say uh it's planned to be in three stages and they're becoming
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:11.480]  you know blatant uh to crash the economy in september 2009 so that everyone sees there's
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:16.600]  a problem and there's a problem to address so the way they address it is stage two which
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:24.280]  is hosing trillion staggering amounts of credit money fiat money uh at the cause of the problem
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:29.640]  the banks the idea being and of course after the federal reserve and they'll confirm it's
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:36.680]  gone into a black hole and no one knows where it's gone that's the idea and and phase two is about
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.560]  emptying the barrels of governments emptying the pockets of government bringing an end to the credit
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:49.160]  lines of government so they have no further maneuver of response to what is coming in stage three
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:57.400]  and that is to crash the economy on a scale that uh you know make september 2008 look like it look
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:03.400]  like a tea party and the figures you're talking about alex in terms of the the uh fresh air money
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:10.600]  in relation to real resources that's the enormous staggering bubble that they're gonna use to to
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:19.240]  cause stage three and crash stage three and the idea is to destroy america militarily and financially
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:26.600]  so that it is subjugated it comes down to its knees and then it has to uh go cap in hand with the
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:32.760]  beggar bowl to people like china and these other countries that are conspiring now to bring an end
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:38.920]  to america as we know it uh so that and and then they will do what they're told so they will be
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:44.680]  absorbed into the world system and and absorbed into the north american union absorbed into a new
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:50.920]  currency this is all part of it because it's simple if something's working you ain't gonna justify
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:55.160]  changing it if you want to change something you've got to destroy it you've got to make sure it's
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:01.000]  not working so you open people's minds to accepting hey we've got no choice that's what it's all about
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:10.200]  and we we know when um uh britain declared war on germany in uh 1939 there was eight months
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:16.040]  when nothing happened it became known to history as the phony war well the phony war in terms of
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:22.920]  this conspiracy is over we're now at a point where we're going to need to start engaging this and
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:27.400]  with swine flu and the economy and all that all the rest of it even let's go over that the idea
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:33.480]  is to throw everything at us in a short period of time short period of years to bring about this
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:40.360]  global change very quickly because humanity is just exhausted fright and terrified do something
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:46.280]  do something and that's the idea that's why we must stay strong and we must not be subjugated
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:52.840]  by this then and not fall to fear and give our power away as a result well david i want you to
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:57.800]  walk through that step by step and i totally agree with you in the time we have left with you today
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:03.720]  but i want to go back and just point out you eloquently laid out what's happening but this
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:09.560]  is not your opinion this is all in imf world bank documents it's openly stated we told people at the
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:16.680]  time that they would steal the tens of trillions hoard it use it to buy up the economy that they
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:21.560]  were vertically integrating they cut off credit then they hoard the money then they go out and buy
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.880]  everything up for pennies on the dollar that's why they say it's the new economy where you're
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:31.720]  homeless or don't have a job or take a cut and pay it's the jobless recovery because everything is
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:39.160]  gauged by the fiat money changers consolidating global power but that's only part of it demonizing
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:45.480]  the u.s and england's name worldwide with wars putting our troops under un control dhs reports
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:50.120]  demonizing gun owners conservatives those that don't like the new world order or want to end
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:56.440]  the feds suddenly they have stasi tv ads spy on your neighbor suddenly they've enlisted i
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:02.120]  gotten the girl scouts to spy suddenly the boy scouts i mean everything as you said is a quickening
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:10.680]  it has gone a quantum level leap into into malice level hell they are definitely launching their
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:16.200]  operations so go through that go through the flu go through what david ike sees happening but also
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:21.800]  as as the tyranny comes in like a flood liberty is coming in the mass awakening your witnessing
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.320]  the thing is that um it's a simple equation the more you centralize power the more power you have
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:34.200]  to centralize even quicker and that's why the process of centralization has got faster and
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:38.520]  faster and faster through the 20th century eventually reached reach the point where it was
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:43.720]  so blatantly was given a name globalization and that's gone on and on and on and as more and more
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:48.040]  power has been centralized it's had to power to centralize quicker so the whole thing is getting
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.200]  faster and faster and the other thing i mean we've only got half an hour today alex but
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:57.560]  you know it's it's something that i i've been writing about and i'm getting much much deeper
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:03.880]  and more understanding about as the days pass now you know when people look at the speed and all
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.760]  those things you absolutely rightly uh detail there you look at the speed in which all this is
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:12.840]  coming in in all these different areas of our lives in all the different fine detail of our
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:19.240]  lives and it's coming in in a coordinated way to a coordinated timescale this is not people sitting
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:23.640]  around a table saying what's on this move guys this is this is much deeper the rabbit hole is
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:29.800]  much deeper than this and it's in finding uh the source if you like of the rabbit hole that's what's
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:34.440]  going to bring the system down and uh we're going to do that in the next few years no question um it
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:43.160]  is coming down well david i want to talk about that it comes down it's in a far less extreme state
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:49.480]  than it would otherwise be if we do nothing david i want you to get into that kind of a brief
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:52.920]  overview we'll cover it more on monday and talk about your new book and some of the events coming
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:16:02.120]  up but a point you just made about how this is coordinated they are banning homeschooling
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:09.400]  and australia england the us or attempting to simultaneously with the same pr with the word
[1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:15.320]  for word same scripts and i see it in the local news they are banning neighbors including police
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:21.720]  officers keeping each other's children period they are banning garage sales they are banning people
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:29.720]  selling corner fruit stands in the countryside simultaneously worldwide it is all admittedly
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:35.720]  coordinated by this private corporate board break that down and what is the end game how does the
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:42.200]  flu tie into it well the way they can do this alex is is a simple structure it has to be simple it
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:46.680]  looks complex we know what it's all happening as you're talking about it now it looks complex how
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:52.120]  do they do this but actually it's it's a very simple structure it's it's like a transnational
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:57.960]  corporation you've got the headquarters which is overwhelmingly in europe and then uh you've got the
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:05.400]  the subsidiary companies in of the headquarters in each country instead of corporations although
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.680]  they're part of it of course it's secret society networks so you've got a global secret society
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:16.360]  network with with a spider at the center overwhelmingly an operational level in in old europe
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:22.760]  and then in each country like united states you have a subsidiary network of secret societies
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:29.320]  controlled by the bloodline families and their job is to introduce the centrally dictated global
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:37.000]  agenda in their sphere of influence by controlling back countries banking uh media ownership the
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:45.240]  corporations the cartels etc and so this is how they can do it globally as you've rightly described
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:51.000]  of this coordination it's because in each country these subsidiary networks of secret societies
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:57.160]  are introducing the centrally dictated agenda so of course because they're all doing it it's happening
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:04.040]  in every country at the same time this is this is how it's possible and the idea is to to subjugate
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:10.040]  humanity on it on a scale that would make all world wins and there's one area uh alex that really
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:15.560]  does need a lot of focus on uh because i've been seeing so much around the world at different
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:22.840]  aspects of this and that's how the state is after our children you know when you um look at
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:27.400]  older succsley a member of the fabian society one of these strands in the web a major one
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:33.720]  actually uh it is book brave new world he was talking about um hatcheries uh public state
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:39.960]  hatcheries to to produce the children and the children were parted from their parents what you're
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:46.120]  seeing is uh change after change after change what i call the totalitarian tiptoe step by step
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:51.240]  by step which is giving the state more and more control and influence over our children
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:56.840]  and taking it more and more away from our parents so when obama came out outrageously
[1:18:56.840 --> 1:19:02.440]  in the last week or so and called for children to spend more time at school and to school holidays
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:07.400]  to be shortened etc because we have to do this for america no no mr obama you have to do this
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:13.080]  for the agenda of the masters that you dance to the tune of because it's about taking more time
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:19.320]  away from children with their parents taking away more parental influence more individuality
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:25.880]  influence so the state all-encompassing blob mind program can get more access to their minds for
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:30.360]  longer and this is why in britain i'm sure it's happening in america too i'm sure you'll confirm
[1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:36.840]  this but in britain we're having uh children taken away from their parents by social services
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.280]  fact i know it's it's happening in america because i've done some research recently on it
[1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:47.880]  for the most extraordinary reasons for instance we've had a couple they spent 38 000 pounds on
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:53.000]  fertility treatment to have a child um when the social services came around after the child was
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:00.040]  born but just a very very small baby the mother joked that the birth had ruined her figure just
[1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:04.440]  to laugh they took her children away and they're still taking her children away and then what the
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:10.200]  social services say is if you want to see your children at all like once a month or so then
[1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:15.400]  you uh must not challenge our decision otherwise you're never going to see them again and you
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:21.960]  must pay them not kind of here and there one time in a million it's becoming uh more and more
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:27.480]  constant more and more common and even let me throw this out let me throw this out brave new world
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:31.560]  it is all scientifically i've had charlotte israeli the former head of the department
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:38.280]  of education policy that was the plan in the 80s yeah in the family it's all on record that's what
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:43.320]  they say in ecoscience in the family raise everybody in dormitories sterilizes through the
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:50.120]  water supply through the vaccines and yes simultaneously now if you yell at your child
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:55.960]  don't run out in the road that's abuse they take your children no judge no jury no due process
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:21:02.120]  and we know the family courts were set up as eugenics courts in england germany and the us and
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:07.720]  absolutely they're now saying you can't babysit your neighbors kids you can't talk to your neighbors
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:12.040]  kids unless you have a government license and i talk to people that live in england it's happened
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:15.800]  to me when i've been there they come up to you and ask why are you walking your dog are you a
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:21.000]  criminal and and so everyone's being trained to answer questions the secret police are everywhere
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:27.160]  and now in in in europe england and the us they go into the schools and i saw this in bellings montana
[1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:33.000]  when i was there last week at the hotel a whole hotel full of girl scouts being trained by homeland
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:39.720]  security to spy yeah i wasn't reading this in the ap it was in the news i was witnessing it without
[1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:50.440]  even looking david and you know it's interesting the more i research this and i'm more i go down
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:57.560]  these different channels of control manipulation and imposition the more times of the name ross child
[1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:04.120]  ends up at the end of it you know this whole mind manipulation uh brave new world and all the rest of
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:10.600]  it this social engineering comes out of the frankfurt school in germany which moved then into america
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:15.160]  to change the face of america that's what he wants to do the frankfurt school was fundamentally
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:20.840]  connected to the house of ross child um it's the the tavistock institute of human relations is
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:26.760]  another face uh of this or another mask on its face and then you go through the banking system
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:31.880]  which is happening now the ross childs have controlled the banking system globally for um
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:38.280]  as centuries and the more and more as time has come to the present day we we need to focus on
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:46.280]  this dynasty because it really is at the the core the spider of this whole web and they operate in
[1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:52.280]  the background so uh you know once upon a time as you well know everyone knew about the ross child's
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:58.680]  power what they've done through the latter part of the 20th century is hidden hidden behind front
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:04.920]  organizations front nominee directors all the ways that they do it to hide the extent of their power
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:09.880]  it's like um the ross childs are not as powerful as they used to be are you kidding they're more
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:14.280]  powerful than they've ever been well that's what i've researched is every time i research a group a
[1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:19.880]  power group a takeover the environmental movement the carbon tax it's always roth child and which
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:24.280]  is intermarried with the british royals are you saying they're greater than the german house of
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:29.880]  sax coberg goth that you're saying at the very center is the roth childs i'm i'm saying that
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:35.560]  at an operational level it all roads lead to the roth childs you see um you know you've only
[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:40.920]  got to do some some simple background research never mind detailed background research into israel
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:48.600]  and you realize very quickly from the start israel is not israel the land of the jews it's roth child
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:54.840]  land the jews are being played like a violin in uh in israel because and being set up for some
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:24:01.320]  appalling things in in in the future because uh the roth childs own the place um the roth childs
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:06.040]  control the american government that's why the american government gives fantastic extraordinary
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:12.680]  amounts of money to um that small slither of land called israel including enormous military
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:19.960]  spending is because if you if the same force controls both countries governments then one hand
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:23.880]  of the force says give the money and one hand of the force puts its hand out says thank you very
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:30.760]  much for it this is why it goes on this is why israel has nuclear weapons and we have this alex
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:37.000]  tell me it's not true but it is this policy official policy in america not to ask them if they have
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:42.040]  them obama's just confirmed that he's going to continue to that that so we're saying oh great
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:47.960]  danger to the world iran or they might develop a nuclear weapon and then we've got this fantastic
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:55.080]  nuclear arsenal in in in israel of course we've never been slow in using uh high tech weaponry
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:00.360]  it's what we had at the head of the um international energy agency a nuclear energy
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:05.560]  agent atomic energy agency this week saying that the biggest threat to the middle east is the nuclear
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:14.120]  arsenal of of israel mordecai vanunu an israeli uh who who worked in the nuclear industry of course
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:18.920]  he uh came out spoke to a british newspaper the sunday times i think it was some many many years
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:24.120]  ago now decades ago and got clapped in prison and said that hey israel's got got this massive
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:30.600]  nuclear arsenal and he was lured to uh to italy he was kidnapped by mosad and child for 18 years
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:36.360]  now david we've only got five minutes left with you you you said you've got big news for us monday
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:42.920]  about the mass awakening that's happening also the center of the spiderweb uh also uh your new
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:47.960]  book coming out i agree with you the takeover of the family is the key if they're able to tell
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:53.560]  people that they don't have free association the key because it's it's what's happening alex is
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:59.320]  that they're targeting anything that holds people together you know i'm seriously not into religion
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:06.520]  you know that but for many people um the church and stuff is is a it's a it's something that holds
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  people together so they're targeting anything that holds people together just because they
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:16.600]  don't want any structure of others coming together they want to divide us keep us apart and keep us
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:24.280]  lost and and bewildered but for the first time ever in major polls 75 percent or higher no there's
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:29.000]  a global banking cartel no the federal reserves private no the bank of england shareholders
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:35.720]  are private and so all the puppetry and and obama and bush and and and blare to be the head of the
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:42.200]  uan and obama the head isn't it blare you know you gotta be a criminal uh before you can uh you
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:46.120]  can be president of europe of course but the good news is and i want you to speak to this
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:52.840]  is that people now are addressing the shadow government the private banking cartel and i don't
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:58.920]  see that being reversed even by staged wars or bio weapons releases or tony blair running europe
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:06.920]  break it down for us well it's quite simple they have not spent 24 seven uh for decade after decade
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:14.120]  after decade uh keeping uh humanity dumbed down and keeping us in ignorance of what's going on
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:20.440]  because it's a bit of fun they've done it because they know we have the numbers uh they may have the
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:24.520]  military they may have law enforcement they may have the media may have all of these things but
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:29.560]  we've got the numbers uh because the number of people in full knowledge and full awareness of
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:34.440]  what they're doing is a fraction tiny fraction of the number of people on this planet and what
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:39.880]  what terrifies them is enough of those people waking up and seeing what's happening it is happening
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:46.600]  it is uh people are waking up in increasingly large numbers and they may they may seem to be
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:51.000]  you know all powerful they're not they're not all powerful we're going to see that as the year
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:58.680]  next two years past and the part of this uh great next speed of change is panic they've
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:03.800]  got to get the lid down before we we break a threshold and cross the line where enough people
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:07.640]  are aware of this to bring it down and then they say we're getting there we're getting there it
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:11.720]  it may not seem like it it won't seem like it for a while but we're getting there and we will get
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:16.760]  there yes but that makes it doubly dangerous for the new world order and for humanity because i
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.840]  agree with you until about five six years ago they were arrogant they were haughty at least their
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:25.640]  servants were obviously the cold-blooded controllers behind the scenes are very serious and really
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:30.520]  tuned into their luciferian force and putting their own statements and understood but even their
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:35.240]  minions now are scared which is kind of a negative thing because now they're actually really working
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:40.920]  hard really trying to accelerate it so it's a catch 22 it's proving everything we said as they
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:46.280]  announced open world government exactly as we said they would run exactly as we said it would be
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:50.680]  so that's giving us great credibility but the time is short because they're we're under full
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:56.760]  scale launch uh give us in the last minute we've got david uh where you're speaking and what you
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:03.720]  think the time frame is uh on this whole implosion well i uh i'm speaking in santa fey um all details
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:08.120]  on my website david like dot com just go into the site and it's right in front of your eyes uh that's
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:13.480]  this sunday for eight hours and then i'm speaking in phoenix uh which would probably be the last time
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:18.200]  i'm speaking america for a while because of the way things are going in my life at circumstances
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:22.920]  that's on the 17th of october the saturday uh week on saturday and again i'll be speaking for
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:27.400]  eight hours details on the website i tell you what my my time scale is the next few years we're
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:35.080]  gonna uh see this move on and move on and we're gonna think there's no hope uh by by 2015 2016
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:40.040]  this is coming down it's coming down and it's coming down in a very extraordinary way we gotta
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:43.640]  end it let me say bye to you there in the break and max geysers coming up david will be on with us
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:56.120]  for a full hour next monday i'm alex jones we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and

[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.120]  his brain a little bit more about what's really happening with this dollar is this the final plunge
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:55.800]  or is this just the beginning of the dead cat bounce downwards and what will a dollar collapse
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:02.360]  either gradual or more quickly collapsing fastest in a year we've already seen quite a collapse
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:07.000]  last few years uh four or five years is gradual we'll talk to max keiser in a moment i wanted to
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.640]  bring ted anderson owner of the genesis network and also owner of minus resources you know when i buy
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.120]  gold i buy from ted because the deals he offers you the deals we pitch on this show i only want
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:20.360]  the best deals for my audience i tell ted that these alex jones specials of the specials i'm
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:25.400]  getting ted buys gold at nine hundred and ten dollars an ounce he sells it when it's nine uh one
[1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:31.160]  thousand forty he bought into the market at that time at a you know nine ten nine eleven nine twelve
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:37.000]  layer uh nine ninety then last week he keeps selling it at that price till he sells out that's
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.240]  always become one of you know one of the fastest growing in large gold golds little brokers out
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:47.240]  there now he sold out of that stuff at the nine ninety nine ninety five level but he's got it
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:53.080]  at another level way above way below one thousand forty seven and the futures are even higher than
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.080]  that right now we'll talk to max keiser an expert on this in a moment but i wanted to briefly bring
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:36:02.840]  ted up to tell you the coins he's got how long the offer lasts ted anderson yeah yeah well they
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:06.760]  we're going to go till midnight tonight for sure we're we're selling the frank currently right now
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:11.080]  at two hundred and thirty six dollars apiece and the british sovereign at two ninety one
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.240]  we also have the walking liberty have still at that eight sixty nine
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:21.400]  Lakota's at two twenty two thirty and uh you know really it's a it's a great buy across the board
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:25.640]  alex what's going on right now in the market though is that i mean our business volume
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:31.480]  has at least hiked by ten times of where it was just a month ago and every single dealer across
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:36.680]  the united states is experiencing the very same thing and we're all fighting over the same items
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:41.080]  out there in the marketplace so so you're thirty six brokers as you told me last night are up there
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:46.440]  till midnight one every night they're exhausted and you're running out of gold and silver supplies
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:51.400]  at any price so people will find out if they don't buy now they're really going to regret it later
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:55.720]  that's what all the trends and evidence shows well they sure will i mean obviously they're
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:01.080]  going to pay more if they wait at this particular time but uh you know i all i can say alex is that
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:06.200]  the demand is there we're going to end up with short supply just like we did a year ago um the
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:11.720]  the market is much bigger than it was a year ago and the mints are trying to mint more but you
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.040]  know what there's just not enough i mean when you watch the dollar do what it's doing right now
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:21.000]  and the foreign markets doing what they're doing people are just concerned about their their money
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.480]  that they put away from retirement and their savings accounts the money that they have in the stock
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:31.480]  market etc etc and they're turning it over to gold and silver and the you know the demand is bigger
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:36.280]  than the supply that's just the way absolutely now tell people briefly we're going to max keiser
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.880]  the coins you have at the lower price and what you bought these coins that in the market versus
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:47.240]  what it is now the time of savings i'm edging up to the supply that i picked up at that 994 level
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:53.480]  now we were looking at the 988 stuff yesterday uh the francs currently at 236 will be adjusted higher
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:57.880]  as soon as this stuff goes british sovereigns will go higher as well so you're still getting
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:06.920]  something at below the thousand level when it's cresting at 1050 that is yeah a crazy eddy level
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:12.680]  good deal i mean that is that is a fantastic deal the answer the answer to it is if i reprice things
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:16.840]  in today's market it's a lot higher not just a little bit but a lot higher and it isn't going to
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:22.840]  be too long before you know i mean i'm not a i'm not a eccentric billionaire i i have so much money
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:28.120]  that i can buy supply with and that's it my resources are limited so yeah if you're but you're very
[1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:33.960]  competitive and you like blasting the competition and if you buy gold lower and silver go lower
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:38.360]  why not sell it at the lower price instead of doing what most people do jacking it up that's why
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:43.400]  you're growing so fast head that's why we hear your ads on national radio and tv that's why
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:53.560]  minus resources is so respected here's the number briefly 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 gold at that 994
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:39:01.240]  level silver at the even lower level in the market even though it's way up 800 686 2237
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:05.720]  and you can only hold that until uh when i mean i'm going to hold it until tonight i mean just
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:10.120]  because of the fact that even if i have to lose on the deal i will i just appreciate the customers
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:14.840]  in the business and i just think it's the right thing to do people need to get gold and silver now
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:22.040]  800 686 2237 thank you ted thanks elix take advantage of it or you're insane let's go to
[1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:26.680]  max keiser he's not affiliated with me or ted uh does that sound like a good deal to you max keiser
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:34.600]  now i'm sorry they didn't have your mic up say it again oh without a doubt without a doubt
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:40.440]  now now you've been a gold bug for a long time and you've been very successful with that
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:45.240]  let's talk about dollar tumbles on report of its demise you're in paris you've got some
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:51.960]  inside info max keiser of max keiser dot com you've got the floor tell us what's happening right now
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:40:01.480]  well uh you know alex um robert fisk had a great story in the independent in the uk this week
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:07.880]  then he was talking about the oil producing nations in the world they want to get out of
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:15.320]  pricing oil and dollars they want to start pricing oil ends a new currency a basket of currencies
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:23.320]  anything but the dollar because the dollar is uh gives the us a really an unfair advantage
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:29.320]  in the world markets because it any country that wants to buy oil they first have to buy dollars
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:34.600]  because oil only trades in dollars and this is a very unfair advantage that i'm the that the
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:42.440]  us has and what these countries are noticing countries like china russia iran is that the
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:49.240]  us is using the profits that they're making from this monopoly pricing power of the dollar and the
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:55.640]  and the price of oil and what's called seniorage which is they basically get a commission on all
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:02.120]  the dollars that they're producing they're using the profits to you know from their wars to fund
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:07.800]  the pentagon to fund the invasion of iraq or the invasion of agate of afghanistan or now
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:13.960]  you know looks like the invasion of iran and the thing about iran is that iran and china signed
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:23.480]  china signed eight billion dollar deal for oil with iran so china is thinking even though they are
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:30.760]  heavily connected to the dollar and their economy has grown as the result of tying their currency
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:36.280]  to the dollar they're thinking that now it's time to divorce themselves from the dollar
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:42.440]  it's time to kick america to the curb and it's time for these other countries to stretch their
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:48.440]  wings and take over in terms of the the new superpowers and they're they're and i and
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:53.560]  robert's fist basically makes that point and is in his independent article and i can confirm
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:59.080]  pretty much what he's been saying is the same thing i'm hearing here in paris and my contacts
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:04.200]  in the mid east that in fact a a new currency is being formulated a new basket of a new currency
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.280]  that'll be represented by a basket of currencies the only thing a couple of things that robert's
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:14.680]  fist mentioned that i would add is that he mentioned that gold would be a one of the components
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:20.680]  of the the new currency but what i'm hearing is that gold could represent as much as 50 percent
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:28.200]  of the basket in the new currency and this is what's driving gold higher now because banks
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:34.120]  and you know central banks have stopped selling their gold and the investor banks and wall street
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:40.440]  and and other places are starting to accumulate gold and i think gold could be you know it could
[1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:46.040]  go into a bubble phase it could be like a dot com bubble or a real estate bubble you know they need
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:51.000]  a bubble in america to keep things rolling on wall street to keep the bonuses flowing and people
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:55.880]  have been questioning what is going to be the next bubble is it going to be carbon credit is it going
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:00.280]  to be green investment green investments is it going to be commodity investments is it going to be
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:06.680]  gold and gold could be a huge bubble uh you could see the price spike you could see the price go to
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:11.720]  two three four thousand dollars an ounce if that's what goldman sacks and these guys decide
[1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:19.000]  is going to be there the next gravy train for you know their their big bonuses uh and i'm hearing
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:24.760]  i'm hearing some other things in europe some really interesting things uh which um you know i've been
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:30.760]  if you you know but anyway that's that's my car hold on a minute max max i want to hear your inside
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:35.560]  info you you handed it that yesterday on their national television i'd like you to because i
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:40.920]  know you don't make stuff up give us entree into your inside info we'd really appreciate it all
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:44.440]  all those investors and people out there that want to know what's happening because you are there in
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:50.920]  that major crossroads of paris but before we get to that uh you know there's something larger going
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:57.160]  on here i read club of rome and un documents and rocker filler documents 15 years ago that they'd
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:03.880]  written years before that you know 20 years ago that they plan to use the us uses a military to
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:09.320]  set up world government then blame everything on us implode the dollar and bring in a new bank to
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:14.280]  bank currency and then have regional currencies they don't want to have one global currency that
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:19.800]  they manipulate and play the markets on a global scale so there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:24.680]  and that now russia and china are basically oh owned and controlled by these interests and that the
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:30.600]  us is just having all the debt piled on it and and that they're preparing to kind of seal the deal
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:38.600]  or swap spit or become blood brothers uh by by torching the u.s. into third world them uh and so
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:43.080]  that and so that china and russia in the middle east shouldn't be celebrating so much sure the
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:49.080]  us is the drunk husband that comes home you know every night in cold coxham uh but but they're
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:54.840]  getting out of bed with the u.s. and getting in bed with the lz bob well i mean break it down
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:45:02.280]  very simply it's it's very simple to to put in in the following terms 75 percent of all the
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:07.960]  transactions in the world take place in u.s. dollars it is the world's reserve currency
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:14.360]  and that's the way spent since the end of world war two and it is the basis of america's hegemony
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:20.120]  around the world and it's you know america has a soft empire as well as a hard empire i mean they
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:26.040]  have of course their embassies and they have uh their facilities all over the world uh but the
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:31.880]  dollar has really been the means by which they have it in the major influence around the world
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:38.520]  and you know that what these what these countries like russia and china in iran of course signed
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:44.120]  the shanghai cooperative organization the fco if you look that up on google you'll find out all
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:50.840]  about it they have a mutual defense pact if america hits iran uh china and russia have pledged
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:57.400]  to side with iran and strike back basically so it's just economics and china has a deal with
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:03.880]  iran for eight billion in oil and america seems addicted to war to feed their machine you know
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:10.520]  last year 2008 alex the u.s. collected about two and a half trillion in taxes and 100 percent of
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:16.680]  that money went to two places bailouts on wall street and the defense contractors now that's
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:22.440]  an incredible statistic 100 percent of all income tax collected last year two and a half trillion
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:28.360]  went to either bailouts or military there's no money going anywhere else and uh you know this
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:34.920]  is just setting up the the the dollar as really uh the the leper with the most fingers you know
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:40.840]  it it or i should say it's the leper with the least fingers it's a currency that nobody wants
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:47.160]  anymore and they're putting in place these other currencies and they're looking at gold because
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:52.440]  gold is the only way that they can have any accountability and that they can have any way
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:58.360]  of hoping to escape all of the debt meisters they're on wall street yeah not being shy
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:02.520]  stood by the money changers that are always creating tens of trillions and fiat money and
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:08.440]  then using it as weapons economic and military weapons against them now the the vampires of
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:14.040]  central banking the best the dirtiest route of europe in the u.s. obviously but china and other
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:18.120]  people play their games the arabs have their own system of banking but they don't allow the usury
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:23.640]  we're up to 30 loan sharking rates here in the u.s. now with the credit card population so much so
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:28.760]  that people are kicking the habit going to debit cards debit cards for visa this week finally passed
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:33.320]  more use than credit card so that's something healthy out of all this but but but will the
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:39.720]  goldman sacks vampires just move on after they've eaten the bones off of the united states or are
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:46.200]  they dependent i mean is this their transylvanian earth is england israel the united states
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:52.280]  germany france is that is that count dracula's earth that he can go anywhere but he's got a
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:59.000]  haul those caskets around i mean is there any way to kill the vampire with a silver spike
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:05.320]  a spike made of silver in other words the thing that goldman sacks and these guys on
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:12.200]  wall street hate is uh... golden silver because it's the opposite of a fiat money system you know
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:17.320]  i've told people for years now if they want to kill goldman sacks better than a hammer as you might
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:23.400]  say if everyone bought one out of gold going on and the price traded immediately up to its inflation
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:29.480]  adjusted normal price of two thousand dollars an ounce it would remove ninety percent of goldman
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:34.760]  sacks and jp morgan's ability to spin cotton candy derivatives out of uh... you know pulling it
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:41.000]  out of their their backsides and claiming that this has some validity in the market and that's why
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:44.680]  that they just hate gold and that's why they've done everything since melvin freeman and alan
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:50.360]  greyspan and bamburn anke and timber tim geithner all their rhetoric all their white papers all their
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:55.640]  doctoral dissertations have all been about the greatness of fiat currency and fractional reserve
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:00.360]  banking and why gold is dead now what's happening now let me get into this what's happening is that
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:05.480]  these countries that are gold that are petroleum exporters are saying enough is enough we don't
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:11.000]  care what the what the uh... risk at this point because we're sick of america's wars we're sick
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.040]  of all the market manipulation we're sick of gold and sacks manipulating the comax and the nimex
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:20.040]  we're just going to introduce our own basket our own currency we're going to put gold in there it'll
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:27.000]  be the first gold back security currency since 1971 when the u.s. dollar still had some tenuous
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:32.440]  connection to gold but there really hasn't been a gold but the last time they did that the globalist
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:38.200]  blew the hell out of iraq shang that wmds now the arabs are getting ready to do it again and notice
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:44.680]  they found secret reactors that the easter bunny laid well yeah of course you know uh...
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:50.440]  arax said that they wanted to start trading oil in euros and the next thing you know we
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:58.760]  shock it off and then um... iran started saying we want to trade our oil in euros and suddenly
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:04.120]  you know the game was moved over to iran but but here's what i'm hearing and this is kind of the
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:09.240]  interesting story if you will you know stacey herbert and i made a really interesting film a
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:15.800]  couple years ago about gold and we interviewed folks over at the bundesbank in germany and at
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:21.960]  that time uh... it was we we it was revealed to us anyway that uh... there are three thousand
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:28.280]  tons of gold uh... much of it was held outside of germany and held in fact in the united states
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:33.400]  and what i'm hearing now alex is that germany like france did back in the sixties they're going to
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:38.760]  demand a gold bullion delivered to them the physical gold you know back in the sixties
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:45.720]  uh... the gall sent ships warship to new york and forced america to put their gold francis gold
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:50.600]  onto a ship stay there ship it back to europe stay there and he wouldn't let nato in his country

[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:59.720]  if you want to support alternative film this shows who the bankers are how they're operating what
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:05.000]  they're doing how to stop them and uh max just briefly because i want to get into what it will
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.960]  look like as the dollar dies in the different scenarios you're saying it's baked into the cake
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:15.400]  it's going to happen and then that more of that inside info about the gold missing and you said
[1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:20.600]  comics would default we've seen some big gold suppliers have been defaulting your crystal ball
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:25.800]  is really firing on all eight cylinders here but but briefly you've seen the trailer for the new
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.800]  trailer that's got you in the end of it going the matches you know these are arsonists and
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:33.240]  they're asking congress for more matches and they say who do we send the check to who do we send
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:37.400]  the check to here you need more matches how many more matches is a ton of matches good
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:42.760]  do you like that trailer max geyser it's a brilliant trailer and i think the part that i'm
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:47.240]  in is especially brilliant i'm well it is the closer it is especially brilliant
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:56.280]  yeah i know i think uh your last film uh the obama deception you know that came during a time
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:04.600]  when i was still we know basically had one foot in the obama camp and uh now i have both feet out
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:11.000]  of the obama camp so uh you know that was really a bold uh film to make at the time because a lot
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.280]  of people were still in love with obama and he had really hypnotized everybody into thinking
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:21.880]  that he was really different than the preceding nightmare in the white house and uh you know
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:27.160]  i was half fooled i must say but uh now you're this film for all the republic i think it's
[1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:31.720]  going to take it further i think you know it's interesting alex is that uh i think your film
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.040]  is going to be a lot more hard hitting than that michael more film capitalism a love story i think
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:41.240]  he's kind of a kind of a cream puff uh attacking the problems i think your film is going to be a
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.480]  lot more hard hitting because don't you have john perkins in the film the economic hit man oh yeah
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:51.640]  we got everybody we john perkins is in it yeah okay so i think it's going to be a lot more hard
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:58.280]  hitting but anyway getting back to the dollar um you know the us dollar the um these countries
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:03.240]  that the oil exporter they want to get out they want to get another currency to compete
[1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:10.200]  basically with the u.s and their objective quite simply is to they want to um they're being competitive
[1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:14.040]  they want to put the u.s economy out of business which means that they want to put the u.s dollar
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:20.920]  out of business and they can do so because their this new era is an era that's going to be dominated
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:26.200]  by countries that actually have resources and we're talking about oil we're talking about
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:31.400]  natural resources and those countries that have been living on creating mortgage back
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:35.880]  collateralized debt obligations stay there because because of the the last break interrupted you on
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:39.960]  the missing gold and the gold then you went back into the dollar let's come back in one minute

[2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:40.280]  tell me it doesn't make any sense but the point is max you were trying to get into the gold demanding
[2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:45.960]  the gold a year or two ago you broke that there was missing gold now that's mainstream media you
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:52.840]  talked about defaults uh you're going on with gold producers that's now happening kind of a train wreck
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:57.480]  as demand spikes then let's get into that inside info that you keep trying to get into about the
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:03.160]  dollar and and more of what's really going on with the arabs and you're saying a faster timetable
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:08.920]  than the one we've been hearing about of five years go ahead yeah well okay you know the
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:16.120]  getting back to the gall in the sixties the infra over there france you know france demanded that
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:23.720]  the u.s return the gold that was held on deposit in new york and they forced the u.s to do so and
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:30.280]  then um the britain because france was very nervous about the fact the way that the u.s was
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:37.160]  going in heavily into debt to pay for the vietnam war uh and um so then britain was uh next to
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:43.000]  line to start demanding their gold and then at that point 1971 uh nixon said no no we're
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:48.920]  going to close the gold window and this was the beginning really of the era of fiat currencies
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:52.920]  and the beginning really of of the era of derivatives because shortly thereafter in
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:58.760]  chicago they started trading options based on the uh black and shul option derivative
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:04.920]  volatility formula and you have now the modern era of derivatives which is an era of making money
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:11.080]  from transactions and not making money from actually doing anything like it would resemble
[2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:17.560]  business and but and this has led to incredible booms and incredible busts they had ever since then
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:22.920]  you've got just a flash forward to modern times you have the dot com boom the real estate
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:28.200]  and then crash the real estate boom and crash now the banking boom and crash and now these
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:34.040]  countries that are emerging like um russia china iran are saying we know what's going on here the
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:39.960]  u.s is simply printing up lots of phony baloney money to pay for their debts and this is uh
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:44.680]  not what we're going to be on board for because we're using all this money also to finance your
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:50.120]  wars so the one way we're going to stop you from financing wars what it's basically the way that
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:54.200]  iran china and russia are going to stop america from invading iran is they're going to crash the
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:59.240]  dollar i mean that's it's global financial warfare they don't have to fire a shot they
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:03.160]  don't have to fire a missile they're going to crash the dollar and that's going to put america
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:09.000]  military and america out of business that's the game plan and and germany knows this and germany
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:12.680]  is right nervous because they've got something like three thousand up to three thousand tons of
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:17.080]  their gold held in new york but didn't they just ask for that didn't they just start asking for the
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.440]  gold a few months ago they're starting to make rumors we they're starting to make these requests
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:27.640]  starting to get because they're they're putting out a feeler to see whether the how the u.s is
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:33.240]  going to respond it's suicide for the u.s to attack around because it's going to implode the dollar
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:38.120]  and it's going to force countries like germany to demand all their gold bullion back from new york
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:42.760]  and tim geithner's old bank the new york fed and they're going to show up and they're going to
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:46.360]  demand their gold bullion and gold bullion is going to skyrocket and all these banks are going to
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:51.640]  be completely put out of their fiat currency money-spitting games and you're going to have another
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:59.080]  huge down leg in uh... in in markets but this is a question robert fisk talking about robert
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:03.720]  fisk in his article for the independent you know robert fisk is a great journalist he's talking
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.840]  about the gold producing countries are now i'm sorry the oil producing exporting countries are
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:14.520]  going to start trading oil and dollars and what i would add to that is you've got now germany in
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:19.800]  response to the the the chaos is going to result in terms of the dollar is going to demand and we
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:24.040]  do we talk we know we made that film alex is on the web i forget the what the name of the film is
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:29.320]  but you see me in the bundesbank in berlin i'm talking to officials inside the bundesbank and
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:35.240]  we have like a hidden camera and they're saying that things that they you know revealed things
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:40.920]  that were quite revealing in terms of who owns the gold where's the gold the gold anti-trust
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:46.280]  action committee put out a letter just two weeks ago uh... which uh... they they picked up on the
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:51.960]  story and they they've required the bundesbank uh... to to make a comment about this film and
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:57.000]  and uh... and to confirm where the gold has been is held there's also a movement about to
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:02.200]  ought to stay there gotta break we'll come back talk about have you ever wanted to generate your own
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:07.400]  supply of electrical power if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:12.280]  solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in toms in illinois these
[2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:16.920]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:22.600]  gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:27.560]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps short
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:33.000]  wave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:37.640]  brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:05:37.640 --> 2:05:43.320]  when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solutions from science

[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:40.520]  new trailer dealing with television mind control for fall the republic and i want to air the new
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:45.400]  trailer we aired yesterday too that you're in the next week we've got another trailer on the
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:51.080]  financial section it's about a third of the film that also has you in it but but finishing up what
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:56.920]  will it look like through a gradual death of the dollar you're saying it's baked into the cake to
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:02.920]  quote you versus a fast one and what do you see happening what will the united states look like
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:11.000]  how do people protect themselves well the uh... the the protection obviously is to
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:16.760]  be into precious metals as i've been saying for five years you know my average cost in gold is
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:21.640]  i think four hundred and twenty dollars a month and i've been saying basically the only thing
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:27.640]  i've recommended in the last four to five years is gold gold bullion and uh... it's an excellent
[2:09:27.640 --> 2:09:33.960]  place to be uh... as we go forward now the u.s. dollar is uh... coming under a lot of
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:37.880]  economic pressures also coming under a lot of political pressure that's something that a lot
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:42.600]  of people who are pure economists are not factoring into their analysis about factoring in the fact
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:47.880]  that the dollar has become a a weapon at the currency market is is where this world war three
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:52.920]  is being fought and so they're looking at charts and they're looking at analysis and they're looking
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:59.080]  at their textbooks but nothing in these charts and textbooks it really covers when you use currencies
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:04.280]  like as a weapon and that's what we're seeing happen now the people in that they said russia
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:08.920]  ran in china are saying the way we're going to stop america from invading iran is we're going to
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:13.480]  we're going to smoke the u.s. dollar we're going to take it down we're going to crush the u.s. dollar
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:19.400]  and we're going to force the u.s. to go into a major economic tailspin as a way to engage in
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:25.000]  economic warfare that's the way world war three is going to be fought now for y'all as i've been
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:33.080]  saying gold bullion is a place to be the dollar is at the very least it's going to be extremely
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:39.000]  volatile you're just going to start to see 10 20 percent moves every you know it can be compressed
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:44.280]  into very short periods of time and that's going to be very scary for people but again if you if
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:50.360]  you're defensive and you got some gold bullion gold or silver bullion you're going to have a you
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:57.960]  know that's the place to be during this period of extreme volatility and that the story is not
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:02.520]  different the only thing different is that that the timeline is being compressed and things are
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:07.320]  happening a lot you know things are happening now they were not talking about a concept that might
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:12.040]  happen in a few years we're saying right now there are people you look at what happened
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:17.880]  the last two weeks you had a g20 meeting a g7 meeting international monetary fund was meeting
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:22.120]  the un was meeting and they're all talking about the same thing what to do about the dollar all
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:26.200]  these guys while the kids in america are sitting playing with the hula hoops and they're you know
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:31.880]  the latest video games the parents their parents being the imf the world bank and the g7 or it's
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:36.760]  ours are in the kitchen sitting around the kitchen table deciding what to do with these kids in
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:41.240]  america and their dollar and their currency so the the kids are going to wake up one day and
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:46.920]  find out that oops mommy and daddy decided to devalue the dollar by 50 percent oh i guess that
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:52.440]  means everything is going to cost twice as much and i guess we're now in the third world oh okay
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:57.880]  but they're making those decisions right now and it's tragic that the mainstream media in america
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:03.960]  is not telling the people in america what does being discussed at g7 g4 g20 right now they're
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:10.760]  deciding america's future right now in the back rooms of these meetings right now and uh obviously
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:16.680]  with china iran and and uh russia they're not they're not being coy about it they're coming
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:22.520]  out there and they're saying you know what we're sick of you market manipulating you know folks in
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:27.160]  the u.s and now you know guns are drawn we're going to start attacking this dollar and we're
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:31.320]  going to start buying up gold aggressively and germany is caught in the middle and they're saying
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:36.280]  oh my god we've got like 3 000 tons of our gold in new york we want it back when germany makes
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:40.920]  an announcement the gold's going to go to you know it's going to have a huge move by the way let me
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:49.160]  just add this cnbc is now predicting two thousand dollar announced gold saying their charts show that
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:58.360]  uh that's up on prisonplanet.com one of the top stories and you've got a fraction of the public
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:03.560]  waking up that gold is important and that actually has intrinsic value and and can't be devalued
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:08.680]  completely and it's probably only going to go up and is going up right now what is going to happen
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:16.360]  when the yuppies decide gold is cool how high could it go well that's what i was talking to at the
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:24.680]  top of the show the if in fact the the powers that be on wall street goldman's axe and jp morgan if
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:30.680]  they figure out that the easiest bubble to try to inflate to pay themselves huge christmas bonuses
[2:13:30.680 --> 2:13:38.600]  this year or next year if they decide it's gold then then they could go really there's the as we
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:46.840]  used to say at wall street um there is no top so it could be like google stock going from 20 bucks
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:52.760]  to 500 yeah exactly you know when i was working on wall street you know and and you know i worked
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:59.080]  on wall street in one capacity or another during the boom of the 80s during the dot com of the of
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:05.800]  the 90s and you know you had in the 90s and dot com stocks that would go public at 16 and trade to
[2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:14.920]  300 and then they return back to you know 16 again but uh so gold could be if they decide that gold
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:20.760]  and it hasn't gold been in a bear market up until just a little past few years during the entire
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:26.360]  bull market on wall street that started in 1982 gold just went down every single year because
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:31.400]  nobody wanted it and it was being trashed by all the central banks who were selling gold to buy
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:36.680]  t-bills to use as collateral to create collateralized debt obligations and cart the fault flops and
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:44.440]  it's huge parties that became the us and global market that hit the skids in summer of 2007 when
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:48.760]  chuck print ceo of the city group said you know as long as the music's playing we're going to keep
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:55.560]  dancing and then that week the bmp came out of the report saying our hedge funds have a lot of junk
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:14:59.400]  bonds in there and we don't think the value is a hundred cents of the dollar we think it's zero
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:03.960]  cents of the dollar and that was the beginning of what we now know is the the financial crisis
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:09.320]  that we're all suffering from today now uh there was an attempt back in the latter part of last
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:15.880]  year to inject uh 12 or 13 trillion dollars worth of new loans into the economy and you're seeing
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:22.360]  the stock market bounce and you're seeing some quote-unquote green shoots but now that these
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:27.960]  all these stimulus packages have ended the clunkers cash for clunkers etc now we're going back to
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:33.480]  reality when the reality is that all that obama these guys did with it just lay another uh few
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:38.600]  trillion dollars with a debt on top of the debt layer cake and the whole thing is just it didn't
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.320]  didn't stop it from collapsing and we'll go right back to where we were last year in the year before
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:48.280]  by the end it within six months there's going to be banks going to congress saying if you don't give
[2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:51.560]  us another five trillion dollars we're going to do another we're going to do a suicide mission
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:55.640]  we're going to blow ourselves up which is what paulson did if you remember he said give us 700
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:59.320]  billion dollars we're going to blow up this entire economy he was like one of these suicide
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:03.320]  bombers and for our congress he strapped on like five trillion dollars with a derivative
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:07.960]  contract that he was going to explode in everyone's face and now you know that that's
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:14.600]  going to come again so uh you know the point being that the rest of the world is saying hold on
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:20.440]  we've seen this movie before we're we don't we don't want to play this game anymore we've got
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:25.720]  the oil you don't have the oil plus you know a lot of these countries are dealing with the fact
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:29.960]  that you know i don't know if you follow this or not alex but you know i think it may go against
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:36.520]  some of your your orthodoxy but the fact is in countries like mexico which is one of the three
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:43.160]  biggest oil fields in the world can't around their production is nose diving it's down sharply and
[2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:48.280]  these big fields around the world i know we may have a slight conflict that are put thoughts on
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:53.960]  this but these big oil fields around the world their their production numbers are diminishing well
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:59.240]  you're certainly right you're certainly right there's six and a half going on seven million people
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:03.560]  and you're going to have fights over fewer and fewer resources there is a lot of oil and stuff
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:08.120]  but it's still a big job to find it and get it out and you're absolutely right there's pressure
[2:17:08.120 --> 2:17:13.240]  everywhere max i'm going to come back and play the new trailer uh because i know you've got to go
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:19.560]  but before we end you were telling me you've got a new project first time i heard of this
[2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:27.400]  at uh your pirate my film dot com website oh yeah well pilot my film my website is anybody can
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:31.960]  list a movie and try to raise money for their movie and i've got a few movies listed i've got a
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:36.360]  movie called where's kenny boy i'm going to try to go down to paraguay and find ken lay because
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:41.400]  i think he's still alive and living down in paraguay i also have a movie called both more jihad
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:46.520]  it's about uh who made the most money with options on 9 11 and i got a story going down
[2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:51.000]  to baltimore maryland and talking to the bankers who made all the money on 9 11 trading options
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  so that's a project called both more jihad then i've got a new project called alex the wonderland
[2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:03.160]  and it's a it's a it's a fantasy project it's about the mainstream media in america suddenly
[2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:09.080]  adopts alex jones has their mainstream media outlet and what would happen if suddenly every
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:14.840]  you know mainstream media started to take on what you've been saying now for 14 years and adopting
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:22.360]  it as the as the main message so what gave me this what gave me the big idea was the hardened
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:29.480]  montana story because to me that is the first major story to to bleep from alex jones to
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:35.640]  mainstream and not the first but i'm saying it's a huge story that went from alex jones
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:42.200]  infowars to to mainstream media in a in a huge way and i'm so this is a little project i'm
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:47.640]  putting together and it's about how mainstream media goes alex jones well i'm honored and i
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:51.400]  think that'll make a good film but i think the worst kenny boy will be even more interesting

[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:56.840]  here it is most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies drama is
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:02.360]  therefore nothing more than their entertainment and never ever was that case throughout history
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:08.120]  social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large populations bringing entertainment
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:14.280]  to thousands of people right in the comfort of our own homes you're actually in an alpha states
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:20.280]  being completely downloaded with new ideas a cult of personality can be manufactured to influence
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:26.440]  the masses nobody will question what he's doing they'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:33.000]  he's wearing yes we can the idea of making it into a celebrity eventually he said they will expect
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:39.320]  the media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them and that's happened today the scientific
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:45.880]  dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick and they're using it against us these cells
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:52.440]  are scanned by a stream of electrons completing 30 pictures a second it's hard for people like that
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:57.720]  to take a serious interest in what their elected officials are doing they've been programmed it's
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:03.720]  obama's role to front for the international banking syndicate barack obama is a puppet of the new

[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:25.960]  and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives you got time to watch
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:32.440]  baseball you got time to entertain yourself but a knowledgeable public we're losing kill your
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:37.560]  television or at least turn it off a few hours a day the children aren't even playing in your
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:44.680]  front yards anymore we don't want to live under a world government of the corporations by the
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:55.160]  corporations and for the corporations fall of the republic fallium one the presidency of barack
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:04.600]  obama obama is the latest version of 21st century mass mind control available on dvd at info wars

[2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:21.240]  coming out next week in the fifth the day before it comes out we got some special sneak peeks to
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:26.520]  for folks just at prison planet dot tv for the balance of the radio show of a quick economic
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:35.400]  uh coverage the last five minutes is uh allen watt joining us from canada allen so much is
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:39.640]  happening they're imploding the dollar they're bringing in world government they're openly
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:43.560]  saying no babysitting no selling watermelons on the side of the road we're going to give you
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:50.120]  a hundred thousand dollar fines for garage sales the same plans in europe in asia in the us are
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:55.560]  being implemented same names open announcement of world government there's no more debating it
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:01.320]  this is the true emergence i want to go over all of this with you today but before we get into that
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:08.360]  what is most important right now uh in the mind of allen watt in your deep reflection and analysis
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:13.560]  as you cut through the matrix uh what's what's key that's developing right now that that allen watt
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:20.600]  thinks we should all know about i think you should know what the new world order really is uh it's
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:28.200]  um it's a non-democratic system a world to be ruled by experts and professionals from all
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:33.880]  different sciences including all the social sciences they go under the term of world peace
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:40.040]  and that sounds nice and fuzzy to most people but when you break down and their own writings
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:47.400]  from their own writings what they mean by world peace it literally is a form of totalitarianism
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:54.200]  from birth to grave uh to do with uh in fact they wanted to separate the children completely from
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:59.800]  parents so they wouldn't be contaminated with all fashion values and ideas but they're found
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:06.760]  with scientific indoctrination at kindergarten onwards any parental input is made null and void
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:11.240]  and so they are they're pretty well reached that stage they can literally program uh the generations
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:18.440]  every within every intake every year of kindergarten upgrade incrementally for what they will experience
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:22.040]  in their lifetime and they'll accept that which they experience because they've been taught at
[2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:28.920]  school as coming uh so what you're looking at really the totalitarian world system a deep
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:36.040]  population plan is at the top of it too uh the unfit as they call them in a post-industrial era
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:40.280]  remember to all the scientists across the world now and all the professions believe in evolution
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:45.640]  it's taught right off the bat they believe in Darwinian evolution survival of the fittest
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:50.840]  they believe that we're the old man all the old types used to work in factories uh the blue collar
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:56.440]  workers are now obsolete with the emergence of science and robots and genetic technology
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:40:02.280]  they can create new types of better servants and not as many as they have now all of this is
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:07.720]  coming down the pipe as we see even the move as you say to stop neighbors from looking after your
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:12.760]  child for a couple hours when they run off for some groceries is forbidden across the board in all
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:19.560]  the countries at the same time as you say and that is also to stop contamination uh and bonding
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:25.240]  to other people in your little locality with old-fashioned ideas it's okay to put them into
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:31.000]  a recommended state approved daycare place for a day because they get the correct kind of induction
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:36.520]  and simultaneously Europe in the u.s and england and canada announced they want year-round school
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:41.720]  and the internal documents 20 years ago said to break up the families entirely they've got the men
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:46.280]  and women working overtime so they can't spend time with their kids and then if you want to use
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:52.440]  the neighbor in fact it even said in england bbc two groups of police officers aren't allowed to
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:57.800]  watch their own kids and the thing was wow even the godlike police aren't allowed to watch their
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:04.440]  their kids that's great and then now 20 000 homes in england they have cameras watching the kids
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:09.320]  that they go to bed on time eat what they're supposed to this is Orwell yes and instead that's a
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:14.840]  pilot project for the rest of the country and whatever happens in britain eventually very
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:19.080]  rapidly actually is introduced across the british commonwealth and we're still a commonwealth we're
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:25.080]  still basically a subsidiary of britain and and then the u.s picks up very quickly too everything's
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:30.040]  working together because we're already under a global system we have been for a long time
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:39.960]  and before even the war started on iraq the first one gulf war one where we fed on the news that
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:44.600]  we're all global global global we went back to being national again when they wanted recruits for
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:50.520]  the military they've kept that up for face value but in reality they've really rolled ahead with
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:56.120]  the globalism and every law really that comes down to every nation comes from one of the departments
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:00.280]  of the united nations is signed into treaty automatically and all the countries and we're
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:07.000]  going to speak more about that but since you mentioned the military notice how in march of last
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:14.680]  year in the u.s in england and in canada but also in ireland and scotland simultaneously because i'm
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:22.200]  just like you do scanning all the western media also asian media that's in english simultaneously
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:28.840]  on the same day they deployed troops in downtown cities and said oh they're just helping with drunk
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:34.440]  drivers helping with checkpoints and now it's and then they go oh yes it's for terrorists
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:40.440]  and for gun owners so right as they implode the economy they deploy the troops worldwide
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:47.560]  and then admit it's global i mean it's all a private corporate borg deploying this now coming
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:53.720]  after our farms and ranches our children any form of independence yes the leader of the plan a long
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:58.760]  time ago when they set up the league of nations the forerunner of the united nations and in their
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:04.520]  own charter they said eventually they ban all private property they'd also have to eradicate
[2:43:04.520 --> 2:43:10.920]  farming because farming was too important to be left to farmers big corporations would would run
[2:43:10.920 --> 2:43:16.520]  the farming of the world we're simply going through a pre-planned agenda but now with the
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:21.160]  century of change and that's the key to it this is the century of change that all academia
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:27.800]  was talking about for for 50 odd years uh were into the century of change it's not democratic
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:36.360]  we see now the rise of this entity this legal entity of of the EU economic union as a sovereign new
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:43.960]  soviet a bigger soviet system than the old soviet system non-democratic that admits in its own
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:49.000]  publications and in the major media that all the decisions are made by an executive branch at
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:55.400]  the top with secret committees and the politicians have no input into the lawmaking all they can
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:44:03.320]  do is complain and that's it this is not a post democratic world written and when you read the
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:09.480]  writings of the big players in the last 50 to 100 years involved in these international movements
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:15.240]  like the Huxley's like both the Huxley's in fact Julian and Aldo Huxley and Russell and others
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:22.520]  they they stay straight out that this world will be run by a form of scientific dictatorship
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:27.320]  where the public will simply obey that's the whole key to everything now is obey you're an
[2:44:27.320 --> 2:44:33.880]  animal we didn't retrain you like any animal the Pavlovian concept and your job is to serve the
[2:44:33.880 --> 2:44:39.000]  world state that now Alan I want to bring up a key point here and I want you to speak to this
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:46.280]  studying their operations at the heart of it they are social Darwinists they're saying if we kill
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:52.520]  a billion people since we are in the position of power that means genetically we got the power
[2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:59.240]  because we were the best and so we're helping the earth by killing you they're testing soft kill
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:04.280]  weapons sterilization yeah as the White House scientists are spoke about I want to go over this
[2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:11.080]  with you today but more than that they get the general public to adopt the eugenical eugenics
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:16.120]  ideas but they don't even consciously know why of yeah humans are a parasite yeah there's too many
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:20.280]  of us we don't have art and literature and spacecraft and you know we can't do incredible
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:26.600]  things which we actually are the an incredible species a wonderful species a self-aware species
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:34.120]  you know but but the elites believe their gods they believe they're wonderful and and and they
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:40.280]  want to control the future and so they only sell the public on lowering their survival instinct
[2:45:40.280 --> 2:45:45.320]  so they will accept and make it a religious sacrament dying for their carbon footprint
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:53.240]  or not having children or or being sacrificed to the earth and so this idea that man is crud
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:58.680]  man is crap they sell this and sell this and say you have no rights you're just an animal
[2:45:58.680 --> 2:46:04.280]  it's a mind game it's it's a huckster scam to say you can make no decisions you're just programmed
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.240]  but then oh the elites have to have their rights they have to have their bodyguards
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:15.240]  oh they're free they they they write all this sick dark nihilistic poetry about how they control
[2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:21.160]  everything and they'll destroy everything if they want to so so inherently these are very sick
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:27.720]  evil control freaks there's no doubt about it at all it's a religion with them it's a complete
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:35.480]  it fulfills all the criteria of a religious belief system and superior genetic uh basically
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:40.280]  hereditary genetic stock that's what they believe in that are from it um they believe that we are
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:45.320]  the leftover junk genes at the bottom otherwise we would be up at the top that's a simple reasoning
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:52.040]  that they have and they believe in power total power is the main key to survival therefore
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:58.040]  they're the ones at the top with the total power and they do plan to exercise that they are exercising
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:03.720]  it now i just went through stuff that was released from the world health organization from some of
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:08.520]  its meetings that have never disclosed to the public before and they now and they admit during
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:14.120]  their own discussions their internal debates that most of these vaccines are the vaccines in fact
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:19.720]  uh the vast bulk of the contaminants in them including genetic contaminants and viruses
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:27.880]  are unknown to them sometimes 90 percent of every inoculation and polio still is unknown to them
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:32.760]  don't know they don't know the effects on the body except with the new adjuvants they're using for
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:38.040]  this upcoming swine flu shot they do know that they're using rather than chicken eggs they're
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:43.160]  using cancer viruses they admit that their own writings they're using cancer viruses for the
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:49.640]  simple reason that cancer viruses are almost indestructible so it will stay in your body
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:54.360]  forever supposedly to protect your body no at the same time it might just give you cancer
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:59.640]  this is incredible science in other words they know what they're doing they're taking the population
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:06.760]  down not just that a drastic step all at once but depending on your shot in your physiology
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:11.640]  it will all start dying off much much faster over the next few years now now alan stop this is this
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:16.200]  is this is mind blowing and we're on the same page this is admitted in hundreds of government
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:20.760]  textbooks like eco science by the white house science are we now have bought over 10 books he
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:25.480]  authored all saying the same sickening stuff about how they would do this inject us with cancer
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:31.880]  viruses that would trigger as soon as our hormone levels lowered in men and women between 45 and 65
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:37.240]  we now see that happening the boldness what do you call the boldness of where they openly say
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:42.760]  they're killing us where they openly admit the first 10 million people in canada in the us to get
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:50.040]  the nasal live flu virus they admit it's going to mutate it and spread it yes this is so in plain
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:55.880]  view they admit it has cancer viruses in the major german and british news we're shooting
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:01.480]  cancer viruses live into our nostrils they admit the Gardasil's killing the girls and mutating
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:06.360]  its own inventor came out and said don't take it i'm sure they'll kill her or something the point is
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:12.520]  is that what do you call that because i see them testing the ambient murder they're now just
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:17.560]  killing us right out in the open and just setting the precedent to do it and then everyone's dropping
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:23.480]  dead or dying and it's like no big deal that's right uh... in fact even admits from the world
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:29.880]  health organization that they're doing a massive campaign to train the public train the public
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:35.640]  to accept that masses of people die all the time from strokes and heart attacks and cancers so
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:40.600]  don't relate it to the vaccine they are getting this is the present propaganda blitz that's out
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:47.080]  right now so they're training the victim to accept his own death and put down to coincidences
[2:49:47.800 --> 2:49:52.520]  it's amazing that they understand what they can do to the public because they've lied so many times
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:57.880]  in the past they know the formulas the techniques and then they know how we respond we if there's one
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:03.800]  percent of credibility in their arguments the public will want to believe them rather than cross
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:09.400]  the line and see if these guys are killing us because because the average person just like in
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:15.080]  hardened montana when i caught when our listeners caught the con artist felon now admitted running
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:19.720]  a giant takeover of the town to put the locals in the camp the private criminal was going to own
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:25.080]  still the local constabulary denies it even as evid's admitted because they don't want to admit
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:31.080]  they're wrong and it's too scary to admit it's happening but that's correct but there's no
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:37.320]  problems in lying to the public and again and he's recently released uh documents from internal

[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:56.280]  pigly wiggly gets the head of the line and then nobody else gets to get on so 1-800-259-9231 that's
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:02.040]  coming up in the next hour ellen we were just talking during the break about social control
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:08.200]  it's just like the aztecs one of the dominant meso american uh uh mayan cultures and and in
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:15.720]  their own writings and in what the spanish absurd mothers would beg to have their healthiest best
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:21.880]  because you wanted to have the best sacrifice 10 year old only son cut up in pieces and then sold
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:26.040]  as meat by the priest class that's how they made their money to the locals and the mothers with
[2:55:26.040 --> 2:55:33.880]  gobble their children with pleasure we have major news out of soul korea and china this is
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:41.240]  mainstream baby soup not a hoax eating babies people get upset if they see a dog killed by marines
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:46.360]  but not if they see a kid killed by marines we've been trained to see human life is bad and through
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:52.280]  mind control just through cultural mind control aztecs would kill their sons and daughters and
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:59.000]  wives and husbands with pleasure that the the the druids would do this and it's the same thing now
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:05.240]  we just give our kids to the state because they're uh because our guests said earlier uh in in in
[2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:10.280]  england a mother said yeah it was really hard to lose the weight ruined my figure they said that
[2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:16.120]  was a symbol of depression so they took the baby from the family with no due process the criminal
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:23.480]  state is here go ahead yes again too interesting so we could build video i think it's not maybe on
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:28.840]  youtube i don't know i can't watch it because of my slow speed uh they punish me for using explore
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:36.120]  net but um uh there was there was a julian hoxley up there now do hoxley and these guys went into
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:40.600]  this whole thing and i'll do hoxley himself who attended all the world meetings he also worked
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:46.600]  at tabas stock institute he thought that the scientific dictatorship would be just so wonderful
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:53.080]  when it came in and the people would be trained to love their servitude but he also talked about
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:57:00.840]  the only obstacle they had at that time back in the 50s was the remnants of a powerful or almost
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:09.000]  post-powerful christianity now that ties in with what his brother julian said the first CEO of unesco
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:15.560]  he said well have to train the people to devaluate human life uh in order to bring through mass
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:23.160]  abortions and eventually genetic selection and sterilization uh so this is the plan unfolding
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:28.520]  now these guys were part of the big world meetings of their day they set their agenda they set their
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:34.440]  timetables they set up for the end of the millennium into the new that's now and that's what it calls
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:39.880]  this the century of change and and they never alter their plans their plans are like long-term
[2:57:39.880 --> 2:57:46.040]  business plans set in stone with 10 year plans for one part 50 for another a hundred for another
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:52.440]  we see this same type of plan cropping up in the declassified information put out by the top
[2:57:52.440 --> 2:57:58.680]  think tanks for the military going up to the year 2050 and beyond and the kind of world that there
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:04.040]  will be then and society will have them and we have of course the rockella has taught around
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:09.880]  the world still pushing the depopulation plan eugenics plan is the fittest you to survive
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:16.360]  the ratio gets sterilized and then wanted to simply be killed off by various means this is
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:22.760]  happening as we live and the public don't even know it's happening yeah the cranes to ignore
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:28.360]  and not participate in their own destiny got a break coming back 50 minutes left in the next
[2:58:28.360 --> 2:58:34.520]  hour without one this is what's happening and they're training us to turn our own predator
[2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:39.240]  instinct on our own species that's what the police the military all of it is

[3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:16.680]  one of the main contributors
[3:00:18.280 --> 3:00:22.680]  one of the stars in fall the republic is going to be fall the republic too it comes out march 15
[3:00:22.680 --> 3:00:30.520]  the next year the big eugenics film but uh your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:37.080]  at the 20 after we'll take calls for two segments allen we were talking again about how they train
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:42.440]  us to feed on ourselves they domesticate us they train us not to notice what's happening
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:49.080]  and this whole agenda is rushing forward uh continue well going into the writings again
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:54.280]  of some of the biggest players who did publish lots of their work but we find their techniques
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:01:00.920]  because they explain their techniques and they were so assured of them working that can only
[3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:06.680]  be done because of previous experimentation on populations and we're going back to the 30s 40s 50s
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:13.720]  60s uh the hoax this for instance talks about uh uh people loving their servitude and they often
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:19.400]  use the term domestication uh domesticate the public which what they meant was and even said
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:24.360]  this that the only true survivors that are fit to survive are wild animals that retain all of the
[3:01:24.360 --> 3:01:30.360]  survival capabilities in order to rule all the lesser types than previous humans who haven't
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:35.480]  made it to the top they'd have to domesticate them that meant to eradicate their instincts for
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:40.920]  self-preservation train them that experts were looking after everything that they would should
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:46.680]  look after by themselves and the even to the extent where they couldn't do anything without expert
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:52.440]  advice well we've had a massive campaign since about the 50s onwards listen to the experts all
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:58.280]  through magazines tvs even in news breaks or even weather breaks you get experts coming on telling
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:05.000]  you how to dress for the rain uh this is the form of domestication it's meant to make you think
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:11.080]  that you you know nothing you're too stupid to understand and just accept it accept there are
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:15.880]  better types of people above you taking care of all the big problems that you should be taken care
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:21.560]  of and your job is to simply play as much as you can play and enjoy yourself and don't become
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:27.480]  involved in the big problems in life to do with politics policies or anything else just accept it
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:34.760]  that's called domestication until you literally have no self-preservation instincts left when
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:40.200]  that happens you're now ready for extermination and then they needn't train you as you say that
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:47.800]  training the children to volunteer for sterilization to save the world and of course this new religion
[3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:54.120]  of ecology is a religion as Gorbachev said we are creating a new religion based on a form of
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:03:00.040]  earth worship but of course it's got its own high priests that decide who should procreate who should
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:06.360]  not procreate and and that's not fast enough for them they want to start killing us off even faster
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:11.480]  we're not breeding enough in the west to tell us that we're almost sterile but and hence the
[3:03:11.480 --> 3:03:16.920]  immigration levels are massive however we're not dying fast enough across the world so
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:22.360]  they want to speed up the process and notice children so you must you mustn't tell them any
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:28.440]  truth you must see it's also strange that these cancers are affecting everyone and everyone's
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:33.240]  dying and that'll be taught is just a new a new happening well they're saying that they're saying
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:36.680]  you're all just going to die of cancer and you're all just going to die of diabetes and
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:40.360]  that matter what you do just take your shot you're going to die and there's going to be lots of
[3:03:40.360 --> 3:03:45.000]  deaths and yeah it's a live virus and yeah you're going to die but it wasn't the vaccine but it does
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:49.800]  say on the insert it may kill you and and this Gardasil is going to kill you but it doesn't protect
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:55.720]  you from the from the cancer but it will give you cancer but everything's fine and they just throw
[3:03:55.720 --> 3:04:02.600]  it all out there and it's like the public really is in a trance now more and more of them are starting
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:09.720]  to wake up so the establishment's program is to shock us even more and pile on hoping people just
[3:04:09.720 --> 3:04:17.080]  give up yeah the technique they give the dialectical process the pros and the cons they get you into a
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:23.000]  punch-drunk state and you simply give up and and then you say well they can't be doing this
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:29.160]  for negative reasons to kill us so I'll just go along with the rest of the public that's how
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:34.600]  simple it is people look around for a hero to follow and if there's no heroes they simply go
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:41.000]  along with the rest of the public and do what they do that's what Huxley said himself now let's talk
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:47.560]  about in the short term what their program is long term but also solutions how you think this battle
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:52.440]  is going to shake out and what things will look like if they win any other important angles Almond

[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:38.840]  out there all right alan i'm going to shut up for this rest of this segment before we go to calls
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:45.480]  getting into what their current operation is what you think's happening with the flu those new
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:50.920]  world health organization documents you have they're up on cutting through the matrix dot com and
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:56.280]  some news about how we beat these people now there is a big awakening happened so
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:01.880]  that collision between people that want freedom and decent humanity
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:07.480]  and and and for honorableness to be held up and those that want death and destruction
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:12.200]  well i think the people first have to understand that they're not dealing with
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:18.360]  democratic institutions you're dealing with people with an agenda who are all pre-chosen
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:25.480]  before they get into politics the trains into their roles and they're all on board with this agenda
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:30.840]  so technically there's no negotiation with them to be honest with you the only thing that's left
[3:12:30.840 --> 3:12:38.120]  outside of outright revolution um it's for large groups of people to literally um
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:44.760]  head some economically for instance an example the nurses of new york state have been told that
[3:12:45.640 --> 3:12:51.800]  they're going to be fired if they don't take this swine flu shot um my suggestion to them is for them
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:57.560]  to walk off en masse and just walk out the hospital en masse for a day or two and you'll see the
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:02.760]  howls and screams that those guys want you to bring you to the negotiating table that these
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:07.960]  are the only kinds of strategies left for people outside revolution and the boys at the top
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:15.080]  know this because they've been setting up internal armies and securities for 20 years
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:19.320]  for this particular time that we're going through now they knew this time would come
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:26.440]  so uh to be honest there's no easy way out of this uh this is life or death uh situations that
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:31.960]  we're going through right now they have the depopulation program the world health organization
[3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:37.800]  at their meeting in 2006 the world meeting stated that if they can get the public to accept
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:44.120]  mandatory inoculation for one thing then introduce more mandatory inoculations every year for the
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:50.120]  rest of the adult's life including annual boosters for every shot they've ever had we're going to be
[3:13:50.120 --> 3:13:56.120]  toxic laboratories walking out laboratories walking test tubes with a competent DNA all
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:01.240]  getting together and telling us all the quicker through cancers they know this at the top so we
[3:14:01.240 --> 3:14:07.320]  that the thing is you can't take a step forward to negotiate that what you say is no that's the
[3:14:07.320 --> 3:14:11.560]  word we're going to relearn is no and say no i'm not taking this i don't care what you want to do
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:17.080]  with me because you're going to kill me anyway so i'm not taking this shot and people have got to
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:22.920]  start regaining their individual rights and freedom you don't if you don't fight for them you don't
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:28.200]  have any you can't write something on a piece of paper and go back to sleep thinking it's all done
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.400]  and even the founding fathers of the u.s said that that every generation would have to fight to keep
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:39.800]  it and have been lulled into sleep by again propaganda and experts with the experts we're
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:45.560]  in charge of all the big problems that you just don't understand and allen involved so we have to
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:52.520]  say no no everything that's coming down the pipe no that's all we have left and allen continuing
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:57.640]  on the flu front they're now ordering kids to go to school to take it no law they just do it
[3:14:57.640 --> 3:15:03.640]  clinics all over the country are saying take it or your call cps on you no law they just do it
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:08.200]  we're seeing the real tyranny and they're bragging that they're setting the precedent
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:16.680]  to force over 56 vaccine boosters so that's now in the hundreds every couple years of meningitis
[3:15:16.680 --> 3:15:22.680]  shots hepatitis shots the aids vaccine and bill gates is now bragging it's in the associated
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:30.440]  press oh when he laughs when he gives a speech oh i found out we're giving people polio with the
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:35.400]  new vaccine it happens to be live and then the little elite clubs they all giggle because the
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:41.800]  local good ol boys they're in on the fun that's Nigeria Nigeria's not good but now got a new evolved
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:46.920]  type of polio that they admit now at the world health health organization came from the particular
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:53.000]  vaccine they were giving the people there is evolved into a new hyper polio this rampaging
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:58.040]  through the public it came from the vaccine admits it because and now they admit in the
[3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:04.120]  mainstream literature that the live nasal vaccine is going to create hundreds of mutations and is
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:10.200]  what's spreading h1n1 so out in the open they they they hit us with all the fools that are
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:15.320]  shooting it up their kids nose sneezing on everybody and the public is so dumb down they
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:21.560]  can't even understand it again they've been trained the experts don't lie and uh we've had
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:27.320]  50 years of training into this new type of system the public can't believe at that
[3:16:27.320 --> 3:16:31.400]  that's the at the scene get the ladder but until you literally cross the last wrong
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:36.120]  and stand on it you won't see the big picture and the last drop wrong as difficult as difficult
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:40.200]  to cross and say but not just talking about killing us they have been killing us and they
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:46.120]  want to kill more of us when you really understand that it's true you'll see everything completely
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:53.640]  different from then on as to what you can do so you can't negotiate with tyranny well the key here
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:59.080]  is they're not negotiating they're not stopping it's a power cult yeah and we have to admit
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:03.960]  they're testing this off kill now and i want to talk some about solutions here uh but everything
[3:17:03.960 --> 3:17:11.160]  you you know bring up just just just literally flags come up because it's all so accurate
[3:17:11.480 --> 3:17:17.400]  you're dealing with all of this and watching them kill us and then always little petty power people
[3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:21.640]  who don't even care if they're being killed themselves as long as they can kill people
[3:17:21.640 --> 3:17:27.320]  under them it's very sick yeah and again to the test at all that it's done for does the big
[3:17:28.200 --> 3:17:31.960]  player and that's all the universities have those specialized areas and creating vaccines
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:36.920]  that are back to you more viruses for warfare purposes but they're also into the social science
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:43.880]  and psychology and stanford is one of the prime universities for for for mass control basically
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:49.960]  they did the the old days of the mill guard experiments on on testing people's obedience
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:54.440]  to authority by shocking people he's treating people that they're actually shocking our victim
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:58.440]  on the other side of the glass it was there was actors on the other side of the glass they didn't
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:04.600]  know and they go up to kill voltage on the dial there as long as someone above them took authority
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:11.000]  and responsibility for it they know how to use the public against the public yeah and 90% you
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:17.160]  could take a farm boy make him a cop six months later 90% in the stanford research will put a gun
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:22.680]  to their mother's head and blow her brains across the room if someone in a uniform orders them to
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:28.760]  do it yes and and it's true to see that all techniques have been understood by the high you
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:35.240]  know sciences and all cults guys and masonry and so on at the top you can find it in the riots of
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:43.000]  new york in 1800s that's um the mayor uh at the time a whole riots he says uh he said that people
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:48.440]  can always hire half the poor to kill the other half that's what he said if they understand this
[3:18:48.440 --> 3:18:54.280]  that the money is the key uh i can survive i get money i'll go in the winning side don't leave me
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:59.640]  alone that's what they think until their usefulness is over and then they're they're eliminated too
[3:19:02.040 --> 3:19:06.680]  unbelievable alan let's do this let's come back and take calls and then at the end of the last
[3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:10.120]  segment let's get into a little bit of solutions but we're gonna have you back up for more of that
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:15.080]  as well but i guess what you're saying is the big solution is becoming aware of this matrix of
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:21.160]  propaganda and social engineering and really getting upset about it and really talking human to human
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:26.360]  about the ruling elite and their program for humanity and ask the public do you like being
[3:19:26.360 --> 3:19:31.800]  controlled do you like being poisoned do you like everybody being blubbery and and bleach skin and
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:36.280]  unhealthy and zits all over the place i mean do you like being poisoned do you like the

[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:50.200]  that i just enrolled in school and i wanted to find out what i could do as far as the vaccine
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:55.080]  and everything um i live right outside of houston i went to my son's nurse yesterday
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:00.360]  and asked her for the vaccine exemption form she said she has nothing like that she didn't
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:04.680]  want to give me any information she's a liar basically understate okay you have to go to the
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:12.840]  health department let's do this live on tv right now guys google texas vaccine exemption form
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:17.880]  and we will be on the state health department and you just print it off and you mail it in and of
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:22.840]  the criminals at that school who get money for shooting your kid up their federal funds are
[3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:28.840]  almost exclusively tied to that it's so important the government wants that that that that you then
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:34.440]  go in and you give it to them and then they're open for massive criminal charges if they try
[3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:39.880]  to kick your child out but see their criminal charges on your child are for truancy when they
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:47.880]  kick them out that's what they talk about arresting you for shots they're total criminals so uh there
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:55.560]  it is okay uh there is the state of texas texas vaccine exemption form and you just google that
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:01.560]  and you can print the form off secure online request for exemption affidavit and there's copies
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:06.120]  of them online but i guess here the state's now making you ask to screw it up but they've got to
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:11.080]  give it to you i'm sorry man i don't mean to get mad i'm just so tired of lying criminals
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:16.840]  but again this this evil woman or man they feel like it's good like like a death camp operator
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:22.680]  oh they're helping by lying to you and believe me a school nurse knows they're lying alan what
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:28.280]  what yes they do another some true believers in their professional brainwash themselves
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:31.880]  in fact the big boys say that the first one to get your brainwash are the ones who manage
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:36.280]  the rest of the public and a lot of them truly believe it but there's a lot of nurses too that
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:42.520]  that uh understand that they've seen the effects of uh inoculations and that's why close to 60
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  percent are saying no in new york shelly in new york state actually this is the thing with new
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:51.560]  york state they made it a policy the big board of controls the health authority for new york state
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:27:56.920]  a policy and instead in a policy there will be no exemptions for religious or philosophical
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:02.280]  or or or even even diabetic reasons uh this is for the first time in their history they've
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:07.240]  actually brought diabetics yeah even if you're a doctor because this is key you can find an
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:11.400]  anti-vaccine doctor by googling in any major city if you're in a small town you may have to go to
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:16.280]  big city they will give you a medical exemption and they admit on the flu shots hundreds of
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:21.080]  things if you've got allergies you're not supposed to take shots because they admit that it is going
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:26.440]  to cause an autoimmune response but but now they're trying to say we don't care of a medical doctor
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:32.760]  says no we got SWAT teams who want to kill they want blood take the cancer shot shelly what are
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:40.120]  you facing right now i called the immunization branch there and uh they're in austin and the lady
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:44.600]  laughed at me yesterday on the phone she said there is no exemption form for i was asking
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:51.000]  specifically for the swine flu um and she said ma'am ma'am ma'am obama's been on tv saying you
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:57.880]  don't have to take it okay so she told you you have to no she said that it's it's not mandatory
[3:28:57.880 --> 3:29:02.680]  and there is no form that i can find but it but then let me guess houston's trying to force you
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:09.960]  to take it though that i don't know okay well well but you said that that ma'am it's a general
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:14.600]  vaccine waiver form so that when they try well it's it's all over dallas morning news they're trying
[3:29:14.600 --> 3:29:19.480]  to make texas kids take it so see that see the alan what do you call these ring around the rosie
[3:29:19.480 --> 3:29:25.160]  mind games this blob of con artist play where they'll go you don't need an exemption it's not mandatory
[3:29:25.160 --> 3:29:29.800]  but you have to take it what do you call that mind control alan it's a it's a form of double
[3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:34.040]  thing when you get into this double thing we can believe two opposing ideas at the same time
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:38.600]  then you can't think rationally for yourselves you give up and go along with them that's what
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:42.440]  that's the most hope to give up and go along yeah stay there alan i want to hear more from you

[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:29.240]  big john all right i didn't mean to go off into a rant i was just talking to one of my producers
[3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:35.560]  on the radio guys rob do about how they nobody and his wife sent education how they tried for
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:39.160]  months to get it in the exemption for me they would laugh and say it doesn't exist

[3:33:51.800 --> 3:33:55.800]  yeah there's always these little ring around the rosy games it's in the dallas morning news
[3:33:55.800 --> 3:34:01.000]  they're kicking kids out if they don't take the regular shot seasonal flu and the new one i mean
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:05.960]  i i showed dallas morning news yesterday austin's announcing it but there's no law they're saying
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:10.920]  you don't have to but you have to and then you say well i want an extension form and they laugh at
[3:34:10.920 --> 3:34:16.840]  you and say you don't have to honey i mean this is just so sick and and and these locals they always
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:23.000]  get like a little piggy face a little demonic smile what is that programming where they revel in
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:29.880]  abusing people they revel in lying yeah what you've got truly is what i said about the soviet
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:35.800]  system and the hero worship of the man at the top the same with the with the nazi regime in germany
[3:34:36.760 --> 3:34:42.040]  uh what they found was all the officers down below are sadomasochists and this is how power
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:47.720]  works it's a sadomasochistic thing that attracts psychopathic types into those positions in fact
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:53.400]  they're generally the only ones who go into them and they worship the person above them with power
[3:34:53.400 --> 3:34:59.160]  and they despise the person beneath them who has less power than themselves that's how simply it
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:04.920]  works with sadomasochism and you'll always have this strange sadomasochistic authoritarianism
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:11.480]  when you get into politics and right down to local politics even any authority this is the very thing
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:17.560]  that carol young warned the public about back in the the fifties he talked with the iron curtain
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:23.640]  across germany but he also said he says i see an iron curtain of massive bureaucracies building up
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:29.880]  with with governmental agencies stifling and strangling the freedom of the whole planet uh he
[3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:35.160]  understood what was coming down the pike back then many of of his generation did in fact because
[3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:40.440]  they're involved in meeting higher level people and he knew that the world we're bringing in would be
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:47.240]  one of tyranny by force and that's what you've got one of the criteria of tyranny is when you're
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:54.040]  forced into a position by authorities and without any escape routes in other words you have no choice
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:57.000]  that is tyranny when you have no choice in any situation
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:05.480]  well you're absolutely right they since they don't have a choice they learn to love it and
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:12.440]  love the defendant and so when you say hey the banks just stole 23.7 trillion we got to pay it back
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:18.280]  with interest they just laugh and and will say i'm part of the power structure and it's almost
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:25.400]  like a five-year-old dressing up like their Luke Skywalker dressing up like their you know some
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:34.600]  hero that it's like the public or eternal children and they're they they imagine things they they
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:40.440]  they're delusional and i never had a view of myself as something special or wonderful or good
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:47.000]  i'm just a person that has my instincts intact and you know having a bunch of psychos writing books
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:51.160]  about how they're killing me with vaccines and stuff in the water and then i can see the evidence
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:55.320]  they're doing it i mean if they write hundreds of books about how they're killing us and how
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:37:01.800]  how it's a scientific dictatorship wouldn't there be something wrong with me if i didn't
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:08.280]  as a red-blooded male not stand up for my species against a up against a power tripping group that's
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:14.360]  playing god absolutely and part of the key of of obedience as they stand for another university
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:18.440]  there are into these experiments all the time around obedience or the ci involved with them
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:25.800]  obviously and what they find is with the more power they accumulate in any agency and the
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:33.000]  sadomasochistic power structure they begin to despise the ordinary people who who begin to cow
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:38.600]  under authority the more the people cow under authority the more the despised is almost
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:44.520]  weaklings and and eventually hated by those in power uh i've always said it's like a
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:49.000]  farmer breaking the legs of a cow it falls to the ground then he starts kicking it because
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:55.560]  it can't get up that's the very system that's in play today with the sadomasochistic total power
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:00.040]  structure that's set up this is a hell on earth they're being in and it's up to us to fight it
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:06.120]  but utterly with every means that we have well i think the one of the most effective ways to attack
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:12.200]  it is to just show people the matrix of false reality and reach out to police military bureaucrats
[3:38:12.200 --> 3:38:19.720]  and go you know your little cousin just out of cancer at 22 that's not normal here's some statistics
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:25.160]  do you know what's in the water do you know what's in the shots here here's ap admitting they're
[3:38:25.160 --> 3:38:31.640]  giving everyone polio with the polio vaccine and you're not going to listen now because you have
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:37.000]  defenses up but deep down in your instincts you know i'm telling you the truth you're being
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:44.520]  manipulated and i found that six months down the road a year down the road they then wake up and
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:51.240]  just showing them how they're not in the power structure like they think they are how they're
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:57.640]  being attacked as well and what's interesting too is this new world order is to go through a
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:04.120]  series of changes including the riot phase for 30 odd years as they bring down the food supply
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:08.760]  and then the united nations takes over that the distribution of food to all the different regions
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:14.200]  as they call these sections of the world and they say their own writings and the united nations
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:21.400]  that will gradually reduce these this ration to each area every year and it's up to you to bring
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:27.480]  your population down to accommodate and use the resources are given to you this is all the plan
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:32.920]  and this is how on earth they're being in step by step and of course the reduction of population
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:40.040]  via mass literally it's um but we're being killed off by inoculations and they know this
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:45.080]  and that's all stated and they all brag about it and you'll tell some mom and she'll arrogantly
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:50.840]  laugh at you take her kid who already looks like a zombie and and and just and just shoot them up
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:55.640]  with some more and then they'll look at you with pleasure you crazy nut it doesn't matter if you
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:40:01.160]  just quoted state department random 200 yes it doesn't matter if you're quoting you in documents
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:06.760]  it doesn't matter they don't care and then when their kid dies they'll wear a little cancer ribbon
[3:40:06.760 --> 3:40:15.080]  and cry and it's like a celebrity thing oh your kid died too you know because it's all about
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:20.760]  euthanizing everybody that's what this is all about it is euthanasia and it's a bacteria bacteria
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:26.600]  warfare a spiral warfare a spiral warfare it carefully designed and as they and all this
[3:40:26.600 --> 3:40:32.360]  stuff has been released recently from the internal meetings at the world health organization they
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:40.360]  admit that all of these particles of of DNA and RNA and so on recombined within the body
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:45.640]  infect the cells of the person and cause cancers down the road they understand well they grow it
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:51.480]  in the exact type of monkeys and fetal tissue that have the cancer virus that's most viral
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:55.560]  that's most deadly in it well actually that they've said now they've stated now that they're
[3:40:55.560 --> 3:41:00.040]  actually using especially for this new swine flu rather than use the eggs chicken eggs and so on
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:05.880]  for doing so which also contains thousands of foreign they're using cancer virus instead of the
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:13.720]  dead baby retinas because of the green monkey kidneys or the other growth mediums you're right
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:19.080]  they're using cancer virus that's what they say because the cancer virus is the survivors they're
[3:41:19.080 --> 3:41:24.920]  using that as an example yeah yeah isn't that sweet i'm gonna move the calls quickly now
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:31.480]  mark in oregon you're on the air go ahead hi alex and alan honor to speak with you thank you for
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:37.560]  your great information thank you for your great wisdom even alex on monday's show that you had
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:43.800]  mentioned that there were 10 million doses of the flu mess being sent out into the country on monday
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:47.480]  they will have arrived or probably have arrived at the destination by now i'm sure many of
[3:41:48.040 --> 3:41:52.920]  destinations that it's arriving to are the walmart stores well let me tell you they said
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:42:00.360]  they said last friday that 200 000 were going to tennessee indiana and texas and that then by
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:06.920]  the end of the next week 10 million more would start flowing and then they admit there's been
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:13.720]  no testing of the h1n1 and that they're making people sign secrecy forms and waving their rights
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:20.680]  when they take the nasal yes you also reported alex a male clinic has come out and said that the
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:26.040]  flu mist will be much more contagious to other people it takes 10 to 20 days as i understand
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:30.920]  it at this point for the actual symptoms to manifest in someone who has received an injected
[3:42:30.920 --> 3:42:38.120]  or a flu mist vaccination now i think the time clock has already started on this and that the
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:45.800]  actual mass murder genocide that they're that this operation consists of and it is not a drill
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:50.920]  absolutely not a drill it's set in motion now as to where it's going to follow through with the actual
[3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:56.040]  sickness itself and people are going to become so sick and weak that they're going to accept
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:43:01.560]  martial law and i think this is the first stage of the operation well i know this we're going to
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:08.760]  find out by the end of october early november whether it's meant to mutate and really be deadly
[3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:13.400]  or if this is just setting the precedent for us to go under world health organization rules
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:18.360]  and to set the precedent to take the shots as they've stated we know it's at least that bad
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:23.800]  alan watt what do you think's going on it is true i think it follows both purposes uh
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:29.000]  you become a human incubator when you take on the stuff you are now the new egg if you like
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:34.840]  you're the new reactors it bleeds within you and they admit you shed the virus to all those around
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:40.680]  you there's no doubt about that and uh uh what's interesting to me is putting this kind of thing
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:48.840]  into a mist form uh this supposed virus uh would kill primarily attacking the respiratory system
[3:43:48.840 --> 3:43:53.000]  that the nasal passages and bronchial tubes in the lungs but so they're bringing it right into
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:59.160]  the very areas and they admit that the adjuvants are designed to track leukocytes and phageocytes
[3:43:59.720 --> 3:44:05.320]  to attack the stuff right into the lung area which might cause you to die with those that
[3:44:05.320 --> 3:44:13.000]  don't know that's the that's the autoimmune storm of how the 1918 killed tens of millions
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:20.280]  it's the autoimmune response to the virus that kills you in hours with fluid and now we're
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:24.760]  getting reports they're covering enough that people are taking it and collapsing and so alan
[3:44:24.760 --> 3:44:30.760]  i want to be very clear about what you just said they admit in the literature that it can cause
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:35.400]  the autoimmune response and you're right you're injecting you're injecting live virus
[3:44:35.400 --> 3:44:41.160]  into the nasal passages into the lungs which can then cause the autoimmune response and
[3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:45.800]  Reuters is out ahead of it saying there's going to be lots of deaths but it's after you take the
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:52.760]  shot but it's not the shot now how obvious is that yes it's very obvious and and again it's
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:58.360]  twofold as you say that it is to clean us to take the annual shots and boosters for the rest of
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:05.560]  our lives that's what it said at the world health organization 2006 meeting all right i hope you're
[3:45:05.560 --> 3:45:09.880]  wrong mark but we at least know they're setting the precedent for the big soft kill that's coming
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:14.120]  but we're going to find out the next few months here buddy it doesn't look good i'll say that i mean
[3:45:14.120 --> 3:45:19.000]  they admit it's live virus they're putting into 10 million morons uh let's go ahead and talk to
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:25.560]  john in arkansas john you're on the air go ahead hi elixir this is john i spoke to you about the
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:33.880]  police um stopping me and trying to get me to take the shot yeah tell us tell us about that again
[3:45:33.880 --> 3:45:41.400]  because uh expand on that yes um i was on my way home um from a girlfriend's house and a police
[3:45:41.400 --> 3:45:46.360]  officer here and little rock stopped me it's like hey how you doing you like us a little like to be
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:49.880]  out and i'm like yeah it's okay i'm just coming from a girlfriend's house oh it's a free country
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:53.480]  you know the guy's got to ask you while you're out at night you know you're a slave go ahead
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:59.960]  and he was like so have you um taking your um gotten your flu shot yet i said no and he said why
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:06.600]  not i said because that's government propaganda and it contains mercury which kills you and he
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:10.920]  looked at me kind of crazy so he said so you're you're gonna probably spat out some new world
[3:46:10.920 --> 3:46:15.400]  order crap huh i said yeah i was kind of thinking that and kind of telling you to fuck off right
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:19.480]  about now i'm gonna let you go sir i understand that happened to you but we really need to remember
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:25.640]  we have a lot of children listening okay buddy uh no no more for uh that caller let's talk to
[3:46:25.640 --> 3:46:33.080]  mike in texas mike you're on the air go ahead hey guys can you hear me all right yes go ahead um
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:38.840]  i've just been this this is in regards i guess more of the eugenic kind of stuff that you guys
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:47.560]  are talking about um i studied uh soviet union uh history and politics when i was in university
[3:46:47.560 --> 3:46:55.400]  and recovered the arrow see um a lot of the uh genetic mutations and uh aberrations that uh
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:00.840]  resulted from the uh pesticides and other stuff that was running off through the irrigation
[3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:08.120]  ditches of the farmers um i'm just curious to know if a lot of the similar stuff
[3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:15.240]  is being put into this kind of gmo foods and uh fast food and other stuff incredibly good point
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:21.960]  let let me briefly say that they've done studies were over 90 percent i want to say 97 you can
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:29.000]  pull it up of people in india of the sewage systems have the sv 40 live cancer virus they don't just
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:35.160]  inject this in people it then spreads and mutates in us as incubators as alam was saying now i've
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:39.880]  interviewed genetic engineer genetic engineer guys making millions a year guys who were running
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:44.360]  whole facilities and they would find that they would be told by other engineers they were just
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:51.400]  running plants to make the potato this way the tomato that way insert this gene and they noticed
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:55.640]  we've had them on the show over and over again that it was a combination change that would change
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:48:01.720]  other things and produce a pharmacological crop that's what it's called pharmacological crops
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:07.560]  that would also sterilize all the guinea pigs and rats they tested it on and so yes and that's
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:11.320]  what they've said they're going to have food crops already have them with vaccines in them
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:17.240]  with live viruses in them and that and that the very gmo food it's already going on alan what
[3:48:17.880 --> 3:48:22.520]  yes i also have the information it's often websites and by the united nations that they were into
[3:48:22.520 --> 3:48:28.520]  crops uh for the last 15 years for third world countries especially all kinds of stuff including
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:33.320]  corn that would have that would actually help sterilize the people and bring down the population
[3:48:33.320 --> 3:48:39.080]  rate if i'm rocker fella himself uh isn't charged off the rice campaign technical the golden rice
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:44.440]  campaign that's getting on a modified rice to probably countries there's no being imported
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:50.120]  back into the u.s. and other countries too this stuff also was designed also to to lower the
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:59.400]  sperm in in the meals etc that's that stuff on their own side alan i was going to do some
[3:48:59.400 --> 3:49:02.680]  financial news in the final segment when i want to hold you to the variance we can take a few more
[3:49:02.680 --> 3:49:08.360]  calls are you game for that yes 10 more minutes okay let's take another call here let's talk to
[3:49:08.360 --> 3:49:13.800]  mike in texas mike you're on the air we'll just talk to mike loyden connecticut sorry
[3:49:13.800 --> 3:49:21.960]  loyd go ahead how you doing alex good um a friend of mine uh wife works for big uh hmo you know
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:29.080]  in three years ago they had a meeting and um they discussed flu and her husband got so paranoid he
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:36.280]  went out and bought bought dried food so you know how can they know that far in advance
[3:49:36.280 --> 3:49:43.560]  unless it's planned you know sir in january we had emergency managers on and in documents for
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:48.600]  major states where they were saying in november december millions were going to die i'm not saying
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:53.640]  that's going to happen the feds were telling police departments the citizens will attack you in the
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:59.320]  winter so they're clearly getting ready for something that they're testing the water i don't know
[3:49:59.320 --> 3:50:05.800]  know but yes they this is all pre-planned alan what there's no doubt about it too in fact there were
[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:11.560]  uh the the rent to talk even john holdren made with that book eco science along with the other
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:17.560]  big eugenicists and ecologists which were like the population experts uh if they admitted then
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:21.160]  they have to find ways of putting things in the water and the food and that was what
[3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:25.720]  30 odd years ago and you go further back again into the hoxley's talking about the same thing
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:30.680]  in russell's putting stuff in the food but that veteran russell lord veteran russell in charge
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:34.920]  for the biggest department inside the royal history of international affairs
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:41.720]  said they would also use the needle to bring to be the people a compliance and to bring down the
[3:50:41.720 --> 3:50:47.880]  population yeah that's the worst to use many cases folks when these hospitals kill your family
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:52.120]  your kids just remember who did it the new world order they think you're stupid they think you're
[3:50:52.120 --> 3:50:56.280]  not going to notice what's happening final segment loyd stay there for comments from you as well we'll
[3:50:56.280 --> 3:51:05.080]  be right back how many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video
[3:51:05.080 --> 3:51:09.800]  recorder would have made a difference in your life in the past owning a hidden video recorder has
[3:51:09.800 --> 3:51:16.280]  been expensive and too much of a bother to carry that was then this is now introducing diginette

[3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:23.800]  an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day think it can happen here executive

[3:54:09.800 --> 3:54:15.560]  trying to warn people and like alan watt said the biggest issue is to realize they're not talking
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:20.440]  about killing us in all these publications they're doing it and you've got to face that horror and
[3:54:20.440 --> 3:54:25.560]  read their own statements and they've been caught the un's been caught the time for games is over
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:31.400]  get aggressive there's more of us than there are of them cut into the matrix.com is alan watt's
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:35.240]  website he is a big part of the new film fall the republic volume one hope you pre-order it
[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:40.440]  because it's going to be shipped down the order it's received it's coming out in just 13 days all
[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:46.280]  right let's go ahead and uh loyden connecticut are you still there yeah i'm still here so you're
[3:54:46.280 --> 3:54:51.480]  making the point that yeah the internal people are freaking out about the flu go ahead you know
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:58.120]  when i was a kid uh my old man he wouldn't let us get a shot because everybody in his neighborhood
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:02.840]  when he grew up took the polio vaccine and they all were they were damaged by it and he was terrified
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:11.080]  of it and uh i haven't i've never had the flu and i've never taken a shot so i don't really think
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:16.040]  they do anything at all i think it's just like smoking mirrors you know it'd be nice if it was
[3:55:16.040 --> 3:55:21.720]  just a scam but but it actually does do something i appreciate your call alan briefly tell him what
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:27.240]  it does to him well there's no doubt from their own writings they admit uh the top there's thousands
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:33.240]  of of viruses they haven't even identified yet and every shot every shot for everything that
[3:55:33.240 --> 3:55:39.080]  they've ever given you uh and it's the recent uh explanation that's given out at the top
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:44.360]  but they do know that the ones that they have given you definitely and not only can but do
