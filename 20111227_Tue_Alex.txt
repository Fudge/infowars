[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.920 --> 00:40.520]  it is Tuesday the 27th day of December 2011 obviously throughout the week I'm
[00:40.520 --> 00:46.160]  going to produce some special reports for the radio and TV dealing with 2011 a
[00:46.160 --> 00:54.560]  year in review and looking forward into the big 2012 that's only a few days away
[00:54.560 --> 01:00.200]  and as you notice as we prepare to enter 2012 there is intensifying
[01:00.200 --> 01:06.080]  reportage by the establishment mouthpiece media that a strike on Iran is
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.320]  imminent we're going to be going over that today also there's a big white
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.720]  wash article in the Los Angeles Times announcing to the general public what
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.640]  we've known for over nine years the TSA is going to occupy every city and every
[01:21.640 --> 01:25.520]  major highway and there is no escaping they are going to grab your wife's
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.840]  breasts and your children's genitals and your genitals in an act of total
[01:28.840 --> 01:33.480]  federal domination and prisoner training here's the Los Angeles Times TSA
[01:33.480 --> 01:38.360]  screeners aren't just for airports anymore roving security teams that's a
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.560]  martial law federal teams that's what that is the increasingly visit train
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.640]  stations subways and other mass transit sites to deter terrorism critics say it's
[01:48.640 --> 01:52.960]  largely political theater no critics say it's groping critics say it's a
[01:52.960 --> 01:57.400]  violation of the fourth amendment and the tentamen critics say it's martial law
[01:57.400 --> 02:03.560]  critics who have a pulse and have brain cells know that it is theater in that
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.240]  it's not to protect you from terrorists you don't round randomly say let's just
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.600]  have federal police go set up on this highway and pull people out of their
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.880]  cars and search their vehicles and then search their bags and then give them
[02:19.880 --> 02:27.280]  frisk while they have less searches going on at the ports and the containers
[02:27.280 --> 02:33.680]  coming in and less border patrol actually engaging in action on the border and
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.000]  the government saying legalize all the illegals including felons but anybody
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.560]  that criticizes you know the open borders is an extremist but we've got to set up
[02:45.560 --> 02:49.720]  random checkpoints the middle of Tennessee in the middle of Michigan in the
[02:49.720 --> 02:54.760]  middle of Florida in the middle of California in the middle of Colorado and
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.680]  you pull up to these I've there's newscast of this we played them they've
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.200]  been beta testing for at least five years and even as it would happen we'd
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.840]  show people local news and still Jones is an extremist national news reported
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.320]  yeah he believes that there's a plan to put troops on the streets and federal
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.880]  TSA he's a lunatic in fact just last week more than 200 news articles in
[03:20.880 --> 03:29.520]  newspaper CBS ABC you name it saying Ron Paul is nuts he goes on Alex Jones's
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.280]  show and they talk about plans to put troops on the streets as stars and
[03:34.280 --> 03:41.760]  stripes as the major newspapers Army Times reported as local news reports it
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.360]  I mean local news we can play him the local preachers have secretly been
[03:45.360 --> 03:48.840]  trained to tell their flock to turn their guns in when the time comes red alert
[03:48.840 --> 03:55.160]  totally creepy off the chart red dawn and then it's like look at these lunatics
[03:55.160 --> 03:59.400]  they're worried about a plan to do this and now it's all being announced oh it's
[03:59.400 --> 04:02.920]  just political theater to make you feel like you're safe no it's not to make you
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.400]  feel like you're safe it's to make you feel scared and to have the local police
[04:07.400 --> 04:10.680]  go under federal control I've seen the newscast from all over the country and
[04:10.680 --> 04:16.320]  I've had state reps on from Florida Tennessee you name it who've been out at
[04:16.320 --> 04:19.640]  these things because sometimes they go all day long and you pull up and their
[04:19.640 --> 04:24.440]  state police out there in many cases in Marine Corps hats in their drill sergeant
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.500]  hats bugging their eyes out scaring the daylights out of people and guys with
[04:28.500 --> 04:32.760]  MP5 submachine guns and police dogs screaming at people and getting in their
[04:32.760 --> 04:38.280]  face it's total criminal evil and it has nothing to do with protecting this
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.200]  nation so that's coming up the Iran situation the total demonization of
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.520]  Ron Paul Gerald Salente popping in hadn't been on with us about two and a half
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.920]  weeks to give us an update on MF global and how that ties into everything that
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.040]  incredible footage a few weeks ago we haven't gotten Gerald's response to this
[04:55.040 --> 04:59.000]  where Corazine gets caught lying it's all coming up and your phone call stay
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.280]  with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.640 --> 05:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.280]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.640]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.640 --> 05:24.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.280 --> 05:33.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.400 --> 05:37.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.880]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:49.880 --> 05:54.560]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[05:54.560 --> 06:01.200]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:01.200 --> 06:04.880]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs
[06:04.880 --> 06:09.600]  Generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[06:09.600 --> 06:13.520]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[06:13.520 --> 06:17.400]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[06:17.400 --> 06:21.880]  pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory
[06:21.880 --> 06:27.200]  system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.480]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[06:31.480 --> 06:35.640]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce
[06:35.640 --> 06:41.040]  pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator very easy to
[06:41.040 --> 06:44.880]  follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and
[06:44.880 --> 06:51.000]  simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.880]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:00.480 --> 07:05.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.760]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.360]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[07:13.360 --> 07:17.880]  I have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[07:17.880 --> 07:22.000]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.240]  American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[07:27.240 --> 07:32.280]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[07:32.280 --> 07:36.240]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[07:36.240 --> 07:40.080]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[07:40.080 --> 07:43.920]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[07:43.920 --> 07:49.920]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the
[07:49.920 --> 07:55.720]  Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[07:55.720 --> 08:02.960]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv this is communications radio network proudly
[08:02.960 --> 08:09.840]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:16.680 --> 08:23.000]  here we are my friends it feels like a Monday but it's a Tuesday the 27th day
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.760]  of December 2011 and I'm gonna open the phones up throughout the three hour
[08:29.760 --> 08:35.480]  broadcast except when Gerald Salente is on with us for 30 minutes at the bottom
[08:35.480 --> 08:40.360]  of the next hour we haven't had Gerald Salente on in about two and a half three
[08:40.360 --> 08:44.560]  weeks and I want to go back to the testimony a week and a half ago of the
[08:44.560 --> 08:49.200]  head of MF global John Corzine saying he didn't know where the money went and
[08:49.200 --> 08:56.800]  then the head of the Chicago mercantile exchange saying no we talked to his
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.520]  people we talked to his top staff he's the one that ordered the money transferred
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.760]  illegally so we're now a couple weeks into this and Corzine was not
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.280]  instantly clapped in irons and that's because all the different heads of the
[09:11.280 --> 09:19.160]  federal agencies all the different heads of the federal agencies are former
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.480]  Goldman Sachs and what three of them are former deputies of John Corzine
[09:24.480 --> 09:29.360]  himself who was the head of Goldman Sachs so it's his deputies they've all
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.080]  gotten tens of millions of dollars out of the financial destruction of our
[09:34.080 --> 09:40.480]  Republic and they think it's real funny and you see Paulson who gave himself a
[09:40.480 --> 09:43.200]  waiver to give himself hundreds of millions of dollars of your bailout
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.080]  money of your tax money who was the former head of Goldman Sachs himself
[09:47.080 --> 09:53.080]  also the head of the Treasury four years ago with the 2008 mega banker takeover
[09:53.080 --> 10:00.960]  bailout that launched this latest disruption of our currency and deepening
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.720]  of our debt to these criminals what he did was publicly illegal on the face of
[10:07.720 --> 10:13.000]  it but he gave himself a waiver so at this point can these guys give
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.440]  themselves a waiver to I don't know grab babies out of baby carriages and give
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.840]  them cement shoes and throw them into the ocean I mean after all they've put
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.560]  all their people over the different federal agencies so why not and they
[10:27.560 --> 10:32.000]  worked hard to get their people in all the major regulatory agencies in every
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.600]  major European country every post now they have the power to force
[10:37.600 --> 10:41.920]  Bertelsoni to step down to have their old minion and Greece step down and they
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.280]  put in new former heads of European Goldman Sachs divisions and former heads
[10:47.280 --> 10:54.080]  of the European Central Bank I mean it's a small corporate takeover group that
[10:54.080 --> 10:59.400]  lobbied to put politicians into power who then put their other people into all
[10:59.400 --> 11:02.640]  the other major positions and now they've recruited even more of their
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.720]  people in we're probably I don't know in the US almost a hundred years into this
[11:07.720 --> 11:11.920]  with the Federal Reserve Act Europe's a couple hundred years into this and so
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.760]  it's it's total gangster government run by the Bankster gangsters imploding the
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.940]  world economy funding fake environmental groups to create corporate
[11:21.940 --> 11:26.280]  collectivism to shut down all of their competition and only allow them to
[11:26.280 --> 11:31.240]  operate while they fund all the nanotech and GMO companies that are
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.720]  publicly destroying the earth's actual genetic code and irrevocably damaging
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.560]  human DNA which on record is mutating quickly because of the mercury in the
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.440]  shots and the dioxins in the food but none of that's an issue you're not
[11:46.440 --> 11:50.400]  going to hear word one from the major environmental groups because they're all
[11:50.400 --> 11:57.920]  on record founded and funded by the Rockefellers the gothers of England the
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.760]  gothers of the Netherlands the Rothschilds of England every stink in one
[12:03.760 --> 12:07.600]  of them you know what Henry Paulson did with the hundreds of millions of
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.320]  dollars 200 something mill he gave himself he gave you go look this up
[12:12.320 --> 12:20.960]  most of it to environmental groups that's his tithe to their religion their
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.880]  anti-human religion of shutting down human activity nothing to do with the
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.200]  earth all right I'm already ranting here's the deal I've told myself in the
[12:30.200 --> 12:38.880]  new year it is a resolution and I told myself this a month and a half ago that
[12:38.880 --> 12:46.040]  I was going to lose 60 pounds and I've lost 21 and my plan was to just buy by
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.320]  this time next year lose the 60 pounds and I'm already 20 pounds there it's
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.240]  easy for me to lose 20 pounds I've got to go all the way to 60 I'm gonna go down
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.160]  to 180 pounds and I'm well on my way and I'm gonna do it running twice a day
[13:00.160 --> 13:07.240]  is the main key but that's a side issue the other big resolution is to
[13:07.240 --> 13:16.200]  simplify and categorize everything I do and so on the radio show and on the
[13:16.200 --> 13:20.040]  nightly news show I am going to continue to cover complex issues and continue to
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.680]  cover little side issues that are part of the larger system for people that
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.320]  really tune in study deeply it you know it's key that we all grow together with
[13:28.320 --> 13:31.880]  a deeper understanding but also for the general public it's important to come out
[13:31.880 --> 13:36.240]  basically with the handbook of the New World Order in different video reports
[13:36.240 --> 13:41.320]  that have all the documents in them on every major subject so people understand
[13:41.320 --> 13:44.960]  the globalist main philosophy they understand their greatest systems of
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.960]  control they understand how the global finance system works how the GMO take
[13:50.960 --> 13:56.920]  over works why the globalist are playing God I need to really get this stuff on
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.600]  record because the only fear I have of being imprisoned or killed or set up
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.680]  which thanks to your prayers hasn't happened but certainly could make no
[14:06.680 --> 14:09.920]  mistake we're at the very tip of the spear now we are reaching tens of
[14:09.920 --> 14:13.760]  millions of people a week we are growing exponentially and we are definitely on
[14:13.760 --> 14:21.200]  the globalist radar screen in a big way and so I have no fear except for really
[14:21.200 --> 14:24.920]  laying it all out and I've done a lot of that in the films but I need to do it in
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.120]  say 20 reports might be 30 reports I mean there's a lot of things I've got to
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.040]  categorize and set up and instead of just writing a book that limited people
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.720]  read making film books that's really what my special reports have been over the
[14:37.720 --> 14:41.120]  years before I started the nightly news those little 10 15 minute reports that
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.680]  would be watched millions of times a piece in many cases we put them out for
[14:44.680 --> 14:52.600]  free on YouTube I want to codify every subject and then once they're all done in
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.560]  the next six months or so put them together in film form use that as a
[14:58.560 --> 15:05.280]  blueprint to then make a higher production value film so that's I'm just
[15:05.280 --> 15:08.920]  telling you what my goals are I've got a goal to start a newspaper nationwide
[15:08.920 --> 15:12.720]  that is printed locally in your town distributed by patriots half of its
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.160]  national news the other half your local news if I guarantee to succeed like
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.000]  gangbusters everything's going high tech we go low tech while hitting them at
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.560]  the same time high tech and the latest systems there hit them with the low tech
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.080]  I've got the goal because I'm always trying to finish other things I'm doing
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.320]  to finally launch the social network because I want to launch it right we've
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.840]  launched one before that got you know 30,000 members in crash and you know
[15:34.840 --> 15:38.440]  it was just an off-the-shelf system that's pretty much done we just got to
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.200]  get the personnel then in to run it and then it's a finance issue we've got
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.600]  that coming up I'm just giving you kind of a quick state of the info war report
[15:46.600 --> 15:53.000]  here but another big one I've got is to cover the news because I stay up all
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.760]  night I get up at 5 a.m. I read all this news then I just get upset and angry
[15:57.760 --> 16:02.600]  and I come in here maybe hit 20% of the news in three hours don't hit it in an
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.360]  up depth because I end up is going to guest or spinning out or ranting on one
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.920]  issue because it is exhausting to actually pick up this article and give
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.560]  you a real analysis of it and go into all those connections and information and
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.160]  integrate it and put it out I mean a lot of times Mike Adams was here a few
[16:20.160 --> 16:23.040]  weeks ago to do the nightly news he wanted to have a meeting with me about
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.720]  some issues about some news issues were working on he was sitting in here right
[16:27.720 --> 16:32.280]  in here in this office in the studio right there and he's like well I'm sorry
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.480]  I'm bugging you and I'm like no Mike I invited you here but I was totally out
[16:37.480 --> 16:41.680]  of it and yawning the entire time and then I've always intended to call Mike
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.760]  and apologize to him and never done it's all just doing here on air and then you
[16:45.760 --> 16:48.880]  know he was pat me on the back when he was here you know going over news and
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.640]  stuff he was saying no well thanks for having me out I hope I'm not bugging you
[16:52.640 --> 16:58.360]  because I was being rude in that I was so exhausted I was trying to actually
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.400]  pay attention to him and listen to him I had invited him here but I couldn't do
[17:03.400 --> 17:11.040]  it and so that's another reason I've got to get an absolute shape and get the
[17:11.040 --> 17:15.680]  best nutrients and operate at the highest capacity because I can't just do
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.200]  this off adrenaline I can't just do a three-hour show and then prepare for two
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.960]  or three hours of more research with the guys and do a nightly news every night
[17:23.960 --> 17:28.680]  without getting myself completely mentally and spiritually and physically a
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.760]  hundred percent because by the time I get home at seven or eight o'clock at
[17:32.760 --> 17:37.600]  night I mean I'm like a zombie and I'm not complaining it but now that I've
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.600]  been exercising and eating right a lot better I've suddenly actually had the
[17:41.600 --> 17:46.240]  energy to do it it's good I've got so pray for me to stay on track here folks
[17:46.240 --> 17:51.240]  and to really try to be disciplined like somebody like Ron Paul and to you know
[17:51.240 --> 17:58.160]  take care of myself fully I mean one big issue I discovered is that over the
[17:58.160 --> 18:01.760]  years I might drink two glasses of water a day you've got to have at least eight
[18:01.760 --> 18:07.960]  and I was dehydrated for years and irritable and crazy because of it now
[18:07.960 --> 18:12.160]  I'm making myself and I'm asking the crew most days to drink the eight glasses
[18:12.160 --> 18:15.320]  of water but yet over the weekend I didn't do that and I remembered it started
[18:15.320 --> 18:18.840]  doing it again and then felt that incredible energy and understanding and
[18:18.840 --> 18:25.080]  my old near photographic memory came back so point is I'm trying to take to
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.360]  the next level and lastly and let's see if this goal can be attained now I'm not
[18:29.360 --> 18:32.640]  going to cover mainstream news announcing TSA to take over the streets of
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.160]  America that's coming up next hour I'm not going to get to the giant stack of
[18:36.160 --> 18:44.760]  World War 3 being basically escalated into some incredible realms or the
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.600]  Communist Chinese confiscating people's property and land and trying to take their
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.480]  children if you have more than two children and now that's the model here
[18:52.480 --> 18:58.760]  in the US or Monsanto GM and GMO corn linked to organ failure new big
[18:58.760 --> 19:03.800]  scientific top journal reporting yes ladies and gentlemen every major GMO
[19:03.800 --> 19:10.000]  crop does this and I've talked to top scientists on air who come to their
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.320]  people and say this is sterilizing all the mice and we've got to not have this
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.760]  go in the market and they say shut up that's part of the plan so we're gonna
[19:19.760 --> 19:23.520]  be breaking that down but I'm not getting to all that I'm gonna discipline
[19:23.520 --> 19:27.760]  myself I'm going to do it and I'm going to take your phone calls because I love

[24:38.800 --> 24:45.600]  right there just like the pied piper you know I agree with Dave too man canned
[24:45.600 --> 24:52.400]  hunts where people love to kill almost extinct animals I've seen videos of
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.880]  these on YouTube where people go out to these ranches or whatever and they'll
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.720]  like release birds or whatever right out of containers or animals tell me we'll
[25:01.720 --> 25:04.760]  go up to the cage and shoot the animal in the cage and then have a trophy put
[25:04.760 --> 25:11.240]  up I don't know it's pretty crazy okay let's go ahead and it's one thing if you
[25:11.240 --> 25:15.080]  like to hunt with a bow or something and then you actually go and process it or
[25:15.080 --> 25:20.480]  butcher it yourself and eat it that's great but let's go ahead and go to John
[25:20.480 --> 25:26.120]  Illinois than Mark Bobby Nick and others you're on the air John hi Alex I
[25:26.120 --> 25:31.280]  appreciate your show and I've been a listener for several years you know and
[25:31.280 --> 25:34.520]  I struggle with some of the same things you struggle with I mean people not
[25:34.520 --> 25:41.680]  wanting to be informed and knowing truth and I appreciate the vast array of
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.360]  different sources that you bring to the table I do have one question though in
[25:46.360 --> 25:54.480]  regards to you know how do you prevent yourself from being played as an
[25:54.480 --> 26:01.480]  example you know I know your guest Robert Chapman has said that he expected
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.280]  gold to be over 2,500 at the end of this year you know because I think it was
[26:06.280 --> 26:11.800]  Goldman Sachs was saying you know we're going over 2,500 you know it'll they
[26:11.800 --> 26:16.320]  expected it to be a 2,500 so Mr. Chapman said he expected it to be
[26:16.320 --> 26:21.960]  higher as a matter of fact because if they're saying 25 you can say that
[26:21.960 --> 26:25.480]  they're just they're afraid that it'll they're trying to suppress it and
[26:25.480 --> 26:31.600]  obviously at today's price of around 1,600 well John I mean I mean let's be
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.520]  clear here it's not it's not being played I mean if you look at a 12 year
[26:37.520 --> 26:44.240]  gold graph it was 260 12 years ago and it's gone right up to 2,000 and then
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.160]  they've the globalists have done desperate things destroying their own
[26:48.160 --> 26:53.840]  commodities market raising the margin where there basically is almost no
[26:53.840 --> 26:59.640]  speculation now and they've got tens of tons of gold and JP Morgan I guess that
[26:59.640 --> 27:03.280]  was a sucker punch because normally when they come out with an analysis it's
[27:03.280 --> 27:06.960]  right because they're at the top of the heap even above Goldman Sachs and that's
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.520]  what most analysts believe was 2,500 or higher and Bob I'd say Bob's right about
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.240]  95% of the time and but they just kept and then MF global has hurt the gold
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.880]  market I mean they've never in the 150 plus years of the Chicago Mercadill
[27:21.880 --> 27:28.800]  Exchange CME group ever allowed people to take private sequestered accounts
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.120]  you know private segregated accounts and keep it and then have a guy lie and
[27:35.120 --> 27:37.640]  say I don't know where it went as if the feds don't know where that money was
[27:37.640 --> 27:41.760]  wired it was wired to London and they know which banks it was wired to JP
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.880]  Morgan's one of the big ones and there's a 12-year graph so we have it on
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.520]  screen there is a 12 oh that's a 35-year graph yeah I asked for a 12-year they
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.040]  gave me a 25-year I mean I mean that's gold and if you look at the last 12
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.120]  years there from you know 09 up until now it's going straight up and so that
[28:02.120 --> 28:07.400]  little dip you see there is pretty much nothing when you put a 12-year graph in
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.480]  so I will listen I've always said this what we say here is what I would do
[28:11.480 --> 28:16.760]  personally I'm not telling you that firearms are a great thing even though
[28:16.760 --> 28:20.000]  I said they're only gonna go up in value and now Wall Street Journal had the
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.240]  headline last week guns and ammo the new gold in fact show people that guns and
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.200]  ammo the new gold click news I think was Wall Street Journal I know it was Wall
[28:27.200 --> 28:30.200]  Street Journal but maybe another one too saw a couple saying that different ways
[28:30.200 --> 28:37.320]  different slight variance the headline and so again I said guns ammo store
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.160] able food gold silver they've been the best investments within a year it's
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.000]  gone up and down several times because the system is doing everything it can
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.440]  to knock it down because it exposes paper currency but as global paper
[28:50.440 --> 28:55.560]  currency gets devalued they can't hold it down forever so I haven't sold gold
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.720]  that I bought at 260 bucks and I haven't sold silver I bought at $5 an ounce
[28:59.720 --> 29:06.440]  not when silver hit $49 not when gold hit 1900 and something so that's what I
[29:06.440 --> 29:12.160]  believe playing you would be if I thought golden silver was a bad investment
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.120]  and then I got up here and I said get it and then and then it came out later
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.080]  that I thought that was a bad idea like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan remember
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.280]  last year John or two years ago that the golden the JP Morgan emails came out
[29:26.280 --> 29:31.960]  from Timberwolf where they were selling their customers stock housing stocks
[29:31.960 --> 29:40.000]  housing commodities that they thought were were horrible but then they were
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.680]  telling that people it was a good thing to buy unloading garbage that would be
[29:43.680 --> 29:47.440]  being played John I want you to be able to come back counter what I said then
[29:47.440 --> 29:54.560]  others stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:54.560 --> 30:02.720]  the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global

[33:22.680 --> 33:27.200]  questions that need to be answered in detail but again no investments are
[33:27.200 --> 33:31.440]  bulletproof none of them are silver bullets as I've said about silver upon
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.320]  intended but it's the closest thing to a silver bullet if you're some insider
[33:36.320 --> 33:42.960]  well then stocks and bonds are great but again being played is like what JPMorgan's
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.360]  division of Timberwolf did selling housing stocks that Congress then got
[33:48.360 --> 33:53.160]  the emails on they said we're selling total bleeping you know what to our
[33:53.160 --> 33:59.800]  customers ah ha ha their idiots ah ha ha here I'm saying gold and silver
[33:59.800 --> 34:02.880]  wherever you buy it and if you're going to buy gold and silver might as
[34:02.880 --> 34:07.560]  resources has great deals said Anderson thinks they've hit the bottom with it
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.400]  going down a couple hundred bucks but that's because that the world is in a
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.320]  depression they had of the IMF now admits that again being played is the
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.400]  mainstream media that's not really the mainstream the folks that pose as the
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.760]  mainstream getting up there and saying unemployment's at 8.9 and
[34:27.760 --> 34:34.360]  inflation's at 6% when every other private respected group that advises
[34:34.360 --> 34:39.080]  the fortune 500 like John Williams shadow stats and the rest of it use the
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.160]  old way the government broke it down unemployment's at 22 or more depending on
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.040]  what state you're in California's above 30 as their carbon tax laws by the way
[34:48.040 --> 34:51.200]  California knows what it's doing they want to bankrupt people it's all about
[34:51.200 --> 35:00.440]  control and then expanding on that you've got inflation well above 11% so
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.680]  the so-called mainstream media are paid deceivers in fact they'll take a lot of
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.360]  true news but spin it oh look the TSA screenings aren't just for airports
[35:10.360 --> 35:14.920]  anymore LA Times reports they're going to be everywhere they've been everywhere
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.800]  for five almost six years it's been a public plan where to have a job you're
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.280]  going to be federally certified as a citizen you haven't paid all the taxes
[35:24.280 --> 35:30.280]  they say people that hire you will be given felonies felony federal charges
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.760]  the illegals will be above the law this is all a plan to destroy the middle
[35:35.760 --> 35:42.960]  class the TSA is going to run everything it's public and I sit here with
[35:42.960 --> 35:48.400]  horror go into the urban warfare drills reading army documents John Warren
[35:48.400 --> 35:55.360]  defense authorization act now four years ago five years ago 2007 I mean the 2007
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.400]  defense act they're horrible every year the new stuff they have this latest one
[35:59.400 --> 36:08.840]  abolishes the Bellarites Constitution in the least that you know you did
[36:08.840 --> 36:14.240]  something intentional I'm saying that just a caution that these people can you
[36:14.240 --> 36:21.280]  know play other people and then you know like we you know heard you know one
[36:21.280 --> 36:29.000]  example mr. Chapman give his thoughts based on what they said and oh I do agree
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.920]  with you no no no in in hindsight because J.P. Morgan is so desperate
[36:33.920 --> 36:37.840]  because according to Max Kaiser many other experts I agree with have been
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.640]  proven right they couldn't physically deliver gold because they had been in
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.360]  the market shorting it to try to drive it down and then and then if it didn't go
[36:48.360 --> 36:52.760]  down they were going to be basically bankrupted so they did stuff like MF
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.600]  global global didn't deliver the gold they did stuff like raise the margin
[36:58.600 --> 37:03.320]  calls over and over again through their control of governments worldwide and they
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.960]  did stuff like con the public into believing that it was going to go up
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.920]  and so yes you never know what curveballs they're going to throw but
[37:11.920 --> 37:17.180]  they can only play these games for certain short periods of time as they
[37:17.180 --> 37:20.560]  globally devalue currencies which they're accelerating what's going to
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.960]  happen to commodities long-term they should go up they should should go up
[37:25.960 --> 37:33.440]  if true economics prevails exactly so all we can do is is go with free market
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.280]  economics they've got a rigged market but history shows Ron Paul agrees the
[37:38.280 --> 37:42.400]  Von Mies Institute agrees Austrian economics even the Keynesian you can
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.600]  I mean bottom line economic law is what goes up must come down what and so their
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.680]  currency system is going to catch up with them it already has man I go to
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.080]  shops now to buy stuff I go to the grocery store the inflation is horrible
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.600]  it's it and they're telling us that inflation is you know three four five
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.360]  six percent depending on what group you're looking at John that's right
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.440]  yeah I mean so who knows what's going to happen I mean who knows they could do
[38:12.440 --> 38:16.960]  anything they could outlaw gold and silver again and say turn it in I mean
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.880]  the when you're living under tyranny that's why societies fall apart because
[38:21.880 --> 38:27.000]  there's no security to invest there's no security to build there's no security to
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.080]  hire there's no security except if you're a big globalist fortune 100 you know
[38:33.080 --> 38:38.920]  how things are gonna go you know how to plan everybody else is shut down yep
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.640]  well I appreciate your show thank you very much thank you John and again I
[38:43.640 --> 38:47.200]  said I'm gonna take a lot of calls I've taken one in 15 minutes by the way he

[39:10.600 --> 39:16.360]  important man I get wound up I take off a couple days and I am so wound up right
[39:16.360 --> 39:20.520]  now all right let's try to go quickly now to Mark Bobby Tom what deep and
[39:20.520 --> 39:28.800]  others Mark in Oregon you're on the air good morning Alex hey buddy hey man my
[39:28.800 --> 39:36.120]  old radio friend I just want to sincerely wish and and I do pray for the best
[39:36.120 --> 39:41.480]  year yet coming up for you and your family of course for all of us but well
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.600]  yours too brother thank you sir you contribute and you give so much
[39:45.600 --> 39:50.160]  personally I think you deserve a special prayer and I believe God's gonna make it
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.000]  that way for you I notice you're striving for it more excellent you've
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.360]  already achieved excellent sure you're now polishing up and my problem is is
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.720]  I'm too wound up I mean I'm like a horse that comes out of the comes out of the
[40:02.720 --> 40:06.520]  gate and runs through the wall runs over the fence instead of staying on the
[40:06.520 --> 40:12.360]  track I've got to grow up and polish and focus but I do feel like I got 600 horse
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.360]  power under the hood it'll just take a little bit more what you're doing
[40:16.360 --> 40:21.360]  nutritionally and diet wise and exercise and you're just about there man you
[40:21.360 --> 40:24.680]  really are thank you God bless you sir what do you think about all the
[40:24.680 --> 40:30.760]  incredible things that are unfolding I mentioned to you on the show going back
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.320]  a couple of years about two years Alex that you know I noticed the speed and
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.840]  so did you the their their rate of implementation of their global agenda
[40:39.840 --> 40:45.760]  economically as well as tyranny wise destroying our Constitution and
[40:45.760 --> 40:50.320]  destroying other countries is really picked up going back a couple of years
[40:50.320 --> 40:57.160]  so they set a new pace they set a new momentum and they've achieved it and
[40:57.160 --> 41:02.920]  they've achieved it and all that we can do is just to do our best to expose their
[41:02.920 --> 41:09.520]  evil deeds and we follow you you know and then you enlighten us and it's that
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.960]  only game plan in town and it's the one in the Bible where we're to expose the
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.800]  evil and to defeat it and we can only try our best to do that and God honors
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.360]  that so God bless you I I just wanted to mention one thing Alex really ask you a
[41:25.360 --> 41:33.440]  question have you heard about house bill 46 46 fill me in on it I think I have
[41:33.440 --> 41:39.000]  but I want to make sure I'm accurate well from a source a radio source so I've
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.920]  always found very reliable through the years this bill has already been passed
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.000]  through Congress but it's not taken effect yet nor has it been announced
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.240]  publicly but that it will go into effect right after the new year begins I
[41:56.240 --> 42:01.640]  heard specifically the date January 1st now what this bill does Alex is it
[42:01.640 --> 42:09.520]  exacts a transaction tax on all bank transactions that means if one gets a
[42:09.520 --> 42:15.200]  Social Security check and they deposit it 1% goes to the US government well I
[42:15.200 --> 42:20.720]  know Europe is is is trying to create that financial fee system that really
[42:20.720 --> 42:25.800]  just affect the general public and so I'll have to look into that if that is
[42:25.800 --> 42:34.320]  the case I will look into it so it's HB 46 46 yes sir and it will exact after
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.480]  your initial deposit it will exact a 1% transaction tax on any debit card
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.960]  or check in payment for any goods or services at the bank so it's not just
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.760]  your initial deposit it's everything that you buy after your initial deposit
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.240]  out of that deposit funny you say that because that's why they want to cash
[42:53.240 --> 42:58.200]  with society we've been sold that it's such a great idea and then it's just
[42:58.200 --> 43:01.640]  going to make everything so easy and you just wave your hand with a microchip
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.680]  or you get face scanned and then your face is your money and I appreciate your
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.480]  call mark the problem is from studying public globalist think tank documents
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.640]  and big symposiums they've had in Chicago and other cities and where they
[43:17.640 --> 43:24.960]  get the big companies together for IT development and for commerce discussions
[43:24.960 --> 43:29.960]  about the future of banking transactions all over the years the system
[43:29.960 --> 43:35.120]  admits once they've got you on a cashless society they can track everything
[43:35.120 --> 43:40.480]  they can manage the economy to consolidate it not to help people and
[43:40.480 --> 43:46.280]  they can knock out the black market the underground that's just barter and
[43:46.280 --> 43:52.440]  humans living like normal people so everything the globalist are bringing in
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.320]  is about cracking down on the general public it's all about shutting down mom
[43:57.320 --> 44:03.880]  and pop and that's why you see well it was even Forbes a few months ago you had
[44:03.880 --> 44:08.600]  the headline you know why is there a giant purge and crack down on lemonade
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.480]  stands people being arrested girl scouts being fined for selling cookies even
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.960]  though it turns out they were paying the taxes total harassment of high school
[44:19.960 --> 44:27.440]  bake sales church bake sales just just enforcers everywhere because under this
[44:27.440 --> 44:32.960]  system it's not just the Amish every day I hear about I'm arresting or rating
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.320]  Amish who are just selling milk to their neighbors I mean that's what they've
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.720]  always done they moved here from Germany and Russia and Switzerland in the last
[44:42.720 --> 44:45.960]  200 years because they were being persecuted there and they said we can
[44:45.960 --> 44:50.440]  come here and live on the land and work and and practice our religion they
[44:50.440 --> 44:55.080]  said yeah and you know what the Amish and Mennonites they'll just pick up and
[44:55.080 --> 45:00.640]  leave where they're gonna go paraglider even now being persecuted there just
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.200]  trying to produce food and sell it for almost nothing to the locals they're
[45:05.200 --> 45:08.920]  good for economies but the system doesn't want that because it's all about a
[45:08.920 --> 45:16.040]  consolidation I mean here's a daily male headline the rise of pernicious laws
[45:16.040 --> 45:22.400]  that criminalize the law abiding and this is an article out of England how
[45:22.400 --> 45:26.200]  they're just coming out with all these new laws and regulations I mean I saw
[45:26.200 --> 45:30.680]  one where a 90 year old woman's been feeding ducks since she was a child's
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.840]  local lake and they arrested her and what finder for a thousand dollars for
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.520]  feed them some bread I mean I take my children once a month or so down the
[45:39.520 --> 45:47.000]  town lake to feed bread to the ducks I see articles where woman given two
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.880]  thousand dollar fine for throwing cat litter in the trash can you see these
[45:51.880 --> 45:57.560]  articles where the police are only there to raise money and now they're setting
[45:57.560 --> 46:04.680]  up federalized rural affairs systems and this bureau of rural affairs this
[46:04.680 --> 46:11.440]  this this commission this council of rural affairs is the technical name and
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.320]  then most of it is federalized locals they're wearing your local state game
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.840]  warden and county game warden they're wearing local BLM but they're under the
[46:20.840 --> 46:26.080]  feds and they march up and literally get in your face and treat you like
[46:26.080 --> 46:35.360]  absolute trash the EPA a year ago said dust off of a plow thousand dollar fine
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.800]  for every incident and they just sit there it's on the news they're put the
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.800]  sit there okay I watched you plow for eight hours and every row you plowed
[46:44.800 --> 46:51.220]  was a new fine that is going to be sixty five thousand dollars no judge no
[46:51.220 --> 46:56.360]  jury you can't appeal now the Congress just passed Obama says he's gonna veto
[46:56.360 --> 47:03.640]  it a bill saying you're allowed to have dust off your field they said hey is a
[47:03.640 --> 47:08.800]  toxic waste you know splicing all the crops together where they in three
[47:08.800 --> 47:15.480]  generations sterilize every mammal that eats them that's not a problem oh if
[47:15.480 --> 47:20.680]  if there's any runoff from your field into any type of stream they're gonna
[47:20.680 --> 47:26.680]  take your property but if you're a big global corporation you can do whatever
[47:26.680 --> 47:31.360]  you want I remember an AP article back in the late 90s where there were
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.960]  thousands of violations at one Tyson plant or complex of plants for chicken
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.280]  production and then another local had a couple violations and they got shut
[47:42.280 --> 47:48.840]  down that's why the big corporations always lobby for more regs because
[47:48.840 --> 47:57.840]  they're not enforced on them that's the essence of the New World Order and
[47:57.840 --> 48:03.360]  Republicans aren't gonna tell you that they're not gonna tell you why Newt
[48:03.360 --> 48:11.360]  Genrich and Mitt Romney are supporting Obamacare because that's what the
[48:11.360 --> 48:15.320]  insurance companies on with the big banks want it's it lets government take
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.760]  over medicine and cut back what you get and it makes 35 million people buy the
[48:19.760 --> 48:27.600]  insurance it's on record the big banks wrote that bill of course Mitt Romney
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.040]  and Newt Genrich are for it see it's a cover that it's even socialism that's
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.000]  bad enough because it always leads to control but you think these big mega
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.040]  ruthless corporations that in Africa and Latin America send in military to kill
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.760]  indigenous people for their property under environmental auspices but then
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.920]  they go ahead and cut it all down do you think they care about you or I know the
[48:50.920 --> 48:57.480]  answer is no I'm gonna get to it all in the next hour let's continue your calls
[48:57.480 --> 49:02.000]  quickly here Bobby in California thanks for holding it on the air if you go
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.960]  to Google and type in BPA and retail workers you'll find a report from the
[49:05.960 --> 49:10.040]  environmental working group stating that retail workers carry an average of 30
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.360]  percent more BPA estrogen than other adults everyone should print that article
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.360]  often do it to every cashier you buy something from yeah of course most of
[49:18.360 --> 49:21.560]  them will look at you like you're a complete moron you mean you're bringing
[49:21.560 --> 49:26.160]  me a mainline government report that that that of thousands of plastics the
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.360]  one they've chosen for printer ink for the plastics for everything as an
[49:30.360 --> 49:36.540]  estrogen mimiker that lowers male fertility and hyper accelerates women
[49:36.540 --> 49:40.680]  it's aging women inside that's why breast cancer is off the charts and I've
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.840]  warned people and read the reports and CBS news comes out and says Alex Jones
[49:44.840 --> 49:50.040]  hates gay people and says the chemicals want to make us gay they make a joke out
[49:50.040 --> 49:54.160]  of it because it's a chemical weapon attack and the women you know what CBS
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.480]  reporters so what if their wife dies of breast cancer of their daughter or
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.760]  grandma whoop-de-doo let's not actually warn people that it hyper feminizes
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.680]  women and gives them breast cancer and then feminizes men and gives us
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.920]  particular cancer well we can just make a joke about how I'm bashing gay people
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.800]  has nothing to do with that because they're chemically altering who we are
[50:15.800 --> 50:21.240]  and just like in the movie the last man on earth when he's trying to cure them
[50:21.240 --> 50:25.560]  they go no we don't want that and throw a spear right through him Omega man's the

[54:02.200 --> 54:13.720]  I'm back live you know this is my frustration this is my spinning of
[54:13.720 --> 54:20.840]  wheel sometimes. Another report I want to do because I hit a nerve three years ago reading
[54:20.840 --> 54:26.080]  big scientific reports that were out about Bisphenol-A, I've been talking about it for
[54:26.080 --> 54:29.840]  over a decade, but it was finally coming out in mainline government reports in Europe and
[54:29.840 --> 54:35.520]  other places, that Bisphenol-A that's used in the printer ink, the receipts at the store,
[54:35.520 --> 54:41.080]  the plastic lining when you microwave that food, you wonder why boys are so feminine
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.200]  and confused, why girls are so hyper-feminine, some of them are going into puberty at age
[54:45.200 --> 54:52.080]  three now, and I did a big report on it and hundreds of George Soros affiliated groups,
[54:52.080 --> 54:58.000]  he has hundreds, came out and said Alex Jones says the government wants to make us gay.
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.200]  Well actually I do have government documents, we covered in in game 1.5 with Professor and
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.600]  Dr. Kaufman who came across documents where they said we will promote promiscuity because
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.680]  the studies show that people then won't have lasting relationships and the state will get
[55:13.680 --> 55:20.080]  the children, which you've now seen, somebody who's out of wedlock four times more likely
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.440]  to be in prison, and then they spin it, oh you're bashing single mothers, no, we're saying
[55:25.440 --> 55:32.000]  it's a lot harder, the state wants you isolated, okay, they want to break up the family, it's
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.640]  not a, so then we say yes this is massively, my main report was about breast cancer, number
[55:38.640 --> 55:46.000]  one in the world in the US, up several thousand percentage points, it is a hellish scourge,
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  my grandmother has breast cancer, okay, and in fact that was three years ago, she's had
[55:52.000 --> 56:00.200]  it that long, and it's slow growing, she's opted just to not do it, not deal with it,
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.360]  but the point is that I was talking about that and by the time it hit CBS News and ABC
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.480]  News last week, oh this guy Ron Paul talks to says they want to make you gay, no what
[56:10.480 --> 56:16.600]  I said was is that fish are hemaphrodites, frogs are hemaphrodites, all over the western
[56:16.600 --> 56:23.160]  world when our sewage dumps into the water, this stuff coming out of us is so strong it's
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.600]  destroying them as well, because their life cycles are quicker and it mutates more each
[56:28.600 --> 56:35.160]  generation, just type in human DNA massively damaged from heavy metals, and there's all
[56:35.160 --> 56:42.560]  the big reports, so for those that don't know what an omega man is, it's a remake of a Vincent
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.720]  Price movie with the last man on earth or whatever it's called, they're both excellent
[56:46.720 --> 56:53.280]  sci-fi movies, where there's a virus that basically turns people into these undead, and some
[56:53.280 --> 56:58.440]  of them retain their intelligence, and he's got a cure for them and at the end he's like
[56:58.440 --> 57:05.240]  I can cure you, I figured out a reverse the virus, he's a scientist, and they kill him,
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.360]  and so I was using the analogy of hey did you know the system wants to reduce our population
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.320]  and want to break up the family, so they're using hormones on us, just like they have
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.240]  genetically modified mosquitoes they release that then breed with the other mosquitoes,
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.240]  with the genetic trait to produce a hormone, so they're sterile, the mad scientist are
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.640]  manipulating us, and their answer is you're not supposed to tell people they have a choice,
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.600]  they're supposed to say it's trendy, be glad you want to put makeup on, you know as a man
[57:34.600 --> 57:38.920]  out there because you've got so much estrogen, be glad you feel like a woman, be glad you've
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.720]  got male breast, be glad your wife's dying of breast cancer, be glad your mother's dying
[57:43.720 --> 57:50.480]  of breast cancer, and your anti-homophobic or homophobic or whatever if you don't embrace
[57:50.480 --> 57:55.240]  it, see how that's all scientific, they're just cold scientists destroying our humanity,
[57:55.240 --> 57:59.840]  destroying our sexuality, artificially changing us, then the argument is oh there weren't gay
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.880]  people in Rome, of course that stuff's gone on in history, I'm not making even a moral
[58:04.880 --> 58:10.200]  issue here, I'm saying I have a choice, they shouldn't be trying to spike everything with
[58:10.200 --> 58:15.960]  female hormones, man that's uncool, okay I don't want to take female hormones, I want
[58:15.960 --> 58:21.720]  to be a male, okay, and I don't want my wife to be bombarded and my daughters with so much
[58:21.720 --> 58:27.880]  they get breast cancer, okay, and now you're anti-woman, you don't want them to die, see
[58:27.880 --> 58:31.160]  how they use political correctness, I'm like folks this is hurting us, it's killing our
[58:31.160 --> 58:34.480]  women, shut up you just don't like women, no no no, they're putting the hormone in, it's
[58:34.480 --> 58:39.560]  hurting women, shut up you just want to hurt women, it's all nonsensical political correctness.
[58:39.560 --> 58:47.040]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:47.040 --> 58:58.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road, but if the
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.400]  unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[59:02.400 --> 59:12.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[59:12.280 --> 59:21.600]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the
[59:21.600 --> 59:29.680]  crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[59:29.680 --> 59:36.480]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality,
[59:36.480 --> 59:41.040]  our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[59:41.040 --> 59:48.160]  ride all day with confidence, order yours at gusset.com, diamond gusset jeans got it,
[59:48.160 --> 1:00:00.240]  others don't.
[1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:25.720]  All right, I'm continuing with your calls a little bit here, then I'm going to get into
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:30.000]  more of the news and more of your calls, and Gerald Salente is joining us, Bobby just brought
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.920]  up a subject that when I, he started hitting it, what more than a decade ago, but it started
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:39.960]  getting attention about three years ago, the system is really scared of this because they
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:49.080]  are jacking the GMO to sterilize men and women, but they're also adding feminizing, sterilizing,
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:53.520]  fertility reducing hormones as the Rockefeller Foundation said they would do in the mid-60s,
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:59.000]  they've republished those documents that are public, but linked to them at info wars.com,
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.280]  they are feminizing men, they're not just adding sodium fluoride to brain damage you
[1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:09.160]  and reduce IQ, and I guess the political correctness now if you say that is don't call people dumb
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:13.480]  down, he's making fun of you saying you've been dumbed down, drink more fluoride, but
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.920]  they don't do that there because it's too obvious, but when you say, hey, between all
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.680]  A alone and most plastic products and linings and in the printer ink is a massively increasing
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:29.760]  breast cancer in women in major studies, they don't know what to do, but I added it also
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:34.320]  feminizes men and men are the main target, it's a byproduct for women down in the breast
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:38.560]  cancer and the women are going into fertility now younger and younger, some as young as
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:44.400]  three if you can believe that, they're having babies at seven and eight, fertility a hundred
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:50.400]  years ago was on average 13 or 14, so all of that's going on, all of that's happening
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:56.360]  and their answer is shut up, you hate gay people, and so not debating the morals of
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:00.360]  it here, so I can get through to some of you that are mind controlled out there, do I have
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:05.760]  a right to not have the government put female hormones in me and a lot of folks have joined
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:10.960]  the cult and I'm saying a cult aspect of that and they're like shut up, we're going to
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:16.080]  get you, you know might as well, might as well give into it and it becomes a body snatcher
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:21.400]  type deal, if you want to force people artificially to join something and see as more and more
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:25.840]  the public goes under the influence and they also have the social stuff pushing it on the
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.280]  TV, so people act on the hormones, then as you're like well I don't want to take it,
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:34.200]  they're like you're going to take it, you're going to join us and so that's really the
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.240]  point it's now reached, is that you're going to join us, you're going to do this and a
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.240]  lot of it is repressed families, people that are really into things that they think are
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.960]  shocking and so it's who, it's the bad thing and we're going to make you do the bad thing,
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:54.800]  but for the globalist on top it's just cold-blooded, put the sterilants into the water, screw up
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.960]  the society and then when somebody pops up and says here's all these government documents,
[1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:04.000]  use political correctness and say you're attacking people's identity and that's why I use the
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.400]  Omega Man analogy where he's like I have the cure, you know they're putting chemicals
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:12.440]  in you, they're like shut up, kill him and so that's basically the answer, so if you
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:16.840]  like dinobreast cancer and justicular cancer and prostate cancer knock yourselves out,
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:22.040]  dang I'm the bad man I guess, because that stuff hyperages those organs because it's
[1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:27.720]  also a toxic form of the hormone that creates a lot of other retrograde hormones that it
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:30.720]  breaks down into, I don't want to get all into the science, you can go look at it yourself,
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:35.320]  Bobby give people that latest report you mentioned, I've seen probably 50 or 60 over the last
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:40.040]  few years, but I'll give us the latest and then we'll pull that up and see if I've seen
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.040]  that in the past.
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:46.920]  Yeah, you just Google BPA and retail workers and it's a report from the environmental working
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:54.040]  group and it just shows how they tested the retail workers about 30% more estrogen from
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:59.000]  handling receipts and money and whatever else and then imagine what they're doing to pregnant
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  mothers who are getting 30% more estrogen with that fetus inside them.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.400]  And they're getting more miscarriages, they tend to when you have too much estrogen and
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:13.120]  what is it, not enough of the other hormones, progesterone, they have that second trimester
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:19.520]  miscarriage, but why tell women how to not have all those miscarriages that are epidemic?
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:25.640]  Just be, you're not trendy, you need to just shut up, you don't like gay people?
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:30.600]  We're being bathed in it and all this post-consumer recycle stuff they're pushing, they're finding
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:35.600]  that even the toilet paper is exposing humans to harmful amounts of DTA because of the storey
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:42.080]  seeds, which have been found to contain 2% up to 2% DTA in total weight, so all this stuff
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:46.960]  that's being recycled and being pushed as a better alternative, these bags are being
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  more.
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.680]  And again, we're all seen as animals, they put it in the money, the paper, the printer
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:55.280]  ink, all sitting back scientifically laughing at us.
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:05:00.560]  Finish up Bobby straight ahead, I want to hear more from you.
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:09.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:13.880]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:18.960]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:20.880]  grid technology is coming.
[1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.240]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:29.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:32.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:36.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:41.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:45.040]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:46.360]  my oldest sponsors.
[1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:53.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[1:05:53.280 --> 1:06:00.160]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:03.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.880]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:08.880]  risk.
[1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:10.080]  Saving means to make money.
[1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:14.300]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[1:06:14.300 --> 1:06:19.840]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:25.600]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.280]  or antibacterials.
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:32.920]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:35.200]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:38.480]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:40.560]  to do something you've never done before.

[1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:05.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:12.920]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:13.920]  at home.
[1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:18.960]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:19.960]  the shots.
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:24.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:28.240]  Full, the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:34.080]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:35.080]  world government.
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:39.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.480]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:47.480]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:48.480]  of the Republic.
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:53.480]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:08:22.480]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.480]  And you can pull it up.
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:28.680]  In fact, guys, we're going to show a video clip here in a moment, but then pull up, BPA
[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:30.320]  Retail Workers, 30% higher.
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:31.320]  I do remember that.
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:32.880]  They came out months ago.
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:36.720]  BPA is on record triggering breast cancer.
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:40.280]  It's on record triggering prostate and testicular cancer.
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:43.560]  And if people think that's funny, that's wonderful.
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:49.640]  But CBS News and others last week attacked Ron Paul and said, he goes on the show of
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:54.800]  Alex Jones, who says the government puts chemicals in the food to make us gay.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:00.960]  Now, this is a good thing that they're attacking on this subject, because they're attacking
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:03.520]  because they're scared.
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:09.000]  What I pointed out is that it reduces male fertility and makes girls go into puberty early
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.920]  and causes the artificial aging, the accelerated aging of sexual tissues, tissues that have
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:24.400]  a high hormonal flux, the ovaries, the breast, the prostate, the testicles.
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:30.160]  Those are areas affected heavily by hormone flux to boil it down and simplify it.
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:34.760]  Sharks do not get cancer because sharks do not operate off of hormones.
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:35.760]  They're cold-blooded.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.800]  We're warm-blooded.
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:44.640]  That's why cancer is so high in mammals and marsupials for that fact.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:48.400]  One of the reasons is because we are hot-blooded creatures.
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:49.960]  Our hearts beat fast.
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  We have hormones.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:51.960]  We're supercharged.
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:53.520]  We're jacked up.
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:57.800]  Now, the system, and that wears out cells.
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:07.640]  Now, there's the Centers for Disease Prevention, down BPA in 93% of Americans over age six.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:19.560]  It goes on to get into the fact that workers in retail have a 30% more BPA in their bodies.
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:23.960]  That was as of May 2009, so that's the federal government's own report.
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:25.200]  You can link right there.
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:30.680]  We have it on screen for PrismPlanet.tv viewers to that federal disease control and prevention
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:31.680]  in Atlanta.
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:35.600]  They were forced a few years ago to report on it because it was all over Japanese, all
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:37.800]  over Russian, all over European news.
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:42.360]  Again, I've been covering this since I got on air 16 years ago.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:48.480]  We knew then this is added to our food through the lining, through the microwavable stuff,
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:53.040]  through the glasses we buy, the bottles, but the printer ink, the money.
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.440]  Again, they have thousands of plastics they could use.
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:00.280]  Now, Bobby just brought up something that was key.
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:03.000]  BPA has proliferated.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.640]  If you go back 10 years ago, Aspartame was only in a couple hundred products.
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:12.800]  Now because the public's become aware of it, it's in over 10,000 last time I checked.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:16.160]  You can't buy sugar gum at a major store that doesn't have it.
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:19.200]  It says sugar, but it's got Aspartame in it.
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:20.200]  And why?
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:22.240]  Because you're going to get addicted to that gum.
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.960]  All those food additives just aren't additives for flavor.
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:27.560]  They're addicting.
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:35.600]  They got a federal law passed decades ago where major fast food restaurants can use
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:40.440]  in their, the dough on things that are fried on the batter.
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:43.360]  They can put silicone in it.
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:45.680]  No wonder kidney failure is off the charts.
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:47.240]  No wonder liver failure.
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:48.880]  No wonder fatty liver.
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:50.920]  They're poisoning everything.
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:53.480]  And you study these elites, they don't eat any of this.
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:56.160]  They are obsessed with organic.
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.560]  They are obsessed with it.
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:01.480]  They know what they're doing.
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:02.980]  And you know, this is what's funny.
[1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:03.980]  It's not funny.
[1:12:03.980 --> 1:12:04.980]  It's very sad.
[1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:09.640]  I get up here and I just showed you the federal government's own documents on screen, told
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.360]  you what to search to find them.
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:19.760]  You can get literally, there's the CDC's own report.
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:29.040]  But separately, when you read into the deeper studies on Bisphenol-A, hyperfeminizes women,
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:30.040]  feminizes men.
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:31.400]  It is an estrogen.
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:37.040]  You might as well, like Bobby said, go to the doctor and say, I want to become a woman.
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:38.600]  Give me female hormones.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:43.520]  And they'll say, here's estrogen, here's progesterone, here's everything else.
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:48.560]  And you'll grow hips, you'll grow breasts, your skin will glow like you're basically
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:50.360]  a pregnant woman.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:54.320]  Now my point is, they're doing this on purpose.
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:55.720]  They're selling the culture.
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:56.760]  They're selling the ideas.
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:00.760]  They're injecting it while putting the chemicals in.
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:01.760]  And they've done studies.
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:02.760]  You can pull them up.
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:07.200]  Where you give this to monkeys, you give it to dogs, you give it to frogs.
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:12.320]  Male frogs, even reptiles operate similarly, will start acting like females.
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:17.440]  And then when you scientifically get up here and try to warn people, they make a joke out
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:21.160]  of it.
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:25.040]  I'm not attacking anybody for what their identity is.
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.360]  Quite frankly, I don't care.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:31.000]  And people get off on this stuff so much and love it when they get attacked for their identity,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  whatever they're into.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Just, I don't care.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Stay out of my way.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Okay?
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.560]  Leave my second amendment and my private property, my freedom alone, and don't try to brainwash
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.200]  my children to your thinking no matter what it is.
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:44.200]  It's simple.
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.400]  I want to be independent and free.
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.600]  But let's be honest, we're an artificial habitat with the system on record jacking with our
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:53.200]  food and our water.
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:55.440]  And by the way, it's not just with the sexual hormones.
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.960]  They're adding over 350 chemicals are added.
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.360]  Generally, it's only a couple of hundred.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:04.760]  But there's 350 plus that tend to be out of dear water in what they call fluoride.
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:09.080]  We're talking about radium, strontium, uranium.
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:14.360]  Now if those had sexual effects, which they do, they reduce fertility, increase cancer,
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:17.160]  they don't really flip you one way or the other sexually.
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:19.720]  They would say, don't criticize uranium in the water.
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:20.720]  You don't like gay people.
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:22.760]  And you're like, what does that have to do with gay people?
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:25.640]  It's all just a politically correct game they play.
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:33.880]  And CBS and ABC and all these other big publications with the talking point now that Alex Jones
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:36.800]  says they're putting stuff in the food to make you gay.
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.320]  That's what's so good about this.
[1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:43.360]  When they attack us, people are actually going out and finding what I've really said and
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.200]  you know what, I don't want to get testicular cancer and I don't want my wife to die of
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:48.200]  breast cancer.
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:51.360]  I'm going to look into this bisphenol A and you find out it's all true.
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:56.520]  You're like, wow, Alex Jones tried to warn me, which by the way is not some faker, folks.
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.400]  We're all under attack by this.
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:02.800]  I'm not some hero for telling you this, but I'll tell you this, CBS News and the rest
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:09.560]  of them are wicked devils who know exactly what they're doing.
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:13.760]  There is a talking point out that, oh, this guy's trying to warn people we're jacking their
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:16.400]  food and water with hormones and toxins.
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:18.360]  That's why the public can't wake up as in a trance.
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:23.280]  We're drugged, folks, only by being conscious to the drugging.
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:27.480]  And then the fact that we're in a trance from television that puts you in a literal in between
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:33.040]  waking and sleeping, sleepwalking phase, literal brainwave, only by being conscious and finally
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:34.640]  shaking somebody out of it.
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:36.840]  You've heard the political term, wake people up.
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:38.200]  I woke up.
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:39.440]  That's not a figure of speech.
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:40.440]  You do.
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:42.880]  You wake up.
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:43.880]  And you know what?
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  You're going to be groggy.
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.320]  It's going to feel like a hangover.
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:48.760]  It's going to be frightening.
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:52.520]  But then you realize, well, I was already in this position, at least I'm awake now because
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:58.080]  all the stuff going on around us, it's going on whether you want to deny it or not.
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:15:59.080]  Reality's there.
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:03.960]  I've used the analogy and I'm going back to your calls of somebody on PCP.
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:09.160]  And they do it all the time because the governor is taking off their mind.
[1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:14.720]  They are put in a dream state, an hallucinatory lower brain sleep state.
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:18.760]  Not only are they in a sleep state, it's not there's a cerebral cortex in a sleep state
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:20.200]  like when you're walking around on Prozac.
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:24.720]  That puts you in a sleep state because it's a toxin, a fluoride toxin that's made out
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:25.720]  of fluoride.
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:28.160]  There are a lot of poisons that make you feel good.
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:32.280]  But you're in, it's in the hallucinogen, psychotropic class.
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:34.960]  Go look it up.
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:37.320]  But people on PCP can beat up 10 cops.
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:39.000]  They can punch through windshields.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.760]  I talked to Derek Einkauf about it.
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:45.800]  He ran into guys fighting on PCP killing each other as a ambulance.
[1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:48.120]  They got the calls, shut up before the cops.
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:53.080]  And I've talked to police who've seen people on PCP because the governor's gone and they
[1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:58.320]  will just run and jump off a 20-story roof thinking they're a bird.
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:16:59.520]  But you know what?
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.720]  Just because the public thinks the government loves them and everything's fine, everything's
[1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:07.360]  sweetie cake, and those reporters that work for the sellout system know they're BSing
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:10.720]  people but still feel like they're part of the power structure, you're just at a different
[1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:12.360]  level of delusion.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:18.440]  There's no making a deal with this system.
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:22.960]  And so you think you're just going to go jump off the cliff and it's really, you're a butterfly
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:24.760]  and you're going to go flutter down to the ground?
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:26.880]  Not going to happen.
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:29.920]  And that's why for those of us that are awake, we watch propaganda.
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:39.360]  We see the messages implanted in TV, movies, anti-family, anti-male, endless brainwashing.
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:41.600]  And it's laughable to those of us that are awake.
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:43.400]  We're like, look at it, it's right there.
[1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:44.840]  And it becomes obnoxious.
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:46.800]  It's everywhere.
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:49.640]  And we tend to get angry at the general public who's in a trance.
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:51.280]  These are zombie victims.
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:58.720]  This is like breaking into a Dr. Ewing Cameron CIA mind control base that's been declassified
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:03.760]  where they had school kids they kidnapped all hooked up with drugs and recording audio
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:05.920]  brainwashing them.
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:10.360]  Just because you take the earmuffs off somebody who's being brainwashed and being injected
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:16.000]  with PCP and a cocktail of LSD and masculine, just because they don't know who you are,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:17.080]  they're not bad people.
[1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:19.000]  These are victims.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.120]  And the police officers listening right now are victims.
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:24.160]  The bureaucrats listening right now are victims.
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:27.120]  The military are victims.
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:31.280]  And now that we're in a trance, the system can sell all this publicly.
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:37.280]  I mean, I remember seeing six, seven years ago in Wired Magazine, the article was called
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:41.240]  the Marshall Plan because the head futurist at the Pentagon is called Dr. Marshall.
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:44.480]  And he was saying, you know, we put the troops on drugs in Afghanistan.
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:48.520]  After they go in and do some particularly nasty work, we all give them amnesics now.
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:52.400]  Did you know they're doing that in a large part of the force now?
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:58.600]  They actually, now part of the regiment is hypnosis and amnesic cocktails.
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:01.000]  This is public mind control now going on.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  This isn't going on in some laboratory now.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:08.320]  They hide it in plain view because the public is in a trance as well, not deeply in one.
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:13.360]  They're bringing the public deeper into a trance with the chemicals, with the hormones, with
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:19.720]  the electromagnetic, with all of it, getting people into this state where they'll accept
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:26.240]  almost anything, including weird, fat, pot-bellied men groping your daughters at the airport
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:27.800]  now to be on the highways.
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:31.760]  But Bobby, I appreciate you were going to break here, but I appreciate you raising those
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:32.760]  points, sir.
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:33.760]  Thank you.
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:40.040]  And one more thing, those smart meters, those are directly in our houses and people need
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:44.720]  to call up the electricity company every month and complain because there's no, who's
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:47.320]  to say, they're overcharging, who's to say they're not overcharging people?
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:50.760]  No, no, they've been caught and they track everything in your house.
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:51.960]  They admit that, sir.
[1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:54.040]  They admit pure or welling and evil.
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:20:00.720]  They'll put poison in our water, of course they're surveilling us.
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:04.400]  Does being over 40 make you feel like half the man you used to be?
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:06.600]  Do you feel tired, out of shape?
[1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:08.560]  Is your romantic life suffering?
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:09.800]  It's not your fault.

[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:11.600]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:14.720]  who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:21.840]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:23.240]  opposite reaction.
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:28.640]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:32.480]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:35.480]  The globalists are scared they've overreached.
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:38.920]  The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:54.440]  globalist propaganda platform.
[1:22:54.440 --> 1:22:56.680]  We are going to use their system against them.
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:00.160]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:01.440]  Warning!
[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:06.840]  The unprepared may not survive the next natural disaster, terrorist attack, pandemic, or economic

[1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:25.560]  You'll be glad you did.
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.960]  Here's the guy and the last man on earth.
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  He tried to warn him.
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:31.560]  He's got the cure for the disease they've got.
[1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.560]  But they just kill him.
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:34.560]  They don't want to be helped.
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:35.560]  They like it.
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:25:05.080]  They don't want to know what was done to them.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:27.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:41.480]  Alright, let's go to Moa Deep in Pennsylvania.
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:44.480]  Gerald Salente is coming up on the latest on the world economy.
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:46.080]  Moa Deep, you're on the air.
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:47.080]  Go ahead.
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.080]  Is this that evil Alex Jones?
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:53.200]  I'm the guy telling folks they're putting stuff in there to increase our cancer.
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:55.920]  Our cancer rates several thousand times off the charts.
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:56.920]  I'm the Batman.
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:59.120]  You're the Batman, Mr. Jones.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:03.720]  Anyway, I'm calling from Pennsylvania with some new news and two questions.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:11.280]  The first news, as a Pennsylvania water customer, I just got a new letter today stating that
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:21.040]  they're changing from processing the water and cleaning it from chlorine to chloramine.
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:27.040]  I have no idea what this difference is, but I spoke to a chemist.
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:31.200]  I spoke to, I don't know what they're called.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:32.680]  They're biological guys.
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.280]  The toxicologist, the biological toxicologist.
[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:37.280]  Go ahead.
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:41.440]  Ten times more deadlier than chlorine.
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:47.400]  All of Pennsylvania is going to switch from chlorine to chloramine.
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:53.040]  I'd like to fact you, so before when we're done, who can have your guys not hang up on
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:56.920]  me, pick up the line, give me a fax number, I'll send you this.
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:04.000]  Then the two things, I know it's an info war, and I know that you hate for people to ask,
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:09.560]  but I have to ask just basically because you have to go by your gut, and I'm much, much
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:15.680]  older than you, and I have to go by my gut, and my gut's telling me something different.
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:21.800]  But I'd like you to give me, if you can, a straight answer on one, when does it change
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:28.680]  from an info war to a hot war, and two, when will the people have to fight?
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:30.560]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:32.920]  Look, you're asking for a fax number.
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:34.480]  We never even give a fax number out.
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:38.280]  I know we have one here in the office, but put him on hold, and we'll somebody give John
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:42.280]  Harmon up there at the network our fax number, because I do want to see this information.
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:43.560]  This gentleman wants to send us.
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.320]  So we'll put him on hold, and then give that gentleman our fax number.
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:48.640]  I haven't given it out, and I forget it.
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:52.920]  I should have a fax number in here, but please, not more than four or five pages once I do
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:55.320]  get it and give it out on air.
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:58.960]  Look, again, that is such an incredibly complex issue.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:07.560]  A caller called in and brought up the government admitting that between all A, BPA, is massively
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:14.960]  causing infertility in men, and hyperfeminism in women.
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:17.880]  And I've seen some media spin it like, oh, you'll be like Wonder Woman.
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:22.080]  No, you'll have the breast of an 80-year-old woman when you're 30 and die of breast cancer.
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:27.000]  It's not fun, okay?
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.360]  It's such a mass murder.
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:33.040]  Most of us who've lost family members to cancer and other disorders like that, the government
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.040]  did it.
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:35.040]  The globalist did it.
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:36.680]  They're called eugenicists.
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:38.680]  They've written public plans to do it.
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:43.600]  They're horrible murderers, and they've got to be dealt with, but you don't deal with
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.920]  them by saying, when do we start getting violent?
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:47.920]  I mean, who do you get violent with?
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.840]  The fluoride head cop down the street who's just as poisoned and brain damaged as everybody
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:56.560]  else, you try to wake them up and get them out of the zombie state.
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:59.600]  They've all learned a little zombie state, and they've all got their little mindset of
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:00.880]  why they do what they do.
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.720]  You've got to break that shell.
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:08.160]  You've got to get in there and get them to see the wider world.
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:09.440]  You've got to expose the globalist.
[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:13.520]  I mean, look at Ron Paul, now the leading candidate under total demonization.
[1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:15.520]  Look at where we've come.
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:19.280]  Twenty years ago, he couldn't get one co-sponsor in Congress or in the Fed.
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:20.280]  He passed it in the House.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.000]  The Senate used the procedure to kill it.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.800]  We do better next time.
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:28.800]  Ron Paul, if he doesn't win this time and goes and retires, the idea of liberty is there.
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:31.880]  He was one focal point.
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:32.880]  We are succeeding.
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:39.400]  Look, White House memos, talk about how great a new Oklahoma City would be for them to
[1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:41.000]  blame their political opposition.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.960]  Now, when do you get violent?
[1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:50.160]  When someone is unjustly trying to hurt you, whoever they are, they're right back.
[1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:51.480]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.960 --> 1:29:57.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:01.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:07.560]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation, is in need of help due to the shattered
[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:08.560]  economy.
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:13.080]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:17.880]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious, easy

[1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:03.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:08.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  risk.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.240]  Saving means to make money.
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:14.880]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:20.000]  real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:25.800]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:27.440]  or antibacterials.
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:33.040]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:35.320]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:38.640]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:40.720]  to do something you've never done before.
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:47.760]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at five-star soap

[1:31:56.680 --> 1:32:01.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:05.600]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:07.240]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:11.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[1:32:11.280 --> 1:32:12.280]  or gold?
[1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:15.640]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:17.840]  possible that could even happen again.
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:22.360]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:23.360]  seeds.
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:28.040]  You can call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:30.160]  dense food for you and your family.
[1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:33.960]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:37.960]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:43.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:52.120]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:57.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:26.840]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:32.840]  Who are you, you blubber-less crubs?
[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:33.840]  Who are you?
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:43.800]  What if I say I'm not gonna surrender?
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:48.000]  What if I say you're the pretender?
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.280]  What if I say 1776?
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.280]  Is the answer to 1984?
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  You're the pretender, what if I say I will never surrender?
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:04.280]  What if I say I'm not gonna surrender?
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:08.280]  What if I say just another war in your place?
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:13.280]  You're the pretender, I am fired up.
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:16.280]  You know, that last caller was asking, when do we get violent?
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:19.280]  The first person to shoot loses.
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:26.280]  We're not looking for a fight, but I'll tell ya, my ideology, my worldview is not like Gandhi's.
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.280]  It's a mix of George Washington and Mahatma Gandhi.
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:35.080]  I understand the globalists want violence up front, and they want to characterize people
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:38.680]  who are against their tyranny as the criminals and as the disorder.
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:42.960]  The globalists are criminals, they are the disorder, hiding behind their three-piece
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:47.120]  suits and behind their stolen billions, and the military and police that they've tried
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:48.120]  to brainwash.
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:52.480]  The good news is the police and military are waking up, and you know 10 years ago I wasn't
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:53.480]  saying that.
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:56.760]  I can go over all the evidence, but I want to go to Gerald Salente.
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:03.640]  The point is 70-plus percent of all donations from the military are to Ron Paul.
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:06.920]  For both parties, all presidential candidates.
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:08.720]  Police are supporting Ron Paul.
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:13.120]  Bloomberg bemoaned it last month, saying, give this man your money so he can fire you
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:17.520]  and pointed out, guess who gets the majority of federal employee donations?
[1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:20.960]  Ron Paul, that tells you the folks inside the federal government know what's going
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:21.960]  on.
[1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.240]  They're sitting there watching what's happening.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:29.960]  They're just paymasters who pay the stolen money out to the mega corporations.
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:31.600]  They know, they know.
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.520]  In fact, it's easier to wake up military and police than anybody else because they actually
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:37.000]  live in the real world.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:38.680]  They're seeing what we're talking about.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.760]  I can't tell you how many letters I get, how many emails, how many calls, you've heard
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.040]  them, where police officers say nothing made sense, I've been on the force 20 years, 10
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.840]  years, whatever the case is, until I started listening and everything I'd always questioned
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:51.840]  didn't understand.
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:53.020]  Now it makes perfect sense.
[1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:55.520]  You took me outside the compartmentalization.
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:57.320]  You didn't show me how to see.
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:35:58.960]  You pointed out what was already there.
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:04.200]  You woke me up.
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:06.200]  When you wake somebody up, all you say, get up.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:07.200]  You're not doing the work.
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:08.200]  You're just get up.
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:09.200]  You're up.
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:10.200]  You're awake.
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  Now you see.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:12.200]  You see the same thing I see.
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.520]  You're not believing what Alex Jones is saying.
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:16.000]  You're not buying into what I'm saying.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:17.560]  You're seeing.
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:19.000]  You're seeing it.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  All right.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.240]  Gerald Salente is just a great friend of the show and we really appreciate him coming
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:33.200]  on right here near the end of the year to give us his 12 trends first here.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:37.440]  For our audience, you can get the full details at trendsresearch.com, where as trend alerts,
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:38.440]  everything else you're posted.
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:40.000]  But he's giving it to us here first.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.200]  I tried to get him on the last two weeks and he said, well, I'm traveling plus Alex,
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:46.640]  I'm writing the 12 trends, deep analysis.
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:49.520]  I'd love to come on, but I've got to come on once this is ready.
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:53.120]  So you're hearing it here first and he'll be with us, I guess, five minutes to the next
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:54.120]  hour and then he's got to go.
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:59.080]  But we're very honored to have Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com and I have here my hunt
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:01.440]  little hands, the top 12 trends of 2012.
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:07.040]  But Gerald, let me ask you the question this way today because I've read over these trends.
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:09.760]  Some of it is new.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.040]  Some of it is basically tweaked analysis that you've already gone over, but a lot of this
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.920]  is key groundbreaking material and we respect your analytical mind when it comes to this.
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:25.320]  But do you want to give us an MF global update first or get into the top trends first?
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:30.560]  And then I want to air this clip of the head of the CME Group confirming, so he's gone
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.880]  from criticizing you to now agreeing with you and saying Corzine did take the money
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.240]  and is lying.
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:46.600]  Well, the update is this, so far I've gotten, they've reinstated about 70% of the lost funds
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:49.320]  in my type of account.
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:55.320]  Having said that, it's only part of the story because what happened is when they closed
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:38:02.720]  out my positions, I remember I bought gold $1443 an ounce that I was going to pick up
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:09.320]  in December, when they took all the money out, they closed the positions down the day
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:11.640]  they went bankrupt.
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:22.400]  And remember I showed you the corrected statement, it was now $1765 an ounce, not $1443.
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:32.280]  So when they went bankrupt and my positions closed out in December, I had to sell them.
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:39.360]  And I didn't buy them according to them at $1443, I bought them at $1765, so I had to
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:41.480]  eat those losses.
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:44.200]  So now I have that problem on my hand.
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:47.360]  Now here's the best part of the deal.
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:51.640]  You know, I want whatever money I have, I want to get it back, right?
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:58.360]  So I call up the broker, remember, the way they got the name broker is that you're broker
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:02.800]  better than when you started, that's how they made the name up.
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:07.440]  So now I call them up, I say, listen, why a transfer of whatever money I have in there,
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:09.800]  get it into my bank, check it out.
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:15.680]  We can't do that, we're going to send you a check, that's what I mean, you can't
[1:39:15.680 --> 1:39:16.960]  why a transfer to me.
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:23.160]  I said, you guys never quit, you're really quick to take the money when I wire transfer
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:27.520]  it in, but you won't get it out.
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:35.520]  So they won't wire transfer the money, I haven't received it yet, and now you know that story.
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:39.760]  Now it takes time for the check to clear and on and on.
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:47.480]  Now in saying this, it's very important because as you well know, I went public with this
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:55.280]  to warn people that what you think you have in your account really isn't yours because
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:02.320]  they have all of these loopholes in place where your money is only as safe as the last
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:04.760]  loophole that they put in.
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:08.520]  And I don't care who it's with, it makes no difference.
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:13.480]  By the way, I tried to go to a local bank and follow my own advice and get out some cash
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:20.000]  and it wasn't even quote above the amount where they file a fence and deal, you know,
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.640]  and they acted like my wife was a crook, freaked out and then started calling me saying, when
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:30.000]  you know your wife's occupation, it's got to go in the federal financial crimes enforcement
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  file and I'm like, for less than $10,000, but even if it was $10,000, I mean, what
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.080]  on earth, I mean, this country is a giant prison, Gerald, everywhere, you're treated
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:49.200]  like trash and then all these little people, they get off on enforcing it on others.
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:50.200]  It's sick.
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:51.200]  It's like a nation of maggots.
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:53.240]  You know, you really hit on it.
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:58.640]  You know, as I've been saying, you know, your money isn't yours unless you have it.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:00.140]  End the story.
[1:41:00.140 --> 1:41:09.520]  Last Wednesday, I called up HSBC and I told them that I was coming in Thursday morning
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.040]  at 9.30 in the morning to make a withdrawal.
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:15.880]  I gave them the amount.
[1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:19.520]  They said they only could give it to me in hundreds and fifties if I wanted to wait until
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:21.320]  Monday, I could get it in hundreds.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:22.320]  I said, no, it's fine.
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:24.400]  I'll take it in hundred and fifties.
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.200]  I couldn't make it at 9.30.
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.640]  Had my assistant call them up, Mrs. Slenty will be in at 2.30.
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.420]  I go there with the check, hand it to the person I was talking to on the phone.
[1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:38.880]  It was like I never called.
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:44.000]  Now they tell me I have to go over, I have this video on our site.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.920]  I have to go over and talk to the bank manager.
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:50.440]  I go over there.
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:56.480]  I sit down, she looks at me and you talked about it, these power hungry little people.
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:02.920]  She said to me, this is a sizable amount of money.
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:06.160]  What are you going to use it for?
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:10.360]  So I said, how about none of your business?
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.680]  She said, that's not very friendly.
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:18.560]  I said, how about none of your effing business?
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:25.640]  How dare you ask me what I'm going to do with my money?
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:27.760]  She said, well, you have to comply.
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:33.400]  I said, you didn't ask me how I got the money in there, and now you're asking me what I'm
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:34.400]  going to do with it?
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.160]  They're saying you're a criminal, they imply you're a criminal.
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:39.400]  Exactly.
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:42.440]  This went on for 40 minutes.
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:47.480]  I'm talking to people all over the HSBC chain.
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:49.800]  First she tells me to leave the office.
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:52.080]  She has to talk to compliance officers.
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:57.600]  Yeah, that's like these people that get arrested now for trying to get their own money out.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:01.080]  Wait, are you saying you have a video where you break this down or there's video of this?
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:03.160]  No, I have a video where I break it down.
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:04.160]  I wish I did have a video.
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:05.160]  You want to go back in there?
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:07.480]  Oh my God, tell us what else happened, Gerald.
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:08.480]  Break this?
[1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:09.480]  Oh my gosh.
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:12.920]  Tell your name, there was Penny Demo.
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:18.760]  Try Demolition, and I told her, I said, you know, I'm going to make you famous.
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:24.720]  I'm going to tell everybody what a jerk you are and how dare you ask me what I do with
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:31.360]  my money, and now you're telling me you have to make a call to somebody and I can't be
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.320]  in the room as you talk about my money.
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:41.480]  I said, ah, this goes on and it goes on, and I'm demanding to talk to other people.
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:48.560]  I get some woman said, Mr. Salenti now, you should have called the bank up ahead of time.
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:50.440]  I said I called yesterday.
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:52.680]  My assistant called again today.
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:44:00.520]  She said, but we have to, we have to know what you are doing with your money.
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:09.440]  I said, listen, if she didn't tell you, I'll tell you, it's none of your damn business
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:12.320]  what I do with my money.
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.240]  Now listen, I know I could have said, I'm going to buy a car, I'm going to do this,
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  I'm going to do that.
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:20.200]  I said, screw this, I'm not telling him anything.
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.200]  She said to me, well, Uncle Sam wants to know.
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:31.680]  I said, listen, tell Uncle Sam to give me a call and we could talk about it.
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:32.680]  Let's stop right there.
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:34.680]  I did the same thing, but I didn't go in.
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:39.520]  I came in here Friday so angry that I was bouncing off the walls because they were calling
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:40.520]  me over and over again Thursday.
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:44.600]  I finally start talking to this local bank and the guys like, sir, we've got to fill
[1:44:44.600 --> 1:44:49.400]  out this report on you to the feds and I'm like, well, why is it in either business?
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:51.760]  He goes, sir, we're not spying on you.
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:53.240]  And I said, what do you mean you're not spying?
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:55.640]  You've got to fill a report out to me on the feds.
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:59.240]  He goes, well, new rules are coming in and blah, blah, blah, I said, I thought it was
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:00.320]  above this amount.
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:02.040]  This is below that amount.
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  We're sorry, sir.
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:04.040]  Don't be paranoid.
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:05.520]  We know about your radio show.
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:10.520]  Oh, so I'm the paranoid one that in America, this isn't even that much money.
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:12.720]  I mean, I might be able to buy a golf cart with it, maybe.
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:18.400]  I mean, not even a car that in America, I can't even get some cash out would be out without
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:20.120]  being treated like trash.
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:24.280]  And that's what this whole system is about with Patriot Act compliance is turning everybody
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:26.840]  into little agents, having them all spy.
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.000]  So then I start yelling at them, listen to the morning at home, my wife runs in, what's
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  wrong?
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  I say, you talk to him.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  She calls him back.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.120]  She starts yelling because they start telling her she's paranoid.
[1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:37.480]  Then I call him back.
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:38.480]  Then they're acting all weird.
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:39.680]  Then they wouldn't come to the phone.
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:43.640]  I said, I'm coming down there if you don't get on the phone.
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:48.200]  So then, oh, the guy that was at lunch at 1030 in the morning, he's now there and comes
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:49.480]  and gets on the phone.
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:55.280]  And again, again, you're absolutely right, Gerald, they, I've got you here as a guest
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:56.280]  I'm ranting.
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:45:57.280]  Let's continue.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:45:59.000]  So did you ever even get your money?
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.920]  Yeah, I got my money.
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:05.640]  But what I'm telling you, and this is why I kept going public with what's going on.
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:07.360]  They don't have the money.
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:13.320]  Yeah, they have the money, but they need your money so they could keep gambling.
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:15.160]  Doesn't anybody get it?
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:21.480]  That's why, that's why the CME group, although that Big Mouth Clarence Terry is saying that
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:27.360]  or the Terence Duffy is saying that they have a hundred billion dollars.
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:32.200]  They couldn't come up with 1.2 billion to cover the bad bets.
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:38.480]  That's like all of Las Vegas closing down because one casino can't cover the bets.
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:40.880]  They don't have the money.
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:47.560]  This whole thing is financially leveraged beyond what Ponzi could have ever imagined.
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:54.520]  So what they're doing is they're trying to make it as impossible as it can be for you
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:47:00.640]  to get your hands on your money because they need it to gamble.
[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:07.320]  So what I'm telling everybody is if you don't have your money in your pocket, you don't own
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:08.320]  it.
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:09.320]  Period paragraph.
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:15.080]  And as I said, the first trend, and I broke it on your station, before anybody else I
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:19.400]  told you, watch out for economic martial law.
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:20.400]  It's coming.
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:23.760]  Well, that is trend number one, and I thought we only had you for 30.
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:24.760]  You've been gracious enough.
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:27.840]  Jared told me in my ear you said you're staying a little bit into the next hour, so that's
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:28.840]  good news.
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:29.840]  And I want to go over these.
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:34.120]  But in closing to the guy, I said, I'm not going to tell you what my wife does here at
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  my company.
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.440]  So this is a private checking account, this is after tax money.
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:43.240]  This is how we pay for our gas, our food, everything.
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:45.960]  This is how we pay for babysitters.
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:48.120]  I said, you understand this is a private checking account.
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:51.680]  And he said, I still need to know this, I need to know that, and we have to tell the
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:53.760]  feds what you're doing with the money.
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:58.360]  And I said to the guy, I said to him, I said, you tell him then I'm not a criminal like
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:02.680]  them who caught laundering trillions of dollars of drug money in the last decade.
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:08.960]  I'm not like Wells Fargo caught laundering $376 billion, Source Bloomberg AP.
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:12.800]  I said, I'm not like the big banks that run this country and have stolen trillions of
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:13.800]  dollars.
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:18.240]  I said, you realize I'm in a little local bank because the big mega banks are the ones
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:21.000]  that run the country and run the Ponzi scheme.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.520]  And the guy finally said, yes, I understand, I apologize for implying that we're not spying
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:27.520]  on you.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:30.920]  And I said, what you're saying is the feds are telling you to spy and he goes, yes.
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:32.600]  And I said, that's fine.
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:36.280]  But now I don't even, I mean, I've got to have some money in there to like pay for
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:37.560]  some things with checks.
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.640]  I've got to have a business account to pay my employees, but I mean, you're right, Gerald.
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:46.480]  I mean, you just, I guess I built a giant vault in here or something with armed guards
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:49.360]  and pay people myself like the old West or something.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:54.040]  I mean, you just cannot trust these people and they treat you like a piece of garbage.
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:59.640]  And again, they don't ask you where you got the money when you put it into the account.
[1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:06.240]  Well, boy, they don't, this is my money and they won't give it to me.
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:13.800]  Oh, by the way, I wrote about this before when I used to deal with key bank.
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:17.240]  It was the same bunch of crap.
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:22.880]  And I brought one of my colleagues with me when it started getting really ugly.
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:27.160]  So I would have proof they don't have the money.
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:32.000]  They don't want to give it to you and I'm warning everybody, do what you want to do.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.600]  I could care less.
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:38.880]  All I'm saying is they're going to screw you.
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:43.480]  And these are, and you, you keep using the word globally on and on.
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:46.920]  Let's make it really clear during this Christmas time.
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:52.960]  The only time that Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace became violent is when he picked
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:58.480]  up a whip to drive the money changes out of the temple.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:05.880]  If Jesus Christ become violent, I could become angry when the money changes are giving it
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:06.880]  to me.
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:07.880]  I agree.
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:16.280]  And the money changers now are in charge of every temple in Athens, in Rome, in Washington.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:23.560]  It's the bankers, the criminals that Christ violently beat out of the temple that are
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:31.120]  ripping this nation and the world apart because their money junkies, their addicts, they can't
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:32.120]  get enough.
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:36.160]  We're about to go to break, but in 20 seconds, how long did it take for you to get your money?
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:37.800]  You had to go get witnesses.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:41.920]  40 minutes, 40 minutes it took me to get my money.
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:48.400]  And you know, they put about, I'd find out what they put in that report to, to, to Papa
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:49.400]  Fed.
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.400]  I tell you, we've got to fill out a report to give it to the criminals that grow the
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:56.520]  opium in Afghanistan known as the U.S. government.
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:59.200]  Gerald Salentes, our guest, we'll get into his top trends straight ahead.
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:00.600]  He's with us into the next hour.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  Then your calls.

[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:08.840]  collapse.

[1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:37.760]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:34.440]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers and investment advisors won't talk about
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:35.440]  gold IRAs?
[1:53:35.440 --> 1:53:39.840]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:41.520]  of gold for your retirement.
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:45.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.960]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

[1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:04.880]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:07.880]  All right, we've only got zero and 15 to the next hour then I'll finish up with the
[1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:08.880]  callers that are holding.
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:13.320]  Then I'm going to get into Iran and boy, they are really trying to prod Iran into action.
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:16.160]  Iran's doing a bunch of drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
[1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:20.480]  I've got Ron Paul news and a bunch of other economic news.
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:21.720]  You're also lent us our guests.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:28.760]  You can subscribe and get the new 2012 journal that's just coming out at trendsresearch.com.

[1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:37.880]  We've got a noble lie, Oklahoma City exposing that false flag event like no other films
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:39.380]  ever done.
[1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:42.160]  Scientists under attack, genetic engineering and the magnetic field of money where they
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:43.560]  persecute these scientists.
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:47.760]  Very powerful and outside the law stories from Guantanamo.
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:51.040]  By the way, has Obama signed NDA yet?
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:55.320]  Guys Google Obama NDA, he's supposed to sign it today or tomorrow, he says he's going to
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:56.320]  sign it.
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:01.040]  We're going to get more trends from Gerald here in a moment and it is your purchase of
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  the books and videos at infowars.com that funds much of this growing media operation
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.720]  in the face of the globalist, in the face of the money junkies, the criminals, the money
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:14.440]  changing cartel, the Ponzi operators.
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:17.160]  But don't forget we also have the everything special.
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:24.320]  You can get all 18 of my films for 70 plus percent off, 99.95 instead of 360 bucks at
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:25.480]  infowars.com.
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:28.920]  That special is going until the end of the year and I want to thank all of you for your
[1:55:28.920 --> 1:55:29.920]  support.
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:33.080]  Okay, going back to Gerald, we only got about five minutes in this little segment and the
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:34.880]  next hour starts.
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:39.120]  Let's start getting into more of your economic trends, Gerald.
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:43.400]  Economic martial law, they're even calling it that now, months and months after you first
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:47.760]  started using that about a year ago, they're calling it that in multiple states now.
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:53.400]  Yes, and when you have to really look at what's going on over in Europe, Hungary is a real
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:55.600]  close one to watch.
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:01.080]  They're in real financial trouble, they can't even meet the IMF, the International Mafia
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:04.360]  Federation's demands to get more money.
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:11.520]  So their liberty is gone, freedom of the speech, they're taking over, this new government is
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:13.520]  taking over the government.
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:19.840]  So that's a model to watch because all throughout Europe what they're doing as the economic
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:25.320]  systems collapse, they're throwing more and more actual martial law on top of the
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:27.560]  people to keep them in control.
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:33.600]  When this system finally implodes and we believe it's going to happen, in Europe, the first
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:38.840]  quarter of 2012, they're going to call bank holidays.
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:46.760]  There's a videotape that anybody could Google it up, we sent it to you, of Joe Biden talking
[1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:56.200]  to Corzine when Corzine was running for re-election of Governor, 2009, June, and I said that when
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:08.800]  Obama got elected, the economy was so bad that they might call a bank holiday.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.200]  Your Skype cut out for a moment, repeat that, Gerald.
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:17.080]  Gerald, you're back, go ahead.
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  Hello.
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:21.640]  Yeah, you cut out for a moment, repeat that, you said that they were talking about declaring
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:22.920]  a bank holiday.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:32.480]  That's right, this is June 2009, Biden's words are, as soon as we got sworn in, the
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:39.080]  first thing at the top of our list, we had the transition team there and 30 economists,
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:46.000]  whether or not to call a bank holiday, this is no holiday, folks, you can't get your money,
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:50.720]  you think it's bad trying to get it now, you can't get any of it, and when you do get it,
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:56.520]  they'll do like they did the last time they call a bank holiday, they'll devalue the currency.
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:01.120]  So that's what I'm warning, they've already said they were going to do it, now remember
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:11.640]  Alex, that happened before there was a European crisis, that happened before the United States
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:20.360]  was $15 trillion in debt, that happened before the Federal Reserve, when you added all up,
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:26.400]  pumped in $26 trillion into the Ponzi scheme to keep it afloat.
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:30.080]  We have that clip, I know Kurt Nemo wrote an article about it, we can remember that
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:37.520]  headline, we'll dig that up, we also have the head of the CMT coming out, or CME coming
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:41.440]  out and talking about course, I'll stay there.
[1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:51.800]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:56.080]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:59:00.680]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:04.520]  of the Silver Lungs system, and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:07.200]  anywhere in or on the body.
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:11.960]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:16.560]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:21.200]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:24.720]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[1:59:24.720 --> 1:59:31.520]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:32.520]  system.
[1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:39.880]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:43.000]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:53.800]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:59:53.800 --> 2:00:05.600]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:10.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:23.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:28.240]  I'm up-trend forecaster Gerald Salente as our guest for this segment, part of the next.
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:32.120]  In the next segment, I'm going to play the clip of the head of the Chicago Merc until
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:38.600]  exchange, a month after denying Corazon and runoff of the money, changing his testimony,
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:41.640]  and saying he did know where it went and ordered it.
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:44.720]  And then we're going to play the clip that Gerald was just mentioning, but we're queuing
[2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:49.880]  it up right now to write when Biden says that they were talking about a bank holiday with
[2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:52.280]  their advisor, Corazon.
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:54.080]  But we're going to come back to that in a moment.
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:58.080]  Let's hurry through some of the other top 12 trends, then we'll revisit those clips at
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:00:59.640]  the end of the interview.
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:03.720]  Battlefield America, Gerald.
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:04.720]  Economic martial law.
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:10.920]  They've taken our rights away from us with the National Defense Authorization Act.
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:15.160]  Everyone that's read it knows it or read the information coming out about it.
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:21.520]  So my belief is that this system is breaking down, and they're ready now to make sure
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:23.680]  that we don't get out of line.
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:27.560]  So Battlefield America, here we are.
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:34.760]  That's what Lindsay, that cracker from North Carolina, South Carolina, calls America,
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:36.660]  and that's what they're making it.
[2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:41.760]  So the battlefield is lining up so that they can instill martial law.
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:48.080]  And also, very important, Alex, is that these people are not as stupid as we think they
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:49.080]  are.
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:54.480]  They know what's going on, and they're just playing a con game to keep us con as they
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:02:00.680]  keep moving forward to rip us off more and more and subject us deeper and deeper into
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:05.040]  their psychopathic sickness.
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:08.280]  By the way, it got no attention.
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:12.400]  Obama signed it Friday, and I did Google searches and couldn't find it.
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:14.560]  The guys just found it Politico.
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:21.080]  It was a minor footnote in an article on Politico with no headline associated with it that
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:22.560]  Obama signed it.
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:26.760]  So they even signed it and didn't want the public to know.
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:28.480]  Yeah, I didn't know.
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:30.360]  I didn't know he signed it either.
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:33.760]  Yeah, I've got the signing statement right here.
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.400]  And this never made the major news.
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:47.840]  It was buried on page 831 in the bottom corner of the toilet paper of record, the New York
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:55.160]  Times, with a bland headline that mentioned nothing about what this law did.
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:00.480]  Wow, but they know they're going to end up devaluing the money and stealing it.
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:02.880]  And I guess they think the military's going to protect them?
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:06.200]  What's going to happen when the military's checks don't cash?
[2:03:06.200 --> 2:03:11.400]  Well, you know, the military, though, whatever happens in this country, it's happening like
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:14.400]  they happen in other Third World countries.
[2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:20.320]  The military and the police become the enforcers for the criminal crime bosses.
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:27.720]  They're still enough to pay them because they'll get every nickel out of us.
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:31.080]  Let's continue into your third trend.
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.840]  Let's get into invasion of the Occupy.
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:37.240]  Yes, this is really huge.
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:44.720]  What's happened with the octopi, as we call it, an octopi, a tentacle creature that's reaching
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:46.880]  out all over the world.
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:53.240]  Its strength is that it doesn't have a head to cut off like a Julian Assange.
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:55.960]  WikiLeaks was putting out valuable information.
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:03:59.640]  But when they cut the head off, the information died.
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:07.840]  This octopi is a symptom of the war that's going on worldwide, as I've said before.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.760]  When the money stops flowing down to the man on the street, the blood starts flowing in
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:13.760]  the streets.
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:22.720]  These octopis are in 80 countries, in 1,200 different cities, they're going to continue.
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:28.760]  And when you cut off one tentacle, another one grows and the old one regenerates.
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:34.920]  This is the beginning of that movement, Alex, that may change things in another direction.
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:40.000]  Okay, let's race through the other seven or eight points.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:49.600]  Climax time, technocrat takeover, repatriate, succession of session, safe havens, Big Brother
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:56.480]  Internet, Direct versus Fox Democracy, Alternative Energy 2012.
[2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:57.480]  Stay with us.
[2:04:57.480 --> 2:04:59.600]  This is the final segment with Gerald Salente.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:02.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:07.680]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation, is in need of help due to the shattered

[2:06:07.920 --> 2:06:12.440]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:21.680]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:06:21.680 --> 2:06:30.040]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:34.840]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[2:06:34.840 --> 2:06:39.840]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:46.640]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:51.200]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can

[2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:59.600]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.600]  You may be arrested and your subject is to other police action.
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:05.600]  Terany is here.
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:09.760]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:12.160]  It really says that the state is God.
[2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:16.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:17.960]  on earth.
[2:07:17.960 --> 2:07:22.760]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:24.600]  expanded nationwide.
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:29.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[2:07:29.280 --> 2:07:30.640]  shadow state.
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:34.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:41.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.520]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:50.560]  The police state isn't coming.
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:51.560]  It's here.

[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:06.760]  I mean, literally, one of the early discussions we had in Chicago in preparation for the administration
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:12.880]  of our transition team out there, we got together, I think it was 30, 35 economists, all left
[2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:15.960]  right center, and what do we talk about?
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:19.200]  The first question they wanted to raise with us is whether we might have to call a bank
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:25.560]  holiday, a bank holiday on the day after we were sworn in.
[2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:30.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the president and I weren't back there blaming John Corzine then
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:31.880]  I know we were doing it.
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:36.080]  We were on the phone calling John Corzine, literally.
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:41.960]  I literally picked up the phone and called John Corzine and said, John, what do you think
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:48.960]  we should do?
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:56.520]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:58.520]  You want answers?
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.520]  Well, so does he.
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:12.560]  All right, it's our final segment with Gerald Salente and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:15.440]  I have the signing statement buried.
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:16.600]  I couldn't find it.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:17.600]  The guys found it.
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.080]  I mean, no one that I knew talked about the fact that Obama signed this last Friday.
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:24.720]  I guess going into a Christmas weekend, nobody noticed.
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:28.520]  Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com is with us going over his top 12 trends and he says
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:33.640]  you'll come back for a full hour before the year ends or early next week to really break
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:34.640]  these down.
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:35.800]  But he mentioned that clip.
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:40.640]  Yeah, there's Corzine, the former head of MF Global, the former head of Goldman Sachs,
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:42.520]  the global kingpins.
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:45.360]  And I don't blame Goldman Sachs for what happened.
[2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:47.880]  I called them and asked them how to fix it.
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:49.920]  Yeah, they really know how to fix things.
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  Don't they, Gerald?
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:52.120]  Oh, yeah, they're great at it.
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:55.800]  And remember that clip, Alex, that was great that you played it.
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:56.800]  Think of what that means.
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:09:58.300]  A bank holiday?
[2:09:58.300 --> 2:09:59.760]  This is no holiday.
[2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:01.600]  You want to hear an Orwellian word?
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:02.600]  That's one.
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:08.440]  Do you realize what this country will look like with people not being able to go to work,
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:13.320]  with the banks closed, with mayhem and bedlam?
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:17.440]  All hell will break loose and then they'll get to use the military they've got.
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:19.120]  You got it.
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:22.040]  That's why they pushed us through.
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:29.840]  So they'll have all the people in place to crush any rebellion or outrage when, could
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:32.320]  you imagine, who did we call?
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:39.840]  John, I can't find $1.2 billion Corzine to help us fix this thing.
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:42.960]  Who could get away with this crap?
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:47.880]  Now let's talk about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:54.440]  Their head a month and a half ago criticized you, but since then he's come out, Mr. Duffy,
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:11:01.040]  before Congress, at the same hearing as Corzine, and said that, hey, what you were told by
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:02.680]  him is not true.
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:07.480]  Our people were talking to him and at the meetings, he knows where the money went.
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:12.120]  Everybody I know in the business, and I know guys that had firms, I know guys whose names
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:22.200]  I can't mention, top guys laugh when they heard Corzine repeat the alibi that his mouthpieces
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:25.960]  fed him to the Senate at the last hearing.
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:29.600]  And here's what I like the best about the whole charade.
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:32.440]  You see the plaque in front of his name?
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.040]  The honorable John Corzine.
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:39.880]  The honorable John Corzine.
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:41.240]  This is what's going on.
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:43.800]  It's just the front.
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:45.960]  Corzine doesn't do any time.
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:48.680]  The feds aren't busting down his door.
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:50.640]  I can't get my money.
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:52.040]  You can't get your money.
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:53.400]  That's our money.
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:59.440]  But Corzine can't find $1.2 billion and the cat's honorable.
[2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:02.520]  So no, Alex, the whole thing is collapsing.
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:05.120]  That tape that you played proves it.
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:07.260]  A bank holiday.
[2:12:07.260 --> 2:12:08.260]  That should be headline news.
[2:12:08.260 --> 2:12:12.000]  And by the way, Ron Paul gets criticized for saying something like that's coming.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:13.120]  He's on the banking committee.
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:14.480]  He knows it's being discussed.
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:17.320]  You've got to leave in a minute, but you've agreed to come on later in the week to go
[2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:19.840]  over the rest of your 12 points.
[2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:26.040]  But briefly, I want to play Terrence Duffy two weeks ago, proving that Corzine's lying
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  and Corzine has still not gotten in any trouble, and his former deputy was over the federal
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:34.000]  agency that allowed this and has disappeared.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:38.160]  But the media doesn't care about that because they're bought and paid for, they're whores
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:39.600]  bought and paid for by these people.
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:41.000]  They're not media.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  Here's the clip.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:48.160]  After receiving this information, CME remained at MF Global while MF Global attempted to
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:55.360]  identify funds that could be transferred into segregation to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy.
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:02.200]  A CME auditor also participated in a phone call with senior MF Global employees wherein
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:08.560]  one employee indicated that Mr. Corzine knew about the loans that had made for the customer
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:11.480]  segregated from the customer segregated accounts.
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:17.240]  CME Group has provided this information into these individuals to the Department of Justice
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:20.720]  and the CFTC who are investigating these matters.
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:24.680]  All right, so understand something, folks.
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:28.440]  That's the whole mercantile exchange above this who had their people in there.
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:33.680]  Now, obviously, if Gerald Salente's pulling out, you know, $15,000, whatever it was, they're
[2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:38.080]  freaking out of, I'm pulling out $5,000, they're freaking out, oh, but they don't know where
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:39.080]  billions went.
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:40.080]  Yeah, they do.
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:41.080]  It went to Goldman Sachs.
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  It went to J.P. Morgan.
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.080]  It's on record.
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:47.680]  So, in closing, there it is, Gerald, and he's not gotten in trouble.
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:51.560]  So if he doesn't get in trouble, it sets the precedent they can do anything.
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  They have done anything.
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:57.280]  You haven't seen one head roll on Wall Street with this whole financial crisis.
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:13:59.560]  What a joke, the Justice Department.
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:06.480]  You know it's just us, little people, not them, and the CFTC, you pointed it out.
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:09.120]  Who's the head of the CFTC?
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:10.800]  Gary Gensler.
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:12.600]  Who's Gary Gensler?
[2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:19.000]  Gary Gensler was John Corzine's lieutenant when John the Don Corzine was the head of
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Goldman Sachs.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:23.760]  I mean, only an imbecile can't put this together.
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:27.880]  Wow, Gerald, we don't have time.
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:32.640]  You've got to go in about a minute to go through the other six or seven trends.
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:36.680]  But just in 60 seconds, what's one of the other really important ones that we're going
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:38.840]  to cover later in the week when you join us?
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:41.520]  Oh, climax time.
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:44.840]  Everybody's going to wake up this year, and there's going to be two things that are going
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:45.840]  on.
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:47.440]  Number one, there is no recovery.
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:50.960]  There never was a recovery, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:56.200]  Number two, they're going to start getting the message that the first great war of the
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:14:59.520]  21st century has begun.
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:05.000]  So we're going to start seeing all these geopolitical and financial problems that have been building
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.480]  up come to a conclusion.
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:09.680]  So strap yourself in.
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:13.960]  Well, we'll talk to your crew and find out a good day for you to come on.
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:17.360]  Will a pencil in someday this week, Gerald, to come on and go through the rest of it and
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:18.360]  take calls?
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:19.360]  I'd love to.
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:20.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:23.200]  There goes Gerald Salente, my friends.
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:25.360]  And yes, strap yourselves in.
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.800]  We've had callers holding since I got Gerald on.
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:33.920]  And so we're going to go to Tom and then others that are patiently holding here in just a
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:34.920]  moment.
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:39.920]  And then I'm getting into the latest Iran, and it's a big stack, probably 15 articles
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:42.240]  I'm going to scan over.
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.120]  We've got incredible tyranny in China that our criminal government won't criticize.
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:53.240]  We've got TSA screeners aren't just for airports anymore, shopping malls, highways, everywhere.
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:54.240]  They're coming.
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:55.480]  They're coming for your wife and children.
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:56.880]  They know they can grab the genitals.
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:15:58.000]  They can do anything.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.120]  It's an act of total domination, like a big dog, hiking its leg and urinating on a little
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:03.120]  dog.
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:04.120]  This is pure pimp time.
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:07.160]  They're going to break you and let you know you're their slave.
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:08.960]  You're their crack whore now.
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:10.720]  The government is here to dominate.
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:15.280]  This is called slavery and the main reason I've been told by insiders for TSA is to
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:17.080]  get you ready for forced inoculations.
[2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:18.640]  It's about the hands go on.
[2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:19.720]  We've confirmed with documents.
[2:16:19.720 --> 2:16:20.720]  They've trained the preachers.
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:24.320]  When the time comes to say it's of the Lord, take the shot, turn your guns in.
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:28.640]  They're not training preachers, tens of thousands, well it's hundreds of thousands now nationwide
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:32.360]  and putting them on secret FEMA payroll because they want to play tiddlywinks.
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:37.160]  This is super creepy, super premeditated, super evil.
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:41.280]  And if you don't get super angry and super involved, they're going to get away with it.
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:45.320]  This is the total takedown of America from the inside by the megabanks.
[2:16:45.320 --> 2:16:46.320]  Total criminal grips.
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:49.400]  I mean, have them help us.
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:52.880]  This next year is going to be bonker land.
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:54.800]  Let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:55.800]  You're on the air.
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:16:56.800]  Thanks for holding Tom.
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:16:57.800]  Hey, Alex.
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:16:58.800]  Welcome.
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:03.720]  Hey, last Monday a friend of mine called me and he was working, he's from Pennsylvania
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:07.120]  as well, but he was working up in Rochester, New York.
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:12.880]  And one of the other contractors he was working with told him that over that weekend, he was
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:16.360]  together with his father over some kind of family get together.
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:20.280]  And his father is a prison guard at one of the local prisons there.
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:25.840]  And his father told him that they had gotten a memo and then were asked for a sit-down
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:26.840]  meeting.
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:34.920]  And they suggested that all the prison guards, let me see here.
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:43.640]  Apply for work at the FEMA camp because they're anticipating within the next six to eight months
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:48.240]  that the prisons would have to close due to funding.
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:54.200]  And then they also suggested that they store two months worth of food and water.
[2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:55.200]  Yeah.
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:56.200]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[2:17:56.200 --> 2:17:59.800]  I've actually seen blurbs where they do tell federal and state employees and private
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:01.200]  groups to dig in.
[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:04.440]  I know police departments for about five years have been digging in.
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:07.520]  For war with the American people, not to fight guys with turbans on.
[2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:12.520]  That's a total, total smokescreen always has been the memos prove that.
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:15.440]  But I'd like you to get your friend on the show or to send us that memo.
[2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:19.720]  In fact, if anybody's got memos like that, send them to showtips at infowars.com if you
[2:18:19.720 --> 2:18:23.560]  don't hear on the show a day later, send it five times until we get it because it's such
[2:18:23.560 --> 2:18:26.680]  a limited crew and funding to have folks digging through it all.
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:32.720]  We do get a lot of hot tips, obviously break a lot of news that way, but specifically though,
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:33.720]  that's how they always work.
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.640]  They build prisons for non-violence, but also violence.
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:41.600]  Then when things implode, they pack the prisons with political dissidents.
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:45.720]  And a lot of police departments have said, by guns, we're not going to be able to protect
[2:18:45.720 --> 2:18:46.720]  you.
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:49.240]  We've been ordered to just revenue generate.
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:51.360]  And it's just a total criminal government.
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:56.600]  I mean, I can keep saying that over and over again, but words don't describe it.
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:18:59.000]  Was the person you were talking to concerned about this?
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.480]  Yeah, well, the person I was talking to, he's aware.
[2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:09.200]  He's been listening and he turned me on to you, but he was just surprised that somebody
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:11.080]  else just came up to him out of the blue.
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:14.160]  I don't think he'd ever had any kind of discussion like this with him before.
[2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:18.600]  Well, by the way, they are running around hiring state, federal and private prison guards,
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:20.480]  well, private for state and federal.
[2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:23.840]  That's who they put in the 36 camps in Iraq.
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:27.840]  And they would actually go find guys who had been kicked out for rape or abuse and hire
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:31.600]  them for Abu Ghraib where they rape children in front of their parents.
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:33.720]  I mean, remember, that's what America signed on to.
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:37.280]  I mean, this is, you think Jack Bauer is cool because he tortures the bad guy?
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:41.760]  That's fantasy folks to get you to accept torture as cool.
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:43.240]  So get us that document.
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:44.680]  I want that document, Tom.
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:47.120]  Good job calling in with that information.
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:48.120]  Anything else?
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:52.600]  Well, one thing I was thinking would be a good idea if you had some kind of suggesting
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  a reading list.
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:56.720]  Because a lot of times I've heard you refer to books that you've read or...
[2:19:56.720 --> 2:19:57.720]  We need to do that.
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:19:58.720]  That's a great point.
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:04.520]  We're all straight ahead than the big news, stay with us.
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:07.960]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:09.600]  like no one is home.
[2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:11.440]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[2:20:11.440 --> 2:20:15.000]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:19.400]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:22.480]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:26.960]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:31.680]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous
[2:20:31.680 --> 2:20:32.960]  police departments.
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:34.720]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:42.680]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com, or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:47.360]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one,
[2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:50.400]  for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:56.200]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-T-V, or go to faketv.com.
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:00.760]  The burglar deterrent.
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:07.120]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough, an easy natural organic way to bring relief to diabetics.

[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:12.680]  are looking for relief.

[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:42.440]  With MDS Forte, there are none.

[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:05.360]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:06.360]  Everyone can feel it.
[2:22:06.360 --> 2:22:12.000]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.120]  who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:19.880]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart.
[2:22:19.880 --> 2:22:23.600]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:29.000]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.840]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:35.880]  The globalists are scared, they've overreached.
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:39.320]  The future of the Info War is in your hands.
[2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:45.880]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv, download the thousands of special video reports, e-books, and more,
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:47.920]  and get them out to everyone you know.
[2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:52.680]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:54.360]  globalist propaganda platform.
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:57.040]  We are going to use their system against them.
[2:22:57.040 --> 2:23:00.280]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:04.920]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima,
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:09.920]  Japan, and making its way across the entire U.S. continent, contaminating the air, water,
[2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  and food?
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:13.640]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[2:23:13.640 --> 2:23:18.320]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:20.560]  unless you do something to protect yourself.
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:21.560]  How?
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:24.640]  With Liquid Zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:28.440]  Without a doubt, Liquid Zeolite is by far the best product to remove radiation from
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:29.440]  your body.

[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:17.120]  It's time for me to fire the Batman spotlight into the sky and ask Paul Watson to look into
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:18.120]  this.
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:25.400]  Obama has not signed the N-D-A-A. I think this political thing is a typo because it's
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:30.280]  talking about a Defense Authorization Act, but it's a separate one and some supplemental
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:31.280]  to an older one.
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:33.120]  There's so much defense spending.
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:41.720]  It's got language about detainees and same subsections, and I wonder people were confused
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:42.720]  by this.
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:43.720]  I'll tell you, this is getting crazy.
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:48.560]  I'm going to dig into this because if he hasn't signed it, what's going on?
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:51.400]  I'm going to have to look into this a lot closer.
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:52.400]  Very bizarre.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:57.720]  Let's continue with your calls, and then I'm going to play Wesley Clark on C-SPAN,
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:05.040]  former head general at NATO, former U.S. general, admitting there was a plan to attack seven
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:06.040]  countries.
[2:25:06.040 --> 2:25:11.120]  They're following that plan now, and Iran is next up as well as Syria.
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:12.840]  Let's talk to Bill in Connecticut.
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:14.360]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:16.400]  Hi, Alex.
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:17.400]  Hi.
[2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:26.000]  Briefly, you were talking about why Obama didn't sign the bill yet, and I remember listening
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:34.640]  to a Lindsay Williams YouTube saying that the globalists aren't very happy with Obama
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:40.240]  because he's been resisting them, but he has to play along to a certain degree in order
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:45.040]  to keep his job, if you will, and other things.
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:47.720]  What may be playing into this whole thing?
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:49.640]  Well, I know this.
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:55.880]  I mean, he certainly said a lot of things like end war, stop torture, whenever he was
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:26:00.520]  running that he went back on, but his advisors are top New World Order, and I'm not saying
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:04.880]  Lindsay's wrong, but I know who his big oil company source is.
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:08.640]  There are splits within the power structure itself.
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:10.760]  Okay.
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.080]  I'm just, I put that out there because that was the last thing I heard on the radio.
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:16.480]  No, no, I think that might be it.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:18.000]  I mean, I mean, who knows?
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:19.520]  Why hasn't he signed it yet?
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:21.000]  Sorry, go ahead, Bill.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.140]  Yeah, well, that's what I'm thinking.
[2:26:23.140 --> 2:26:28.960]  Just going back, that there may be some problems with Obama not playing along with these guys,
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:36.120]  but the main point was, I often hear you say that resistance is victory, and to a degree
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:41.960]  I agree with that, but I think that's only one step in a procession of other steps.
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:46.600]  If we resist the right thing in the right way, I'm just trying to get folks moving
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:52.040]  out of their trance, and once you get on the field, you'll get a better understanding.
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:57.760]  Well, I was listening to, you had Bruce Fein on it.
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:04.680]  He was thinking along the same lines that I was thinking of that we need to subpoena
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:12.440]  these people and prosecute them, and he was even talking about impeaching the congressmen
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:19.400]  that are not holding their oath to the Constitution, which is virtually all of them at this point.
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:25.800]  So what I was thinking, if you could get Ron Paul or Rand Paul to form a subcommittee and
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:32.920]  bring people before the subcommittee like Lindsey Williams, and then subsequent to his testimony
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:41.360]  bringing the oil bigwigs, you could start with them because they're obviously intrinsically
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:42.360]  involved.
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:43.360]  Oh, you're right.
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:45.560]  Imagine a House Committee on Un-American Activities.
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:50.800]  You could haul in all the globalists who are openly have quotes and written books saying,
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:56.960]  get rid of sovereignty, get rid of our industry, Maury Strong, all of them.
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  You could haul in there, George Soros, all of them.
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:00.960]  Here's the issue.
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:03.600]  The power is starting to approach that level.
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:08.000]  We first got to wake people up to realize Obama and people are puppets and look at the
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.960]  banksters themselves, and we're in that process now.
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:16.680]  That's why they're trying to finish their end game and launch their wars and clamp down
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:19.800]  because they know we're close to getting our country back.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:22.600]  That's why they've gone into this mode, but you're right.
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:26.760]  Talking about how they're criminals, talking about how they're gangsters, pulling down
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:30.560]  this aura of the wise men in suits that care about us.
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:36.600]  No, these are organized crime scum, and where are the grand juries, federal and state?
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:37.600]  Where are the people?
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:40.640]  I mean, here's course on committing crimes publicly.
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:45.080]  So I hammer it every day, highest level of the administration advisor.
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:52.080]  Here is the Attorney General caught shipping drugs in, shipping guns out.
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:56.880]  In federal court, caught, even in the New York Times now, eight agencies under him,
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:00.920]  all involved, of course, shepherding the 500 billion in drugs a year.
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:02.160]  That's then laundered by big banks.
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:07.480]  We have the entire chain, every angle, the money, the drugs, the weapons to secure them.
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:15.400]  All there, guns into Honduras, guns into Nicaragua, guns into Illinois, Indiana, Florida, Texas,
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:18.240]  using it to then shut down the Second Amendment, false flag.
[2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:20.960]  We have them, but we've got to get the word out.
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:26.480]  I mean, if everybody went to city council on TV and just talked about it, where's our
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:31.560]  city putting on a resolution against this, where's our, it's all about the buzz.
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:33.560]  It's a committee of correspondence.
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:41.600]  We've like 15 years before 1776, we've got to educate people that the bad men run the
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:47.200]  country and you can't just remove a politician, put a new one in, those are puppets.
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:50.480]  You've got to discredit the whole system to get America back.
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:57.960]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:03.640]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:08.400]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:09.400]  risk.
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:10.600]  Saving means to make money.
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:15.240]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[2:30:15.240 --> 2:30:20.360]  real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:27.800]  or antibacterials.
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:33.440]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:35.720]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:39.040]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had

[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:05.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:09.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:14.080]  Number two, our new energies are once to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:15.080]  you to have.
[2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:20.760]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:25.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:32:29.080 --> 2:32:32.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:32:32.560 --> 2:32:36.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:32:44.800 --> 2:32:46.200]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:50.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:33:11.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:22.600]  The tyranny, if I had to give it a layman's simple definition, is government, high criminals,
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:25.480]  or criminals against the general population.
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:30.480]  And that's what we face and it's happened over and over and over again in history.
[2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:38.520]  You know, I had a trailer a year or two ago for Fall of the Republic and in the trailer
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:44.360]  I talk about hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century.
[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:49.320]  And that video trailer I saw one of the talking points was like, look at him, he says hundreds
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:53.400]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century.
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:55.400]  There's not even hundreds.
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:34:04.120]  Now, there's about 185 countries, subdivisions within them, there's a total about 300 or
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:15.400]  more major ethnic enclaves or sub-states on top of the 185 or sub-nations, plus or minus
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:22.080]  a few depending on how you slice it.
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:23.840]  And I should revise it.
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:26.920]  In a century, there's been thousands.
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:30.920]  I mean, some Latin American countries and African and Asian countries might have two,
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:37.440]  three, four governments in a year, different forms of tyranny and they tend to fall deeper
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:44.800]  and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper as the corrupt just wear out society.
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:49.840]  See an average person thinks, well, why would the system want to screw things up?
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:53.320]  That messes up the economy, they'll make less money, you don't understand.
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:58.080]  They'd rather burn the house down so they're the only one with a house, they'd rather burn
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:01.680]  down every house in the neighborhood so they're the only one in the house because it's about
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:07.840]  their control, it's about their power, it's about their will to power, it's the psychology
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:15.120]  of the corrupt and good people who are stronger and smarter in every way than evil except
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:16.120]  in one area.
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:22.920]  We're blind because we think the world operates and basically works like we do and that's
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:26.600]  not how it works.
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:34.320]  Can I use the parallel, the analogy to serial killers?
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:37.640]  Every time you read about one of these cases, it's like, why would somebody want to grab
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:39.360]  little kids or women and do this?
[2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:42.040]  I mean, why would you want to torture somebody?
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:47.680]  It's just so horrible, it seems so anathema so you'll tend to not even read that part
[2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:52.360]  of the newspaper or not read that book or watch that TV show.
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:57.840]  But then there's childlike people that kind of get off on it and are into it and I can
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:02.480]  understand the fascination to understand evil but still there's some people who kind of
[2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:10.600]  get into it and fantasize that they're kind of part of it and it's very, very sick and
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:16.000]  if you look at our society, we're being trained at preemptive war, secret arrest, torture,
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:23.360]  people's kids, I remember a caller, probably like 98, 99 called and said, I was just at
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:27.640]  a 7-11 and bought, I think it was weapons and technology of law enforcement magazine,
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:33.400]  I'm going for memory and you ought to see it, it talks about torturing people's kids
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:38.000]  in front of them to stop an anthrax attack and how it's good.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:42.560]  So I literally ran out to 7-11 and went in, there it was and this person was calling from
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:47.680]  another city and sure enough opened it up and it was a law enforcement, a former military
[2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:52.960]  trainer counterterrorism about, well they're going to release anthrax bombs and it's going
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:37:00.960]  to kill thousands if you don't and you got the person's kid, do you torture them?
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:03.880]  And I saw several other articles like that over the years, I'm probably giving you a
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:10.840]  composite from memory, it's all, the point is, is I saw another, was it weapons and tactics
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:15.920]  of law enforcement because there was another one, the law enforcement technology was another
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:20.280]  one that I'm remembering had the thing about, if you see somebody with a get out of the
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:25.200]  UN sticker on the back of their car, well I go ahead and take them to jail and chiefs
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.600]  don't get mad at them because they're probably just already an extremist and again, that
[2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:35.760]  sounds crazy when you hear it, but it's about pushing the envelope, pushing the overton
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:42.400]  window, tabbing the TSA, stick their hands down your pants, it's supposed to be extreme
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:45.880]  and I know of your police out there and read those, you've read all that kind of stuff,
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:48.800]  I know new listeners, in fact I shouldn't even probably go from memory because it's
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:55.320]  all foggy and I did know when stuff gets foggy, splice and mix and it's one magazine said
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:38:00.200]  it when the other didn't, by the way other people out there that collect all that stuff,
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:03.800]  I've lost more magazines than most people will ever have, they get sent to me, but if you're
[2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:08.240]  out there and collect all those, highlight those, mail them to us and I'll do a whole
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:16.240]  report and not just those issues, but all the issues that cover this and go over this.
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:18.920]  Okay, I said I'm going to get into more of the news now, I've already mentioned a lot
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:21.600]  of it, but let me get into quite a bit of it now and if we have time I'll get to the
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:25.840]  other callers that are holding.
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:34.360]  Before I get into this incredible Iran crisis and the corporate media globally, the establishment
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:39.960]  mouthpieces slowly but surely trying to sell the public on the same lies that took us to
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:46.080]  war with Iraq, they've now shut that down and are ready to go to the next phase.
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:51.320]  I want to play a clip from a couple years ago on C-SPAN, this is the former head of
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:39:04.760]  NATO, former commanding general of NATO, Wesley Clark on C-SPAN talking about being in a meeting
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:09.400]  with some folks who showed him some classified information concerning seven countries the
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:11.920]  West plan to strike and this is a long time ago.
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:17.600]  Now the thing is Clark doesn't know because obviously he hasn't researched it and the world
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:21.440]  so full of information, I mean none of us can know everything obviously, that there was
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:30.320]  an Israeli plan in 1982 to do this that then got picked up in the early 1990s by the Pentagon
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:33.600]  as a plan and this is the plan today.
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.240]  And so here's Clark telling you about the plan, but it's been in major newspapers what
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:41.640]  Clark's talking about, this basic plan, this domino.
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:47.360]  Now the West knew that when they raised commodity prices on corn and things like that and wheat
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:51.880]  that it was going to make these countries where half the public is on subsistence level,
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:57.360]  two dollars a day or less, more than half their money is spent on food, so when you
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:01.720]  cut their food off it's going to cause problems.
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:06.800]  And so they knew right at the time when to then take control of the revolutions and send
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:15.000]  in their al-Qaeda in Libya, Egypt, and now Syria and it's on record, they are al-Qaeda,
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:19.840]  no al-Qaeda and they publicly work for the U.S. government and it's in the news they
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:22.840]  do.
[2:40:22.840 --> 2:40:27.040]  I was having Christmas dinner with my parents this weekend with the family and my dad was
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:32.320]  like man, he goes it's all over the news Alex that al-Qaeda is the main force that
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:38.680]  NATO uses and it's all true what you said, he's just like I can't believe the system
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:44.040]  thinks we're that dumb and I'm like dad they're in a trance, good old boys just know men
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:49.040]  exist with beards and turbans, I will literally slit my wrist or cut my children's heads off
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:54.880]  because I'm a trendy, you know good old boy and you know just burn the Billarites, kill
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:41:01.880]  Arabs, you don't understand the entire government attack plan is for you.
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:06.960]  The men in the turbans with the beards openly work for the bankers.
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:13.040]  Saudi Arabia was created by British intelligence, al-Qaeda was created by U.S. British, Israeli
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:17.520]  and Pakistani intelligence on record.
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:22.200]  The leadership is global triple agents, they have underlings that they get out of dirt
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:27.240]  villages whose mama you know got blown up or whatever by a smart bomb who are willing
[2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:32.080]  to go out and do stuff, that's why they're so dangerous, they've got real converts that
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:36.440]  will go blow themselves up, the CIA doesn't have to brainwash you and put you on drugs
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:40.000]  for two years to make you a mind control assassin.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:43.840]  They pick you up out of some Palestinian village and you've seen your whole family
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:50.520]  killed up of the years and they take you and give you money and train you and sure enough
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:54.960]  they help you get on the airplane, a nice white guy from the CIA comes because you're
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:42:00.440]  so stupid and gets you on the airplane.
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:04.520]  I mean this is how they work, it's real simple, the globalists want to take over the world
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:09.120]  so they'll hire groups to attack or groups to take the blame when the military itself
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:14.760]  attacks itself has a pretext to make that place a battle zone.
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:20.200]  It's called a frame up, it's so elementary and it's the enemy's key tool they use against
[2:42:20.200 --> 2:42:23.360]  us to sell us on this total takeover of our society.
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:28.440]  Now I've told you for almost 10 years they were going to put TSA on the streets, they
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:31.440]  are going to be at the shopping malls everywhere, why did I know that?
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:36.160]  Because I read law enforcement publications, I have sources and I watch C-SPAN and I'm
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:39.400]  going to tell you, you're not going to do anything without Homeland Security saying
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:40.720]  something.
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.920]  Your local police are all going to take orders from the TSA and Homeland Security, everything
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:50.320]  and they're going to set up checkpoints everywhere and they're going to put their hands on you.
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:56.640]  This is about domination and when people get mad and decide to fight back you're going
[2:42:56.640 --> 2:43:01.200]  to be called terrorist on the news and they're going to say and they're already saying criticizing
[2:43:01.200 --> 2:43:05.400]  it is incitement to violence and then they're going to try to come arrest people and you're
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.560]  like but a shooting war will start, that's the plan.
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:14.840]  Just like they're blowing up stuff and I ran and pushing them and pushing them and cutting
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:20.680]  off their oil and cutting off their resources, the plan is to prod them into responding and
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:24.200]  now that's even mainstream news, Lindsay Williams said it here a month ago.
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:34.560]  Quick, let's get him back on, so all of this is happening and it's a plan and the people
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:39.640]  running America hate America but they wrap everything they do in the flag that has two
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:40.640]  big effects.
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:47.800]  The world then sees torture of kids, evil, toxic waste, GMO, drugs that have been tainted
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:53.860]  by design, blood full of HIV, all of it as the American flag.
[2:43:53.860 --> 2:43:57.480]  People worldwide see the American flag, it's like the Nazi flag or the Communist flag,
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:00.120]  I mean they run in screaming fear.
[2:44:00.120 --> 2:44:04.960]  That's on the news, a lot of our troops have 666 on the tanks, human heads and skulls stuck
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:12.280]  on them, helicopters with 666 on them, heavy metal music blaring out and I mean can you
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:17.640]  imagine all these third world people seeing this coming and then they've grown up malnourished
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:21.520]  their whole life and can't even really fight back and if they do grab up a gun then I don't
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:27.040]  know how to shoot it right and it's just a big joke, it's a big carnageville and all
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:34.480]  of those sins are now going to come back here and manifest tenfold, I mean woo, the 51 million
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:40.120]  aborted babies, all of it, just get ready in spades seven times over, God's going to
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:43.680]  give it all back to us and I'm just telling you repent now ladies and gentlemen, repent
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:47.200]  now because the new order hates you a lot more than they hate Iraqis, you think the
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:52.120]  globalist hate Iranians, they hate you a lot more and it's the sickest joke that they've
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:59.160]  staged terror attacks to get well-meaning good old boys to decry the Bill of Rights
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:03.000]  and Constitution and then we get the manuals from good police that give them to us and
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:09.200]  good feds that give them to us and the whole thing is about the American people, it is
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:15.240]  a domestic takeover right out of red dawn, it is a, and it's not just to loot us, they
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:18.920]  want to arrest, they want to torture, they want to run a red terror in this country,
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:26.200]  a total reeducation purge and military and police, if this does get triggered, I would
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:31.000]  guess they're going to die by the hundreds of thousands, conservatively, the citizens
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:36.280]  are going to die by the millions and I'm not kidding when I tell you that, okay this is
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:42.200]  not going to be pretty, this is going to be absolute war, guerrilla warfare in all directions
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:45.840]  and the globalists are going to sit back and watch it wreck America and come in five years
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:49.920]  later and reorganize everything and buy everything up for pays on the dollar, it's in the IMF
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:54.160]  World Bank plans to implode countries like this to have civil unrest, we do not want
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:58.240]  it, we do not need it, we need the military and police to stand down and we need the public
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:03.480]  to stop shooting their mouths off about violence all day, the globalists are sitting in Europe
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:09.280]  and on private islands and on giant yachts, they brag they've got yachts so they can stay
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:13.760]  offshore for a year if they need to, okay, you know, you're not going to hurt the new
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:18.880]  world order killing a cop or some military people, you know, you want to shoot your mouth
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:22.960]  off about killing people, how about you go talk to them, how about you go educate them
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:26.640]  and that means slap them upside the head with your voice, they're laughing at you say, listen
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:30.840]  I warned you, it doesn't mean be polite to them if they laugh at you, but a lot of them
[2:46:30.840 --> 2:46:35.440]  aren't going to laugh at you, you've got a responsibility long before we talk about
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:41.720]  violence to try to talk to these people now, we've got to turn this around, now let's go
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:46.880]  to Wesley Clark, here he is on C-SPAN talking about a decade before all this happened, the
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:52.120]  plan for these countries they were going to take down, but the trigger as PNAC says would
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:58.760]  be a giant terror attack on the order of Pearl Harbor, Pearl Harbor killed 3,911 did, there's
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:01.200]  a $3 bill, here it is.
[2:47:01.200 --> 2:47:06.720]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:10.920]  I said are we still going to war with Iraq and he said oh it's worse than that, he said
[2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:15.560]  he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, he said I just got this down
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:19.560]  from upstairs meeting the Secretary of Defense's office today and he said this is a memo that
[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:26.800]  describes how we're going to take out 7 countries in 5 years, starting with Iraq and then Syria,
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.640]  Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran.
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:37.440]  And the full clip is up at infowars.com, he talks about it for like an hour, ok now let
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:43.080]  me show you what's going on here, this is just in the last two days, ok?
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:51.680]  Here seeing in from Wolf Blitzer wrote this, Iraq could break apart, I told you in 2001
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:56.560]  and 2002 when they launched the war in three they always planned to break it in three parts,
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:03.240]  they always planned the pull out, it's all staged, all of it, the President of Iraq works
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:09.320]  for the globalist, this ruse that America got forced out is all complete and absolute
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:16.640]  bold, there are more than a dozen giant quote embassies that are giant armored compounds
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:20.600]  with mercenaries in them, the entire government and military's train, they're going to try
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:26.480]  to break it in three parts, the south for the Shiite, the middle part for the Bathis
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:32.200]  and others, you know the old Bathis relics and Sunnis and the rest of it and the north
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:36.080]  for the Kurds, that's the plan, it's always been the plan and now they're just now acting
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:41.840]  like this plan just got developed, kind of like TSA screeners aren't just for airports
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:48.960]  anymore, LA Times, they're coming to the malls and they're going to grab your genitals, but
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:53.000]  they know how to sheep train you first, dog training, you know first it just goes to the
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.760]  checkpoint, check the car for bombs, oh we care about you, next we're going to check
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:00.600]  your vehicle inside, next we're going to check your papers and now we're going to touch
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:04.640]  them, because you might be a terrorist, because you're guilty until proven innocent, meanwhile
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:08.160]  you're looking at government representatives who may not be bad men and women, but they
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:12.160]  do work for the people that are staging the terror, these are the terrorists, you know
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:15.880]  they say the terrorists attack us because they had our freedom, it's true, the globalists
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:20.040]  attack us because they had our freedom and now they've taken it, here's another one,
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:24.840]  Iran begins naval drills in Strait of Hormuz, it started two days ago, Tehran's largest
[2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:29.680]  display of military power will bring it into close proximity with US warships and strategic
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:36.360]  oil route and they did, Iran says it warns off foreign helicopter, the word is now it
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:42.200]  was a US helicopter that came into their territorial waters, they on the third time threatened
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:48.800]  to blow it up and so it pulled back, so Iran is starting to take the bait after having
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:53.160]  the military bases blown up and saboteurs and all the rest of it, again we're not seeing
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:57.440]  Iran's good either, these governments it's like one little system versus the big new
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:02.080]  world order system, I just know the Iranians do not put steroids in their water, you can
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:06.920]  say whatever you want about the Persians all day long, they do not, they haven't killed
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:14.640]  51 million babies, Hormuz naval drill message to the west, they're saying it's a message
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:20.640]  to the west and oil prices will double or triple if they close it, Iran rejects court
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:30.240]  ruling, it worked with al-Qaeda in 9-11 attack, yeah they had a New Jersey judge rule and
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:34.600]  now they've had some other judges rule, maybe they can rule that the Easter Bunny is real,
[2:50:34.600 --> 2:50:38.680]  that's all I'll tell you about that when we come back, I mean they said Iraq did that,
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:43.560]  they said every other country over there did it but Saudi Arabia who was actually involved
[2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:48.080]  with the globalist in it, 15 of the 19 are from there, we've talked to the embassy heads
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:51.240]  you said they were ordered to let the hijackers in the US and told they were US government
[2:50:51.240 --> 2:50:58.600]  agents, I mean this is on record, this is on record, oh but not Saudi Arabia, no Iran
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:01.400]  you're behind it, yes, yes.
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:06.120]  When the food collapse happens if trucks stop delivering food to supermarket shelves tomorrow

[2:54:14.160 --> 2:54:19.560]  I'll do five minutes overdrive to talk to Emily, Carolyn and Mike. That'll be PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:24.760]  on MFullWars.com, audio stream only. Then I'll be back tonight to do an MFullWars nightly
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:32.400]  news, very important transmission coming up this evening. Look, we can turn this around.
[2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:36.080]  We can turn around so many things that are happening. Ten years ago, if you talked about
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:39.680]  misfine all a sterilizing people and giving them cancer, you get laughed at. Now the government
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:45.480]  has been forced to admit it. Ten years ago, you told people GMO is basically designed
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:50.280]  to attack the human body. You get laughed at. Now there's a big report out of the International
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:56.600]  Journal of Bioethical Sciences, analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:55:01.960]  on mammalian health. That's mammals. Research has found that agricultural giant, Monsanto's
[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:06.240]  GMO corn, is linked to organ damage and rats. Gee, they knew that 20 years ago, depending
[2:55:06.240 --> 2:55:15.240]  on the type. And wow, it's weird. The three main varieties of GM corn, Mon 863, Mon 810,
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:24.200]  and NK603. It's just so funny. They're all real bad for you. Well, jeepers, creepers,
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:29.320]  if bugs won't eat it or if they do, they die. You think it's good for you? It grows a, quote,
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:35.480]  natural pesticide. I love people that are into drugs because I'm not. I guess I do drink
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:39.920]  coffee and stuff, but the point is illegal drugs. They'll say, but it's natural. This
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:46.680]  drug is natural. Really, cyanide. There are plants out there. They got cyanide that are
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:53.320]  natural. Silver nightshade's got poison. It'll kill you dead in a hammer. It's natural.
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:57.680]  So their argument is, well, we trigger the plant to grow it 1000 times or higher. This
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:06.840]  poisonous fungus inside of it that naturally grows on it. Yeah, at one 1000th or less.
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:12.200]  It just goes on and on. I mean, the honey bees eat this stuff and they fall over dead
[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:16.320]  in a hammer. I mean, look, look, I'm just here saying, oh, hey, this is for you all.
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:20.760]  They knew when they adopted it in the fifties. Here's the documents. They did it to sterilize
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:26.200]  people. You might be concerned. Oh, shut up, you nut. They wouldn't do that. Oh yeah, they
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:32.080]  have been and it's on record. And you know what? They're not stopping. You know, when
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:39.280]  it comes out, this stuff's in a baby formula, melamine and bisphenol A. Every other government
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:42.800]  removes it, but our government comes out and says, we say it's good for you. Kind of like
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:46.600]  radiation levels go up. They just say, we'll raise the level of what we say safe. This
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:52.960]  is an insanity to buy into this system is an insanity. And I see all these yuppies because
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:59.880]  I want to see a movie this weekend. It was sold out. So we went to the mall, walked around
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:06.840]  and I watched the sharp in shape yuppies and the people of their families and their real
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:11.920]  end to playing the corporate game, not sticking their heads up, saying yes, yes, yes to get
[2:57:11.920 --> 2:57:18.240]  some chicken feed money. Listen, listen, you're not winning going along with this. I don't
[2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:22.920]  care if you got a big house and a bunch of crud. You got to take care of. Okay. You know,
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:26.560]  that's something I've really been liberated in. And I was always someone of a centered
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:32.000]  person and a decent person, but I still thought it'd be really cool to know movie stars and
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:36.480]  stuff. I mean, I would like movie stars. They live on Mars or something. And then I never
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:40.040]  even reached out to movie stars and I was reached out to and still am even more so than
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:43.600]  ever. And then it's kind of like, okay, I've met some of the most famous people in the
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:54.320]  world. It means nothing. So everybody thinks bigger house, big car, movie stars, be famous.
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:57:58.080]  They think that that's unattainable. That's something they, oh my gosh, it's like living
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:02.800]  on another world. I'm here to tell you, none of that will fulfill you. Helping an old
[2:58:02.800 --> 2:58:08.960]  lady across the street or somebody comes in to rob you and take them out. That's going
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:14.640]  to satisfy you. Planning a garden in your backyard. That's going to satisfy you. Being
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:19.840]  a good decent person and teaching others skills and helping build humanity. That is going
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:26.400]  to fulfill you. And I'm telling you they are moving towards war with Iran big time. I mean,
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:29.840]  it's got top generals in the US and Israel saying they're getting ready to hit them.
[2:58:29.840 --> 2:58:33.760]  They're certainly trying to scare Iran into some type of a vodka to move. And the war
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:38.600]  is already going on inside Iran like Gerald Salente said. This thing is just starting
[2:58:38.600 --> 2:58:53.160]  to escalate.
[2:58:53.160 --> 2:58:57.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[2:59:52.200 --> 2:59:59.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:59.200 --> 3:00:08.400]  Alright, I'm going to be back tonight at 7 o'clock central. A lot of news I got to. A
[3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:11.560]  lot of it I didn't. We'll be covering the news I didn't get to and more tonight at 7
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:15.400]  o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv. Let's jam in three calls right now that have been holding
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:19.560]  the longest. Emily, Carolyn and Mike. Emily in California, you're on the air.
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:26.600]  Alex, wow, my gosh, it is, oh my God, it's amazing to speak with you there. I have so
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:30.960]  much respect for you. Well, I respect you as well. Thank you for calling.
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:34.840]  Quick question. This may seem like the dumbest thing in the world, but there's a documentary
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:39.160]  out there called September Clues. I don't know if you've heard of it. Have you heard
[3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:46.760]  of it? Uh, vaguely it rings a bell. It's about they, it's about no aircraft hitting
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.440]  the towers, period, right? Correct. Yeah. And then there's another one where they talk
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:56.560]  about how the scientific way that there's actually like the pod and then they put the
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:01.560]  planes over it. No, I don't know. You know, it was pretty convincing, but I don't think
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:06.920]  it's ever bad to question. I can tell you that some of the people pushing that theory,
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:11.800]  I don't know about that. I have to go back to memory, but that film aside, the progenitors
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:18.040]  of the no plane theory, one of them came out in a big documentary that had been filmed
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:23.880]  in 2000 by this big visionary technologist. I never gave it attention at the time because
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:29.360]  the person is subsided off into the background. And it turned out that it was a big CIA drill
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:34.360]  and that it was a CIA, uh, social experiment that didn't New York. And then one of the
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:39.880]  main characters in it, it's a documentary. It's nonfiction use the person that created
[3:01:39.880 --> 3:01:44.920]  all that. And so it's, it's, you're not bad. You're asking my opinion. I don't like getting
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:49.160]  into the end fighting because they want to create division and the 911 truth movement
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:53.440]  is that they put all that out and say it's all completely fake stuff on TV. And then
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:58.720]  I say, really, I talked to good friends I've known for years that saw the second plane
[3:01:58.720 --> 3:02:03.800]  and they say, no, you're CIA shut up. And then later, one of the researchers runs in
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:08.080]  and says, have you seen this big documentary about the social networking documentary about
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:12.040]  the guy that envisioned where the internet was going, the top scientist, you know, computer
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:15.160]  technologist, and then it all turned out to be true. And then they're at the center of
[3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:23.360]  it is this is the individual admitting ties to the CIA 12 years ago. So totally stays
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:25.480]  totally to get us fighting with each other. Emily,
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:30.240]  good to know. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. You bet. And again, I don't want to get
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:36.560]  off into a whole fight about that. Uh, people can have their views. I'm not saying everybody
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:40.280]  that believes that's bad. It's just, that's what the media always uses about, you don't
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:44.560]  believe there are any airplanes. And I'm like, yep, that's your go to, isn't it? Go ahead
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:49.200]  and poison the pot with this info. Uh, let's talk to Mike and Texas, Mike, you're on the
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:50.200]  ear.
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:56.400]  Yeah, Alex, just to kind of bring home the, uh, pounding of the drama about the federalization
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:01.200]  of all local law enforcement. Uh, just several weeks ago, I went to, I live in a small community
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:06.480]  west of Fort Worth, still have a town square, et cetera, and, uh, went to a program, uh,
[3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:10.720]  to listen to my son and hear students, uh, do some Christmas carols and so on and so
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:17.160]  forth. And, uh, probably about 40 law enforcement people in a small town square. I look out
[3:03:17.160 --> 3:03:22.400]  the window and there is this mammoth, um, law enforcement vehicle painted beautifully
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:27.840]  red and white with gold leaf that says incident command center. And of course that caught
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:31.880]  my eye and went out there and finally got the attention of an officer. Of course it
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:35.440]  startled everybody that was Smithley that's been listening to me talk about what's going
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:40.080]  on and was so excited about all the cool things that it had. And I said, well, I see on the
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:46.680]  back of there in paint funded by department of homeland security. And it really brought
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:51.560]  it home for the people that I was with, uh, especially when I was speaking to the officer
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:54.880]  and he said, it's got everything. He was so excited and I said, well, what do you do
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:04:00.480]  with it? He said, we basically go wherever we're needed. I said, well, who tell you where
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:04.480]  to go? I said, does the fed tell you where to go? He said, yeah, but don't worry about
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:07.920]  it's funded by the local county and the local authority. So I said, yeah, but that's what
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:08.920]  I pay for.
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:14.240]  He said, yeah, usually about 70% of it is from the locals and the threat fusion center
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:19.960]  is fed run and they'll lie to you and tell you didn't it is and, and, and believe me,
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:24.360]  they're training to spy on you. Everything. It's so horrible. Those poor moron local cops
[3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:26.560]  have no idea what they're going to be asked to do.
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:32.000]  Absolutely. He said, we just go where we're told and it just floored the five or six people
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:36.080]  that were with me and they got goosebumps and I said, I'm telling you, they're federalizing
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:37.080]  everything.
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:40.600]  Did the police officer listen to you?
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:45.560]  No, I was talking, I had friends and family with me while I was speaking to them and when
[3:04:45.560 --> 3:04:49.680]  I said, does the fed tell you where to go? That's when he cut the conversation off.
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:53.640]  Oh yeah, he's been trained. You're a terrorist. If you can string a sentence together, they've
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:56.980]  been told you're a terrorist. You're just supposed to drink fluoride and give all your
[3:04:56.980 --> 3:05:02.560]  money to the banks and help destroy America or you're a traitor.
