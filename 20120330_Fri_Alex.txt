[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:33.200]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones right now the Supreme
[00:33.200 --> 00:41.200]  Court justices are meeting to decide in secret whether or not they're gonna uphold all or
[00:41.200 --> 00:49.200]  part or strike down the government slash insurance slash mega bank takeover of health
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.200]  care and the death panels and the eugenics and kill the babies up to age three that they're
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.200]  they're recommending and just tune in with the first time just before you think I'm lying
[00:59.200 --> 01:05.000]  put into a search engine it's in hundreds of newspapers I'm not joking I understand that's
[01:05.000 --> 01:12.000]  crazy but I'm not the crazy one I've probably gone a little crazy focusing on this stuff
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  I know why a lot of people get into this information and then say I just can't handle
[01:17.000 --> 01:27.000]  it and punch out completely that there's a lot of people veterans former CIA people who do
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  just basically retire early and disappear because they know what's going on inside the government
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  and it totally flips them out outgoing people who were the top of their clash all American
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  and they just disappear into nowhere just want to live in a shack and be left alone because
[01:46.000 --> 01:56.000]  when you come face to face with evil you either join with it and sink to the bottom or you
[01:56.000 --> 02:06.000]  fight it or you just punch out of society and some people they just deny what's going on
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  I wish every day as I've been trying to psychoanalyze myself and understand the process I've gone
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  through this is understands everybody's process to a certain extent I mean how have we gotten
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  to the point where the out of control galloping corruption growing like a metastasizing blooming
[02:25.000 --> 02:35.000]  cancer how have we gotten to the point where this is all out in the open now and some good
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  things are happening but not quite enough I mean you would imagine that there would be
[02:39.000 --> 02:52.000]  a much bigger response to this level of tyranny we got a big radio show lined up for you today
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  I say that every day because it is I mean it's big issues powerful news important information
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  you know the information on this transmission has already saved a lot of lives stopped a
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  lot of new conflicts exposed a lot of tyranny we've had we're always so busy fighting the
[03:09.000 --> 03:17.000]  next globalist salvo that we never really go back and properly chronicle our successes
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  but more and more I realize that's something that's important for us to do as well is to
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  chronicle the info war because it's a story of your success 99% of the success we've had
[03:32.000 --> 03:42.000]  is you I first put the idea into motion and that idea was put into motion by others actions
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  and now like ripples in a pond it's a cliche because it's so true we are seeing exponential
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  awakening but that's gonna have the byproduct of the empire striking back and I just am
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  very disquieted in my spirit everybody is though because subconsciously and in your
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  gut you know you're under assault you know things are wrong you know things are unfair
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  on so many levels and you know that that's not why you have anxiety there's something
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.000]  else ominous and I look at all the big threats I see on the board and I try to say what is
[04:28.000 --> 04:38.000]  it that's getting to me what is it I know that something horrible is already happening
[04:38.000 --> 04:48.000]  and we haven't discovered exactly what it is yet all right we'll get into the supreme court
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  situation and a lot more on the other side of this Friday transmission I'll tell you about

[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously

[08:20.000 --> 08:33.000]  it is Friday the 30th day of March 2012 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Fritz Springmeier is joining us to cover some ground he's never gotten into
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  before here on the broadcast he wants to get into suppressed globalist technologies
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.000]  he also wants to break down how Nazi Germany is a model politically and economically
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  for what's happening in this global order now because Hitler only got elected to a sub-position
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  he was only a minority leader in the government and most Germans thought he was a joke
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  how did he end up taking control of the nation because when I invited Fritz on Monday
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  I said I want to get you on Friday he said we told the producer he said okay well what does Alex want to talk about
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  and I said whatever you want just you're an interesting fellow great author interesting researcher
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  folks like hearing you on the show so whatever you want to cover obviously I'll bring up all my points
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  so he's joining us in the second hour I want to get Dr. Doug Rocky the guy that literally
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  wrote the book the book for the Pentagon and depleted uranium in the 80s and again in the 90s
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  headed their DU program research and mitigation program he's got a bunch of degrees he's a physicist
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  biology the list goes on and on but because now with Fukushima and things we're being told
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  you're mentally ill if you go to the hospital with radiation poisoning in Japan it's on record
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  that it's many times worse than Chernobyl so in 86 they admitted oh this is killing people
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  making them sick kids are dropping dead heart failure that's what happens bleeding from the gums
[10:08.000 --> 10:15.000]  chronic fatigue super high radiation levels now they just say we're not giving you medical care
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  and when I saw that in the news this week it was in the Japanese news Paul Watson wrote an article on
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  I guess an English exclusive English language exclusive globally in full wars does that a lot
[10:26.000 --> 10:34.000]  proud of the work of all our writers but the point is that we're uncompartimentalizing the news
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  something that is important to do because you don't want to just be regionalized around the world
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  because when you see the Japanese government saying you're mentally ill here's Prozac and then
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  locking people up in mental institutions till they die of radiation poisoning or if you're living in
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  the area and you're saying you make my child go to this public school I want to be able to go to one
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  further away from Fukushima you know not 12 miles away they say you're mentally ill and that's in
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  the Japanese news and they're going along with it yes you're mentally ill remember we were liars that
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  reactors were blowing up even though we could watch them and get the different radiological
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  breakdown fingerprints off the different isotopes and we knew there was total meltdown including a
[11:24.000 --> 11:36.000]  plutonium reactor which they had there mox three number three reactor mox mox core reactor plutonium
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  and uranium most nasty type out there to have a problem with old rotting 39 year old system that was
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  supposed to only go 20 years the radiation just eating through all the circuitry the metal everything
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  the same all over the world on average reactors are over 30 years old 9 out of 10 are leaking the
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  associated press admits it in a small footnote and the new attitude of the elite and the big bankers
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  and the John Corzine type should make 40 to 1 bets with other people's private bank accounts and
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  then doesn't get in trouble when he steals their accounts and loses the money.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  The attitude is just let the reactors blow up and melt down everywhere and just dance around in
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  radiation that's what I'm saying they've reached a Caligula level craziness the elite is good at
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  controlling us dominating us dumbing us down manipulating they've got all these automated
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  propaganda systems set up in the last 60 70 years by hard-working globalist who were evil but
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  hard-working and now it's just kind of a machine that's automated and most the elite are just
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  rancing around like crazy people and they're not going to shut reactors down because they're
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  making money off of them and control in fact they're saying they're going to shut down more
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  coal power plants and build more nukes I know I've already gone over this rant before it just
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  goes to the heart of everything that's why I haven't dug Rocky Pop in for 30 minutes because
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  that's what they started doing in 1991 and people were dying from the DU and it was in their own
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  hands don't use it back to the 40s they had DU and they talked about using it and Doug
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  Rocky's quoted these he has them on the websites he writes for he's ferreted out and dug all these
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  up these are declassified reports from 47 49 52 where they're like yeah we've got all this
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  byproduct of nuclear weapons production and what's left over from reactors it would make great
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  armor and it would also make great you know weapons systems we've tested it but it ignites
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  going out of the barrel and so you're getting a very dangerous dose of it every time you use it
[13:39.000 --> 13:48.000]  in artillery or in small arms or in missiles and it's all in these reports and when I get him
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  on I'll have him dig one of those out they also looked at a DU gas that they were looking at
[13:56.000 --> 14:06.000]  using but decided against and they said no because it kills our own troops 1990 rolls around
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  they said you know what tell them just you know wash their hands or whatever and when you
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  clean out the tanks you know where special gear by the mid 90s it's just do whatever you want
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  by 2000s it's it's they're not even a discussion and people sons and daughters they call me all
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  the time they go yeah my son got assigned to maintenance of Abrams tanks or got assigned to
[14:29.000 --> 14:38.000]  maintenance of aircrafts and worked on ward hogs a 10s yeah my son got assigned to you know
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  munitions and yeah he's 23 and he's got lung cancer and his kidneys are failing and it's DU
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  I mean I've probably had I don't know 30 40 calls last year or two Rocky gets them every hour
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  because everybody in the military knows he's the one exposing and he's had 30 something surgeries
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  himself most his team died just investigating it and you know what they do now they say
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  you're mentally ill you come in your your urinating blood you can't breathe you've got
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  flashes your you and your wife have a deformed baby holds in their brain holds in their hearts
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  everything else you can imagine this is on record yeah I mean 15 years ago it was the cover
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  of time life books that DU caused it and all the scientists admitting it now they just go
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  nope not true and they have guys and they're scrubbing out those barrel heads and all that
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  and I've talked to them sometimes they wear a respirator you get that stuff on your skin
[15:38.000 --> 15:48.000]  you're walking dead again the the establishment is crazy they're crazy
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  people are ignorant about just how far down the rabbit hole we've gone here all of us together
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  like I saw a few comments when I had a little ruse on he talked about the Pentagon developing
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  anti-matter weapons they're like listen to this old cook because the media says he's a cook
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  they say George Washington was a cook today they say Ron Paul's a cook you know he's talking
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  about anti-matter weapons what a nut they don't even know that there's declassified
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  admissions of a 30 year anti-matter weapon campaign and that they isolated it and have
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  the weapons for at least a decade I mean that's in the San Francisco Chronicle you
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  can look it up the details are classified but they've got anti-matter weapons and they
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  wouldn't have leaked it if they didn't want the people to know it and other governments
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  to know it by the way when you're talking about anti-matter you're talking about actually
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.000]  weapons that something that's the size of a quarter they estimated some of the studies
[16:55.000 --> 17:03.000]  I've seen would blow the earth into tiny particles we're not talking about an asteroid
[17:03.000 --> 17:12.000]  belt or something where the earth was I mean we're talking dust cloud plasma vapor we're
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  not in Kansas anymore by the way I've always said we're not in Kansas anymore it's one
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  of my favorite perseverations that kind of ruined it when I saw Avatar that is a powerful
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  weapon he's like you are not in Kansas anymore out there past that fence everything that
[17:30.000 --> 17:44.000]  crawls or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eats your eyes for juju beads by the
[17:44.000 --> 17:54.000]  way Aaron I ended up shooting like a 30 minutes of footage and like 30 minutes or more of
[17:54.000 --> 18:02.000]  voiceover to put together this I did all this last Friday and then again Sunday we worked
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  on it to put together this sneak peek at Prometheus the big movie coming out by one of my favorite
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  actors and I thought probably the best out there living director very talented very smart
[18:15.000 --> 18:25.000]  guy and Aaron ended up going down the rabbit hole on that and it's not going to be ready
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  for the radio show today it should be ready he says it will be tonight on the nightly
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  news seven o'clock central and it's very important information because what's going
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  on and Aaron knew some of this and it's seen a lot of it as eugenics studies and Jacobson's
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  really into studying it and then Aaron went down the rabbit hole was like oh my gosh this
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  is really worse than we even said so he's back there trying to figure out how to put
[18:49.000 --> 18:58.000]  it all in what we discovered people running things are out of their minds or maybe they're
[18:58.000 --> 19:05.000]  right I mean not right about what they're doing but they the dominant theme when you think
[19:05.000 --> 19:19.000]  the elite are into the occult that just means the hidden the elite believe that they are
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  communicating with extraterrestrials spiritually at a dimensional level it goes back to every
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  culture every society whether it's true or not that's what they believe it's pretty much
[19:29.000 --> 19:35.000]  what David Ike is saying but and then some that's why every movie you see it's like the
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  John Carter movie I went and saw everybody says it's so bad I thought it was entertaining
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  you know it's like Mars and people being teleported in this race of beings playing humanoids off
[19:44.000 --> 19:50.000]  against each other that's the the elite think they're that and so I'm not saying I believe
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  that I'm saying this is what they believe we'll come back with the news stay with us
[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  guys are coming up to today folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  a switch to get the lights back on if so this is going to be the most important message
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter
[20:13.000 --> 20:19.000]  power outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from our friends
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their emergency backup systems provide

[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  I want to get to about how close we are to the casual society and that's going to be
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  used to shut down the grassroots community infrastructure even more and only allow
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.000]  big box stores to operate government regulations and systems are going to try to shut down
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  small operators online as well that's why they're going after farmers ranchers
[24:32.000 --> 24:42.000]  anything small anything independent speaking of that I've read over the new
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  Michigan regulations on livestock and all heritage breed pigs that have any type of
[24:50.000 --> 25:00.000]  dark hair or red hair just because they look like what any breed of pig reverts to
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.000]  once it's gone wild they're going to kill all the pigs in Michigan and I know all about
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  pigs from a farming and ranching family and also go to the livestock shows of my
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  children I mean the pigs I saw at the Texas Austin rodeo would have all been killed
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  under this confirmed Michigan pig ban will eliminate all heritage breeds destroy
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  thousands of small farms and they get to charge the people with felonies if they
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  and I read this on the air the other day it says any characteristic or characteristic
[25:34.000 --> 25:41.000]  not recognized by science as being attached to feral it says just anybody we want
[25:41.000 --> 25:49.000]  you know any farm any pig it doesn't matter we will come on your property
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  kill it and charge you criminal people are like that doesn't make any sense they
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  don't care the public's worried about feral hogs that have gotten out and
[26:01.000 --> 26:07.000]  bred instead of killing those it's we're going to go after people that have pigs
[26:07.000 --> 26:15.000]  that could get out so psycho government I mean they just it's so over the top
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  people are like this doesn't make sense yeah it does it's hands down your pants
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  one day arrest people eliminate stands the next no gardens the next and it's all
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  being announced we have a government that basically is trying to do everything
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  that Joseph Stalin did as many natural news readers now know the this articles
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  up at info wars dot com or natural news dot com the state of Michigan's
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  Department of Natural Resources DNR recently issued a final ruling a ruling
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  they rule us not law the agency rules you on its invasive species order ISO
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  for swine that targets destructive feral to the UN has always said that's how
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  they're going to ban cats dogs cows they call invasive so that's the rest of
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  story they said how are we going to shut down family farms we're going to say
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  all of this is unnatural and bad to the environment and try to go back to the
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  way North America was or Europe was pre domesticated animals you think I'm
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  joking like ten years ago telling you the bioethics board said they want to kill
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  babies up to age three now it's mainstream news okay this is you go read it
[27:27.000 --> 27:35.000]  for yourself that's the plan in fact type in animal rights group wants to ban
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  ban owning cats and dogs I mean it'll be or or wants to ban farm animals as
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  invasive species I mean in government Europe is looking at this this isn't a
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  game as many natural news readers now know the state of Michigan's Department of
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  Natural Resources recently issued a final ruling on its invasive species order ISO
[27:56.000 --> 28:04.000]  for swine that targets destructive feral species not not feral hogs that are
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  just the regular pig different variants like dogs it's like saying you know that
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.000]  this is like saying your your German shepherd because it's related to wolves
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  has to be killed that's exactly what this is or or your poodle and it's meant
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  to selectively harass the farmers and see big port production is the other ones
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  all in all 50 stages like they banned real milk 60 years ago nationwide well
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  they banned it from stores first they just got it regulated then they started
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  it banned so they could feed you boiled cooked so-called milk that was filled
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  with pus and feces see with when it's raw fresh milk there can't be any
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  contamination or they can't get away with it so they just get rid of real milk
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  so the counterfeit can come in and now big agra by the way they're coming out
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.000]  seeing invasive chickens your chickens roost in trees come up to your house
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  get fed you take eggs you sell them they don't want chickens out in the open
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.000]  they could start roasting oh I forgot let me give natural news a tip to do another
[29:12.000 --> 29:18.000]  big report they're coming after all different types of gain hens and things
[29:18.000 --> 29:27.000]  including pheasants they're saying they don't want those released and it just
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  goes on here anything that has red or black hair or spots of hair or anything
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  else they just say I mean I mean they say anything we wish I mean you go rid of
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  yourself it just says any pig we say even if it's not in the scientific
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  literature that's a sign of being feral it's dead so it's feral species folks
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  that feral species a pig is the domesticated pig we're on the march the
[29:51.000 --> 30:02.000]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a year ago
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral

[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:23.000 --> 32:27.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.000]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[32:39.000 --> 32:42.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[32:59.000 --> 33:08.000]  six five I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
[33:08.000 --> 33:12.000]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.000]  Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:18.000 --> 33:25.000]  let me just finish and let me just finish up with this article on the
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  pigs and I'm gonna get into government-run health care and the Supreme
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  Court set to rule today but they're gonna keep it secret until June this
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.000]  is something that's gonna cost trillions of dollars a year some estimates
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  have it upwards of two trillion this is one of the biggest issues ever they're
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  gonna keep it secret until June while they write their opinion you better
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  believe government industry are gonna know and something this big is gonna
[33:52.000 --> 33:59.000]  leak and again the folks thought they weren't gonna pass the health care
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  act and Paul said they've got the votes in the house months before he said I
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  think it's gonna pass and then he said last week that unfortunately he's
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  hearing rumblings that they're probably gonna rule for it and I saw a bunch
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  of articles getting conservatives ready for that and then we saw the articles
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  saying that the Supreme Court's gonna go against it and that they sounded like
[34:22.000 --> 34:30.000]  they weren't buying it in the oral arguments a few days ago and I you know
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  read the transcripts of the audio tapes and Supreme Court release which is
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  unprecedented and it's all the points we'd make if the government can make
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  you do this they can make eat broccoli if the government can make you buy
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  somebody's product and then selectively give waivers to groups that they are
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  friends with that's total discrimination I'm gonna get to that in a minute if
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.000]  you think I'm joking about this feral hog thing that's like saying we have a
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.000]  problem with coyotes so we're gonna come by your neighborhood and any dog that
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  looks anything like a coyote we're gonna kill in your house and then you read
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  the description and they say it's anything it's a dog with curly hair it's a
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  little dog it's a big dog that's what they say in the descriptions that they're
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  not saying we're gonna kill feral hogs we're gonna have an eradication program
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  and get the citizens together and explain to citizens there's a lot of people
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  even people that hunt don't think you can shoot these pigs and they ask is there
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  a season and all this idiocy there's no season on an invasive species that does
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  eat the baby deer that does tear up your farms your crops I mean they're
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  devastating a group of a hundred feral hogs will come through your field and
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  just wreck everything even if they're not eating the crop you're growing say
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  cotton like bulldozers with their with their shouts and tusk they just turn
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  everything over and any pig in a year or so out in the wild starts growing tusk
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  it's the rooting that stimulates the teeth and hair starts growing and all the
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  rest of it just like if you went out and lived in the wild for a couple years
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  you'd look like grizzly Adams your skin would get thicker you'd get a big old
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.000]  beard long hair you'd get tougher and this is such an example of the craziness
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  of government is why I'm getting into it that they're saying we're gonna come to
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  your farm and if there's any characteristics such as black or red hair
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  or any other sign that it could be connected to the these feral varieties
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  we're gonna kill them on the spot with rifles go read it we have links to it
[37:00.000 --> 37:07.000]  this is a ruling and we're gonna arrest you and charge you with felony crimes
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.000]  and the farming groups and everybody are like are you crazy let me read you some
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  of this contrary to some of the claims currently spreading across the
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  internet and elsewhere DNR ISO does not simply target feral breeds responsible
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  destroying crops or forest as we pointed out in a recent article on the matter
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  the ISO brand certain hair colors fur types tails skeletal structures and
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  various other characteristics as being indicators of feral breed again
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  same as a pig they call it a breed like with dogs even though these descriptions
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  also identify many heritage breeds that have been raised in Michigan for many
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  decades well yeah and they say in the ruling they're gonna come to your property
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  and if you have them they're gonna put fines on you or arrest you so it's a new
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  way for the whole military industrial complex that ships the drugs in so they
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  can then catch people selling them because making it illegal has huge profits
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  associated and then next it's your aloe vera plantation are gonna say that's a
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  drug and next you can't grow hemp that doesn't even have THC in it for cotton
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  hemp cotton hemp fabric and then next oh you can't have a garden and then next
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.000]  on and on now they move on so you got to have animal ID premises ID you got to
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.000]  you got to have inspections you got to have the rural affairs do this
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.000]  certain hair colors fur types tails skeletal structures and various other
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.000]  characteristics as being indicators of a feral breed
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  even though these descriptions also identify many heritage breeds that have
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  been raised in Michigan for decades in other words there is nothing sensational
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  overblown about the claims made that the state of Michigan has basically declared
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  war on all pig breeds the spy the select few raised by large scale factory
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  farms the DNR's approach to situation is beyond misguided is blatantly
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  unscientific assault on small scale pig farmers across state of Michigan many
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  of which face being completely put out of business the DNR's thinking is a
[39:19.000 --> 39:27.000]  rational writes senator Darwin L. Boer from Michigan's 35th district in a
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  recent article on the issue the department says that we must ban certain
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  pigs because the state has a feral hog problem and see the public is so dumb
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  that when they hear well of course we got to kill the feral pigs yeah I've
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  shot plenty of myself instead of that they're saying we're gonna go after
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  and start inspecting your breed as if the you're the people causing this pigs
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  have just been getting out for hundreds of years and the wolves and other
[39:59.000 --> 40:07.000]  predators have been cold too far back so nothing's keeping the pigs down and
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  when you drive down the highway and see them all over Texas now sometimes you
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  see more pigs than deer on the side of the road nobody shooting them and it
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  goes on the department says we must ban certain pigs because the state is a
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  feral hog problem pigs running at large or outside of fence but since all pigs
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  outside of offense are feral and the DNR cannot genetically differentiate
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  between swine the department decided to ban certain pigs in Michigan simply
[40:35.000 --> 40:46.000]  due to their appearance so they have a new way to harass you and it just goes on
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  to say the senator says there's a way to harass and arrest people and make
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  money yep here they come they're never backing off they're never stopping
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  there's always something new they can make illegal and they're already talking
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  about not letting you have free range chickens because they might get out they
[41:03.000 --> 41:14.000]  might go and take biosphere from some other animal all right let me shift gears
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  into government-run health care they're they're ruling on it right now may
[41:18.000 --> 41:28.000]  have already happened and it's up in the air what's going to unfold supreme
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  court decision on health care again they're announcing that it's officially
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  will be today now they were saying earlier in the week this week it's now
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  today and it's also reported that it will not be announced until late June
[41:43.000 --> 41:50.000]  because they have to write the decision well if they do not strike the whole
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  thing down we are in deep trouble because the whole thing has to be struck
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  down and the fact that Obama argued that through his his his lawyers while
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  lawyers that yes we can also give waivers whoever we want that is even
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  more tyrannical I've already talked a lot about that it's just unprecedented to
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  not only have a government mandate on health care written by the insurance
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  companies it allows the insurance companies and banks that own them to
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  set policy through federal computer systems that will tell doctors and
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  nurses the procedures they can do just like the VA taking that power out of
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  the doctor that knows best at that point what procedure needs to be taken care
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  of and it cuts off the money at certain ages and and Biden wrote in his book
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  we're not going to give grandma eye surgery after 65 and you're not going to
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  get heart surgery you see to go home and die this is their plan this is what
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  they're planning and that rationing of health care is what goes on in Canada
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  and in England and in Europe and in Cuba everywhere they've got this this is
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  for eugenics this is so the eugenicist can decide and so health care isn't a
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  free market thing health care should be completely deregulated buyer beware
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  and you go and get whatever you do research and decide and people will
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  quickly discover who's got the best systems and that will accelerate
[43:18.000 --> 43:25.000]  medicine but no no it's big pharma which are all eugenicist on record who
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.000]  have the regulations written were Bayer for 11 years I always say a decade it
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  was 11 years could ship out in Europe Australia New Zealand Canada the US
[43:37.000 --> 43:46.000]  millions of dosages of factor eight blood product platelets sifted out of
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  blood that they'd mix all the different types together knowing it was coming
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  from prisons Bill Clinton was one of the big ones making money off of it they
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  would sell drugs to the prisoners and they would give the blood every week
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  until some of them died doctors blew the whistles I had them on they got fire
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  bombed oh yeah I got fire bombed robbed fire bombed you know have the
[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  hemophilia society on talking about it in a week later they get robbed this
[44:13.000 --> 44:22.000]  is my life this is the government remember that happened in like 99 I
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  tried to call get those doctors back on they're like nope I'm getting death
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  threats they fire bombed us they robbed the hemophiliac society we're done I
[44:30.000 --> 44:39.000]  gave it to Congress I gave it to the states nobody did anything I'm done that
[44:39.000 --> 44:48.000]  was a doctor was working in the prisons and they knowingly shipped it out to
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  millions of people well as millions of dosages there's hundreds of thousands
[44:53.000 --> 45:01.000]  of people factor 8 that they knew had HIV and multiple forms of hepatitis you
[45:01.000 --> 45:12.000]  name it a death warrant murder and it came out that Bayer knew and said ship
[45:12.000 --> 45:20.000]  it they didn't just do that because they wanted the money do you know about
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  bear pharmaceutical do you know about their history you might want to go look
[45:23.000 --> 45:34.000]  into them yeah Nazis yeah bear and where did they learn everything they knew
[45:34.000 --> 45:44.000]  oh England the eugenicist it's all the eugenicist and that's why yesterday
[45:44.000 --> 45:52.000]  whenever one of my IT people one of six great crew member was called in by the
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.000]  FBI because a year ago he did some websites for the biggest bar owners in
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.000]  town who've been arrested government claims they're involved in narcotics and
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  stuff and they call him in and I said you do whatever you want but if they bring
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  me up and start saying you're a criminal and trying to associate with me look out
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  and sure enough it went into that I'm trying to turn him into some type of
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  informant telling me he's a criminal when he's done nothing that's why I went
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  in there's a lot of nothing I'll just go in there and talk to him and then it
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  turned around to me and that's why I went on air and said don't you dare think
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  about trying to turn my employee into some type of informant for you and then
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  set me up we're looking for that and whether or not they really are criminals
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  I don't know I've got their names I got to look into them all I know is you work
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  for a justice department that ship guns into Mexico that have killed thousands
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  of people conservatively in Mexico hundreds on this side six law enforcement
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  people three board patrol three police last time I checked it's always growing
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  that's what we know and no one got in trouble and the government ships the
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  drugs in on record and just had a piece of equipment or something go out that
[47:08.000 --> 47:20.000]  was where I got some feedback so all of that is going on and so it's like the
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  time the FBI was calling me about some stuff on the message board comments and
[47:25.000 --> 47:34.000]  it's like why are you bringing up the Obama deception to me why I mean you're
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  you're wanting to know about so many made comments on the website if you want to
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  get those records get a subpoena and they did don't why are you using this as a
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  drag net into my life I'm not doing anything wrong even though you guys are
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  constantly passing kangaroo laws to grab as many of us in your net as you can
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  even with all the laws the way they are I sat there this morning and thought is
[47:56.000 --> 48:09.000]  there anything I'm doing wrong and I'm like no speeding it doesn't matter the
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  system will make up whatever they want that's why I'm not for the death penalty
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  anymore I believe child molesters killers need to be executed but you can't trust
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  a government that we've now learned in some cases more than a third of the people
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  on death row are totally innocent and the system knows it came out from a
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  prosecutor in round rock that this guy had been in jail for decades and they knew
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  the killer was but for their careers they just had keep the innocent person in
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  jail and then when it came out they did it this is just north of Austin where I
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  live no one even got in trouble I mean that's why I don't trust any of you
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  that's why I expect the worst because the system wants to make us think we're the
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  bad people and we've all done something wrong
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  meanwhile they're the group that has to be watched they're the group that can't
[49:05.000 --> 49:13.000]  be trusted government is like fire it's a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  you know I see encouraging signs like the judge for the second time in a row
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  saying release Atari there they were totally set up that that militia I knew
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  that day one it's a shaken big setup deal just to demonize to the Second
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  Amendment and freedom and to create an atmosphere of the government waging war
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.000]  on the American people that's a good sign a bunch of states are passing laws or
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  have already passed laws saying police don't secretly arrest citizens don't
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  help the feds in fact arrest feds if you see him doing it kidnapings illegal I
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  mean that's government kidnapping under NDA people are taking action if the
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  Supreme Court rules that this is unconstitutional man I'm you know I
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.000]  want to win I want to turn things around I want to believe the FBI is good I
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.000]  want to believe my local police are good show me show me I haven't seen a lot of
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.000]  that in my life all I see is a system always trying to treat me like I've
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  done something I can't fly to see family and people with my children because I
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  don't want men grabbing my daughters and my sons genitals that's a no-brainer
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  it turned out the TSA has files on me and others Bob Barr's got the intel
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  suing over it and I'm called an extremist and dangerous because I don't
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  want my children molested I mean come on sanity is not a crime legalized
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.000]  freedom and and I you know the Supreme Court did rule the Second Amendment is
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  the Second Amendment they added a little proviso that there could be some
[50:51.000 --> 50:58.000]  regulation but I mean it wasn't a total attack so we can win this thing but we
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.000]  got to recognize good for me folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is

[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  we've seen a lot of announcements the last year or two about world leaders
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  calling for global government and global taxes biden has come out we have a quote
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  coming up the next segment we want to create a global minimum tax which means
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  global standardization that's what the organization of economic cooperative
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  development is also calling for show what they want is to raise taxes globally
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  they say the average tax that they want worldwide is about 85% federal you can
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  look that up of course then they're all mega bankers exempt from it all just like
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  they're exempt from the healthcare mandate so that's how they operate so
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  that is coming up we're going to talk about the police state with fritz spring
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  fire and his research into that coming up the next segment again court hears

[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  in new york heard arguments thursday for a preliminary injunction against the
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  national defense authorization act the bill signed by obama that legislates for
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  the indefinite detention of american citizens without trial just like
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  justices this week asked the old the white house lawyers they said okay you're
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  saying you won't use this mandate to make people eat broccoli but you could
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  under this so let's just take that out they're like no we don't take that out
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  but you said you're not going to use it and you say you're not going to give
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  people waivers anymore but you want to keep that in there you see if something
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  is on the books that's illegal you got to get it off like oh the government
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  wants something on the books that they can roast children but only on blue
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  moons and and only if they wear pink napkins while they do it you know
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  something ridiculous like that it's like well it is in law that the white
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  house can have a barbecue once a year on a blue moon and roast children
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  that guys we pulled the definition of a blue moon there is such a thing as a
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  blue moon two full moons in one month you go so it's on the books you're like
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  we'll take that you can roast children on blue moons off the thing we're not
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  going to use it we're not going to use it we'll take it off then well we might
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  use it that's what they said the supreme court of course they demanded this be
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  in there and went through all the pressure in congress to get it
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  U.S. District Judge Catherine Forrest heard testimony from seven witnesses
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  including MIT professor Noam Chomsky, Pentagon paper sourced Daniel Ellsberg
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  and Pulitzer Prize winning journalist author Middle East expert Chris Hedges
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Hedges himself filed a class action lawsuit claiming that the indefinite
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  detention provision of the legislation otherwise known as the homeland
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  battlefield bill could see him sent to Guantanamo Bay simply for doing his
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  job and at the very least would have a chilling effect from the work of
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  journalists and activists yeah Obama is targeting journalists everywhere
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  and arresting him for talking to whistleblowers that expose crime he has
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  the most secretive administration he's engaged in all these crimes he's
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  spying without warrants on citizens it's all admitted it's all illegal and
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  then what do you get I could spend all day on this mother Jones the rights
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Obama martial law fail no president Obama is not coming to steal your house
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  and take all the food out of your fridge really there's not executive orders
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  to confiscate hoarded food there's not executive orders FEMA expanding the
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  flood plains taking homes there's not government's not raising taxes and
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  bankrupting people the IRS didn't take in homes and their argument is well
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  there's been provisions for decades for martial law he just is updating it
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  yeah not for nuclear attack but for any reason including the threat of
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  emergency and then mother Jones points to WorldNet Daily whitewashing it
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  and points to Michelle Malkin whitewashing it says see even they know
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  no they don't know and I'm not attacking WorldNet Daily the point is
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  they had an article saying well these experts say it's no big deal
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  you know this has been on the books a long time yeah like the Patriot Act
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  wouldn't be used on citizens and now it is been on the books a long time
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  slavery was on the books for hundreds of years does that make it okay
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  finishing the last segment and other Jones saying oh it's been debunked this
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  executive order Obama signed you know it's been around for 60 years he just
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  reauthorized it it's no big deal Alex Jones is bad why even look Michelle
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Malcolm is saying you Jones is wrong Michelle Malcolm I've had it wrong
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  saying that she is for arresting all the Arabs and putting them in concentration
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  camps Muslims that that that that she thinks that all of that is basically
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  reasonable and good what she wrote a book called the case for internment it
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  was reasonable to grab all those Japanese it was reasonable to have them
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  disappear it was reasonable to do all that and take their property see what
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  happens is you don't get told you're right when everything you talk about
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  comes true what what happens is people just say okay they're spying on us
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  without warrants head of the CIA says that okay they're secretly arresting
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  people what's the big deal you're bad you're like no I before you said this
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  would never happen now it's happening you know telling us tortures goods secret
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  arrest Obama says I'm against that secret arrest provision I wanted out turns
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  out he demanded it be in and then only he had the power and then he said he
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  wouldn't sign it and of course he did sign it it's all and so I'm still
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  having debates with people about Obama didn't sign that just like people say
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Bush didn't is it for the assault weapons ban back four or five years ago
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  and I'd say yeah he was shut up you liar and I'd go no he really was for it
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  they just can't believe that their political hero that their political rockstar
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  would be lying to them because they're they're into the con game they're into
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  being con they're into being I've seen people that have gotten involved in
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  Ponzi schemes I've had people friends and even distant family years ago who are
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  like yeah this Nigerian prince wants to give me a million dollars I'm like
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  that's a Nigerian email scam and they're like no it isn't it's real I just give
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  them five thousand I get a million and I'm like you're not gonna you're not
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  gonna get your money back it's a scam please let me show you they're like no
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  you're just jealous that I've got this opportunity I'm like okay and are they
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  ever sorry later that you were right no the more you're right the worse you
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  are the more you're proven right people never say oh wow he was right about
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  that they just move on to the next thing and that's part of this delusional
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  garbage that's going on but what about the NDAA what about the Patriot Act
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  being used against non-terror-related groups like we told you it would what
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  about all the secret arrest what about arresting people for filming police
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  what about the TSA what about the checkpoints everywhere now what about
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  the CIA involved domestically what about the torture what about arresting
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  hundreds of reporters who talk to whistleblowers about government corruption
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  Obama has probably five thousand fold I mean reporters say it's just hundreds
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times what Bush did just going after
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  reporters going after free speech arresting people just everything and
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  real liberals say what you want about them but they're consistent in their
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  ideology and expose Obama for being a fascist globalist like Noam Chomsky
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Chris Hedges and others they're having to sue because they could be arrested
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  for the type of people they talk to under NDAA and his mother Jones come out
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  and talk about their case no mother Jones comes out and says the the rights

[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  school and then so many months a year after that until you're 25 and it'll be
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  basic training at military bases but it's going to be domestic and they'll
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  come out and say I'm lying about that hoping you don't go watch the video on
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  C span I'm sick of it all right the rest of the hour and into the hour next

[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  up on him and he keeps beating all their fake charges so they just have a bunch
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  of informants with big criminal records a thousand feet long they could have an
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  informant show up here and say I robbed a bank and they got juries that are kept
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  98% conviction rate most of them getting narcotics money these federal juries

[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  wars dot com right now fritz since she wanted to get into Nazi Germany and
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  parallels to how Hitler took over to what's happening here today I thought I
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  would just first talk about the incredible police state we live under
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  and because it's been done incrementally it's like well yeah they will secretly
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  arrest you and kill you but that's not a police state look at this crazy guy
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Alex Jones mother Jones says he you know Alex Jones does it doesn't like
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  torture or secret arrest I mean he's alone fritz springmeyer yes thank you
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  for the privilege to be on your show and this is a great topic today because
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  it's something that's affecting all of us it's this police state and I just want
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  to build upon what you've been talking about in the in the last ten minutes
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  which was you you did such a good job of describing all of these things that
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  are happening around us you know like the FEMA core and and the rest if we
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  don't look at history and I I love history I love to go back and and examine
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  things if we don't look at history as they say then we're forced to repeat it
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  we have a good example of how a police state can be created successfully the
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Nazis needed a consensus for their government to work and yet a large
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  share of the German people had strong reservations about the policies of the
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Nazis they didn't believe their cosmology and a lot of their other I were
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  forced fed it yeah and what was the bottom line the main tool that the
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  Nazis were able to establish that gave them the the social control to carry
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  out their policies and what it turns out is is when you examine things and the
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  same dynamics are working today and you've been describing some of them the
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  same dynamics that allowed the Nazis to have success are happening today and
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  those are what I wanted to talk about the the most important tool that they had
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  was denunciation now another popular word would be snitching but snitching has
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  the connotation that you're you're actually talking you're actually
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  informing the police on a real criminal so I want to use the word denunciation
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  and that is where you become an informant where citizens are turned into
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  the eyes and ears of the police state and they start turning in people as a
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  thought police that's what happened in Nazi Germany and how did they manage to
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  get that to happen and Howard how is it happening here and in this country my
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  son in 1990 was going to a Protestant school and I found out that he was
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  secretly being taught in the classroom in a Christian Procule school
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  nonetheless to spy on his parents and when I asked the teacher well who's
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  who started all of this she said well she got her training at mama teachers
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  college at the teachers college here in Oregon and that's how they train the
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  teachers so even in Christian schools the teachers are being trained and
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  certified by the state and they already for quite a few years have been
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  training our students to spy on their on their their adults having been in
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  prison I'm very conversant with the prison population and I can categorically
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  without a doubt say that the majority of convictions the majority of
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  indictments and convictions being done in this country are being done on the
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  basis of tip-offs denunciation snitching it is not done by police investigation
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  they have they have child molesters and murderers who will go call out a
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  preacher with no record in the jury sends them to jail I mean they use
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  professional liars who are known criminals to testify right there was
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  even a company to help them do that it was called conviction consultants
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  incorporated you would rent a rat and the government would pay these these
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  rats about quarter million dollars to come in and lie through this this
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  company conviction consultants yeah that's how they do I mean I mean they
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  could folks you have to understand this system has no credibility they I mean
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  the Dallas police have been caught just pulling people over throwing bags of
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  chalk in their back of their car randomly to take their property they're

[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  never been with anything less than a nine so fine the author of bloodlines of
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  the Illuminati is our guest fritz spring mire joins us and then look at this
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  little headline here the Atlantic the hero that's right Rob Jacobson
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  earlier brought me the Atlantic this is like the establishment liberal
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  publication they sent one of their head guys down here a few years ago they
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  never did an article on me they just wanted to check me out but i i met
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  and talked to the guy for about four hours i'm not going to even get into
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  it the point is is that it says that he's the hero ben Bernanke saved the
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  global economy so why does everybody hate him and then you open it up to
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  the third page that has the rundown of what's in the magazine the Atlantic
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  and it's all about how great Rahm Emanuel is and how he's saving us i
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  mean aren't we lucky to have been Bernanke and and other heroes like Rahm
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Emanuel i mean what a joke he fronts for the private Federal Reserve that
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  engineered the global implosion by design and created the derivatives i mean
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  he is should be in chains shows should one of the other big architects of
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  this corzine John Corzine me caught perjuring caught stealing masses of
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  money worse than burning made off don't get in trouble and then they have
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  their publications tell us how great they are and the average nitwit walk
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  around a grocery store sees this and thinks the hero i mean that's like
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  saying Jeffrey Dahmer is a hero so over the top this is a short segment
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  for its long one coming up please continue with the point you were
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  getting to about the snitch society i don't think people know that it's come
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  out that police departments are even telling how their officers how to
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  lie on the stand about people and i guess until you've experienced it you
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  just don't realize how evil the system's getting i'm not saying all police do
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  it or all systems do but i'll guarantee you and it's on record the FBI and
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  others certainly do true how did the Nazis achieve their remarkable
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  success in getting this consensus how well when they took over power when
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  they were voted into office they started applying brutality and terror the
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  police now these police forces were were officers in general that were
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  inherited from the Weimar Republic they weren't Nazis but a lot of people
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  will follow whatever they think is illegal government so you have a lot
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  of people today that don't realize how illegal our government is and how so
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  many of the laws and things that they're doing are illegal so they blindly
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  think that whatever's been said they need to follow so what you had in Nazi
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  Germany was it wasn't important that the that the rank and file of the
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  government and the Gestapo believed most of the Gestapo were actually not
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  hardcore Nazis what they were were police officers that believed in following
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  the legal government and so what you have people doing is cooperation or in
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  German gleischaltung this gleischaltung this cooperation is all that they
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  need so it's more important that the government has a party line that's
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  that they establish a party line because they know that a lot of people just
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  like today will cooperate with that whether they wholeheartedly believe
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  it or whether they have reservations or not they will excuse that following
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  it by saying well that's that's whose boss and and that's the will of the
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  people you know we voted Hitler into power blah blah blah when I went to
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  West Point I was shocked because it was at the tail end of the Vietnam war and
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I from this wasn't a scientific poll but from talking with my classmates the
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  majority of them did not believe in the Vietnam war you know the Vietnam war
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  was very unpopular even with even with the officer cadets but what was
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  scary to me was is all of those classmates that were against the war
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  were quite willing to go over and be officers in Vietnam if that's what
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  their orders were in other words they're setting their their conscience up on
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  a shelf with the excuses this is what I've been told to do that that's the
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  little fright that's right it's I was just following orders syndrome well the
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  Nuremberg code shows we're gonna come back and get into this because it's the
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  heart of the problem we face that just following orders doesn't doesn't cut
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  it Fritz Springmeyer is our guest author of bloodlines the Illuminati we're

[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  following orders when it's clearly corrupt and immoral is the road to absolute

[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  he's breaking down how the Nazis were able to do a couple things bully the
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  general public into shutting up via fear and peer pressure of being shouted
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  down but also get the military and the police structure to follow orders
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  incrementally and they firebomb the Reichstag building shortly after Hitler
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  got elected and then use that to get more power he didn't get elected with a
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  majority vote though he got into one of the houses of parliaments because they
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  have a president and a chancellor and then after the Reichstag and von Hindenburg
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  was sick it had a stroke then they merged the two and he became the furor to
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  keep everybody safe from the terrorist that blew up the capital blow up the
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  capital become supreme ruler so that's why you've always got to look what
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  somebody blows up the capital okay who stands to gain from this one but
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  Hermann Göring was there within minutes of course he was the one running around
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  with the troops pouring gasoline everywhere it later was declassified
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  running around to catch the bad guy a homeless person they drugged and had
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  naked screaming and yelling who supposedly broke into the whole capital
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  and poured gasoline and and incendiary weapons everywhere and again it's this
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  following orders Hitler also created the SA that was like a goon force of not
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  really police and military because they couldn't get the police and military
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  early on to do all the stuff they wanted who would just go beat you up as a
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  gang or who would then enforce on you and of course he called those guys
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  after he fully came to power and the establishment actually like that because
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  they were disgusted by the TSA type folks but that's what this is all about and
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  they just create a culture look at all the cop shows all the movies where the
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  cops are always good the FBI is always good there might be government
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  corruption but it's a rogue group no the people on top are the crooks then you
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  do have good people in police and FBI at the lower levels generally but their
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  compartmentalized need to know and look at Fast and Furious look at what that
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  shows us shipping guns into Mexico the media is like why wasn't just selling
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  them at gun shops were shipping into Mexico was giving them to drug gangs in
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  Florida it was giving them to groups in Illinois and Texas and running
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  stings with fake IDs that were real IDs but fake issued by the government to
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  shut down people legally selling guns they just want to shut down good people
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  they want to dominate going back to Fritz Springmeyer you were bringing this up
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  because of all the subjects you could have raised today I think this is a good
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  one you picked but why raise this point well I'm building upon there's a
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  whole bunch of things that you said that I can build upon go one of the
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  early earlier things that you mentioned was about magazines and so forth and
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  that's what happened in Nazi Germany to is that they used so-called public
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  magazines newspapers to to start the social control if you were a German
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  woman and you had sex with a Jewish man why then the local newspaper that was
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  run by the Nazi Party would come out and they would call you a shunt mage
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  can which means the sinning woman a woman of shame and they would print
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  your name in the paper well how many of us have gone through the grocery store
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  and as you're going through the checkout stand look up there at the gossip
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  rags you see you see the same things happening here is that people are are
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  being surrounded now they have magazines everywhere and weekly is called busted
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  and stuff where they put all the citizens arrested not convicted in there so
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  they can be publicly pilloried exactly they're getting as used to this
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  gladiatorial event where it's entertaining to see our fellow citizens
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  pilloried yes exactly all going along the same program that that brought the
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Nazi success if we look at a couple statistics of the Gestapo it's very
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  revealing if we look at Dusseldorf which was a city in Germany the
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  statistics for the Gestapo from 1933 to 1944 only 15% of the legal or their
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  their police proceedings that they would start were were started on the basis
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  of police actually seeing something happen all the rest was based upon
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  reports from snitches and and other agencies public agencies that would
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  snitch for them that's why even when they report I saw a new article about
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  this today neighbor sees a gun they just go ahead and send the police to
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  somebody's house and the guys and they're cleaning the gun is garage and
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  they'll shoot them or they'll tell them come out and then call a SWAT team
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  and then they're like but my guns not illegal it's like it doesn't matter
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  we're you know somebody called the doctor called you weren't vaccinating your
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  children well there's no logins that well the state police are still here
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  we're gonna have to take a child in the custody they may be in danger but
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  there's no law that have a shot we're taking your child well where's the
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  warrant we're taking your child again they're just getting us used to not
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  following a law and tattle tailing is taken like like a golden sacrament from
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  heaven because they want to encourage this the only power you have as a
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  citizen is to snitch and that is a godlike power now that must be worshiped
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  yes so well said I was watching television I don't watch a lot of
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  television but I saw this lady that was there was a news story on her she was
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  being heralded as a heroine in the television news and what did she done
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  well there had been a group of men in a car that had driven up to a gas station
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  they were dressed like any Americans but they looked their complexion looked
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  Arab and she called the police because these Arab looking
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  complexed men had driven up to the gas station and she was being heralded as a
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  heroine I mean talk about something that's so blatantly against what this
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  country was founded upon the declaration independence the Constitution they
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  were they they were totally opposite of where they're taking people where you're
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  you're a hero for calling in someone because they look like they're Arabs
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  wow another interesting thing that I noticed from history because I was
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  studying Warsaw Warsaw was a city in Poland where the Nazis established what
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  was called a ghetto they moved Jews from all over Poland and other places into
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Warsaw and then later they moved those Jews to concentration camps and I would
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  ask people the listeners out there how many Gestapo do you think it took to
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  move something like and I don't remember the exact statistics but ball ballpark
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  figures may be a half million Jewish people out of the Warsaw ghetto and in
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  in a whole series of moves how many well it was only a dozen something like a
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  dozen Gestapo police were all that were needed and the reason why is is because
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  all they did was oversee what the local Jewish police did the local Jewish police
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  that the Jewish people with that's right that's what George that's what George
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Thoros was in Romania and he did an interview 14 years ago 15 years ago for
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  60 minutes and by the way they've removed it everywhere you can find the
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  transcripts and short clips and he said he it's one of the best times of his
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  life as a quote and then that's hailed and then when Glenn Beck dare criticize
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  him as being a collaborator with the Nazis the ADL said that was anti-Semitic
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  so see if you actually helped Nazis round people up you are loving and of the
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  goodness but if you're not a Nazi then the Jewish groups say you are I mean again
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  it's incredible it's absolutely incredible just how evil this system is
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  and but it was also the compliance I've watched the footage of communist
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  Seventh-day Adventists so many groups Jews I mean they just killed the Russians
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  and all of them well the Russians started fighting back because they figured
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  out hey this guy first they thought it was a liberator they hated Stalin so
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  much and they thought well this is even worse but you've all seen the footage
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  of the men would put their hat in their hand and and and say thank you to the
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  soldiers and running to be shot the women would walk in with their babies and
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  be shot and then I'm a weirdo because that's not happening with me see that's
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  not happening and you see people not resisting there actually was some resistance
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  in the Warsaw ghetto there wasn't much resistance against Pol Pot in Cambodia
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  the good news is Fritz five million guns a month being sold an all-time record
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  and people say it's because they don't trust the government so I don't think
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  it's gonna go that way in America Fritz yeah there there have been some
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  positive things happen like back in May 2000 in Canada the people discovered
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  that there was this huge data bank that Canada's human resources was keeping
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  on people their human resources department they gave it they're giving
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  it this long name longitudinal labor force files that's so typical of our
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  government to come up with these large names anyway the Canadian people within
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  that month got that stopped and shut down so there have been instances of
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  where the people said no no we're not going to take this and you can look
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  through history and see those those events happening and of course we're
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  not taught we're not taught the class risk taking 101 when we go to school
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  so how do we take risk you know how do we step out and and not just be reactive
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  but how do we be proactive like you are being on your show you know well first
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  we have to get beyond our fears because fears become self-fulfilling prophecies
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  you know defensive thinking is rooted in the past we have to move forward be
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  proactive and we need to have faith we need to have hope these are the kind of
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  things that I really want to to encourage people to have is faith and hope you
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  know so that they'll move forward in there we're forced to take risk in life
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  you know that all of us are forced to take risk so so what do we do do we
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  we run back to our fears and try to have security you know Helen Keller said
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  that security is mostly just a superstition you know it doesn't exist in
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  nature she said she said life is a daring adventure and I dare to say you
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  know that's what you and I have been embarked on is a daring adventure you
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  know and there we have our we have our rough moments I know that you you've
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  had your rough moments I've had my rough moments but I would rather do that
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  than to crawl on my knees and lick the hand and kiss the feet of the people
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  that that want to to rule us with this tyranny
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  friends just continuing here do you think we can turn the tide against this
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  what's your gut because I do see people waking up but I don't see I don't see
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  them really then taking action though and and and by that I mean we need to
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  boldly call this system out and and totally discredit it because just like
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  they want to shout us down it is a battle of wills they're so immoral and so
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  openly criminal that if we just expose them and and and say no and resist with
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  non-compliance they're not going to get away with it they need our compliance
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  exactly they do need the general public's compliance if they're going to
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  operate effectively and that's why they continue to have the charade that we
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  elect our presidents we don't select nor do we elect our presidents it's the
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  process has been totally hijacked but as long as we continue to to be fooled
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  into thinking that we select these criminals to run this this country
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  people will continue like the church oh well we have to obey the legal
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  authorities well excuse me but these authorities are no longer legal they're
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  illegal you know to to put me in the prison they probably broke 20 or 30 laws
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  easily you know laws that carried far more time in prison than what they they
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  put me in prison for but nobody's going to call people to task for what was
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  being done you know jury tampering blah blah blah you know but the thing of it
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  is is people need to to stand up and and be good people good people will stand
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  up and and you know maybe you're asking me are we going to be successful I
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  don't know if we are or aren't but I do know that we have a choice to make as
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  to what kind of person we're going to be are you know are we are we going to
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  be the punk that's that's a prison term are we going to be punked by these
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  these power hungry people are we going to have the dignity of being decent
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  human people that decent people that say hey this is not right and it isn't
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  right and like you say calling them out there understand the dynamic of power
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  here and I know you know Alex is that power generally demolishes the user's
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  character and so it corrupts total power totally corrupts and we see these
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  people some of them may have had some decency to them before they got power
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  but afterwards even these petty bureaucrats you know they that's my next
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  point knowing the Illuminati and what they're into at the deepest levels
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  running this I know they're in control of society they're trying to get greater
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  control they're not in total control but they're not in control of themselves
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  and from what I've read what I've researched what I've seen but a lot of
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  experts have said is that the Illuminati of 50 years ago 100 years ago was more
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  focused more dedicated more professional and that there's been blowback and more
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  careful I would add blowback of the drugging and the electromagnetic and
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  this culture of death and at the highest levels of the elite are becoming more
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  and more decadent they don't have a lot of really hardworking people at the top
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  anymore like David Rockefeller and that's why we're seeing such crazy GMO
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  getting out and even hurting the elite reactors 9 out of 10 leaking the elite
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  don't care you know they wouldn't let the troops use DU until 1990 now they let
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  them use it it's killing them I mean they've really gotten a craziness to
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  them now where they're just acting like they want to destroy everything is there
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  a method to that madness yes there is and you're correct there's a lot of madness
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  behind it that's one reason why in their plans they plan to use technocrats
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  people that are highly skilled you know your your time your scientist who doesn't
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  care who's funding them as long as he has a job to do his research and these
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  technocrats are going to run the new world order form
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  because they're just there they're not looking at the bigger picture and thinking
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  what is what am I subscribing to and and that goes back to Nazi Germany again
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  most of the Gestapo police were not hardcore Nazi party members now
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  eventually they got integrated into the Nazi party but even then the majority
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  of them didn't have their heart in in what the Nazi party I've read in most of
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  the major mainline German reports I mean this isn't propaganda it's what they
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  themselves wrote Heinrich Himmler and others when they were would go out into
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  a death camp would vomit and and would throw up and not want to see it Hitler
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  never wanted to look at it either they just scientifically said we're going to
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  do this and then ordered people to do it and that most the top Nazis would
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  would gag and throw up but but it was all part of acting tough and they were
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  willing to do it and they were punching the buttons I want all you phony
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  environmentalists to know something your carbon taxes will kill billions of

[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  the top professor on on the subject and he said that he would do a written request
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  interview but he is hearing impaired he's completely deaf and so he couldn't
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  obviously come on the radio show and talk to us about it I do intend to do that

[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  building upon the social control one of the effects of the social control has
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  been to hide the a lot of the solutions that would give people hope that the
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  torus is is a donut shape and it's the shape of energy fields like the magnetic
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  field tornadoes the galaxy I would go so far as to say the shape of the universe
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  is a torus the torus has been used by inventors to create free energy
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  machines but all of this has been suppressed another thing that's been
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  suppressed by their social control even to the extent of murdering people that
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  come up with these alternative medical solutions there there there are there's
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  a lot of research there's research into how to reverse the aging process by
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  supporting the telomers that's the end of the DNA I want to hear that back in
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  60 seconds hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  wisdom to spot savings opportunity and recognize risk saving means to make

[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  all right we're into hour number three dr. Doug Rocky's gonna pop in for two segments
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  we're trying to save lives here they're now saying if you if you're dying of
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  Fukushima radiation you're mentally ill that guys that's from two days ago we
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  reprint me Paul Watson's article that links to the Japanese news on that one
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  he joins us that's another example and then Max Kaiser's coming on of how the
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  system ridicules you the Soviets did it the Nazis did it they use medical systems
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  as a tyranny so it's admitted there's radiation poisoning but because you are
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  trying to get medical help they're just gonna say you're mentally ill and
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  and that's on record they said we were mentally ill that there was high levels
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  of radiation and they got caught lying so it's another example that I want to
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  have you back up in a few weeks to just do an hour on solutions and get into all
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  the suppressed technologies and things but as you mentioned decades ago they
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  now admit they can reverse the aging process in insects and rodents and
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  humans the elites how far advanced are they technologically from your sources
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  inside the Illuminati than that we know because it's obvious they've got a
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  breakaway civilization but what can we prove Fritz well I know of cases and I
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  don't know the reason why is it's very selective but there are selective
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  individuals that are actually living hundreds of years they're living
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  transgenerational but this is this is a very guarded secret and I don't think
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  I've ever said that is said what I just said publicly because they're they're
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  pretty sensitive about that particular issue so they do have and and actually
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  from from what I know there are things out there to give us healthy lives we
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  should all be living to at least a hundred years old productively but of
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  course as you so aptly demonstrate they keep poisoning us and they keep taking
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  away our nutrition from our food and from our soil and they're they're working
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  over time to try to to steal our health and it seems like our culture is
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  cooperating with that again we had that glycaltum that help the Nazis carry out
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  their programs and agendas yeah I'd love to be back thanks for having me Alex
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  you bet get more into the fact that they said that 96% of DNA was junk of
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  course they knew that wasn't the case that's it's an antenna even mainline
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  science is now saying that right right they years ago they ridiculed the
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  telemers on the end of the DNA and I was really upset because I have faith in God
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  and I know that he didn't design this body and create something that was
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  worthless in there and I didn't know what the answer were for the telemers but
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  finally three scientists got a Nobel Prize for for regressing the age
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  regressed mice from 80 human years back to 50 human years showing that the
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  telemers could be supported and they they discovered what the telemers were all
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  about there's other things stem cell research I could go on and on about
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  different medical advances but the general public is not being told about
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  and I just encourage the listeners are listeners out there are your listeners
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  are like diamonds diamonds in the rough and I just encourage them to on their
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  own start investigating all of the suppressed technology and all these
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  suppressed medical methods that could bring them help them become self
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  sufficient and taking care of themselves that's right get out of the system and
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  that means mentally start investigating don't even believe what we're saying
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  just start investigating on your own start being wily be skeptical thank you
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  so much for it spring mire one lines the Illuminati available at info wars.com

[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched down the best

[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  medicine for over 20 years and both civilian military personnel I'm gonna
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  have to stop right there it just goes on and on the point is the they knew it was
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  deadly and don't use it even up to 1990 and didn't use it suddenly they started
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  using it now whenever people are joining the military I get hateful letters
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  and calls occasionally people saying how dare you there's no radiation the army
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  told him or the Marines told them they wouldn't do that to my boy also get
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  letters every week and calls you've heard them yeah I'm 27 just got lung
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  cancer kidney failure it's DU VA says take prozac I'm mentally ill Alex you know
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  five years ago I could carry a pack 40 miles now I can hardly walk I'm going
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  on dialysis Dr. Rocky gets these calls every day and he's the expert so
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  they've gone from this is deadly don't use it until now just don't even have
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  any procedures it's wonderful for you use it at local shooting ranges and use
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  it in concrete use it in machinery parts it's everywhere now we've got just
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  10 minutes here and then five minutes the next segment I want to give him the
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  floor briefly what is DU doctor and and why are they proliferating it shoes
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  but then I want to shift gears the real reason you're here we're trying to save
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  wives exposing this the Japanese news is reporting and we had a prison planet
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  dot com article on it two days ago fear of radiation treated as psychiatric
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  disorder in Fukushima despite proven track record of official deception the
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  kids are dropping dead people are bleeding they're dying they admit it's many
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  times worse than Chernobyl but they're not giving him treatment and saying go
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  on prozac so I guess they're taking what they do to our military heroes and now
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  doing it in Japan this is beyond madness Dr. Rocky what do you think of all
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  this it's total madness a week ago last Wednesday I went to the Department of
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  Veteran Affairs at Danville for my own medical care with the PTSD doctors said
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  knowing full well exposed to depleted ram neurotoxic effects confirmed hot and
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  all this stuff and exactly what he wanted to issue with prozac and I said you
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  can't have you ever looked at my records you can't issue prozac when you guys
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  are treating me for masses masses final injuries and fibromyalgia with pain
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  that's it's crazy the Department of Veteran Affairs came out with a brand
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  on golf wheel the sense is so new that I don't think think is right and in the
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  segment here on depleted uranium I have to read this year quote-for-quote
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  because it's incredible quote the purpose of depleted uranium surveillance
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  program is determine do you related health effects and expose soldiers and
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  study the medical and surgical management fragments three thousand one hundred
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  ninety-two urine samples have been screened for do you with four veterans
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  found to be positive screen the 79 veterans with document do you exposure
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  have been found every two years since 1993 better to travel the Baltimore VA
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  medical center have a complete medical examination the extensor laboratory
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  studies to include urine see a blood your uranium chromosomal analysis and
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  neurocognitive testing I can't even begin to describe I mean this is a brand
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  new report that still follows the Los Alamos memorandum that I was given in
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  March of 1991 when I was ordered to clean up the mess by General Schwartz
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  Klopp but at the same time order to lie in all our reports here they're saying
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  79 veterans have been followed every two years since 1993 I have 424
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  individuals on my team I was responsible for including a hundred 24
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  friendly fire as of 2000 in the gent GAO reports they don't even follow up on
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  51 to this day I cannot I repeat I have been unable to get medical care for my
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  primary team members and friendly fire guys that we know were exposed whose
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  medical care I ordered in March and April 1991 and then they come down and
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  say there's only four people I got I got over a dozen positive reports on my
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  desk right now to include mine include Denise Nichols our nurse and
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  everybody else and I got one back the other day from another guy current
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  time they had just did the test here locally again and Melissa McDermott
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  came back and said yeah you're hot for DU but it came out of your diet from
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  your food and water in the area when I talked to the assistant to the director
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  of Danville VA Medical Center they totally acknowledged yeah we all know
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  there's no depleted uranium in any food or water around here there's none that
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  should do their force base but this is what they do to get out from it it all
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  comes down to it depleted uranium is the way the department energy gets rid of
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  the majority of us by products waste by products for every 100 pounds it goes
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  into the enrichment process for the Department of Energy over 99 pounds of
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  pure waste and all of that has to go someplace so they came up with the idea
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  let's make uranium additions which are not coated they're solid radioactive
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  radioact materials consisting of radioactive isotopes 238 235 234
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  uranium 236 plutonium neptunium namerica and as a consequence when we look at
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  the health effects it's staggering because they say there are no health
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  effects but then and you've got the documents you put them up on your
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  website when you go to the internal VA reports they totally confirm them when
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  you go to our medical records they totally confirm them when you go to the
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Department of Defense's Pentagon briefing on depleted uranium by Colonel J. Edgar
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  Wacky they totally confirm it all but that's my question to you because I've
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  heard you on my show and I've seen documentaries where you broke down in
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  the past there were documents as you know in the late 40s early 50s where they
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  looked at using DU and said don't because it has too much blowback on the troops
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  it's a soft kill and then what changed then in the early 90s to go ahead and
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  say let's just use it there was a lie about the combat capability of the
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Iraqi military and how effective their armor was and so this is where all ties
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  together because oh they said they had Russian reactive right they had Russian
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  reactive armor that was immune to anything that we had so they had to use DU
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  okay now this is the screwy part not only did General Schwarzkopf assign me by
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  name which he was ordered to do by the Pentagon God had to have a hand at this
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  Pentagon's matter blue blazes at me that to clean up the DU mess but when we
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  went to clean that up the next project they assigned me to was to capture
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  equipment so I did the assessment on the Iraqi Soviet armor and all this stuff
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  and what I found out is we could have taken it out with a standard M-60
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  machine gun you know basically anything we had you know standard rifle because
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  it was just basically nothing there so they had that and then we keep coming
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  on down so then we you know use it in Somalia we used it in the Balkans 94 95
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  we use the Balkans 99 then low and behold we set up all these current wars
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  Iraq and Afghanistan we know in Afghanistan Afghanistan the Taliban who
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  were ordered to overthrow because they wouldn't go along with the Unicode
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  pipeline deal that's why we went in there did not have armor of any type
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  and yet we used the plated uranium munitions and I've got the shipping
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  documents were we shipped incredible amounts of Afghanistan and obviously the
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  health effects on the Afghanis and all the other I forget the tonnage in all
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  these wars it's some astronomical it was 300 probably 300 to 70 tons during
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  desert storm we know from 30 to 40 tons of 94 95 in the Balkans I don't know
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  how much of Somalia in 93 because and by the way the proofs in the pudding as
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  you know doctor I've got London Guardian headlines lands at 14 times
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  increase in cancers and birth defects in Iraqi cities in the last few years
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  that were bombed with these munitions and you see the same numbers in our
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  troops it is it is an it is a nightmare level now shifting out of that they
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  tell you take prozac your mentally ill if you've got to you poisoning as you
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  talked about now they're telling the Fukushima people no medical treatment
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  here's prozac now the same thing let's understand but Fukushima and all the
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  contamination over that's a nuclear reactor went sour and everything else
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  but the standard guidelines for cleaning up that radiological mess outside
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  inside the reactor core is the army regulation that I wrote 700-48 the
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  guidelines for maximum exposure to anybody should be exposed after that
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  event for anything isn't a technical both in 913 under 278 that Rich
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  Blizzard originally wrote back and you know the before desert storm and then
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  we redid after our DU test in Nevada so it's all there what we have now is
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  incredible amount of radioactive materials spread all over from combat
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  destroying all of these other equipment they have full radioactive elements that
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  come parts of them then we have all these reactors that have gone nuts and
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  that all of that waste has gone up in the atmosphere around even here at the
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  University of Illinois in the local paper the university was bragging how the
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  scientists measured the radioactive particulates from Japan coming down on
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  Champaign or Band Illinois the University of Illinois and say we can measure
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  it we can measure it and I'm going then you got a problem and now you've got all
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  of this waste coming across the ocean I think Hawaii is the first day the first
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  company you know first oh there's just all those houses and everything with
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  plutonium on it that it'll never you know lose its radioactivity it's hitting
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  the California coast and they're like hey don't worry about it yeah and then
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  you know we brought all the contamination from Camp Doha back to Idaho
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  you know kiss off the potato Idaho crap because we got all the DU contamination
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  that we were ordered to clean up then we were that I helped write the plan for it
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  that the Kuwaitis said take it out of our country take it out of our country so
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  they put it in Boise Idaho congratulations Idaho stay there I want to find out
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  about this rebranding of radiation is good for you hello I'm Alex Jones my

[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  Dr. Doug Rockies our guest we just got him for 5 more minutes doctor the main reason
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  I got you on is because this is hiding in plain view as you know it's an
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  ongoing holocaust of our military and others it's proliferating into every
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  facet of life the FDA and EPA are raising the levels of what they say is
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  safe radiation in some cases a hundred thousand times with one isotope it's a
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  new attitude and we all saw you pundits come out and say radiation is good for
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  you and culture people ought to be thankful at Fukushima and now they're
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  throwing them in mental wards when they come in with blood coming out of their
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  you know gums and stuff why is the is why is the elite what has changed in the
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  global power structure to where in 86 they admitted Chernobyl was bad this is
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  bigger than that they say it's no big deal they wouldn't let you use DU until
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  1990 now they're proliferating and everywhere I mean what is the mindset
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  of these people why is this happening well power control and money and
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  everything else that just absolutely complete arrogance I mean it's it's
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  like the same thing would happen in the 60s the better living through chemistry
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  the American chemical side and now we got incredible things and I mean there's
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  the discussions on all the radio TV and everything this last week is how all
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  these children are come up with all these incredible brain and neurological
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  diseases and everything else I stick it's all the chemical exposure we've gone
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  to war we've destroyed infrastructure we lose all these chemical biological
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  radiological materials in our everyday life we use them in warfare we blow it
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  up we contaminate everything well the only way they can avoid liability is say
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  hey it's all good for you and you gotta believe us because we're your daddy and
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  we know what's best for you in the meantime people are sick and dying
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  you know I you guys you've been incredible Alex I've got another one too
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  there's a new documentary out and again this is from your one of your guys
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  you know on the other side Gary Knowles put out a new brand new documentary called
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  American Veterans discarded and forgot incredible this is brand new updated
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  and everything going on I need to get him on about that oh it's really really good
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  I just reviewed it and help put out the letter for centered out this week but
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  we're seeing the same thing over and over again we did a documentary that
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  just came out a few months ago from France from the French they looked at
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  Pelusia they compared the health effects of the Iraqis and compared the health
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  effects with all of our soldiers kid at Port Bright North Carolina they're all
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  got the same thing they're all dying from the same thing the better I can't show
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  you how many soldiers I know special forces you name it who are 30 years old
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  35 and whose lives are just shot I mean they I mean you don't want to talk about
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  yourself but I mean you've how many surgeries is it over 30 right I gave
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  up counting I mean I gave up counting on the kidney surgeries while I was
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  director of the DU project and they're going Doug how do you do this research
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  how do you put it all together you ought to be dead and so sick you're I mean
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  you're in and out of the hospital you're either in the field blowing stuff up and
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  clean it up or trying to figure out a clean it up where you're getting the
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  hospital and surgery it's nuts but you know what's bad is I was ordered to get
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  this taken care of our brief general Shinseki you know in written briefings he
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  issued the order mandating thorough medical care and training and viral or
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  remediation while he was commanded as the general he signed the army regulations
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  as the commanding general for the Chief Staff of the Army now he's secretary of
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  the VA and he acts as if there's no problem I don't know about this well how
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  can you not be the secretary and not know there's a problem and not sure
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  medical care when as the army general you were the guy that ordered it the same
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  thing with general peak before him the previous secretary he had also ordered
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  all the medical care based on my input and he also became secretary of the VA
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  and yet there's nobody sick there's no problem we got three quarters of a
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  million of OIF OEF OMD veterans already in VA medical care 15% of the active
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  duty force in the army is not deployed because they're medically disaster and
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  you've got a one million backlog of military veterans seeking medical care
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  from the VA at the time and yet all you hear it's broke we can't do it we don't
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  know how to do it they know what to do they have no intention to do it because
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  how do you tell the American public we want to war for no reason and we've got
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  millions of US military casualties and because of what we did we have millions
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  of non-combatant casually children that suffer because of our illegal actions
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  well it's it's it's like a gun that shoots both ways you shoot the guy on
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  the other side and it shoots the other way and shoots you in the head but it's
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  delayed soft kill and by then the bankers and people have scurried off with
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  the money but it's it's blowing back on them I mean the elites aren't getting
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  out of this these really are arrogant crazy people like Corzine making 40 to
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  one bets we find out world leaders aren't taking the vaccines world leaders
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  are not eating GMO we find out the generals wanted to stay in different
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  facilities and not areas that have been hit by DU they know and they are just
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  absolute scum I called the military last week because everything's heating up
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  in Syria Iran and you know Pakistan and Afghanistan and what you tell them sir
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  I told them they can't do this again they got a stoop they got a complaint with
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  everything and it was kind of like oh don't go away you know it's like don't
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  tell us what we already know don't tell us what we always agreed on because when
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  we did the work we put everything together we were there you know heaven sent
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  but when we had to act and do something to correct it nobody wants to talk about it
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:54.000]  they don't care they don't care we're on the March the Empire's on the run thank

[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:20.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  alright we are back live we are lining up Max Kaiser right now from France
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  while we're getting him on the horn
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  I just want to go back to this Atlantic Monthly Magazine article
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  the hero
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  Ben Bernacke saved the global economy so why does everyone hate him
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  so now they don't deny the fact that everybody hates him
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  and everybody hates the private Federal Reserve and knows it's the occupational force
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  but now we've got to be told that he's our savior when that's a total lie
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  the villain the left hates him the right hates him even more
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  but Ben Bernacke saved the economy and has navigated masterfully through the most trying times
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  the globalist maneuvered us and bragged the economist brags
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  ooh Goldman Sachs has conquered Europe without a shot being fired
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  what Napoleon and Hitler couldn't do
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  oh financial times of London I mean their memos are public it's all a big joke
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  MF Global had John Corzine former head of Goldman Sachs
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  ripping people off
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  they're the ones devaluing the currency
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  they're the ones that created the derivatives
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  they're the ones that called all the shots and got rid of Glass-Steagall
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  all of them
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  these guys are bigger crooks than Bernie Madoff
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  and Ken Lay, carbon taxes all of it
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  this guy's recommending tax increases and austerity
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  to put the economy into a cardiac arrest
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  so they can buy it all up
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  and Max Kaiser told us a year before the Iceland implosion
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  that he was at the bar there in Reykjavik and the bankers were bragging to him
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  because he's a former big shot stockbroker TV host
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  they know who he is
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  traded and worked with George Soros' son
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  a few months ago he's in Greece
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  I know six months ago now
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  walks into the hotel
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  I went and looked it up later
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  Steve Jobs was actually blogging for
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  not Steve Jobs
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  Forbes
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  Steve Forbes was actually blogging for Forbes
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  bragging about how great it was to buy up everything
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  well Max Kaiser walks into him and he's like Max
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  it's wonderful
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  we're imploding their economy and buying everything up
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  and then shelling the public that the global
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  corporations and the global banks
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  are loaning money to Greece
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  and that Greece was bad
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  Greece had Goldman Sachs operatives
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  their president and others
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  shine them on to debt that wasn't theirs
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  the derivatives, the too big to fail
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  now they're sending the very
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  minions of the same banking structure in
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  to be the presidents and prime ministers in Italy
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  and in Greece
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  and they tried it in Iceland
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  the Icelanders said no
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  and then it turned out surprise surprise
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  90 plus percent of the debt they were being told
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  was theirs they had to pay for wasn't even their debt
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  the British news was calling the Icelanders
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  terrorists and saying Icelanders won't be allowed
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  to fly to England if their government
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  doesn't pay us the money they owe our banks
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  turned out those banks criminally had
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  hijacked Iceland
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  this is all on record but
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  the corporate whore media
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  instead tells us that there are heroes
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  they went in and threatened the martial law
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  this is on record
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  if Congress didn't give them a blank check
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  in the banker bailout that was really a banker
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  coup d'etat
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  which is French for coup d'etat
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  it's an attempted joke there
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  from one of my favorite children's movies
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  Hop
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  I like Carlos man he's a good villain
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  he's the point is that
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  this is so insane
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  and now they want a global minimum tax
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  we're going to play that coming up here
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  in just a little while
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  Joe Biden's called for this global tax
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  but I have an article here
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  from the supposed left
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  from mother Jones attacking yours truly
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  the rights Obama martial law fail
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  and it goes on to say he isn't doing anything scary
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  there's no NDA, there's no torture
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  there's no taking executive orders for nuclear war
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  and saying for any civil or economic emergency
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  they can arrest everybody
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  I mean that's what it says
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  but they had it on the books before
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  yeah he's just expanding it
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  there's no TSA sticking their hands down your pants
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Alex Jones is a bad man
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  and Bernanke's a hero
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000]  okay Max Kaiser you've exposed them
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  as the world's greatest terrorist
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  what do you think of the Atlantic telling us
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Bernanke is a hero
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  and Goldman Sachs and Rahm Emanuel
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  that's also in there are heroes
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  the whole thing is, I mean
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  this guy gave birth to the planet
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  did you know the sun comes out in the morning
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  Max Kaiser because of them?
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  yeah well I get into the
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  machinations you know
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  I like to look at the actual
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  banking crimes
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  as they are being commuted
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  because when I was working on Wall Street
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  I was engaged in many of these
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  tactics myself
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  so it's always fun to see how
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  they're doing it these days
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  and my sources are very good
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  you know last time I was on your show
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  I described the conversation between
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  Jamie Dimon and John Corzine
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  where Dimon threatened to kill Corzine
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  and everything that's come out
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  since then now
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  the blanks have been filled in
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  so I've got pretty much the whole picture
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  and you were proven correct
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  it was wired to London
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  he did know, he did order it
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  we have the head of the CME group
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  saying he purged it himself
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  now the memos are public, of course the CEO
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  who ordered the bets stole the money
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  and that's like you catch a fox
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  with a chicken in its mouth
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  and it tells you with blood dripping
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  I didn't eat the chicken
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  I mean it is off the chart ridiculous
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  what does all this signify
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  give us the rest of the story
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  where it's all going and will he get in trouble
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  or will he be given some
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  some prize by the FBI
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  for being a good citizen
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  yeah
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  well I think
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  the way the story is being portrayed right now
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  they don't really have it
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  correct, I mean the
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  the story really is JP Morgan
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  or Jamie Dimon attacking
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  MF Global and this comes out
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  of the whole recent era
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  of the too big to fail banks getting even bigger
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  you know as a result of the 2008 crash
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  you have
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  Bank of America bought Country Ride
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  and Merrill Lynch
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  Wells Fargo bought
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  Wachovia and JP Morgan bought Bear Stearns
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  and
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  let me stop you Max because I want to be able to hear you
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  are you building a barn or something
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  because it sounds like you're sawing and stuff
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  oh really is that any better now
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  it just sounds like you're banging on things
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  yes sir you've got the floor just don't
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  I might be banging, okay
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  does that sound better
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  so they got these too big to fail
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  banks are getting even bigger
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  and as a result
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  they've become very predatory
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  so JP Morgan
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  sees over at MF Global
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  on their books
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  they have this huge
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  leveraged Eurobond
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  position
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  they have to also remember that JP Morgan
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  the MF Global is a client
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  of JP Morgan
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  JP Morgan is their clearing bank
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  their custodian bank, their creditor
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  you could almost say that MF Global
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  is a subsidiary of JP Morgan
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  so they know
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  JP Morgan knows everything going on
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  at MF Global
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  they know their balance sheet, they know their position
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  so
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  when the timing was right
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  JP Morgan tells MF Global
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  that we need $175
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  million margin call
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  we need $175 million
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  and of course
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  they know that they don't have that money
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  Corzine says look
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  we don't have the money
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  and it was at that time that the
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  famous conversation went down
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  where Jamie Diamond essentially
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  threatens to have him killed
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  like John Perkins talks about
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  the economic hitman
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  he'd go into the Pentagon, meet with generals
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  if he couldn't get people to take the money on the sex
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  they send in hitmen
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  right so Corzine says we don't have it
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  there's a threat to kill him
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  and then
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  soon thereafter
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  what we now know from testimony
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  is that Corzine
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  goes into the customer accounts
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  he transfers
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  $200 million of that customer money into
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  a separate entity
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  he then calls up
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  JP Morgan and says look I got the $175 million
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  I'm going to
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  send that over to you guys
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  notice it's not $200 million because that would be
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  too obvious
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  he uses a slightly different number
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  this $175 million versus $200 million
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  and of course JP Morgan is kind of shocked
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  because they're trying to
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  throw MF Global under the bus
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  because they want access to this huge levered
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  Euro bond position
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  so Jamie Diamond and JP Morgan at that point
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  they request
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  from MF Global that they send over
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  written confirmation
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  that this money is not coming
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  from customers
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  they know it is coming from customers
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  but they want written
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  confirmation that it's not coming from customers
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  because they realize what's going on
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  now that written confirmation
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  never materializes
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  but that money nevertheless goes over
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  to JP Morgan
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  so now JP Morgan has
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  committed crimes three different ways
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  they've purposely thrown
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  the company under the bus
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  they've instigated customer theft
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  of funds and they willingly
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  took stolen money
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  surely
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  thereafter
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  of course the firm goes bankrupt
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  and this is where
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  we see the payoff
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  because that huge levered
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  Euro bond position
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  gets sold off into the market
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  to George Soros
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  George Soros fences
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  that position
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  that multi-hundred dollar Euro position
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  makes a ton of money
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  because he's working with JP Morgan
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  and he's a client of JP Morgan as well
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  and they fenced this out to Soros
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  before this all goes down
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  and we see the progression
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  of yet another bank
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  heist and another incidence of too big to fail
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  getting bigger and it's all orchestrated
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  from the side of JP Morgan
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  and John Corsign is a bit of a patsy in all this
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  let me expand on that
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  because
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  I was looking at the connections
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  with Obama and Goldman Sachs
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  and the head of the EPA formally being Goldman Sachs
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  and then all these third world countries
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  the presidents are Goldman Sachs
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  and then the finance minister
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  is Goldman Sachs
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  I mean literally over
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  eight out of ten
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  presidents or finance ministers in the world
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  I just randomly have started
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  looking up the names of African country
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  leaders, Latin American
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  New Zealand
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  European, it's Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  I know JP Morgan Chase is bigger
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  I know they're the big Federal Reserve
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  shareholders all that
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  hard of the New World Order, I know they're bigger
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  but then is like Goldman Sachs
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  the technician team
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  I mean what's that relationship
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000]  there because I just see Goldman Sachs
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000]  operatives everywhere
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  the money is being funneled back to JP Morgan
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  is that like Don Carlioni up on the hill
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000]  or something
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  and then what
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  A and then B
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  what's going to happen to Corsign
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  do people perjure themselves
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000]  and a bunch of money goes missing
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  and no one gets in trouble because
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  that signal is going to destroy confidence
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  well no, JP Morgan
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  is at the top
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  of the pyramid really because they're the ones
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  working directly
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  with the Fed, JP Morgan
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  has on their books over 90 trillion
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  in derivatives
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  they have something like
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  25%
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  of the global derivatives business
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  is right on JP Morgan's books
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  and they also have Blythe Masters
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  who invented
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  the credit default swap
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  so when people are frustrated for example
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  when the price of silver gets knocked down
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  or the price of gold gets knocked down
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  that's Blythe Masters, he's in the market
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000]  terrorizing these markets with these
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  naked credit default swap
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  contracts as he floods
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  the market with these sell orders
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  these bogus flash orders
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  to manipulate the prices so that's all at JP Morgan
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  Goldman Sachs
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  their specialty as you pointed out earlier
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  they're more out in the euro zone
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  they've destroyed Greece
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  they're attacking Portugal, they're undermining Spain
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  they've totally corrupted Brussels
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  they're really trying, they're all over Europe
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  I mean I live three blocks
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  from their France headquarters
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  so I see those guys all the time
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  going in and out of there with their briefcases
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  and shiny loafers plotting to destroy
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  various countries for a quick buck
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000]  but mostly it's JP Morgan
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  and Jamie Dimon who's of course
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  whispered to be the next Treasury Secretary
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  after Timothy Geithner
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  I guess they would have to do
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  some kind of huge
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  flash crash first
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  to create a huge crisis
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  to slip that smelly
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  putrid
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  appointment under the noses
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000]  of the people
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  which I expect that coming by the way
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  we are on the cusp of another huge
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  downdraft
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  based on the growing instability
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000]  of these markets
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  due to the fact that all that happened
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  in the last 36 months
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  is that the central banks
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000]  added 15 to 20 trillion dollars
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  of bad debt to their books
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  they can't service that debt
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  the economies aren't growing enough to service the debt
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  so there's going to be
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  we're definitely on course to what we've been saying
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  on your show now for two years
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000]  of some kind of global devaluation
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  you mentioned earlier a global tax
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  but we've talked
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  about this many times on your show
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  the reason there's an income tax in America
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000]  is to pay the interest on the debt for the Federal Reserve Bank
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  when you create a global reserve bank
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  like they are in the process of doing
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  to roll up all these bad debts
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  since a special drawing or some new global currency
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  they will have to create a global tax
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  to pay the interest on this new debt
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  that's the plan
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  hello
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  they're announcing that world government
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  is going to take everybody's liberty
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  for their own good
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  they're announcing how lucky we are to have this happening
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  what heroes, Jamie Dimon
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  and
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  of course Bernanke are
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  and why does everybody hate them
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  I mean that's the actual headline
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  here in the Atlantic
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  Ben Bernanke saved the global economy
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  so why does everybody hate him
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  of course he's just a front man for these guys
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  but we know they want to raise taxes
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  and keep taking over
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  but now people are learning
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  that they're the authors of our doom
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  everybody's buying guns
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  I don't see them at the end of the day
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  getting away with this
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  what are they thinking
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  or are they so crazy
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  it's like why upgrade the nuclear reactors
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  let them blow up
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  it's just like total psycho behavior
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  well I just saw a report
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  that was saying
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  why the pink slime
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  which they've discovered is 20% of the hamburger
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  meat in America
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  it really is a good thing
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  and that people shouldn't disparage
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  the wonderful qualities of pink slime
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  it's got ammonia in it, cancer is good
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000]  come on, come on
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  if you own all the media outlets, except yours
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  of course, if you own all the other media outlets
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  you can
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  create any reality you want
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  see the great thing about financial terrorism
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  and we saw this in 2008
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  they tried to pass
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  that bailout, $750 billion
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  Hank Paulson went before Congress
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  and the initial vote was no
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  then of course, he just instructed his boys
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  on Wall Street to hit the cell switch
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  there was a mini crash
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  and it scared the Congress people to voting yes
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000]  same thing in Europe, same thing in Greece
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  to get the people to sign on, they staged these
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  horrific financial terrorist attacks
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  to stock market crashes
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  and then the people are panicked
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  into voting whatever they're going to vote
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  so this is great about having
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  algorithmic trading, computer trading
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  so over 70% of all the trading
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  on the exchanges is computer generated
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  and all the computer generated trading
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  is by algorithmic
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  program trading that are created
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  in the Wall Street banks and you create
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  an algorithmic program that says
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  when certain conditions are X, Y and Z
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  we're going to dump
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  a trillion
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  in orders, sell orders
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  into the market, make it sell orders
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  flash, crash and we're going
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  to create a political reality that way
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  so what is its final
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  end game then, where does it go
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  just bankers swattering everyone, drinking gallons
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  of blood, dancing around like Nero
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  well the
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  the trend sort of solidish
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  in the banking industry is
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  picking up speed, I imagine at the end
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  there'll be two or three major
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  mega banks run by
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  two or three people
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  who have a net worth
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  you know what the biggest guy in the world
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  has a net worth of 50 billion
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  or 60 trillion, I would imagine
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  that at the end you'll have people
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  with net worth like a country
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  400
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000]  billion dollars
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000]  folks, Iran and the mid-east
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  nuclear mess is already ballooning
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  our gas prices, whether you're struggling
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000]  with food costs which are being blown
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000]  up by gas costs now
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  or know that when the mid-east showdown
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  explodes, whatever food supply you have
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  is all you'll get because
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  of the huge panic demand

[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  this is biden yesterday
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  we want to create a global minimum tax
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  because your tax money is
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  max is pointing out
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  income tax is globally
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  what year we get the fellow reserve
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  1913
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  what year we get the income tax
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  1913
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  what year we get the
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  federal investigative groups
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  that were set up to knock heads
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  you guessed it
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  everything 1913
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  what year they get rid of the senators
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  being appointed by the states
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  1913
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  oh you didn't know that
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  the states used to run things
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  yeah max keiser is our guest
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  let's go ahead and go to the short clip of joe biden
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  a global minimum tax
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  here it is
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000]  we want to drop the rate
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  particularly for high tech manufacturers
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  like you mr. president
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  we want a global minimum tax
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  because american taxpayers
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  shouldn't be providing a larger subsidy
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  for investing abroad
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000]  than investing at home
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  what a way to push
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  global government is to claim
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  somehow it will help americans
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  is total bull
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  that's what the oecd and others say
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  they want an 85% global average tax rate
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  but he calls that lower
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  that's called lying to crowds
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  max keiser
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  that's what the globalist plan is
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  one mega bank over the world
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  privately owned with a giant
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  u.n. global government
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  corporate nato peacekeeping army
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  stealing and robbing
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  from everybody and tearing up our roads
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  and giving us dirt roads
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  basically the hunger games agenda 21
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  can they get away with it
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  is the question max keiser
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  well if you if you're going to use
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  fiscal policy or tax policy
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000]  you know there's five trillion
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  trillion dollars
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  foreign exchange or forex
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  traded every single
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  day
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  by applying a
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  0.001%
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  tax on those transactions
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  which are all derivative transactions
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  that benefit nobody except
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  the top bankers
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  you would raise all the money you could
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  ever want to raise
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  so joe biden if you had
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  any kind of financial literacy
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  however it wasn't just dumping
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  for a global central bank to continue
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  this global nightmare and roll up another
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  a big tranche of phony debt
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  I mean that he would talk about something like that
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  but that that makes sense
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  what he's talking about is just more of the same
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  max what about the left
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  the so-called left criticizing
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  myself and others
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  for worrying about a police state
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  they're like look
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  I think there's a police state
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  all this a police state which
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  already been set up
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  talking about the left for a second
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  there was a great piece by Matt
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  on his blog today
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  talking about how the Tea Party
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  and the Occupy Wall Street movements
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  are joined at the hip
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  because the Tea Party is right
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  in that there is no government regulation
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  and that the Occupy Wall Street movement
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  is also right in that you've got this huge
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  concentration of wealth at the very top
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  for example Ray Dalio
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  who is a manager and drainage in Westport, Connecticut
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  he paid himself
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  $3.6 billion
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  in compensation last year
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  that's B with a billion
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  $3.6 billion in compensation
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  he runs hundreds of billions of dollars for people
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  and when you have folks
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  individuals like back in 1993
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  George Soros famously broke the Bank of England
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  it was the first time
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  an individual
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  who ran a hedge fund challenged a country
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  he broke the Bank of England
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  he crashed the British pound
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000]  and he made a billion dollars in one week
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  now all the hedge funds
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  since then have been trying to be like Soros
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  a massive amount of
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  money under management
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  and as we saw with the grease
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  that was cooked up with John Paulson
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  another hedge fund manager
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  Lloyd Blankfein the CEO of Goldman Sachs
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  and hold on finish that thought
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  back in 60 seconds by the way
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  tonight the secrets of Prometheus
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  in Fall Wars Nightly News
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000]  from Blana.TV

[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000]  but I want to point out the three
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000]  that have helped me lose
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  37 pounds
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  in just two months
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000]  products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  Pollen Burst and Rebound
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000]  when I started taking the Tangy Tangerine
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  and other products every day
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  now that's results
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  I want to challenge my listeners
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  to go to InfowarsTeam.com
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  and to order just three of their products

[02:59:48.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  InfowarsTeam.com
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  in the heart of FEMA Region 6
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000]  Austin, Texas
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  transmitting worldwide
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  it's Alex Jones
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  and the 74th annual edition
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000]  of the Hunger Games from Region 6
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  I saw a comment
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  on a blog where they had the radio show
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  poster and like what is this the Hunger Games
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  Region 6
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  that's art imitating life
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  understand that
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  and this is an art this is
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  the life we're covering here
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  people say well the Hunger Games
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  is anti-New World Order how are you singing this conditioning tool
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  because it's shown as fiction
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  it acclimates people and what you see
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  in films like that is exactly
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  what the globalist had planned
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  I'm not saying the person is either good or bad
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  I don't know
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  side issue and I thought I'd throw that out there
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  maxkeisermaxkeiser.com
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  I should have pointed that out TV host
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  researcher max finish your point about
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  where you see all this going and then I want to ask you
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  even though you're very successful
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  and leave the stock market
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  and then expose it
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  well you know
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000]  to finish off my point
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  going back to Soros in 93
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  he was the first individual
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  to crash a country
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  and so these
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  super wealthy hedge fund managers and bankers
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  have been doing that ever since
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000]  and they're just getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  and as a result
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  you now have individuals
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  who are bigger than countries and we're seeing them
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  crash countries to make a profit
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  and they're making lots of profits
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  and I just saw a very interesting
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  tweet fly by in my tweet stream here
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  that fuel is being rationed
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  to British
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  ambulances
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  so the price of fuel is so high now in Britain
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  because of the money printing
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  because of the banking terrorism
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  because mermin king the chairman of bank of england
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  is a stooge for the ruling class
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  the price of gas is so high
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  petrol that ambulances can't afford it
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  now this is having a direct
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  impact this is called financial
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  repression
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  when the central banks keeps the jack
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  boot of their manipulation
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  on interest rates so that they're near
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  0%
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  this means that money
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000]  is opening a gas in the economy
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  and money is flooding in
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  with that 0% rate
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  and driving things like fuel costs higher
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  and while pensioners who rely on
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  retirement income and higher interest rates
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  can't survive
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  and this is all done in the name
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  of liquidity and helping
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  the economy but it only helps the
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  speculators it only helps the top
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  of banking class and it's causing
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  this financial repression
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  and huge dislocation and it's all
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  engineered by design
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  and it's pitiful and both the right
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  and the left are beginning to understand this
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  so we need to ask about what do I think about this
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  hit piece of you in a recent
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  left-wing piece
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  it's unfortunate because
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  there's now so much common ground
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  between all disparate groups
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  if you're not a Goldman Sachs
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  partner
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  you're in trouble
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  so there's no time
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000]  there's a waste of energy
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  exactly we're seeing open
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  classical police state corruption
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  and I'm just saying hey
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  let's get our freedom back and I've got
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  the right wing and the left wing
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  I forgot a bunch of other publications
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  on the right attack me over saying
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Obama is power grabbing now
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  and using the military domestically
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  because establishment right wing they love
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  that they loved it when Bush did it
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000]  they're a bunch of establishment types
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  claiming their left wing or right wing
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  they're not even in the left right paradigm
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  they're in the establishment's
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  paradigm and as you pointed out Goldman Sachs
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  is going to betray them
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  right there's no
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  if you go amongst the
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  top of the top you know they hate each other
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  because this guy has got
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  a billion dollars more than this guy
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  exactly but briefly why did you get out
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  of it briefly
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  well I don't really feel as though I ever
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  have gotten out of it
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  you know my point
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  I feel that gold and silver
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  are going to be incredible
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  winners so
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  you say you did bad things on the stock market
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  why did you stop doing that
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  oh well I
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  got a vacation to Paris back in
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  1990
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  and I fell in love with Paris
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  and I just said it's not worth it
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  I'm going to retire
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  and I retired
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  and now you expose what was going on
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  well maxkeiser maxkeiser.com
