[00:00.000 --> 00:11.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.040 --> 00:18.600]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.600 --> 00:26.440]  Texas Alex Jones Joel Scalcin will be joining us in the next hour talking
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.840]  about the rest of the story dealing with top-secret USA the dark side of
[00:30.840 --> 00:36.400]  government that Cheney talked about the secret militarization of police and
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.280]  military trying to create cadres people that will carry out brutal oppression
[00:41.280 --> 00:44.400]  of the American people the good news is it's not going too well for the
[00:44.400 --> 00:48.480]  globalist even using private contractors that's coming up in the next
[00:48.480 --> 00:52.400]  hour well the last three days he's published a three-part series we won't
[00:52.400 --> 00:55.960]  and he's been going into publicly available databases we'll leave it at
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.600]  that but he doesn't want him to close down these sources the sources if the
[01:00.600 --> 01:03.880]  information itself is public and verified it's just that where Wayne's
[01:03.880 --> 01:07.320]  getting this because they've been very secretive about clamping down his
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.520]  college records high school records passport birth certificate all of this
[01:12.520 --> 01:16.440]  Wayne doesn't want him to shut down the source of this because he's digging
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.720]  through it right now and finding even more and is a schedule to go down there
[01:20.720 --> 01:25.080]  again today I'll just leave it at that but the story of Obama all in the
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.160]  company in three parts we've got it linked up at info wars.com we've got the
[01:31.160 --> 01:34.760]  blurb written above it with some of the history of other presidents being
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.680]  intelligence assets bombshell Barack Obama conclusively outed as CIA
[01:39.680 --> 01:43.600]  creation and I've seen a lot of this info open source before but Wayne's put
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.600]  it all together in one spot and found a lot of new data and it's got to be a
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.840]  25 page report but I suggest you read it all but but here he is to go over it
[01:53.840 --> 01:59.120]  with us in the next 45 minutes to 50 minutes and to give us some new intel
[01:59.120 --> 02:04.160]  he's gotten you can find it all in new developments at Wayne Madsen report.com
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.120]  and we have it linked up at info wars.com he's getting so much traffic it's
[02:08.120 --> 02:11.560]  barely staying up this morning it's off and on that's why we've got this key
[02:11.560 --> 02:15.920]  report we're thankful for him letting us mirror it at info wars.com Wayne
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.800]  congratulations on your in-depth investigation you've been in Chicago
[02:19.800 --> 02:23.680]  for weeks you've been all over the country investigating this guy and you've
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.120]  gotten some powerful info. Oh thanks but I feel so much aggrieved I think all
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.160]  this information is what should have come out during the the presidential
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.280]  campaign not on a certain president of the United States and I really think
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.560]  that myself and other members of the media I you know I'm not counting the
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.360]  corporate media they never touch these stories but we really were remiss I
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.520]  think in in delving into this guy's past during the campaign which is what
[02:53.520 --> 02:56.680]  we've done with every other previous presidential candidate and for some
[02:56.680 --> 03:03.240]  reason I guess we all got hooked on the Hopium with Obama. Well Bush was so bad
[03:03.240 --> 03:06.600]  I don't blame people for wanting to get hooked on the Hopium but I saw his
[03:06.600 --> 03:12.520]  advisors and Wall Street doubling down on him I knew McCain was bad but clearly
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.160]  he was the establishment's heir apparent and and so that's why I saw
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.240]  through him. Oh absolutely and now we hear today that one of the Kagan boys has
[03:21.240 --> 03:25.720]  been hired on as an advisor to General Petraeus so what's the difference you
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.520]  know we had Obama speaking at the CIA headquarters telling them you know how
[03:30.520 --> 03:34.960]  much he appreciates what they do and don't don't worry about the
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.600]  investigations you know where he should have been taking him to what they did
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.400]  during the renditioning in the secret prisons and and now we know about the
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.200]  latest one in Morocco where we turned people over and tortured by the Moroccan
[03:49.200 --> 03:56.080]  secret police so I mean this is the guy that keeps on giving as long as you're
[03:56.080 --> 04:01.280]  you know CIA or the Pentagon and and I don't see any change as a matter of
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.000]  fact in some respects I think he's worse. Well Wayne Wayne I have to agree with you
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.400]  unfortunately because he brought left cover to this and a fresh face and he's
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.880]  a better teleprompter reader a lot of people went to sleep over the secret
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.120]  arrest the expanding wars the torture America really losing its soul and he's
[04:19.120 --> 04:25.040]  been protecting John Yoo and of course Alberta Gonzalez and Bush and Bush feels
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.120]  so safe two months ago he said yeah I ordered torture I do it again. Oh
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.480]  absolutely and and his Justice Department is going after Blagojevich again
[04:34.480 --> 04:42.160]  after all he got was a single counselor flying to an FBI agent and he wasn't
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.680]  even under oath there's no even there's no transcript he let's delay off on the
[04:46.680 --> 04:51.000]  able to feel I mean this is this guy I mean he's the gift to keep on giving for
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.160]  the last people in the Lansing administration. Well Wayne stay there we got a long
[04:54.160 --> 04:58.320]  segment coming up let's walk piece by piece through your bombshell report on

[08:52.120 --> 08:56.520]  mean this guy formerly worked for the NSA naval intelligence he's written for
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.400]  some of the biggest publications in the country wash it in post you name it he's
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.040]  a contributor to RT he's a real patriot his info is always born out to be very
[09:05.040 --> 09:09.560]  accurate he told me where he got this new information and he's it's verified
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.600]  and confirmed it's just that there's been a I don't want to go any further
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.360]  because they keep clamping down every time they learn of a new place people
[09:17.360 --> 09:21.240]  are getting information but we're gonna stop right there and Wayne can say as
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.000]  much as he wants but this is all public source and verified as three articles
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.960]  but you need to read all three parts the story of Obama all in the company part
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.720]  one part two and part three at info wars dot com or wave madsen report dot
[09:37.720 --> 09:42.400]  com and again his side is weighed down so if you can't get it there info wars
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.240]  dot com and get it out to everyone you know because I have separately researched
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.800]  this in depth making the Obama deception and fall the republic and a lot of this
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.480]  was already public but a lot of it is new and just completes the image of what
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.120]  we've got now before we go back to Wayne I want to show people a few new
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.600]  stories that came out this week here's politico don't look berthers it's
[10:04.600 --> 10:11.240]  Obama's passport as if his passport means something now this came out on the
[10:11.240 --> 10:16.240]  heels of them shredding and destroying his mother's passport which would be
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.600]  stamped where he was at what time when he was born the evidence shows in Kenya
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.720]  but we know he gave up a citizenship and became Barry Sataro like Anakin
[10:25.720 --> 10:31.360]  Skywalker became Darth Vader he became Barry Sataro and gave up his US
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.720]  citizenship that is confirmed that's mainstream news okay and they try to
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.160]  abscond that evidence by only focusing on Kenya and I'm not bashing those that
[10:40.160 --> 10:45.800]  do it just this is smoking gun now here it is oops Obama mama passport
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.720]  destroyed State Department claims records gone for Stanley and Dunham prior to
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.800]  1968 at around the time that old Barack Obama was born in 1961
[10:57.800 --> 11:02.600]  continuing White House offers glimpse of President Obama's passport documents
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.040]  shows birthplaces of why so they they're they're desperate they won't put out the
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.680]  original passport just a receipt of it okay just just a slip not the real
[11:13.680 --> 11:19.560]  passport and now they're doing this at the same time they destroyed her passport
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.440]  very very suspicious so I wanted to just point out they've been involved in a
[11:24.440 --> 11:28.760]  cover-up Wayne Madsen go over your groundbreaking report the new stuff
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.560]  you've discovered and other things you haven't put in part one or part two or
[11:32.560 --> 11:38.200]  part three you've got the floor Wayne Madsen go over it well I started this
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.320]  investigation by looking at the company that President Obama went to work for
[11:43.320 --> 11:47.880]  after he graduated from Columbia and it was Business International Corporation
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.800]  and that was a company that had close ties to the CIA they use some of their
[11:52.800 --> 12:00.200]  quote-unquote journalists at CIA cover officers overseas now in his book
[12:00.200 --> 12:05.440]  Obama says I went to work for a company in Manhattan after I graduated from
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.560]  Columbia Columbia but it was the company the CIA it wasn't a company and and
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.680]  now he was very disingenuous with talk about talking about that this was a
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.320]  company that had access to some of the biggest the most powerful people in the
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.760]  world including a Soviet Premier Alexei Kosigan generalissimo Franco of Spain
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.240]  and it did obviously this company did outreach to a lot of leftist leaders and
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.840]  places like Africa and Asia and other other parts of the world including
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.640]  Latin America and and then I started looking at of course his mother and
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.840]  her prime in Indonesia especially but also Pakistan it turns out she was
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.880]  working not only for the Ford Foundation on micro financing projects and I I have
[12:53.880 --> 12:59.240]  information at the state of one of the CIA economic officers at the U.S.
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.160]  Embassy in Jakarta worked on the same exact project while she was there
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.640]  financing micro financing of love for these farmers and artisans and central
[13:09.640 --> 13:16.480]  Java now she had Obama take out of an aunt Dunham to Toro takes her son at
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.880]  seven years old in the Indonesia following the CIA inspired coup two years
[13:21.880 --> 13:28.400]  later a lemon to Toro's stepfather was clared back by General Suharto from Hawaii
[13:28.400 --> 13:36.400]  where he met Obama's mother in 65 but prior to the CIA coup and he went to
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.320]  work at four of the Suharto's army now that they killed an estimated up to one
[13:42.320 --> 13:49.760]  million Indonesian citizens a lot of that big Chinese and also reported
[13:49.760 --> 13:53.960]  members of the Indonesian Communist Party so this is the environment she
[13:53.960 --> 13:59.440]  takes seven-year-old Barack Obama I mean what who in the right mind would do
[13:59.440 --> 14:04.200]  that unless you were you know being assigned to work for the agency in
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.080]  those days I also looked at Barack Obama senior now he was airlifted it was
[14:09.080 --> 14:14.920]  called project Africa airlift Africa it was funded by a $100,000 grant from the
[14:14.920 --> 14:19.640]  Joseph P Kennedy Foundation but that's because Tom Amboy who was a Kenyan
[14:19.640 --> 14:25.040]  national leader pro-urad tied in with the CIA decided he didn't want to take
[14:25.040 --> 14:28.560]  State Department money because that would look too suspicious so that looks
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.880]  like they laundered some of this money through the through the Joseph P
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.480]  Kennedy Foundation in 1960 now remember John Kennedy's running for president
[14:36.480 --> 14:43.160]  then so that's building up his national security credentials helping out the
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.720]  agency and the reason for bringing these 230 students from Kenya,
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.640]  Tanganyika and others soon to be independent British colonies in
[14:51.640 --> 14:56.520]  eastern and southern Africa was to compete with the Soviets and Chinese who
[14:56.520 --> 15:02.240]  were training their own leaders in these in these newly independent nations and
[15:02.240 --> 15:07.280]  it was clearly to gain influence with these new government and just interrupt
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.960]  briefly the bottom line historically is the British of the masters of this but
[15:11.960 --> 15:15.840]  other governments have done it that's why you had to be American born to be
[15:15.840 --> 15:19.880]  president in the Constitution because at the time our country was being founded
[15:19.880 --> 15:25.840]  they had problems with the Austrians sending their people into other European
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.400]  countries during the democratic revolutions that were developing to
[15:29.400 --> 15:33.640]  try to put their people into power there and so this story of intelligence
[15:33.640 --> 15:37.600]  agencies pre-positioning people to put them into political power so they
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.360]  control nations is extremely old and we also know that Kenya in the 40s and 50s
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.400]  into the 60s was the admitted declassified global model of covert
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.160]  takeovers and was the main base of operations aside from South Africa and
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.840]  Rhodesia for control of the African continent. Well right and we have to
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.160]  remember the same year the same year that Barack Obama senior was brought over
[16:04.160 --> 16:09.880]  in the CIA airlift Africa project is the same year that the Soviet Union opened
[16:09.880 --> 16:14.800]  the Petriek Women's University in Moscow for the purpose of
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.440]  training people from all these third world nations that he's newly independent
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.360]  countries for this petition we of course didn't have a Petriek Women's
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.840]  University but we ferreted these students among various universities around the
[16:28.840 --> 16:34.080]  United States and Barack Obama senior was the first African student to attend
[16:34.080 --> 16:41.360]  the University of Hawaii and he meets Obama's mother in where your phone was
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.760]  cutting out a bit he meets his mother again Barack Obama senior meets meets
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.160]  mama and of course her daddy you're gonna get into has connections to the
[16:50.160 --> 16:55.080]  agency he meets her where in a Russian language class at the University of
[16:55.080 --> 17:00.320]  Hawaii now this is the height of the Cold War and the other people who would be
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.920]  taking Russian in a place like Hawaii which was like a military I mean the
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.760]  military was all over Hawaii the Navy the Army the Air Force would be
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.160]  obviously people who were involved in some way shape or form with intelligence
[17:14.160 --> 17:22.240]  or were being recruited into intelligence and now Stanley Armoredanum
[17:22.240 --> 17:28.880]  the grandfathered there's a photo of him welcoming Barack Obama senior to the
[17:28.880 --> 17:33.440]  airport in Hawaii now we were told that they met for the first time at the
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.680]  Russian language class it's clear now this furniture salesman we were told
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.600]  that Stanley Armoredanum grandfather it was in the furniture business it seems
[17:42.600 --> 17:49.400]  like he was in much much more than just selling furniture incredible and then
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.920]  of course you have her then being projected into the big foundation under
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.760]  Tim Geithner's father I mean just on every side you've got all these
[17:56.760 --> 18:01.360]  connections in the report and then he's got a fake name he's changing his name
[18:01.360 --> 18:06.720]  we don't know where he's born he comes from nowhere to become president I mean
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.360]  it just I mean the evidence is overwhelming well then we have then we
[18:10.360 --> 18:17.720]  have a curious case of his grandmother of Madeline Dunham who died right two
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.480]  days before Obama was elected president in 2008 the Obama campaign apparently
[18:23.480 --> 18:27.320]  didn't want her giving any interviews to the press maybe they were afraid should
[18:27.320 --> 18:31.600]  be like Newt Gingrich's mother with the Katie Couric interview and slip up and
[18:31.600 --> 18:35.160]  say something that would have embarrassed them but she was one of the
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.560]  first female vice president at the Bank of Hawaii and now low and all we find
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.960]  out that that bank was used by the CIA front company and in Honolulu to make
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.920]  payments to these dictators in Asia likes to hard out and Marcos in the
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.920]  Philippines and generalist emotion I check in Taiwan and the Park Chung-hee
[18:54.920 --> 18:59.400]  in South Korea and the little Democrats in Japan who violated their own
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.960]  Constitution by secretly allowing the U.S. station nuclear weapons in Japan
[19:03.960 --> 19:09.720]  during the Cold War so so this was the payoff this was the CIA payoff network
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.400]  to these the U.S. sponsored dictators in Asia we're gonna brighten come back and
[19:14.400 --> 19:17.000]  keep going through your article that really puts all the pieces together
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.840]  that clearly this guy's an intelligence operative we'll look at once he's in
[19:20.840 --> 19:27.880]  college how he sent to Pakistan clearly in all sorts of secret ops I mean this
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.800]  is extremely clear but also if you really study deep intelligence it's
[19:32.800 --> 19:37.280]  normally a family affair because then the whole family is connected there's the
[19:37.280 --> 19:41.800]  peer pressure of the family you can never leave and so we see that pattern
[19:41.800 --> 19:44.920]  throughout history at the highest levels of intelligence we'll continue to look
[19:44.920 --> 19:50.880]  at a very sataro aka Barack Obama the president on the other side of this

[24:03.000 --> 24:09.520]  okay we're talking to Wayne Madsen who is a top security expert at the National
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.120]  Security Agency Naval Intelligence whenever you watch C-SPAN and you're
[24:14.120 --> 24:17.080]  seeing an intelligence committee hearing you'll see him in the gallery is a
[24:17.080 --> 24:20.960]  press reporter he's written for literally scores of top newspapers and
[24:20.960 --> 24:27.000]  publications here in the country and so a very you know top-level source and
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.760]  investigative journalist Wayne Madsen report.com has it all bottom line
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.200]  before we go through more of the history more of the evidence of this what
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.240]  type of asset is Obama what was their plan because he was nested at the highest
[24:42.240 --> 24:46.800]  level both sides of his family at the biggest foundations that themselves
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.080]  created the CIA the way I read this in my past research it appears that from
[24:52.080 --> 24:58.440]  very early he was put into the highest level schools being developed for where
[24:58.440 --> 25:04.880]  he is now. Wayne anyone who remembers the movie The Manchurian Candidate that's
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.520]  exactly what they were trying to do with in that movie setting somebody up but in
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.400]  this case it was it looks like it was the CIA had their own
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.240]  Manchurian candidate and groomed this individual for higher office and he
[25:21.240 --> 25:29.240]  eventually got it now one of the things that I found was some CIA files from
[25:29.240 --> 25:36.480]  the 1970s referring to behavioral science work being done by the Central
[25:36.480 --> 25:40.480]  Intelligence Agency and one of the universities and this comes from Richard
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.920]  Helms the director himself one of the favorite universities for behavioral
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.360]  science work and let's face it that was out of the office of science and
[25:49.360 --> 25:54.120]  technology that's MK Ultra that was Dr. Sidney Gottlieb's operation one of the
[25:54.120 --> 25:58.800]  favorite universities for this research was the University of Hawaii where
[25:58.800 --> 26:05.320]  Barack senior met met and family Dunham and so you're saying he is trained in
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.960]  mind control or he's under mind control oh I don't you know I don't know but I
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.280]  mean and we don't have MK Ultra was it was it was it was a extreme behavioral
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.560]  modification yeah the LA Times reported the Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski was in
[26:20.560 --> 26:23.920]  that program well another another university you know some of the other
[26:23.920 --> 26:29.520]  universities mentioned in this were Yale MIT University of Michigan and UCLA and
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.760]  and the University of Hawaii is single that is the fifth favorite university for
[26:33.760 --> 26:36.560]  this work by Richard Helms now this work was done through the Advanced
[26:36.560 --> 26:43.360]  Research Project Agency which was working the guy Lieutenant Colonel
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.000]  Kibler with US Army was working on things like remote viewing you know the
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  movie you saw the movie Men Who Stare at Goat that was what that was all about so
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.760]  it was a multifaceted project that have a but it was all done for this weird
[26:56.760 --> 27:01.760]  bizarre stuff well for me what you know the cherry on top and we haven't covered
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.040]  it ten percent of the evidence in your article is that the way they hide all
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.080]  his records the way he goes right into college but it's never there he's all
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.760]  over the world he's in hot zones it looks like they were training him in all
[27:14.760 --> 27:21.640]  sorts of you know in the field training from a very early age well the CIA front
[27:21.640 --> 27:27.720]  company and in Honolulu actually came up with a fast corporate history so that
[27:27.720 --> 27:31.740]  they had been doing business in Hawaii since it was a territory everything was
[27:31.740 --> 27:36.440]  fake with that particular company when when the company went bust and accused
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.160]  of being a Ponzi scheme that where we heard that recently certainly we had
[27:40.160 --> 27:44.800]  with Stanford we had we heard it with Enron and here we had another one
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.720]  and DCI so here we have an early example of the CIA setting up the
[27:49.720 --> 27:56.240]  financial firm to make these payoffs out of Honolulu and when it goes bust the
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.880]  innocent investors will be brought in grandmas running it she's working at the
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.600]  bank of Hawaii which is wandering the money she's running the expo account at
[28:06.600 --> 28:11.200]  the bank of Hawaii which is the money is whether the agency is placing the funds
[28:11.200 --> 28:17.320]  to transfer to their their boys over in Asia these dictators and these
[28:17.320 --> 28:23.440]  favorite favorite politicians I would also note that AIG which he bailed out
[28:23.440 --> 28:31.600]  which was started by Ken Stars the great uncle when in Shanghai was also a CIA
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.520]  front doing the same thing in Asia from China to Japan to Korea and everywhere
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.120]  else well look what top secret USA confirms what you'd already reported on
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.520]  for years close to a million secret private spies in the US alone with the
[28:45.520 --> 28:51.400]  highest security level that's one out of 300 Americans absolutely so you know
[28:51.400 --> 28:58.480]  we look at we look at all this and it's fascinating I also found a very rare
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.080]  copy of a book that was written in 1968 actually favorably reviewed a reviewed
[29:03.080 --> 29:11.560]  in an article in the Boston Globe in 1971 and it lists 3,000 CIA agents
[29:11.560 --> 29:16.480]  around the world with the the stations and some of the most active were
[29:16.480 --> 29:23.320]  Jakarta and Pakistan and Karachi and the book list a bunch of Obama's
[29:23.320 --> 29:28.240]  family's bosses bosses right including the guy that was right and running them
[29:28.240 --> 29:33.560]  the microfinancing work out of the US Embassy in Jakarta at the time so we
[29:33.560 --> 29:38.320]  have a lot of a lot of connections I also noticed that one person who I know
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.240]  is listed in the book Peter Ernest who runs now the International Spy Museum
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.040]  here in Washington stay there stay there I want to go over all of it when we
[29:47.040 --> 29:55.040]  come back and what it means we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[31:15.520 --> 31:19.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[31:19.400 --> 31:23.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[31:23.480 --> 31:27.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[31:27.800 --> 31:32.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[33:29.320 --> 33:39.800]  Alex Jones okay Wayne Madsen in layman's terms recap this evidence go over
[33:39.800 --> 33:45.040]  other areas some of the new things you've discovered you've been getting into
[33:45.040 --> 33:49.120]  archives I'll just leave it at that a lot of things are newly declassified on a
[33:49.120 --> 33:53.240]  routine basis they do everything they can to cover up his history now they
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.160]  shred his mother's passport that would be stamped for where she really was when
[33:57.160 --> 34:03.680]  he was born and then release his passport which you know he's already had a
[34:03.680 --> 34:07.360]  passport before even if he got it through fraud that's easy to do this
[34:07.360 --> 34:11.400]  proves nothing but it's their attempt to say look we're not gonna give you the
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.240]  original you know with his feet stamped on it and the doctor's signature you know
[34:16.240 --> 34:21.480]  of his real birth certificate we're gonna give you his passport to supposedly
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.200]  shut up the birthers and you've got this entire history of being groomed the
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.880]  entire family on every side deep inside the big foundations working for
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.240]  Geithner's dad the Rockefellers Annenberg all of them you know all the top
[34:36.240 --> 34:41.480]  globalist and then you've got even more in this three-part series well you know
[34:41.480 --> 34:48.120]  we go back to January February of 08 and the big US State Department passport
[34:48.120 --> 34:54.360]  scandal where some contractors working for a company called the analysis
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.440]  corporation were caught looking into Obama's passport files now that company
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.880]  at the time was headed by not Brennan who used to be with the CIA came up with a
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.440]  lot of this rendition program under Bush and now he's the deputy national
[35:09.440 --> 35:15.160]  security advisor how convenient so so I you know they said all over Hillary and
[35:15.160 --> 35:19.200]  McCain's passports records were being looked at I think that was a diversion
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.640]  that was that was you know make it look like they were going home I think the
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.320]  fact is they were going in to see exactly what Obama had if anything with
[35:29.320 --> 35:35.160]  a smoking gun as far as his passport files and I was getting ready to say
[35:35.160 --> 35:40.040]  before the break that one of the names in this book of 3,000 active ages
[35:40.040 --> 35:44.800]  during the late 50s and 60s is Peter Ernest who's now the director of the
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.000]  International Spy Museum and remember Obama took his two daughters to the
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.080]  spy museum hey well everyone's familiar isn't that a little odd why would he take
[35:53.080 --> 35:59.800]  him there well maybe it was all home week for him so what does this mean to
[35:59.800 --> 36:05.920]  the American people Wayne to to have someone who who clearly was manufactured
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.200]  and put into power I mean obviously they can blackmailing but that's not even
[36:09.200 --> 36:14.520]  needed he's just completely controlled what I think that's the problem he
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.080]  should have president and vice president student are senators or members of the
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.160]  House do not require security clearances the mere factor elected their
[36:23.160 --> 36:27.600]  staffs require the clearances but they do not but that back job for us to the
[36:27.600 --> 36:34.000]  press to vet these people and the media fail miserably during that campaign on
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.840]  what I reported out of Chicago with his private life and now with this his
[36:39.840 --> 36:44.400]  background with the agency this should have all this was all available back in
[36:44.400 --> 36:51.000]  nine in 2008 and and no one you know pursued it because everybody was
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.640]  listening to this brilliant order and you know beware beware these brilliant
[36:55.640 --> 36:59.880]  orders history is replete with them and it turned out to be nothing more than
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.920]  demagogues when they've gotten into office we know many cases of it throughout
[37:05.920 --> 37:12.640]  throughout recent and even ancient history where that happened continuing
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.360]  there's a lot of other areas of your detailed three-part series that we
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.640]  haven't covered yet I kind of recap it get into some other areas and connections
[37:20.640 --> 37:23.800]  we didn't go over and then when we talked last night you said you're still
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.800]  doing more research there's even more that there's mountains of this and just
[37:27.800 --> 37:35.200]  every place you turn CIA CIA CIA CIA well let's look at his father his
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.120]  father Barack senior who was brought over in his airlift Africa project now
[37:40.120 --> 37:43.960]  his his mentor in Kenya who was assassinated in nineteen sixty nine
[37:43.960 --> 37:50.680]  nine Tom and Boyette are basically selected Barack senior and others over
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.400]  more qualified candidates and I've got a not very obscure Reuters piece from
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.200]  London in nineteen sixty where one of the opposition leaders in Kenya says
[38:00.200 --> 38:05.040]  wait a minute some of the people who were passed over had better academic
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.920]  qualifications better certificates than the people who were selected well
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.560]  obvious why they were selected they were selected and in cases of Obama senior
[38:13.560 --> 38:17.800]  he married with a kid and went on the way already in Kenya when he arrived in
[38:17.800 --> 38:23.840]  Hawaii and he married the Obama's mother who's just graduated from from our
[38:23.840 --> 38:30.240]  high school it's very clear that this was some sort of a CIA operation to get
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.280]  those two together you know you gotta wonder what kind of parent would you
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.640]  know put their their own child up for auction for it because the agency finds
[38:40.640 --> 38:47.160]  it's important to do so but it's interesting because he basically was
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.640]  spying for the CIA at all these 10 African meetings and basically he was
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.800]  trying to limit the influence of some of that leftist African leaders who were
[38:56.800 --> 39:01.560]  thought to be in the pocket of the Soviet Union and and communist China at the
[39:01.560 --> 39:08.760]  time and particularly Kwame Krumah of Ghana who was also overthrown in 1966
[39:08.760 --> 39:14.320]  of the CIA coup just one year after Sukarno was overthrown in Indonesia with
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.600]  the help of Lolo Satoro, Barack stepfather and whatever work his mother
[39:18.600 --> 39:26.880]  was doing for USAID and and other entities in Indonesia. Now we talked
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.600]  last night and I said it seems to me that they knew that they would build him
[39:33.600 --> 39:41.640]  up as this messianic leader and then they study societal movements, individual
[39:41.640 --> 39:46.920]  psychology, mass psychology, the architects know that he would then not
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.120]  deliver the milk and honey and the restored economy and the end of torture,
[39:51.120 --> 39:55.320]  the end of wars with his advisors and who put him in power they were always
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.720]  planning to you know not deliver any of his promises and then politically
[40:01.720 --> 40:08.520]  destroy him and you concurred with me so I want you to expand on your view what
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.920]  was their plan for Barry Satoro aka Barack Obama and and and what is their
[40:13.920 --> 40:21.120]  master plan in compass for the nation and and and and for their front puppet
[40:21.120 --> 40:28.800]  more Balkanization, more division, selling Africa on AFRICOM or AFRICON
[40:28.800 --> 40:35.840]  being set up I mean what's the overall program with plan Obama? Well you know
[40:35.840 --> 40:41.440]  the CIA regularly uses people who are called futurists now this is a weird
[40:41.440 --> 40:46.800]  kind of thing where people looking at these are these are subject area experts
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.280]  who try to look to see where technology, where politics, where population, where
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.600]  demographics will be 20, 30 years into the future. And they seek to steer it, they
[40:56.600 --> 41:00.040]  seek to already know what people are gonna want to do, where culture is going
[41:00.040 --> 41:03.960]  to bring them so they can be prepositioned to dominate those systems
[41:03.960 --> 41:08.640]  that's what Google is. So if we go back in time to 1960 we're looking at the CIA
[41:08.640 --> 41:13.200]  looking at the demographic changes of the United States, increasing African
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.800]  American population. I don't think they really banked on the increase of the
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.360]  Hispanic population. Obviously that came later but... Well wait a minute it's come
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.800]  out that the Ford Foundation billions, Bill and Linda Gates, tens of millions,
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.880]  two Macha and Laraza, Ford Foundation going back 60 years creating those groups.
[41:31.880 --> 41:37.320]  Right. Well I think the one thing because of the civil rights movement they
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.240]  were looking at look Martin Luther King was the leader of the African American
[41:42.240 --> 41:47.720]  group movement, the people in this country. He broke with Johnson in
[41:47.720 --> 41:54.440]  67 over Vietnam, steered very hard to the left and as a CIA I'm sure said, God we
[41:54.440 --> 41:57.920]  can't, if we're gonna get a leader we can't have a Malcolm X, we can't have a
[41:57.920 --> 42:02.960]  Martin Luther King Jr. We have to make sure that when we have one, in
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.200]  wanting to become president, somebody that we can basically control.
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.040]  Let me back you up, Margaret Singer in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s on record in
[42:13.040 --> 42:18.160]  public letters with the Rockefeller Foundation saying we've got to pose as
[42:18.160 --> 42:22.000]  liberals, get the black leaders in place so we can abort most of them and they've
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.800]  been successful. 51% of blacks never make it out of utero, they're murdered in the
[42:25.800 --> 42:32.040]  womb. So they did that and they talk about controlling black leaders by
[42:32.040 --> 42:36.440]  financing them so we know that that's their strategic plan. And Martin
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.160]  Luther King got off the reservation so they took him out.
[42:40.160 --> 42:49.200]  Well, absolutely and so you look back in 1960 and is it beyond the pale to
[42:49.200 --> 42:53.000]  consider the fact that they may have wanted to groom somebody from the
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.200]  early age like a baby? You know, you've got his parents and his grandparents
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.240]  basically in their pocket and then you've got this stuff about behavioral
[43:03.240 --> 43:08.680]  science work at the University of Hawaii. There's just so many gaps in the
[43:08.680 --> 43:16.440]  histories of not only the president but also his mother, his father, his
[43:16.440 --> 43:22.280]  grandfather and his grandmother on his mother's side. So when you see
[43:22.280 --> 43:26.840]  gaps like that, now you just look at any other president, those families
[43:26.840 --> 43:32.400]  we knew way too much. My god, Roger Clinton, Billy Carter, but in this case
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.600]  we have these significant gaps in their histories and I think that's something
[43:36.600 --> 43:40.800]  that people should be concerned about. Wayne, I think that's the key that you
[43:40.800 --> 43:44.880]  just hit on. You have all this effort to cover up the past. You've got CIA
[43:44.880 --> 43:50.600]  connections to your left, your right, forward and backwards at every level. You
[43:50.600 --> 43:56.120]  have got the fact that they've spent so much time not just in the present but
[43:56.120 --> 44:01.680]  going back decades covering up his true providence and where he comes from.
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.400]  And then as you said, all these intelligence and corporate intelligence
[44:06.400 --> 44:10.880]  and foundation connections and now he's the president and we know they have
[44:10.880 --> 44:15.040]  these programs to go in not just here but all over the world and recruit
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.160]  leaders. I mean the British recruited Hitler, that's declassified in the mid
[44:19.160 --> 44:24.440]  20s and took him from nowhere and funded the national socialists to make him
[44:24.440 --> 44:28.240]  their leader and the Milner group bragged we're gonna build this guy up and
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.880]  he's gonna tear Europe up and then we're gonna be able to come in and rebuild
[44:31.880 --> 44:36.280]  it and take it over. I mean this is their long-term strategic thinking and when
[44:36.280 --> 44:41.600]  you look at Obama and everything he's done, it's clear this guy is a total
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.040]  betrayer of everything he claims to be. Well you remember last November when
[44:46.040 --> 44:53.040]  Old Man Bush, HW41 and Jeff Bush paid what was called a courtesy call to the
[44:53.040 --> 44:57.400]  White House? We were not even told what that was about, a courtesy call. That's
[44:57.400 --> 45:02.320]  all we were told. Well, you know, you've got the guy who the CIA headquarter that's
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.200]  named after and his son visiting Obama and it's just all we were in town we
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.400]  thought we'd stop by. Look, that doesn't happen at the White House. I mean, those
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.120]  the law he's defied, you don't get into the White House unless you have a reason to
[45:17.120 --> 45:24.000]  be there. So, I mean obviously you're saying their plan was to have a
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.680]  controlled asset who was supposedly African-American in there, that's clear.
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.280]  But how is their plan going? I mean did they mean for him to be a messianic
[45:33.280 --> 45:39.840]  leader and be successful and has their attempted launch of this African-American
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.680]  Napoleon failed or did they plan to just use him as a distraction and then
[45:45.680 --> 45:50.400]  destroy him? Well, I think he's given them everything they want. Look, Operation
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.800]  Iraqi Freedom is now Operation New Dawn. I mean, right out of George Orwell's
[45:54.800 --> 46:00.120]  new speak, Lexicon, we're showing pictures of convoys leaving Iraq. 50,000
[46:00.120 --> 46:03.400]  troops are going to stay and we're going to see an increase in contractors. What's
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.680]  that all about? By the way, I have the New York Times today on that. They say, oh,
[46:06.680 --> 46:12.240]  private contractors and intelligence operatives will now run the government. So
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.560]  this is a practice run for the U.S. and other countries where they don't just
[46:16.560 --> 46:21.240]  stage coups. They come in and put in their entire apparatus through these
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.280]  giant armored embassies and control everything and just have plain clothes,
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.040]  death squads running the nation. Well, that's right. And look what Obama,
[46:30.040 --> 46:33.680]  the radiatory comes in, you know, he allows the CIA to overthrow presidents,
[46:33.680 --> 46:37.760]  the lion Honduras. He wants to build seven military bases in Colombia and the
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.120]  constitutional court of Colombia just shot that down. So, you know, what Obama
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.880]  wanted to do with now being shot down by the court in Colombia? I mean, this guy
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.120]  is owned, locked stocked, and barreled by these intelligence, you know, the
[46:51.120 --> 46:57.240]  intelligence community because he's not said no to them ever. I mean, Patriot Act,
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.280]  still in effect. We have an increase in electronic surveillance. We got these
[47:03.280 --> 47:09.080]  people to CIA and Google and NSA and Google and Microsoft and
[47:09.080 --> 47:15.040]  everything else. And so he's allowing it. He ran out on openness. The Freedom of
[47:15.040 --> 47:20.320]  Information Act is still not being implemented. It's still backlog requests
[47:20.320 --> 47:26.400]  are not being honored. So, I mean, everything he ran on, he has lied on
[47:26.400 --> 47:29.520]  very fundamental constitutional issues. And we were told that he taught
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.920]  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School. I don't know which
[47:33.920 --> 47:38.000]  law he was teaching because when you look at his actions, it looks like he's
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.120]  teaching the Constitution of North Korea, not in the United States of
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.840]  America. You know, I laugh, but it isn't funny. This is really happening. And I
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.560]  mean, this is really the private offshore corporate takeover of society.
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.320]  They're setting up their fusion centers run by the CIA in every major city.
[47:54.320 --> 47:58.720]  They're federalizing the police. They're training US SWAT teams in Iraq for
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.400]  cordon for shutting down cities for gun confiscations at the G 20 in
[48:03.400 --> 48:08.080]  Pittsburgh. My employee got arrested. Rob do he saw people being let off
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.720]  trucks with bags on their heads. The army would then when they had to go to
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.840]  the bathroom to follow them and then make fun of them. And this was all
[48:16.840 --> 48:22.360]  encouraged like something right out of 1984. And this they had private
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.880]  snatch and grab teams in front of news cameras on purpose, grabbing activists,
[48:26.880 --> 48:30.880]  putting bags on their heads. Now it happened in Toronto. Same thing in
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.120]  England. They are globally deploying a scientifically developed corporate
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.680]  oppression, a corporate black ops tyranny. And I mean, clearly this is the
[48:42.680 --> 48:46.920]  complete shadow takeover. And now it's out in the open. I mean, this is so
[48:46.920 --> 48:51.800]  illegal, Wayne. Well, let me say another thing about Obama. You know, he has had
[48:51.800 --> 48:57.280]  scheduled two trips to visit Indonesia. Both trips have been postponed. You know,
[48:57.280 --> 49:03.680]  I think he knows that when he arrives in Jakarta, the Indonesian press, some
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.840]  foreign press will start looking at his time there. And I don't think they want
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.000]  that kind of attention on that. And I think that's one reason. Now he's always
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.480]  said he's had other priorities. I think the oil spill was one reason. Well, no,
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.200]  that's another issue, Wayne. He keep bringing up great points. It's admitted
[49:20.200 --> 49:24.080]  he was in Indonesia longer than he said. Then he lied about being in the Muslim
[49:24.080 --> 49:27.960]  school. It's fine if he's a Muslim, but why lie about it? I mean, everything he's
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.400]  ever told us is a lie. You went over that earlier. I mean, when the parents met,
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.720]  when the grandparents met, when all this happened, we learned it's all a fiction.
[49:36.720 --> 49:40.920]  Well, and the other thing I discovered is when they were, before they went to
[49:40.920 --> 49:46.640]  Hawaii, they were in Mercer, Iowa, Seattle, in the state of Washington. And I did
[49:46.640 --> 49:53.320]  find in a list of these agents, CIA people, the name of the chief engineer
[49:53.320 --> 49:59.520]  for Boeing, and he was, his area of primary assignment was Mercer Island. Now,
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.000]  Madeline Dunham worked for the Boeing corporation during World War II in
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.840]  which he talked to the school. He's the only guy listed with the agency in Mercer
[50:08.840 --> 50:13.920]  Island. You know, we've got to figure the time frame here. You know, you
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.520]  know, you can see your coincidence, but I, I think that's much more than a
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.280]  coincidence. But we know his father's involved in all these secretive
[50:23.280 --> 50:28.560]  activities. Now Obama's involved with Odinga, having the Muslims riot to
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.480]  create the prime minister ship for him. I mean, just everything Obama does is
[50:34.480 --> 50:40.960]  dastardly. Everything he does is skull-duggery laced. And it's just at
[50:40.960 --> 50:44.800]  every turn. And then there's the secrecy. And so I think you've conclusively
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.400]  proven that the media has been involved in a cover-up of this guy's true history
[50:49.400 --> 50:53.760]  and everything we know about Barry Sataro is a complete stinging lie. Final
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.160]  segment straight ahead with Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenreport.com, our site's at
[50:57.160 --> 51:05.080]  GCNLive.com. If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.

[51:59.280 --> 52:04.880]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new
[52:04.880 --> 52:10.280]  world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment
[52:10.280 --> 52:13.800]  of the globalists through their own words and documents. The new world order
[52:13.800 --> 52:18.280]  really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the
[52:18.280 --> 52:22.840]  world under their control. The United Nations would take over America. The
[52:22.840 --> 52:27.600]  Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.920]  men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an
[52:31.920 --> 52:35.920]  oppressive world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing
[52:35.920 --> 52:39.400]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global
[52:39.400 --> 52:43.520]  governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.480]  elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible

[53:37.920 --> 53:41.920]  are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be

[54:20.320 --> 54:30.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't done one since Monday. You want me to do it again.
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.320]  I appreciate the work you've done. I want people to read Wayne Madsen's report.
[54:36.320 --> 54:41.760]  And I want them to read the breakdown that we've done on top of it. So I want
[54:41.760 --> 54:48.240]  you to search this key term and make it the number one search term today. And I'm
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.480]  going to launch another one next hour. We'll hit them with two torpedoes. But the
[54:52.480 --> 54:56.160]  article isn't ready at PrismPlanet.com separately on what Google's doing, trying
[54:56.160 --> 55:00.320]  to take over the web with Verizon. So that'll be launched at 30 after we're
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.720]  Joel Scalson next hour. But I want you to search the term Bombshell Barak.
[55:06.720 --> 55:15.040]  Bombshell Barak. Bombshell Barak. And then that will lead them to WayneMadsenReport.com.
[55:15.040 --> 55:21.760]  Search the term Bombshell Barak right now. And that will lead them to this
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.160]  investigation. We'll post these videos later at YouTube. We'll link those in.
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.560]  And DrudgeReport routinely then links to this. And we can push this
[55:30.560 --> 55:38.480]  mega viral. Thanks to you taking action. We'll expose the CIA-created asset. Bombshell Barak
[55:38.480 --> 55:47.600]  is the search term. Bombshell. One word. B-O-M-B-S-H-E-L-L Barak. Please take action.
[55:47.600 --> 55:54.640]  We're 10 for 10. We've done this 10 times. You have never failed in the info war. Bombshell Barak.
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.400]  And we're going to launch another torpedo in T-minus 35 minutes.
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.880]  Closing comments, WayneMadsen. I hope people will support your investigative journalism
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.640]  by subscribing. You give most of what you do away for free. But it's important that
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.040]  people support you as an investigative journalist. How do they subscribe to WayneMadsenReport.com?
[56:11.600 --> 56:20.480]  Well, you just go to WayneMadsenReport.com and you'll see a thing that says join now.
[56:20.480 --> 56:29.440]  I click on that and it'll step you through the process. But it is time consuming to go through
[56:29.440 --> 56:36.480]  and locate and then go through these extensive files because we're talking about kind of ancient
[56:36.480 --> 56:44.640]  history, you know, the CIA 1960-61 up through the 70s. And there's a lot that you just have to
[56:45.200 --> 56:52.080]  piece it together. It's a very time consuming process. But I'm going to continue to try to delve
[56:52.080 --> 56:56.880]  into this background because, as I said, this should have been done in 08. It wasn't done.
[56:56.880 --> 57:04.160]  But I guess the old saying better late than never applies here, too.
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.720]  Well, you certainly deserve respect and support, Wayne. We've got about a minute and a half left
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.160]  in this hour. Any other key tidbits or points you wanted to make?
[57:14.800 --> 57:21.440]  Well, I noticed that it is a mother's passport record. There was a name that had been crossed
[57:21.440 --> 57:28.480]  out, Soharco, which is yet another name we have in addition to Satoro. I guess the question is,
[57:28.480 --> 57:37.920]  who is Soharco? Who was he? Was that another name assigned to President Obama when he was
[57:37.920 --> 57:44.640]  in Indonesia? How do you spell Soharco? S-S-O-E-H-A-R-K-O.
[57:44.640 --> 57:56.000]  Well, I would just urge people to, you know, while we have the Internet, you know it's under
[57:56.000 --> 58:04.240]  tremendous assault by the guys like Cass Unstein and his friends. Just search all this information
[58:04.240 --> 58:10.240]  out so that they become useful later on before it disappears entirely.
[58:10.240 --> 58:14.080]  I agree. They're clearly telegraphing. They're planning to launch false flag attacks on the
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.160]  web, blame it on China or Russia, and use it as a way to start controlling it.
[58:18.800 --> 58:23.440]  Absolutely. WayneMadsonReport.com. Wayne Madson, thank you for spending an hour with us.

[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:28.480]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. It is Friday, the 23rd day of July, 2010. For the next 30 minutes,
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.200]  we have an exclusive interview with Governor Jesse Ventura. Of course, this hit TV show,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.320]  now going into its second season. They're producing conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.520]  He has had trouble all over the country. Most of this we can't talk about because it's the TV show,
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.280]  but now the harassment, the homeland security surveillance has gotten so bad that the governor
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.440]  wants to talk about this pattern here today. And we're very honored that he contacted us
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.880]  yesterday to give us this exclusive. I'm also playing my own part in the show as a consultant.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.360]  But the headline at infowars.com by Kurt Nemo, exclusive. Jesse Ventura talks with Alex Jones
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.880]  about government harassment of his TV show. And it is really intensifying. Governor, thank you for
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.240]  joining us. Hi, Alex. Great to be here. And again, I come on the air with you, Alex, just to inform
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.960]  the public out there of exactly what's going on with our U.S. government, it seems. Well, we
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:25.440]  appreciate you coming here first, sir. Well, you know, ABC or NBC or none of them are going to hear
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.080]  what I'm going to talk about. You can bet on that. And I know that this is the place where freedom
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.960]  speaks. Have you had a chance to see the ABC news story that tries to make a joke about the
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.000]  harassment? It says Jesse Ventura brings his conspiracy theories to the Capitol. No, I didn't
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.960]  look at it, but, you know, what they always say in the entertainment world, any publicity's good.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.280]  Absolutely. As long as they get your name right. Governor, break down the latest or the history
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.840]  of this, wherever you'd like to start. Well, you know, the latest is, of course, we're doing,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.040]  it's the second season. So they told me that I could do an episode on the murder of John F. Kennedy,
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.880]  which to me is the corner post. That's the pillar of everything, the downfall, in my opinion, of
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.160]  our country in the last 50 years was because if you can murder the president and get away with it,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:19.680]  what can't you get away with? And what we did, we wanted to take a finishing shot, very humble,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:26.960]  of simply me standing in front of the eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery, no talking,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:35.360]  no anything. And bear in mind, Kevin Costner did it in JFK. They filmed him there. Well,
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.280]  we went to this character, this Ken Hawes, who's the U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:48.480]  and he denied it and so, and wouldn't let me do it. We did it anyway, though, Alex. We got the shot.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.400]  But in fact, the security people there were very helpful and they even moved people out of the
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.920]  way. So obviously, it didn't filter to the guy on the ground. This was happening in the upper
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.200]  echelon trying to do it the correct way. But I went to my Congresswoman, Michelle Bachman,
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.560]  immediately, and I said, what is this? And she got out great. She said, you have First Amendment
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.720]  rights. She contacted, let me read what happened real quickly here on July 22nd, 2010, we called
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.760]  back and asked to speak with Mr. Hawes. We were told that Mr. Hawes was in Chicago filming blah,
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.440]  blah, blah. Nevertheless, the gentleman we spoke with said that he had discussed the matter with
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.000]  Mr. Hawes and said they considered the topic of your particular episode inappropriate. After
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.640]  receiving Mr. Hawes' cellphone number, we called him in Chicago to find out why you were not allowed
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.800]  to film at Arlington National Cemetery. According to Mr. Hawes, Arlington National Cemetery has a
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:49.920]  policy of prohibiting stand-up filming. Additionally, Mr. Hawes stated that you were denied in part
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.240]  because of the nature of your television program. Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.840]  episode, which alleges that the United States government was directly involved in the assassination
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.960]  of President John F. Kennedy is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:13.200]  Now, first of all, we don't say that in the episode. The episode isn't even finished. How would
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.320]  this guy know it, Alex? How would he know it all? What position we were taking on this? We were
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.360]  merely investigating it. But where does he get off doing public policy and putting his opinion
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.760]  in on whether someone can or cannot be allowed to do something? Governor, this is incredible.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.320]  You have the Army trying to set the precedent at a national park of who can film and can and
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.360]  saying no one's allowed to when the news media is down there every week. I see it constantly. This
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.880]  is so dangerous. Stay there. We're going to come back from a quick break and pick your brain about
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.360]  some of the other things that have happened, but expand on this. But what a dangerous precedent
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.560]  where the government says you can't film at national parks unless we agree with your message
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.040]  since when is the Army running this country internally?
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.640]  Listen up, friends. This is Alex Jones with key information. The mainstream media
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.120]  is now admitting that we're going into a depression. Don't be dependent on the government for you

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.120]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:11.040]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.160]  protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.200]  dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.440]  our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's going to ask you
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.200]  what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we have the constitution,
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.520]  we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.440]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.320]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.640]  A new tool in the Info War. Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.480]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.440]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.720]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.840]  technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:29.280]  overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.120]  power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.120]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.920]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:05.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.520]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:19.280]  Again, it's Friday, July 23, 2010. Governor Jesse Ventura joins us live from California.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.600]  The last few days, he was in DC, part of a pattern of the government trying to block his
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.440]  First Amendment rights and selectively doing this for people's political or
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.080]  abused period just on the country. Governor, for those that just joined us,
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.000]  recap what's happened, get more into what Congresswoman Bachman is saying
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.600]  and the Army trying to block you from a national park.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.160]  Well, what happened, we're doing a show on the murder of John F. Kennedy,
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.440]  and apparently the Army doesn't like it, and they're in charge of Arlington National Cemetery,
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:57.680]  and the gentleman's name is Ken Haas, belt A-H-A-W-E-S. For those listeners out there that
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:11.440]  were as outraged as I am, I'll give you his phone number, 310-235-7621. Again, 310-235-7621,
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.240]  and I went to my Congresswoman Michelle Bachman when they refused to let me film,
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:21.440]  they're going through proper channels, and I'll read again after receiving Mr. Haas's cell
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.840]  phone number, we called him in Chicago to find out why you were not allowed to film at Arlington
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:32.080]  National Cemetery. According to Mr. Haas, Arlington National Cemetery has a policy of prohibiting
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.760]  stand-up filming. That's not true because Kevin Costner got filmed there for the movie JFK with
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.560]  Oliver Stone. You see it in the film. Additionally, Mr. Haas stated that you were denied in part
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:51.520]  because of the nature of your television program. Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.120]  episode, which alleges that the United States government was directly involved in the assassination
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.960]  of President John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.120]  So now the Army bureaucrats are deciding what Americans can do inside the country.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.600]  Apparently, or they have control over what you can film, and I was a governor, a mayor,
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:25.520]  I'm a few U.S. Navy Vietnam veteran. John Kennedy was a Navy man. I'll bet you President Kennedy
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.920]  could speak out on this. He would be more than happy to let me film at his eternal flame.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.440]  Well, the issue is, I've seen the news many times film there, and as you mentioned, it's in many
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.120]  films and documentaries in the film JFK, which is saying it was a government operation. So they're
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.160]  clearly discriminating against you, and it just shows this atmosphere of government control,
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.040]  where the government's involved in productions of movies, where the Army will try to block people,
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.720]  even interviewing people in the military. If they don't know what the bottom line is, Alex,
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.760]  these people are supposed to work for us. We pay their salaries. It's called paying your taxes.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:13.440]  That's what irks me a great deal, is the fact that I paid this guy's salary, and yet he has the
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.920]  ability to deny me from getting photographed by whom I consider the greatest president in my lifetime
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:27.760]  at his eternal flame, because he happens to not like the content of my program and where we're
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.920]  going, because some of us believe the Warren Commission's a crock of you-know-what, you know,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.520]  and we still seek the truth even today. By the way, on another subject,
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.560]  I-she wouldn't go on air with me. It's kind of the same subject, but I did sit down with Marina
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:53.040]  Oswald for two and a half hours. Wow. Tell us about that. Well, you know, she wouldn't go on the air,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.880]  but I think the most dynamic thing was this. She said this to me, Alex. She said nobody cares
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.080]  anymore, and I tried to convince her that yes, we do, because this is the cornerstone of corruption.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.720]  If they can kill the president and get away with it, then they can do anything. And I said,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.000]  it's important that history, and we've learned the truth no matter how delayed it is, if indeed,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.320]  that we've been lied to. And she looked me right in the eye, and she said, would you sacrifice
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:26.240]  your children for the truth? And I looked at her and said no, and she said neither will I.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.680]  That means she's being threatened. Well, it doesn't mean she's necessarily being threatened,
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.960]  but it means that certainly she feels that there is still a threat out there that if maybe she
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.920]  spoke out and said what she really felt that her children could come in some type of danger,
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.040]  at least that's, you know, the way it was intimated to me. And that's what I took from it was that
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:53.280]  she's still very protective of her children. And she's 69 years old now. She speaks pretty good
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.800]  English and she's been married to her husband, Mr. Porter, for since two years after the killing.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.120]  Of course, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, her husband clearly set up. It's now admitted that
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.520]  he was CIA at that air base in Japan and that they had him infiltrate Russia and then brought
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:18.400]  him back. Of course, the film JFK covers all of that with a historical accuracy. Governor,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.440]  off air, you said, boy, the government sure is acting guilty, not just with this JFK thing,
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:29.440]  but everything, everything we look into Alex, the government behaves like they're guilty in
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.920]  hiding something. Let me put it to you this way and I won't say where I was, but I've now been
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:43.680]  tailed and put on by Homeland Security. I've been tailed by the Coast Guard and we don't do
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:49.600]  anything illegal, Alex. Everything we do on the show is above board. We try to go through proper
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:56.640]  channels and we simply, if something requires us to go on the water, we do it in international
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.720]  waters or waters that are supposed to be free to the public. But yet we tried to hire a boat
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.040]  and when they found out what we wanted to do, none of the fishermen would take us out. You know,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.440]  why? Because anybody on the coast now, their licenses fall under Homeland Security and Homeland
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.800]  Security can pull their license if they don't like what they're doing. I like to refer to
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:25.360]  Homeland Security today as the Gestapo. Oh, absolutely. You've got almost every major
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.600]  federal agency under it and now into the Real ID Act, they want you to have to have a federally
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.480]  license through the state ID card to even be able to work. It's a total tracking system and you
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:44.240]  also went somewhere where you were threatened to be shot. Well, yeah, they have areas in the country
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:51.440]  where they have signs up that say legal forces authorized, which I find unbelievable. Whatever
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.200]  happened to a trial, whatever happened to going to court, you know, how can you be judge, jury,
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:03.360]  and executioner in one sale swoop? Now, not saying that they necessarily have or did,
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.920]  but there's areas in this country where they're supposed to, that lethal forces authorized if
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.360]  you cross this line. And there's not even a fence. It's just you cross some magical line on a dune,
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:19.040]  on a dune buggy, you're dead. Yep. Well, you could be. It's not saying that you are, but they're
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.400]  authorized to take you out with lethal force if they desire. Well, Governor, I mean, as you know,
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:31.440]  in 1947, the CIA got unlimited money, funding, and secrecy. And if you've got 60 years of a group
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.920]  being able to operate with unlimited funds and power, I mean, they've been caught shipping
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.480]  in narcotics. They've been caught engaged in assassinations. And they just think this country
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:45.520]  is their own private whorehouse. Well, you know, and unfortunately, our elected officials are
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.240]  allowing them to get away with it. You know, we need to, you know, get back our country and
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.040]  remember always, Alex, that we, the people in this country was formed. We were supposed to be the
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.880]  priority. It was supposed to be a country of citizens, first government, second, but it's
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.320]  not that way today. Government is number one. And we citizens fell by the wayside because
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.640]  everything is directed towards the government, to the survival of the government.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.560]  Governor, I know you've been busy shooting, but earlier in the week, top secret USA came out,
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:24.880]  two year Washington Post investigation, 850 plus thousand private corporate chiefs.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.040]  So that's close to a million with the highest level security clearance there is. And the Washington
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.920]  Post described it as a complete takeover of society. So we have a private corporate system
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.400]  that's giving itself government power, just running completely rough shot. And they admit
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.600]  that their plan is to end the freedom on the internet as we know it. Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.920]  I said that probably about 10 years ago. I said, the internet right now is the only thing where you
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.440]  can, you know, have total freedom on there. But I said, rest assured, the government will put
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.720]  high priority on getting control of the internet because that's the one place you can go to,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.080]  supposedly, and have freedom. And they're not going to allow that. You know, more and more,
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:14.480]  I'm seeing our country becoming under the thumb of corporate America, not even, well,
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.880]  it looks like, you know, it came out in the article that I said, I know I'm very clear on
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.280]  why we're in Afghanistan, Alex. It has nothing to do with terrorism and bin Laden. That's all a
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.840]  big red herring. We're there for the lithium. Did you see that story a month ago where they found
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:38.720]  the $8 billion of lithium over there? I mean, think about it. That runs every cell phone, computer,
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:44.640]  and soon to be electric cars. Well, you're absolutely right. We're in Afghanistan is to
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:51.600]  get the lithium. Now, why won't they just be honest and say that? Well, they went on to admit
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.040]  that it could be potentially a trillion dollars and that they knew this in reports before they
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:03.120]  invented. It's also about the trillions in oil in that region as well. Right. You know, and that's
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:09.600]  the reason we're there. All this stuff on terrorism, you know, put it this way, terrorists are like a
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:15.280]  motorcycle gang. You know, they're out there. Yes, they do exist. And there is a possibility that
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:21.360]  you could run into them very much. But they are not what this government is making us believe.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.400]  They are not, they are not like the Nazi army. They are not like the Japanese army,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.920]  a world war two. If they're not a country out there, they're just small groups of criminals that
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:38.080]  are involved in criminal activity and you have to deal with them. But to put our either an excuse
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:45.040]  to put our country under lock and key and take our rights away from us. Absolutely. And every major
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.000]  technology firm out there is getting massive government contracts to spy on the American
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.960]  people. They've completely butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution. All these groups have the
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.400]  motive for the terror. They stand to gain from it. Did you see the Financial Times of London
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.400]  with one of Obama's advisors, Robert Shapiro saying of if, in fact, guys, print that quote for me,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:13.200]  that if Obama doesn't have an Oklahoma City or 9 11 soon, his political days are numbered.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:22.480]  How would Oklahoma City or 9 11 help him to be blamed on domestic groups to be to be blamed on
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:34.880]  the American people? Okay. Well, all I know, Alex is that, you know, I fully expect within 10 years
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.640]  that we're going to have to have national ID cards and you're going to have to show them to go state
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.480]  to state. Oh, they're already saying that we've got a national ID card and they do want you to
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.520]  have to have it for anything. Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest host of the hit television

[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:05.200]  Attention, this is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.840]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.080]  lowering amounts owed. Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.480]  leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy. If you owe
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.520]  $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.000]  tax settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75 percent.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.880]  Number to call is 89026969. Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.840]  back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy. If you are struggling with $10,000 or
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:45.360]  more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75 percent
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.760]  and save thousands of dollars for free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:59.040]  line into American tax settlement now. 89026969. 89026969. Again, 89026969.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.960]  All right, folks. Final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura. Don't forget the films now being
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:15.680]  censored online. The Obama deception and of course, follow the republic available at infowars.com.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.280]  Since I mentioned it, top Clinton official, only a terror attack and save Obama. Financial times
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.400]  of London. The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in Obama's leadership since Shapiro
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.560]  adding he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.000]  who can command confidence in short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma city bombing. I can't think of
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.600]  how he can do that. Governor Ventura, is that chilling? Well, unbelievable. I mean that they
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.080]  talk about that it is fantastic to take place to have confidence in your president, what that he
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.040]  could fight a war that we have the strongest military in the world. We've already proven that.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.600]  You know, I just find it outrageous that someone would say that and what they'll do for political
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.720]  gain. Well, it's very brazen. They think we're a bunch of idiots to be talking like that openly.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.480]  Governor, in closing, let's talk about the issue of the First Amendment and give out that number
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:15.360]  one more time. This is Ken Hawes and he's the U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs and he's the guy
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:21.680]  that wouldn't allow me and in the letter to Michelle Bachman it said his office also stated
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.120]  that he would almost certainly not allow filming at John F. Kennedy's eternal flame without the
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:35.360]  permission of the Kennedy family. So he's saying the Kennedy family has to give permission to film
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:42.080]  at the eternal flame. Wasn't the eternal flame to burn eternally for all of us to see it? Take
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:49.120]  pictures of it and live with it? And then it goes on to say, uh, uh, justly Mr. Hawes stated that
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:54.480]  you were denied in part because of the nature of your television program, specifically stated the
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.920]  topic of your particular episode which alleges the United States government was directly involved
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:06.240]  in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is contrary to the mission of the United States
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:13.920]  Army. Now, first of all, Alex, they didn't know what's in my show. My show hasn't aired yet.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.960]  So they're simply assuming what's in there and then they're denying me because of the content
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:26.080]  of the show. John Kennedy was rooted in Dallas and if you don't go along with the official story
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.360]  you are not allowed to film at his eternal flame. If I guess if you do go along with the official
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:37.280]  story, maybe then they'll let you. We didn't ask that. But again, his name is Ken Hawes,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:50.000]  his phone number is 310-235-7621. Once again, 310-235-7621. And I'd love for all real Americans
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.120]  to give this guy a call and give him a piece of your mind on who in the hell he thinks he is.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.320]  Well, Governor Jesse Ventura, if we don't hang together, we'll certainly hang separate as Benjamin
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.880]  Franklin said. Separately on this issue though, you said that Michelle Bachman,
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:13.040]  the Congresswoman from your state, is very upset about this. We need to have an investigation or
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.480]  I mean, pretty soon the military will tell us how to wipe our noses. Exactly. And what's the
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.640]  military doing inside our country telling us things like that? The US military is supposed
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.320]  to protect us not from ourselves. They're supposed to protect us from foreign invasion
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:36.000]  or foreign powers. But it seems they're becoming too much involved internally in our country,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.200]  which I think Alex is part of the plan. And your book covers a lot of this. It's so jam-packed,
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.920]  American conspiracies. And incidentally, it's available at infowars.com. You get a free film
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.240]  of your choice when you get the book American conspiracies at infowars.com. It just covers
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:56.240]  basically all the key issues. I think it's Jesse Ventura's best book and is a New York Times top
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:03.280]  10 bestseller. We only got about two minutes left, Gov. So much is happening, but it sounds like this
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.560]  second season is even more adventure and action packed than the last one. I think it's going to
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.360]  be. It certainly is being more adventurous and doing it. I guess we were under the radar the
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.720]  first year we did it, but now it's aired on TV. So we've obviously gotten the attention of the
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.120]  United States government. There's no doubt about that. And what, eight to 10 episodes this season?
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.640]  Yeah, eight for sure and possibly 10. We're doing eight for sure. We've completed, we're almost
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.360]  completed half of them now. So half of them are just about ready to go into the editing room and
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:41.200]  be put together into a final form. And then we got the other four to do before October. And it
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.240]  should be on the air. I'm guessing around mid-October sometime. Well, Gov.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.280]  Governor, that is Alex, unless Mr. Haas has something to say about it. I'm sure if they
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.240]  asked for his input, my show would be censored and not allowed on television. Well, what is the
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:02.240]  army involved in what views of American citizens, much less a former governor is? I don't know.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.160]  You tell me, to me they're overreaching their bounds dramatically and this Ken Haas guy should
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:14.000]  be relieved of whatever his duty is. Well, we talked last time a month or so ago about an
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.280]  awakening. I am seeing an awakening. So I hope the pendulum starts really swinging against all this
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.560]  tyranny. Me too. Alex, I got a run. You take care and I'll keep in touch and I'll let you know
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.160]  anything else that goes on. All right, Governor Jesse Ventura, thanks for keeping us abreast
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.480]  the situation. Thanks for the fit in the second or the first amendment. Take care. Okay, goodbye,
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.400]  Alex. All right, there goes Governor Jesse Ventura about to go do a big interview on his JFK
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.560]  investigation. We appreciate him contacting us and giving us this exclusive breakdown of what's
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.640]  going on with the production. There's a lot more happening behind the scenes, but I'm not at liberty
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.080]  to talk about it, but it'll be coming out on the TV show in the fall. Stay with us.

[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.400]  You've seen the mainstream media say that he's quote,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.320]  quarterbacking and commanding all the attacks on our forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Of
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:42.000]  course, from my research, this is not the case. He was the big hero, the Pakistani general,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.080]  the head of the ISI, who led the attacks against the Soviet invasion. And let me read over his
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.960]  bio, then he'll be with us for the next hour. Hamid Ghul was commissioned in the Pakistani
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:34:00.880]  Army in 58. He was an armored corps, 19 Lancers tank commander in major battles on the front with
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:07.920]  India in 1965. During 72 to 76, he directly served under another top general as battalion commander
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.480]  when General Zia was the GOC first armored division and commander of the second corps.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.880]  It goes on. Ghul was promoted to Brigadier General in 1978 and steadily rose to be commander of the
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:30.000]  first armored division in 1980. Ghul was then sent to the GHQ as the DG military intelligence
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.800]  under top general, who then nominated him as the ISI chief succeeding another general in March of
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:45.520]  1987. He was later replaced by ISI commander by Prime Minister Benazir Budo in May of 1989.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.520]  He was then transferred to commander of the second corps. In this capacity,
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:57.840]  General Ghul conducted the Zarb-e Moa military exercise in November, December of 89, the biggest
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:04.960]  Pakistani armed forces show of muscle since 71 Indo-Pakistan war until now. So he's been a frontline
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:10.320]  commander and of course a general and the head of Pakistani intelligence and I won't go any further.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.840]  I've got an huge laundry list of things to talk about with the general. Two years ago when they
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.800]  had the Mumbai attacks, he came on the show and said the evidence shows it was staged by British
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:28.640]  Israeli and US intelligence. It's now come out in the Chicago Tribune with the headline that
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:36.320]  US agent was the head of that attack. The head of Indian intelligence also said the West led
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.520]  the false flag attack to blame it on Pakistan and to get Pakistan and India fighting again.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:46.720]  That's how they play them off against each other. Hamid Ghul has also questioned the official story
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:54.880]  of 9-11. He's also going to give us his expert take on why the US is quote failing in its war
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:01.520]  in Afghanistan and he joins us now for a full hour. Lieutenant General Hamid Ghul, thank you for
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:09.040]  joining us. And thank you my greetings to all your audience please. Why did you agree to come on this
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:15.200]  broadcast general? Well basically because my version is not going out to America. I have been
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:22.720]  denied the visa to travel to America and these people would not let me into America because
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.600]  they're afraid that I will speak the truth. People will listen to the truth and then they
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:34.880]  would find out that these people have made a mess of the American plans. They are actually
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.560]  deceiving their own people. The American generals are failing. The American intelligence is a
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.160]  disaster and they know that I will speak in their idiom and because I've worked with them
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:53.600]  I've done my intelligence course. You did not mention it in my career record. I did an intelligence
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:01.360]  course in Okinawa when I was a captain under the US Army and I know exactly where the failings are
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:07.920]  and they do not want it exposed but lately I was quite concerned because I was on Fritz
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:16.640]  Zakaria show GPS from two weeks back or maybe 10-12 days back and also with Becky Anderson
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:25.120]  and they cut me out totally not Becky Anderson but Fritz Zakaria he recorded me for 30 minutes
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:32.080]  but he put out only six minutes of my version. That is not fair because I was informed and
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:39.200]  especially the things that I said which were stark realities and he wanted obviously to keep
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:46.480]  the American people in dark about these things. Failing which are going on in Afghanistan of
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.280]  the American policy of the American military generals they are failing in every possible
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:38:00.720]  respect. This is my academic position and I am prepared to face any general in America any
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:07.360]  people in the academia that look this is what is going wrong. I am a friend of American people
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.320]  I criticize their policy and they think that anyone who criticizes the policy is the enemy.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.600]  This is totally wrong. This is a misperception. We work together with the CIA. We work together
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.320]  with the Americans. I have lot of friends there. I respect them and I could also my advice could
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:30.080]  also be useful even at this time because nobody understands their farm society better than I do
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:35.760]  because I worked with them. I read their soul. I read their spirit and I know I respect those
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:42.080]  people. I admire their courage and their valor. They have to be your friends. It's a period. I'm
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:48.960]  telling you you cannot afford to lose Afghanistan as a friendly country but unfortunately the way
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.560]  things are going if they are not handled properly the future of Afghanistan would be hostile to
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.200]  America which would neither be in the interest of Pakistan nor in the interest of America and its
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.800]  allies. But general it would be in the interest of the global crime syndicate known as the New
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.880]  World Order that wants to bring order out of chaos that wants to create crises that
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.960]  wants to destabilize Pakistan and Afghanistan and ship hundreds of billions of dollars of opium
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.800]  out of year to the streets of America. They think we're so stupid they admit on Fox News
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:28.480]  that our troops help grow the opium in Afghanistan now. So the reasons we're there
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.960]  we're publicly told one thing but we're actually there for another reason destabilization. I want
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:40.960]  you to speak to that and see if you agree but first you are live uncensored. What do you want to
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.800]  tell the American people on more than 80 AM and FM radio stations and the number one internet radio
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.320]  show in the world? What do you want to tell the world about what's really happening in Afghanistan
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.840]  and Pakistan because just three weeks ago they finally admitted that they had been lying and
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:07.040]  that USA troops and mercenaries Blackwater and others have been operating illegally inside
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.200]  Pakistan in what I have analyzed to be a destabilization campaign. What's really going on over there
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:21.360]  general? Well we know that Blackwater is now operating under the title of the Worldwide Services
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.480]  and then Corp which is another such organization. They are called the security contractor. This is a
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:37.040]  fundamental fault. There are 105,000 security contractors, the troopers of the security
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:43.440]  contractor operating in Afghanistan alone and I guess there are no figures available. I think
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:50.960]  no less than 2000 are operating inside Pakistan. Now this is something which ought never have to
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:57.680]  been done because the reason is that the professional army is when they start engaging the services
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:06.800]  of civilians whose motivation is none other than making money and cashing dollars then you can
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.720]  expect the kind of results that the Americans are getting and American people, the taxpayers,
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.840]  they have to shut out a lot of money, a lot of American blood is going waste. Now all this
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  is a disaster because you and now the latest one is the WikiLeaks. In this again all the
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.280]  compilation that they have been doing on which they have been basing their plans, I tell you it's
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.440]  a disaster, it's an intelligence disaster. Why? Because they have heavily dependent,
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:44.960]  they have depended on the security contractors for even intelligence gathering. Now imagine how
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:53.520]  can they be such foolish people? I mean the CIA, the FBI and all the other and to top it all there
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:01.280]  is this Task 4373 which has been indulging in massive civilian casualties. They've been killing
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.160]  people left, right and center and every time they have given the information they have bombed the
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:12.880]  marriage parties, they have bombed the funeral processions, they have bombed innocent and they
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:19.600]  have even bombed the hospitals. So can you imagine that the intelligence based on the
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:28.320]  information provided by security contractors has resulted in this massive violation of human rights.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:35.120]  It has been anti-humanity, it has destroyed everything that American people and American
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:43.360]  Constitution ever stood for. It has defied the spirit of the original charter of America, American
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:49.920]  Constitution and human rights charter. Everything that you hold so dear to your heart, the American
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.240]  people, they have violated it here in Pakistan and Afghanistan. General let me go back to something
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.600]  you said, I'm going to put it in layman terms. You have tens of billions of dollars in no bid
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:10.960]  contracts going to Dincorp, going to XZ, formerly Blackwater Worldwide. They have an incentive
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:17.280]  to want the wars to continue and to be expanded because they're making billions of dollars out
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:22.160]  of it. So of course they're going to give intelligence to blame Pakistan and widen the war.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:28.560]  Of course they're going to give intelligence that targets civilians knowing that there is the honor
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.240]  code in Pakistan and Afghanistan just like there was in the past here in America before we lost
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.200]  our souls to a certain extent, that if you kill somebody's wife or children, they are going to
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:45.920]  kill you or die trying to kill you with this blood honored debt. That's why they continue and now
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:54.800]  they admit have the CIA and the army piloting drones from Virginia and they are killing quote,
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.960]  in fact guys search this term, no name terrorist. If someone has a gun, when everybody has guns
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:06.080]  over there, you know so-called free country like America used to be and they are killing innocent
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.840]  people knowing it's going to stir them up and make them mad so they fight back, then they can call
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.720]  them terrorist, then they can expand the war, then the contractors can make more money.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:25.840]  Precisely Alex, this is exactly, you have painted it so beautifully and so vividly there could not
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:33.280]  be a better explanation. This honor code is as old as the Afan society itself. I mean it runs
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:40.880]  through their blood for past 50, 5000 years and this is called Pakhtunwali. Pakhtunwali is an
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:48.640]  honor code. This evokes even stronger sentiments than the religion. Therefore these people are
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:56.320]  not going to forgive all this and I am afraid that we will have lost this region forever to America,
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:02.560]  to the West and this will not be good for us. I agree. I think it is still time that we redress
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:10.000]  the situation and some sense is driven into the heads which seem to be totally blocked to or
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.720]  impervious to any kind of sensible suggestion. But I think we must keep on trying. I think this
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:22.880]  is the last lap in which we are now going and this struggle is going to end in a very big
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:28.800]  disaster for American reputation, for their honor, for their self-respect and we don't want to have
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.800]  this done. I can assure you, I generally am telling this because American people are such noble
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:41.920]  people. Sometimes they say they are so gullible and they are so innocent that this borders on being
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.480]  criminally innocent because of their innocence we are suffering. We are suffering for no
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:55.520]  rhyme or reason at all but because American people's gullibility, their innocence is exploited by their
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.360]  leaders. That is why we suffer and they suffer as well. So I think this is time now we redress the
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.960]  situation. Well, General, as you know, this is the Divide and Conquer British model. You had
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.960]  Mohamed Mosaddegh, somewhat secular, pro-western, but he wanted to build up Iran and keep some of
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.800]  their own money. So they used radical Muslims to overthrow him. Then they put the Shah in
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:26.880]  and double crossed the Muslims. Then the same thing with the Serbs. They used the Albanians to
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:32.080]  break up southern Serbia. Same thing with Saddam. They put him in power. They have him overthrow
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:37.520]  the Bathas. They put him in power. They have him attack Iran. Then they tell him invade Kuwait.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:44.720]  Then they set him up. Now they've set up sectarian Sunni Shiite violence. Everything is to break down
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:52.320]  and destabilize your countries. So there is a rhyme and reason to this. It's just so cold-blooded
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:47:02.160]  and so evil, the average person cannot grasp it. That's right. Alex, I think America, American
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.440]  policy makers have for their own reason. I don't know. I have not been able to tell them that yet,
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.440]  but they have allowed the old British, what would we say, mischievous mind to
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:25.040]  lead American policymaking by the nose. And I can tell you, I know them. I worked with them. I did
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:32.000]  my staff course there in Kimberly in the UK. And I know them inside out. They are extremely jealous
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.640]  of America. They do not want to see America flourish. Inside their heart, they want to pull
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:47.200]  their leg. They make full of them and they talk about it. They have coined jokes for the American.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:55.680]  So this has to be done away with. That is fundamental. The other power, which for its own
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:01.680]  reason, and those are very mischievous reasons, that is Israel. And Israel now is joined in by
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:08.000]  the Indians, unfortunately. So together, they formed the club. That club, as you can call it,
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:15.920]  the extra or ultra-imperial club. This imperial club is responsible for a lot of problems in the
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:22.080]  world. And American people are exploited. They are the most innocent people on God's earth,
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:28.560]  but they are exploited to the hilt for that implementation of their dark impulse and their
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:35.920]  dark agenda, which is the only handful of people. They are clique only in my assessment who are
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.560]  indulging in this exercise. General, let's get into WikiLeaks. I noticed day one that what the
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.800]  media focused on out of 90 plus thousand documents were documents, battlefield reports, as you said,
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.200]  fed by private contractors, classically unreliable, completely unreliable. It's like going to the
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:02.880]  devil for the truth. And it all points at Pakistan. It all points at you. It says that Hamid Ghul,
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:10.480]  here's the quote, is quarterbacking, this is the Washington Post, is quarterbacking direct attacks
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:19.040]  against U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is diabolical nonsense. And if this is the
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:25.920]  kind of intelligence that America is basing its policies on in this region, then God help America
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.880]  because this is totally false. It's fabricated. And I tell you who are the elements involved in it?
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:39.840]  One, the Afghan intelligence. And good luck that Amarullah Saleh, who was an old communist,
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:46.000]  who was heading the intelligence setup of Afghanistan, and the intelligence service there
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:53.120]  in Afghanistan is still infested by the old communist diehard. And they have an axe to grind
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:50:00.560]  especially against me as a person because I was responsible in part for their ouster from Afghanistan,
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:07.040]  from their ouster from power. Then the Indians have joined up with them and they also have
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.040]  things to settle with Pakistan. They want to destabilize Pakistan. They're sitting on our
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:18.240]  back under the shadow of America. And they're stabbing Pakistan and ally, a friend of America.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.680]  We have been friends not now, but we have been friends right through the days of Cold War.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.000]  Ever since Mr. Dulles, Foster Dulles, he framed the policy of befriending Pakistan.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.480]  We have been a very loyal friend of America and we have given huge sacrifices to uphold
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:42.160]  that friendship. But unfortunately, the Indians would have us put down completely
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:48.480]  and they would want Pakistan to be subservient to India. This is not acceptable to people of
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:57.680]  Pakistan. Now, this is how WikiLeaks has been giving. Of course, there are only 180 reports
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:02.240]  with regard to Pakistan and my personal eight times I've been mentioned in this.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:11.040]  But I said to the CNN also, for heaven's sake, if you think that a 74 years old general retired
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:18.320]  from 18 and a half years ago from the army and left eyesight 21 years ago, if he's still
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:23.920]  responsible for defeating America in Afghanistan, which is inevitable because America is now,
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.880]  they have to continents with defeat in Afghanistan. There is no way. And I will speak about it
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:38.880]  professionally at a later stage if you ask me. So if they are going to record it in history,
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:45.680]  in the history books, what are the American future generation going to read that the mightiest power
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:52.800]  ever in the history of the mankind was defeated with the help of a retired 74 years old general
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:58.640]  living in his house in a retired life. I mean, this would be shameful. They would be ashamed of
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:04.720]  it. Let the future generation not be ashamed. Speak the truth that you have failed. You have
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:10.160]  failed because your own policymakers have not come up with the recipes that were required.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.960]  Your own generals would not measure up to the task that was given to them. So why don't you
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:22.560]  accept the failure rather than rub the blame on somebody else and start finding scapegoats and
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:30.000]  those two scapegoats which would not sell in the market. Please, for God's sake, as far as I am
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.360]  concerned, I can tell you my future generation will be proud that he was responsible not only
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:41.280]  in defeat of one superpower, but in defeat of another superpower also. But that's not the case.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:47.360]  I don't want America to be defeated there. I want them to exit Afghanistan gracefully. I don't want
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:52.800]  them to get involved into a running fight in Afghanistan like they did in Vietnam. Why don't
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:58.960]  they learn their lesson? And in Vietnam also, it's not too far back in history, West, general
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:04.160]  Westmoreland, he was an utter failure and he was such a big hero. He was being cast in the image
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:09.840]  of a hero and he kept on demanding more and more troops. In the end, he had something like
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:17.120]  556,000 troops, over half a million troops. And what did you do? I mean, they ran out from
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:23.200]  Vietnam. Why could they not have thought of it earlier on? And similar situation now confronts
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:30.240]  them in Afghanistan. So it's from my point of view, being a friend of America, I want
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:36.640]  that America should go out gracefully, leaving behind them a friendly Afghanistan and it is
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:42.240]  possible. I can tell you it is doable. It is still doable, but tomorrow it may not be doable.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:49.840]  Today it is doable from my point of view. As I assess the situation, it is doable. It is doable
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.440]  that Afghan society is allowed to evolve slowly into a modern society. Okay, also doable.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:02.000]  General, I think there will be no option left to cut and run out of Afghanistan.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.520]  General, we just skipped that break, but some stations I may have gone to. We're talking to
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:14.240]  Lieutenant General Hamid Ghul, former head of Pakistani intelligence. And I want to get more
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.320]  into WikiLeaks. I want to go back to the Mumbai attack because you joined us a few years ago,
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.960]  just a few weeks after that tragic event, and you fingered Western intelligence for staging it
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:32.800]  to stir up enmity between India and Pakistan and as a pretext to bring US forces covertly into
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:38.880]  Pakistan. We now know that was the case. I want to show viewers mainstream news here in the United
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:43.920]  States, including the Chicago Tribune and others, admitting that quote, the head of that attack
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:50.960]  was a US agent and explain to people why they do this. But first, let's get into
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:58.800]  a basic boil down from your military expertise and expert on the region, what the real policy,
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:05.600]  what the real objective has been by the United States being used by these globalists inside
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:11.280]  your country and bordering Afghanistan. A, what are they really doing there? What's their real
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:20.560]  aims versus their public aims? B, what has really happened in the eight years of occupation and C,
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:27.360]  where all this is going? Yeah, nine years of occupation, nine years of this dirty war which
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.680]  has been going on for a wrong purpose, at a wrong time, in a wrong place. Now, what is the real,
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:40.960]  the declared or the stated goal of the war was to disperse Al Qaeda, to catch Osama bin Laden.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:48.800]  And now lately President Obama has come up with a new formulation and that says that we have to
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:55.840]  reverse the momentum of Taliban. And who are Taliban? Taliban are resistance fighters. They
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:02.960]  are the Mujahideen of the old. I mean, they are the same people or their sons and sons who fought
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.000]  against the Soviet Union. And they are fighting for the same reason as they were fighting against
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:14.880]  the Soviet Union at that time. What is that reason? That reason is to protect their way of life,
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.400]  whatever it is. You may not agree with that way of life. But the point is, as you are jealous
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:27.040]  of protecting your way of life, they are jealous of protecting their way of life. The other is
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:35.840]  liberation because they look upon the Americans and the Allied forces as the occupation forces.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:40.640]  And so they want to liberate. They will not settle for anything less than that. So really,
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:46.240]  you are fighting the Afghan nation. Do you want to reverse the momentum of the Afghan nation?
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.800]  Is it achievable? In my opinion, it is not achievable. It is not worth it. It is,
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:57.120]  first of all, it is not proper. It is not morally correct that you should be trying to
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:04.720]  state jacket a nation and as a nation as proud as the Afghans in certain
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:11.520]  mold that you have visualized for them. This is immoral. This is incorrect and it is not achievable.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:18.800]  So the real aim, the hidden aim, the latent aim, I have been saying that before also.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:28.720]  That was basically A, for corporate America to install itself within the center of the oil
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:37.200]  rich area, the resources of the Caspian basin, Caspian sea basin area, resources of the Middle
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:44.880]  East, B to check China from moving into this region. That is the strategy came and C to
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:52.000]  any new system should not emerge because they are afraid that their system is a failure.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:59.440]  And if any new system based on Islamic principles of egalitarian, egalitarianism, equality,
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.600]  fraternity and freedom, if these principles are really adopted, then imperial powers will have
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:13.520]  no place to hide. So really, this was the second, third aim. And fourth one, unfortunately, and
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:20.000]  very unfortunate for America is to provide a security shield to the state of Israel.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:28.080]  And with that, they want to strengthen India. Now imagine a country as big, as powerful,
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:35.280]  as enlightened as America should be acting to provide security to somebody else.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:50.960]  General Gould, General Gould got a break back in 70 seconds, continue.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:13.520]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:18.640]  nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:23.360]  an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:29.040]  Republic has fallen. Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:34.960]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:40.480]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:12.240]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:21.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.840]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, for the last 30 minutes, retired Lieutenant General Hamid Gould has been
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:36.400]  our guest former head of Pakistani intelligence. The Washington Post wrote, if the documents
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:42.160]  are to be believed and the uncooperated U.S. intelligence reports must be read with caution,
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:48.560]  so they add that this is just battlefield reports fed by contractors. Gull has taken a
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:55.040]  direct hand in quarterbacking attacks against U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:01.680]  Gould calls the reports fiction and nothing else. So this is a guy from what I've seen
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.000]  who's told the truth. I mean, I don't trust anybody except my wife and children and God,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.240]  but I just go off long-term study, long-term looking at geopolitical systems, the British
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.600]  model of a great game that our country's adopted, how we're being used. I mean, for five years,
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.480]  U.S. troops and contractors have been sneaking around in Afghanistan, excuse me, nine years there
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.400]  in Pakistan. And now they came out three weeks ago and admitted, okay, we lied to you,
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.760]  we got contractors and troops there. And, you know, Gould said two years ago on this show,
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:41.920]  they were there to stir up the tribal areas to destabilize Pakistan. And now that's admitted.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:48.560]  I mean, these global corporations that suck us dry with these wars, they have a motive
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:52.880]  to expand these wars. So this is a short segment general, but brief answers on this,
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:58.160]  finishing up on Israel and the U.S. being used as a tool that you were talking about there.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:04.560]  And then how can we get out of there on friendly terms with the Pakistan's folks and with the
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:13.520]  Afghans and versus how it will end if we don't pull out? Well, let me tell you that there is
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:19.360]  everything to begin by pulling out and there's everything to be lost by continuing to stay here.
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:25.520]  So that's my judgment and I'm quite convinced that this is right. Now, by pulling out,
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.240]  you are going to, because there is a natural affinity between America and Pakistan and
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:37.120]  America and even Afghanistan because, you know, they have cooperated in the past throughout.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.960]  We have a long history of cooperation. When India was in the USSR camp, Pakistan was all
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:48.880]  along was in Afghanistan too, was in the American camp. Afghanistan made a mistake of being in the
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.800]  U.S. U.S.R. camp and U.S.R. came and attacked it at that time. And of course, they resisted.
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.320]  And Pakistan stood behind them. America stood behind them also. And then don't forget that.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:06.560]  So if you pull out and that is very simple, you have to have a change of heart. And I have given
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:13.840]  that message clearly. I said, I am prepared to come discuss with you, face the court, go for a
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:19.040]  hearing before the Senate or the Congress, whatever you want me to do. I am prepared. If I am a
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:28.480]  terrorist, if I am quarterbacking, as you rightly said, this attacks in Afghanistan, then you can
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.920]  catch me. I mean, there is a terrorist who is offering himself. He says, okay, catch me,
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:40.960]  hold me responsible. Take me anywhere to Congress, to any court, to any interrogation center. I am
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.560]  prepared for all this. They are lying. I tell you, they are lying to the American people more
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:53.680]  than anyone else. And we have, if they have a change of heart, we will find ways and means
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:04:00.800]  when they can pull out safely. They will not be followed. Now the speech that President Obama made
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:09.600]  on 8th of May 2009 in Cairo addressing the Al-Azhar University, I think that was remarkable
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:16.400]  because in this he had said, if there is no chance of attack or there is no threat of attack from
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:22.960]  that region to America, then in that case, we are prepared to pull out every single troop from that
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:31.200]  region. And I, at that time, also on some of the TV channels, I said that this is a legitimate
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:36.640]  demand. Okay, we accept this, that there should be no attack on America from this area.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.240]  That's not what has ever been found in the past also. And that automatically means that the
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:48.400]  responsibility will be on the new government, which will be installed in Afghanistan to make
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:54.320]  sure that there is no threat to American interest. General, I'm sorry to interrupt you. We've got
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.160]  to go to break. Come back and repeat that thought and finish it up. We'll be right back with General
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:04.320]  Hamid Ghul. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:08.720]  soap, not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company,
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:13.920]  a family-owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.560]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.440]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:06.160]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:11.200]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:16.560]  bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:21.760]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:27.440]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:32.960]  the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.640]  the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:43.920]  with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,

[02:06:50.880 --> 02:07:00.000]  the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:08.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:19.520]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.640]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:29.920]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:34.400]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.720]  from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:42.880]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:47.120]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:29.280]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:35.280]  to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the super states that preceded it,
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:43.840]  it has one iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:58.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:08.320]  Well, we've been talking to Lieutenant General Hamid Ghul about a host of really
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:18.400]  important issues, and he's joining us from Pakistan. Last time we had him on,
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:25.200]  the regular phone number was being blocked, and we were having trouble getting through on the other
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:32.720]  line, and it looks like we may be having some phone troubles now. We may try to reconnect
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:41.280]  with him in a moment. General, do we have you? Now, again, I have researched all of this information
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:48.880]  in depth, and we've had the former CIA commander for the entire Afghan war on,
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:54.560]  he wrote the book, Jawbreaker, and he admitted that they would pick up 12, 13, 14, 15-year-old kids
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:02.320]  and would send them to Guantanamo Bay as terrorists, knowing they were totally innocent,
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:09.120]  just to create the solution. It's a manufactured war as a pretext to feed our trips into a meat grinder
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:19.120]  as a giant laboratory of control, and that's the bottom line of what's been going on here.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:28.400]  Going back to General Hamid Ghul, General, I have looked at all of the information
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:35.680]  concerned here, and clearly the Pentagon plan is to expand the war into Pakistan. They now admit
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:42.000]  that U.S. forces and contractors are there illegally. Congress had been lied to about this.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:47.200]  Where is all this leading, and what are the Western forces doing in Pakistan?
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:54.880]  Well, they're on sabotage, subversion mission, and inciting people to rise against the
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:02.240]  federal government of Pakistan. So they are on destabilizing exercise, not realizing that this
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:06.640]  is going to hurt them more than it is going to hurt us, because we are in any case suffering.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.640]  There is a state of flood at the moment we are facing in Pakistan. It's a great human tragedy
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:20.640]  that we are in the middle of it. And on top of it, our friends, America, and their allies,
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:27.680]  some of their allies, and India, they are in collusion to bash Pakistan and to really
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:33.200]  unravel it from inside. But this is very unfair, and I don't think they will be able to do it at
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:39.520]  the end of the day. I think if they get embroiled in Pakistan, then they will keep on staying here
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:44.960]  for a very long time. And I don't think the American people have a heart for it. I think
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:52.240]  60% of Americans are already against this war. And if they're going to expand this war, because I
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:58.720]  know one thing, the irregular fight that is going to be put up to Americans, whether in Pakistan,
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:07.200]  Afghanistan, or Iran, now the larger the area of conflict and longer the period of conflict,
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:14.800]  the established power, the one who is equipped with more firepower, cannot win. This is a lesson
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:21.680]  from history, and it is immutable. Because if they enlarge the area of conflict, then they will get
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.360]  more embroiled into some of the very difficult things which they can't foresee at this moment.
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:34.240]  So I think it is professionally very, very unwise for America to get involved into a conflict inside
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:43.840]  Pakistan. General Gould, where is this leading if the United States doesn't pull out? I mean,
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:49.200]  clearly our government, controlled by these offshore corporate interests, wants to expand this into
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.720]  Pakistan with this destabilization. From your research, how many contractors are sneaking
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:03.440]  around in your country versus regular US forces? Well, I think security contractors, at this moment,
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:11.120]  they are trying to spread their wings into Balochistan area. And Americans have been granted
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:17.040]  permission, it is understood, to open because they arm twisters of our government and our leaders
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:24.080]  very conveniently. And they are going to open a consulate in Quetta. And I think this would,
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:32.240]  it will have two purposes. One, to continue to fan the ongoing insurgency, which is artificially
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:41.600]  being sponsored in Balochistan, which is largest of our provinces because of its very huge size and
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  because of its borders with the background coast, the coastal line mostly is covered by this province.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:55.120]  And it's a long border with Iran. It is about 900 kilometers long border that we share with Iran.
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:04.320]  So it has two purpose, A, to destabilize Pakistan and B, to get inside Iran and try to destabilize
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:11.120]  them because those areas are Sunni populated. And they are definitely trying to create a problem
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:19.200]  for Iran from that point. So really, at this moment, I would put the figure of the security
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:25.120]  contacts, contractors to less than 5000. I don't think they are more than this number.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:33.760]  And they are trying to expand because very recently 650 visas were issued to American
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:38.800]  servicemen and they come in CVs. This is very unfortunate that servicemen,
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:45.520]  traditionally, should be used in uniform. But when you start using them in civilian clothes,
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:54.560]  this is not their job. A soldier is bought and bred and he is taught, his training is to fight
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:59.760]  clearly on the battlefield. So they are trying to turn them into undercover agents. Exactly,
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.880]  trying to turn them into covert spies so they can't be differentiated between them,
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:12.400]  regular troops and the different contractors. Speaking of Iran, General Gull, we continue
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:22.080]  to hear over and over again that Iran is funding insurgency in Pakistan and Afghanistan. And many
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.560]  analysts, even here in the West, even many people in the CIA say that that's asinine,
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:33.760]  that that's a lie. What's the truth there? Oh, it's not a lie. Believe me, Iran is not doing
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:40.560]  anything of this nature. But they would have us believe that Iran is our enemy. They are not
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:48.000]  our enemy. They have no hostility between Iran and Pakistan. That border is quiet. There is
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:54.880]  absolutely peaceful movement of goods and people on that border. So this is not a lie. It's only
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:16:04.560]  to malign Iran. But I tell you, Israel is hell bent to draw America into a wider war by attacking
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:14.080]  Iran. If they go in for, actually to attack some target, even drop a few bombs here and there,
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.600]  I think it will flare up a conflict that they will not be able to control. And America is likely
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:25.680]  to get sucked into this war. And this may turn out to be the third world war. It will be a disaster
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:31.200]  of the first order. I think it must be avoided at all costs. Well, General Gull, it's not just you,
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:36.640]  a formidable intelligence and military expert who's worked at every level from, you know,
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:43.360]  ground commander up to, you know, Major General right through here. But dealing with this,
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:49.200]  the word that I get from Ray McGovern, high level CIA analyst, retired and others,
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:55.040]  is that they're looking at greenlighting it this month. They may attack. Israel may attack
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:01.600]  in the next 15 days or even sooner. We are on the edge of what most even Western analysts say,
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.600]  and the Russians agree, could lead to World War III.
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:12.080]  Yes, I agree with you. I would say that independently. I didn't have this information
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:17.920]  that you have. But all the same, I think my calculation as a strategist and as an intelligence
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:24.560]  expert is that this would be a disaster. I don't think that Russia can be kept back or China for
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.880]  that matter. I don't know which of all other countries will get sucked into this, say,
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:36.000]  embryo. And this will be an inferno that will consume so many things. And corporate America
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.800]  would be the biggest sufferer. They don't realize this because if it results eventually
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:47.120]  in destabilization of the entire region, where are they going to sell their goods? And how are
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:53.200]  they going to pick up the oil? Especially the European countries will be the biggest sufferers.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:57.680]  And Japanese economy will collapse. So many things will happen. You can't simply clean
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:03.120]  calculable at this time. By the way, that's what literally hundreds of top Western analysts
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:08.480]  are saying. They confer with General Hamid Ghul. General, we're running out of time and we've
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.200]  got one more segment coming up. I may try to keep you a bit longer, but I wanted to get into
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.920]  some other issues. We're also simulcasting on television. If I can have a document cam shot
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:23.040]  right here. Evidence. Moonby attackers were Anglo-American Intel operatives. That's Kurt
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:30.800]  Nemo in November of 2008 about the Moonby attacks. Now we have December of last year,
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:38.560]  times of London. Moonby terrorist suspect David Headley was rogue US agent. The Chicago Tribune
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.320]  went on to report he was the commander of the operation. The head of Indian counterterrorism
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:49.920]  said it was a Western op, but they killed him that day to shut him up. Here's another one.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:56.400]  Chicago man charged in 2008 Moonby terror attacks intelligence connection. So how did you know
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:01.520]  two years ago, day one, that this was a Western op that they tried to blame on you and Pakistan?
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:08.000]  Well, I have an uncanny six sense about this because of my experience, because of the fact
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.120]  that I've worked with the CIA and I know how their mind works. I can read their mind.
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:23.120]  For instance, I had said that this attack 9 11 attack was because of the internal cavity
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:28.560]  in inside America itself. Today, they have not been able to come up with a charge sheet
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:33.600]  against Osama bin Laden. He should have been tried in absentia if they had enough evidence on him.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:39.760]  General, I got to stop you. This is too important. I want you to start over when we come back and
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:45.120]  talk about Osama bin Laden. Of course, CNN said that you had no evidence of that when bin Laden's
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.160]  on record saying you didn't do it. The CIA now admits two months ago that they created a fake
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:56.320]  bin Laden video. Print me that Washington Post. It's spy talk. CIA created fake bin Laden video.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.600]  Stay there. General Hamid Ghul, our guest will be right back.

[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:08.160]  Okay, he's a retired three-star general, so it is Lieutenant General,
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:15.200]  a former head of Pakistani intelligence, General Hamid Ghul, and he is with us today.
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:19.360]  And I have to tell you, I've researched this all in depth, myself. It's been declassified,
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:25.600]  the CIA, Mossad, MI6 stage terror attacks. They're doing everything they can to get us into a
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:31.760]  full-bore war with Pakistan. Then they'll have to go in with a full invasion to get the nukes.
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:38.320]  And I, I mean, if you think that the Afghans are tough and hard to beat, the Pakistanis are just
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:42.480]  as tough or tougher and have nuclear weapons. But I'll get into that in a moment with General
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:47.440]  Ghul. General Ghul, you, I brought up the Mumbai attacks. It was later confirmed that that was
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:52.880]  run by Western intelligence and you were getting into 9-11 being an inside job. Please spend some
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:59.760]  time on that. Yeah, 9-11, they haven't given the evidence so far. And I think much hype was created
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:05.360]  now they don't even mention about Osama bin Laden. The latest statement is by General Petraeus.
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.520]  He said that he is so far away that whether he's alive or dead doesn't matter at all.
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:17.520]  So that means they have forgotten about Osama bin Laden now and they are out to destroy the
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:24.240]  Afghan nation and then come for Pakistan. From day one, I said 9-11 was a pretext.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:30.400]  Afghanistan is the lodging place. This is the staging point and from there they will jump
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:37.840]  into Pakistan. And I fear that this is coming true. But in Pakistan, they are overwhelming
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.640]  interest of both India and Israel. It's not America's interest because America won't bother
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:48.480]  whether Pakistan has 30, 40 or 100 bombs. It makes no difference to America. We have no such
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:54.560]  hostility between us. In fact, we have been very fast friends in the past and we still are friends.
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:26:00.880]  Anyway, the point is that Israel would simply not be able to digest Pakistan's nuclear program
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:07.760]  nor the Indians. So Pakistan's nuclear program is one point which needs to be
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:14.480]  now resolved one way or another. Either they have to accept that Pakistan is a de facto
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.040]  nuclear power and should be entered into the nuclear club because that's a reality.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:25.920]  And the fact that they have not accepted it while India's nuclear capability has been accepted,
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:32.480]  that means they are still out to destroy it somehow. They can't reverse it and they cannot
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:40.640]  destroy it. Now that is where my understanding of Pakistan's ability, Pakistan's will to resist
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:47.280]  the resilience comes into play. I can assure you there is a complete consensus in Pakistan
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:55.920]  on this one issue, that nuclear capability we have to protect even if in the process we end up
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:02.560]  with a total destruction. Doesn't matter, but we will protect this capability of ours. It's a
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:09.760]  great asset for Pakistan. But my fear, Alex, is that if Pakistan is put to the corner and it is
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:17.760]  pushed against the wall, Pakistan being an Islamic state could also declare international jihad.
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:24.800]  Now if that Islamic state declares international jihad, it becomes binding on the Muslims of the
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:31.840]  rest of the world to come out in support of jihad. That is what will change the modern history
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:39.360]  altogether if that call is given. So let Pakistan not be taken lightly by the adversaries, by India,
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:47.040]  by Israel or even by America. Pakistan has a potential, which is very dangerous potential.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:54.160]  We wouldn't like to do that. But if we have no other charge, if it is existentialist threat to us,
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.800]  then anything is possible. And it better be avoided by our adversaries.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:06.720]  General, I'm showing viewers spy talk, the issue from about two months ago in the Washington Post
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:13.760]  with a headline CIA's unit, wacky idea depicts Saddam as gay, but buried in the article, they
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:20.960]  admit that they made fake bin Laden videos. The famous bin Laden video is a fake. So
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:26.160]  bin Laden was writing letters saying he didn't do this after the attacks. Meanwhile, they used
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:32.560]  message boards and fake videos and they admit it was a fake video. Why would the CIA arrogantly come
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:37.600]  out and admit they're growing the opium? Why would they arrogantly come out and brag that they are
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:44.880]  creating fake bin Laden videos? I mean, why are they so arrogant? Well, this is the imperial
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:51.200]  arrogance, imperial hubris, which I think afflicts every nation which comes into that position,
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:56.400]  where it stands at the pinnacle and there is no one to destroy them, but they themselves,
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:03.360]  their own internal cavities destroy them, their own arrogance and their own sense of injustices.
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:09.200]  I mean, that is what destroys them. So I think they are, this system is all self-destruct.
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:15.840]  Unfortunately, their status somehow they are not able to handle it properly. The sole superpower
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:22.880]  status, because they are lesser men, the leaders are lesser leaders. There are big knees as far as
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:31.440]  intellectual capacity is concerned, as far as their moral equality is concerned, they are
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:36.720]  picking me. This is the problem of the leadership. So I think while we in the third one countries
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:43.760]  usually cry about our leaders, I think poor America is also really the rest of the quality
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:47.680]  leadership that they deserve at this time. General, stay there. Final segment with you

[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:08.800]  the American people draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:13.440]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy,
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:18.400]  not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land,
[02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:24.320]  they think they're on our water, children, our education, our money. We have to define who we
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:30.080]  are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising.
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:35.360]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the bill of rights, we have common law.

[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:23.200]  from the front lines of the Info War. Free Star General Hamid Ghul, former head of Pakistani
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:29.520]  intelligence who led the forces to victory against the Soviet bear. When you watch the films and
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:35.280]  read the documents about the Soviets massacring villages, carpet bombing villages, it's exactly
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:41.040]  what our criminal government's doing. The same corporations that have occupied Afghanistan using
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:48.480]  our military are occupying my country. They're waging war against my bill of rights, my constitution,
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:53.760]  my children's future. I want my republic back. I want to be known as the land of the free,
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:59.440]  home of the brave, an example of goodness, not an example of evil. They lie to you. They give you
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:05.280]  fake bin Laden videos. They stage terror attacks. They say Saddam's got WMDs when he doesn't.
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:12.000]  They want to start World War III, not just with Iran, but Pakistan. I concur with General
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:21.600]  Ghul's analysis 100% from my own deep 18-hour-a-day research many days. We are going into World War
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:27.760]  III. General Ghul, you talked about how they want to cause the collapse of Pakistan, how
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:32.880]  they're funding radicals there, which has been admitted. They've been caught and how they want
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:38.400]  Pakistan to have their back against a wall. So they have to declare an emergency jihad to protect
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:44.240]  themselves and call on aid, as Afghanistan did, so they can have what the PNAC documents and the
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:49.760]  Israelis and Dick Cheney called for in the September 20, 2000 Rebuilding America's Defenses
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:55.840]  PNAC document, a clash of civilizations. They want to force the American people into a bare-knuckle
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.960]  war to fully commit us. I believe they're going to set off nukes in the U.S. and blame it on
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:07.200]  Pakistan and Iran. I see them putting out this story to where the Americans will howl with pure
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:13.600]  rage. They will ship 3 million Americans over there, bloodthirsty, ready for absolute genocide.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.880]  And so your people, my people, have to stand together against the New World Order, just like
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.720]  they want to put two pit bulls in a ring and have us kill each other. We don't need to do this. We
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:29.520]  need to be smart enough to avert this, and the evidence is clear. We are on the verge of them
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:35.680]  launching World War III, a clash between Christendom, what's left of it in the West,
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.160]  and the East, a war without end. General, your comments.
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:46.000]  My comments are that there is no clash of civilization. This is a myth that has been created,
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.600]  unfortunately. There has to be a meeting of civilization. And as far as Islam is concerned,
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.960]  why is it being looked upon as an enemy, as an adversary? Islam encompasses Christianities
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:04.000]  and Judaism. It is not an entity in itself, but actually it encompasses all the three religions
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.560]  of the book. So there has to be enmity, peace among us, and everyone has to gain from it.
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:16.960]  And therefore, there is no need for the dark impulse in the American system. I won't say in
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:23.200]  the American people because they are so good. It is in the American system that dark impulse has
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:29.360]  to be removed. And it can only be removed by the American people if they rise against this,
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:35.520]  like the moratorium movement back in the Vietnam days, when it picked up from Berkeley's campus
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:43.040]  and then it spread across the cities and villages of a whole of America. It became the battle cry
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:50.320]  for American people that this was a useless war. This was a debilitating war. And we must
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:56.160]  quit as soon as possible, which they did. And of course, America still remained a great power.
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:02.480]  And eventually, because of the Afan blood, because of services of Pakistan and men like me,
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:09.440]  that America enjoys today the status of the sole superpower. Now, America is hell bent or that
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:16.640]  dark impulse in the American system is hell bent, that they destroy America's position as the sole
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:23.280]  superpower. So it has to be morally corrected. Unfortunately, telling lies with regard to
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:29.200]  Iraq, telling lies with regard to 9-11 and telling lies now with regard to Bombay attacks
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:36.240]  everywhere, it is lies, lies and lies, nothing else. And that is not going to be helpful because
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:43.440]  that is going to totally demolish the American position. American economy is in doldrums,
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:50.080]  but the generals of the Pentagon, they would want America to commit more forces in Afghanistan and
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.560]  elsewhere. And now they want to pick up fight with Iran at the same time, pick up fight with
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:38:00.800]  Pakistan. I don't know. They have to sit down, war game it. And if I am there, I will tell each one
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:06.720]  of them how wrong they are. There are lesser to be learned from military history. In Afghanistan,
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:14.160]  for instance, the spaces are not in their control. The victory or defeat is actually the outcome of
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:18.800]  three interplay of three factors, which is very important. Now, I am talking as a professional
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:27.680]  soldier. The time, space and relative strength. In Afghanistan, Americans have the watch and
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:34.800]  opposition has the time. The Mujahideen has the time. In Afghanistan, again, they have the spaces
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:42.240]  are with the opposition. And Americans are confined only to garrison town. More and more, they will
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:49.600]  be squeezed into the garrison town. And third factor, that of relative strength, agreed that
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:57.040]  America has firepower, but America does not have a willing, motivated manpower. Slowly, gradually,
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  the American soldiers have started now asking, what are we here for? Why are we laying down our
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:09.440]  lives? And I think this is a terrible situation if it seeps into the minds of the soldiery.
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.960]  And I think before this really erupts, it's better for America. It is better for the world
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:21.600]  that they pull out of here and they abandon any notions of attacking Iran or coming for
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:29.040]  Pakistan's nuclear capability. They cannot pluck it out and it can create a desperate Pakistan
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:36.080]  which could do anything. I'm not saying that Pakistan would do it, but I think there are
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:41.840]  possibilities and there are chances that Pakistan may actually have two for its own existence,
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:48.720]  for its own honor, for its own well-being. It can go to the extreme limit, which would not be good
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:55.120]  for the countries who want to see Pakistan nuclear capability destroyed and Pakistan cut to pieces.
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.520]  No, it will not happen. I can assure you this and they better disabuse their minds and their plans
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:08.480]  of this kind of notion. General, a few other points I wanted to bring up to you and then any
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:11.360]  other points you'd like to make them will let you go. We're very thankful for your time today
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:18.480]  and your courage to come on this broadcast. But specifically, Benazar Budo, dealing with another
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:24.720]  lie, our media said that she fell and hit her head on the side of a car, even though all over
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:30.960]  European and Central Asian news, it showed her being machine-gunned in the chest by western
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.920]  contractors as the intel. And then when it came out that she had been murdered and that our media
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:42.720]  had lied, they tried to claim that forces associated with the Taliban, which is any
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:48.400]  tribal group that resists occupation, had done it. What is the truth from your research about
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:55.280]  the assassination of Budo? I've been saying that all along she has been killed by the Americans,
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.480]  although she's been killed by Dick Cheney's people. They are the ones who are operating
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:07.280]  in Dick Cheney's order because Dick Cheney has drawn up the plan of governance for Pakistan and
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:13.680]  Benazir has become rebellious. She refused to meet Negra Ponte because Negra Ponte had told her
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:19.520]  not to go in Pakistan until after the election. But she did them and she came and she said,
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:25.280]  I want independent judiciary. She sent me a message through an emissary, a good friend of
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:32.000]  her and me. And he came and said that she says, General, I am now agreeing with you. I tend to
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.480]  agree with you that the Americans have evil designs on Pakistan. And therefore, I know that
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:45.280]  it is, she was, she had become very dangerous for them for Dick Cheney and company who wanted
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:49.840]  things to happen in a certain way in Pakistan. Unfortunately, those things are happening in
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.560]  that fashion. And I think Pakistan is in tatters today. Pakistan has to be redeemed. And I think
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:02.800]  the young generation of Pakistan is very angry, very unhappy with America. So America must not
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:10.960]  think of ruling Pakistan by proxies. This is wrong. And I think they should quit this idea as
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.520]  soon as possible. Well, General, here is my message to the Pakistani people. I know you're
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:21.600]  hardworking, intelligent, good people who have always been friends with the United States.
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:28.240]  And I have the globalist own PNAC plans to go in and destabilize you and overthrow your country
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:34.640]  and then put extremists in power so that you won't have a highly developed civilization.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:41.360]  And they're threatened by that. And they also want to use up America's treasure and our good name
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:48.320]  and destroy us in the international community via your destruction so that this new global
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:53.040]  corporate state known as the New World Order can rise. And they now admit they're forming a world
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:59.840]  government run by private banks. They have a global carbon tax that's meant to strangle development.
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.240]  This is eugenics. And from my research, I've never read your writings on this subject,
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:11.120]  but I'm curious your view on the aim of this global corporate Anglo-American New World Order system.
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:17.360]  And are you aware that they've been caught giving children in Central Asia? This is CBS News,
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:23.040]  real polio in the shots to kill them. They've been caught adding sterilants to the tetanus shots
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:29.520]  to sterilize women. And that from my research, Latin America, Africa, Central Asia, Pakistan,
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.360]  particularly, is targeted by a covert population reduction program. Are you aware of that, sir?
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:44.480]  Yes, I've heard of it. And I think it's very obnoxious to say the least. But America appears to
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:50.000]  become becoming heartless. And I think the American people have got to win back their heart.
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:58.160]  And they have to come up with an opinion which is stronger than their dark policies.
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:04.240]  I think that opinion, America can be stopped in the track only by the American people.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:10.720]  There's nobody else who can do that for them until the whole disaster takes place.
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.440]  But we want to avoid disaster, as you very rightly said. I think that's your mission.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.320]  And good luck to you for that mission. I think it's a noble mission and you must continue
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:24.800]  pressing this hard as much as you can. General Hamid Ghoul, thank you so much
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:29.440]  for joining us today. I look forward to speaking to you again in the future. And I hope that our
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:33.760]  two countries can be friends. And I hope that we can get our nation back from the globalist.
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:37.840]  Thank you for joining us. Thank you, Alex. And goodbye. Goodbye, General Ghoul.
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:43.840]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen, an hour and 15-minute live, uncensored interview
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:49.280]  with three-star General Hamid Ghoul, former head of Pakistani Intelligence. And I
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:55.840]  will post this video and audio at PrismPlanet.tv. If you missed any of it in the live show today,
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:01.120]  it'll be up just minutes after the live broadcast ends. After Max Kaiser is with us on the economy
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:07.440]  and other news. But what you just heard is the truth from all of my research. Separately,
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:14.400]  doing my own research, I can find nothing that Hamid Ghoul said here that isn't veritas,
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:20.160]  that isn't the truth. And this guy was a hero in our media in the 80s, leading the attacks
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:27.040]  against the Soviets. And now, you know, it's the Russians saying we better be careful in
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:32.400]  Afghanistan and Pakistan. And it's our own government run by a bunch of crooks that is
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:38.880]  trying to expand all of this. So a very informative interview with Lieutenant General Hamid Ghoul.
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:44.880]  And obviously, in the days to come, you'll probably see a lot of news articles written about
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:51.360]  all of this. But what was the one line, Jaren, that he said that you thought would be a good
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:59.920]  idea to name the video of this when we posted at prisonplanet.tv? God help America. Hamid Ghoul,
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:10.000]  God help America. This is a guy actually trained over here. And our media is using fake battlefield
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.960]  reports, even the Washington Post said are very questionable, to claim that this 74-year-old
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:22.080]  gentleman, what do you say, 74 or 76, to claim that he is running all these attacks when it's
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  all these different tribes, all these different groups who many times are even fighting with each
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:32.720]  other. I mean, nobody's running this. Nobody's controlling this. That's the globalist mindset
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:41.840]  is they create crises so big and so out of control that the problems just get bigger
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:46.720]  and then they can spend more money and more troops and project more power in the name of
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:51.760]  cleaning it up. But the plan is only to make it worse and commit us to an endless war.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:57.040]  And that's why as a patriotic American who defends the entire Bill of Rights Declaration
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:02.880]  of Independence and Constitution, I agree with George Washington. And we know FEMA demonizes
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:07.920]  George Washington. I have video training films where they teach police and firefighters and
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:12.080]  sheriff's deputies that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson were terrorists and were bad. It's in
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:20.720]  my film, Road to Tearing. And it's just so disgusting to see this. But George Washington, now Al-Qaeda,
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:25.360]  according to our government, I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. He said no foreign
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:30.000]  entanglements. We're not an empire. We're going to trade with people like Ron Paul says. We're
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.240]  going to have business with people. And I got a bunch of other news coming up on the economy I want
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:38.640]  to head on ahead of Max Kaiser joining us. Some other military news when we go to break here in
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:43.200]  a moment. But I've done an hour and 47 minutes without telling you about what makes this operation
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:49.280]  float, what funds this operation. But more importantly, that's just a caveat, a fringe benefit,
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:55.840]  a symbiosis, a symbiotic relationship. These films are waking people up. You can show them the well
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:48:02.640]  produced, well documented, riveting real world films. And your friends and family are ready
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:07.120]  to be awakened. You can get all my films or films I produced and make copies of them and air them
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:12.960]  on access TV and give them to people for nonprofit educational purposes. Invisible Empire, a new
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:18.320]  order defined by Jason Burma, such an important film, took us a year and a half to make this,
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.560]  covers the whole new order architecture, their order out of chaos program, hundreds of new
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.680]  world order global government quotes. This is such an important film. This special ends next
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.880]  Monday. You've got a week to take advantage of this, buy one copy, get three free. You can go
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:39.840]  ahead and do all your Christmas shopping early, have it all, buy one copy for 1995, get three copies
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:46.720]  for 1995 free. So you get four copies, 1995, buy one, get three free. You can buy two for 39.95,
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:57.120]  39.90. And you get eight copies free, 10 videos for 39.90, 10 copies of Invisible Empire for 39.90.
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:03.280]  Same thing with police state for the rise of FEMA. The entire 15 years of my research,
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:07.920]  the latest developments, the secret governor's councils, the military commissions act, the
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:12.880]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the executive orders, all of it is covered in this
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:19.680]  film, the FEMA camps, the clergy response teams, how the underwear bombing on Christmas Day was
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:27.200]  staged. It is all covered in police state for the rise of FEMA. So many subjects well documented,
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:35.680]  buy one, get three free, buy two, get eight free, 10 copies, 39.90, four copies, 1995.
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:41.360]  Same thing with part two of the Obama deception, full of the Republic, the presidency of Iraq,
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:45.440]  H. Obama, how they plan to start the wars, how they plan to steal the pension funds.
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.640]  Made this almost a year ago, it's all coming true now. People see this and are blown away,
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:55.120]  the production quality is off the chart, full of the Republic. You can get all three of these
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:01.920]  films, buy one, get three free, buy two, get eight free, and also other great documentaries
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.240]  that we carry, discounted, global warming, emerging science and understanding,
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.720]  solutions for a broken economy, the secret of Oz, directed by Bill Still, get it discounted.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:17.600]  The Obama deception, all of these are available right now at infowars.com,
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:22.800]  or you can simply call toll three, eight, eight, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:27.040]  eight, eight, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. You can also download all of my
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:31.680]  films in super high quality, burn them right to desk or CD to give people to play on their computers
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:37.760]  or DVD players at prisonplanet.tv. They've got a 64 kilobit audio podcast there.
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:44.480]  They've got the 64, it's actually 120 or even higher audio video of the entire archive of
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:50.000]  the full show. We now do the whole transmission, FTV as well, not just part of it. It's all at
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:54.800]  prisonplanet.tv and your memberships make all this possible. And later this week, exclusive
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:59.680]  for prisonplanet.tv members, my interview with Jesse Ventura on Key Info here in Austin last week.
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:05.920]  Attention, this is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:10.640]  to the IRS. The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:15.200]  and dramatically lowering amounts owed. Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:19.600]  announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:24.720]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:29.600]  American tax settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75 percent.
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:36.160]  Number to call is 89026969. Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:41.360]  who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy. If you are struggling with $10,000
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:47.040]  or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75 percent
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:51.440]  and save thousands of dollars for free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone
[02:51:51.440 --> 02:52:03.280]  line into American tax settlement now. 8902696969. Again, 89026969. The question is where should
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:09.760]  the American people draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:15.760]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule,
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:19.440]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land,
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:25.280]  they think they own our water, children, our education, our money. We have to define who we
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:31.040]  are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:36.960]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law. Knowledge
[02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:42.000]  is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you. Don't tread on me. Rise
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:46.880]  of the Republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:54.000]  is rising. A new tool in the info war. Don't tread on me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:11.280]  Hi, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura and this is the Alex Jones show. I recommend you all
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:17.200]  pay attention to Alex because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall for a second season
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:23.440]  of conspiracy theory where we will attempt to get to the bottom of these conspiracies.
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:34.240]  Until then, keep watching and listening to Alex.
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.320]  Well, right when we kick off the third hour, Max Kaiser, stockbroker and
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:53.600]  winner of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, great trends forecaster, he'll be joining us today on this live
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:01.360]  Monday, 16th day of August 2010. I'm going to get into the economy with Kaiser coming up and the
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:08.080]  Iran situation, but first I wanted to get into some big brother news. This is up at prisonplanet.com
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:16.320]  and infowars.com right now. Remember six, seven years ago in Australia and the U.S., the NSA was
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:22.640]  going to give local police and bureau land management and environmental groups, even private ones,
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:29.680]  access to satellite images, lifetime of people's farms and ranches and in businesses
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:33.360]  so they could harass people so that they couldn't build a barn or
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:40.240]  couldn't plant crops without being harassed. Well, all Google did, which is admittedly part
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:44.480]  of the NSA, I mean, I told you that many years ago, now they admit it, is they just made it all
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:51.680]  public to everybody. And government is now using this to harass people and all over the world,
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.240]  because the same global corporations are setting this up, they're banning people collecting their
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:00.960]  own rainwater and now they're saying you've got to pay for rain to fall on your crops.
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:05.760]  But then other nations don't have to do that. It's all selective. It's all part of the carbon tax.
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:11.920]  This will shut down our industry and our farming even more. Key article up at prisonplanet.com
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:19.600]  by Paul Joseph Watson today, government using Google Earth to loot, destitute Americans. And I
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:24.800]  actually heard an MPR piece about two weeks ago and thought to call Watson because a lot of times
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:30.000]  I call Watson or Kurt. Well, Kurt works here now. He's moved to Austin from New Mexico. But so I'll
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:34.080]  usually go into their office or call them. Watson's in England, both Watson's are. And I'll say ride
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.800]  on this. And I forgot to, but that's why I love Watson because he thinks just like I do. And he
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:46.960]  wrote a story about it. But MPR was saying it was good in Greece and in other countries. The
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:53.920]  government to raise money is charging people, depending on the city, $300 to $1,000 or 1,000
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:59.440]  euros for a swimming pool fee. Or they notice if your swimming pool looks like it's in
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.320]  disuse, they come and find you. So it's all part of this surveillance harassment. Remember that
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:12.000]  Pennsylvania tax collection ad where it says, Hey, Tom, we're watching you. You didn't pay $4,000
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.960]  taxes and we know where you live and it shows the earth and they zoom in from space and show the
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:24.960]  guy's house. Again, this is all designed for you. Here it is. Smile, aerial images being used to
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:31.120]  being used to enforce laws, associated press. And that was August 14th, just two days ago.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:37.040]  That crank this ad up. It started over. That's a good idea. Crank up the ad because I want people
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:42.880]  to actually see and hear this ad where they're intimidating people. Here it is. Just off of
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:51.440]  Fifth Street. Nice car, Tom. Nice house. What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:58.800]  taxes. Listen, Tom, we can make this easy. Pay online by June 18th and we'll skip your penalty
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:08.720]  and take half off your interest because Tom, we do know who you are. Oh, find us before we find you.
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:13.040]  So this whole grid isn't for the terrorist. That's the government. They're staging almost all of
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:18.560]  it. It's for us. State utilizing aerial imagery technology and force petty ordinances and loot,
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:23.920]  destitute citizens of whatever income they have left after having had trillions in wealth stolen
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:28.480]  and transferred to foreign banks and trillions spent to build these satellites and launch them.
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:34.720]  And the whole article just goes over it. And then there's another report here. They're now
[02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:47.680]  coming in to charge you for rainwater usage. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com
