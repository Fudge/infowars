[01:50.680 --> 01:56.120]  transmission I am Alex Jones your host and you will get next year's news today
[01:56.120 --> 02:00.600]  here as we speak they're in the control room printing off news articles from a
[02:00.600 --> 02:07.320]  year ago and two months ago and about a week ago where I said that Facebook's
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.800]  collapse will signal the new digital dark age coming in where the globalists
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.240]  are going to then terrorize these companies into going under full deep
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.000]  state control and the merger with the chai comps and that if Trump doesn't get
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.920]  ahead of this curve we're gonna lose it all I predicted that I would be totally
[02:28.920 --> 02:33.880]  de-platformed as the beta test to make the debate about Alex Jones being taken
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.240]  off and not everyone else now they've got top professors top globalist
[02:39.240 --> 02:44.520]  operatives all over the news in elite publications like Wired Magazine
[02:44.520 --> 02:51.880]  Atlantic Monthly the New York Times today saying the takedown of Jones is
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.400]  only the beginning we're taking everyone down and we're taking them down by the
[02:57.400 --> 03:03.440]  time the Democrats take office in the house in two months in January January
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.680]  20th and they have got incredible graphics and wired of me being basically
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.280]  grabbed by hand and drug into the darkness like I'm being thrown in the back
[03:13.280 --> 03:23.080]  of a van the snatch and grab operation this is real authoritarian behavior and
[03:23.080 --> 03:29.280]  who wrote it an authoritarian out of Turkey now working in US so-called
[03:29.280 --> 03:35.520]  academia in that special group countering foreign disinformation and
[03:35.520 --> 03:42.760]  propaganda act so these people are here they've brought in foreign operatives
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.800]  they've even hired former Stasi Google's even moving into the former Stasi
[03:47.800 --> 03:55.080]  headquarters in East Germany you cannot make this up
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.600]  unbelievable you know I was gonna tell them when I mentioned this showing me
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.320]  being thrown in the back of a van a snatch and grab to get a scanner darkly
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.400]  and show a clip of that from from fiction and that I didn't tell them to do
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.920]  it but great minds think alike great job to the crew and they're doing that if
[04:12.920 --> 04:15.360]  you're a radio listener you're not seeing this you're hearing it I'll go over
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.840]  all of it today this is the next big move it's been announced and we can
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.520]  sit there like idiots and let them do it or we can call the White House call
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.480]  Congress call talk radio you can make a big noise we can stop this they want me
[04:28.480 --> 04:31.600]  off the air they want us curtailed back to nothing that's not already give up
[04:31.600 --> 04:39.600]  give up I'm only begun to fight while you're looking at my ship on fire you
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.200]  might turn around look at yours it's going under the water right now and over
[04:44.200 --> 04:50.720]  the horizon new fleets are on their way flying my flag your flag the blood red
[04:50.720 --> 04:58.320]  flag of 1776 worldwide I'm Alex Jones we are the resistance
[04:59.320 --> 05:03.920]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.480]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[05:07.480 --> 05:13.320]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.680]  bring our listeners and viewers the best eye on the world we've gone through two
[05:17.680 --> 05:22.560]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.160]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.560]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[05:30.560 --> 05:35.000]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.120]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists
[05:40.120 --> 05:43.640]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[05:43.640 --> 05:49.480]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes
[05:49.480 --> 05:54.600]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you
[05:54.600 --> 05:59.120]  want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at info wars
[05:59.120 --> 06:11.360]  five dot com you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you
[06:11.360 --> 06:24.080]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of

[07:07.120 --> 07:13.760]  you to take notes and beg you to take action because we have the absolute
[07:13.760 --> 07:20.880]  total complete battle plan of the globalist to take down the west to take
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.960]  down our prosperity to take our free speech to take your pension funds to take
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.400]  control of your life your children everything and it's all coming up here
[07:29.400 --> 07:37.760]  today I'm gonna air Paul Joseph Watson's blistering report dealing with the
[07:37.760 --> 07:44.480]  race brainwashing of children via YouTube programs put on by the left but
[07:44.480 --> 07:51.640]  understand this is actually what's shown in the public schools this is this is
[07:51.640 --> 07:58.320]  the actual training that is going on we covered some of this friday but Paul's
[07:58.320 --> 08:02.920]  done a bigger report on it kids brainwash to hate white people it's up on
[08:02.920 --> 08:07.240]  info wars dot com and I suggest everyone get this out to everybody you know
[08:07.240 --> 08:12.280]  there's another even more devastating report that I mentioned yesterday that
[08:12.280 --> 08:16.760]  I'm gonna get to a 22 page report out of the Daily Mail where they are taking
[08:16.760 --> 08:22.560]  mentally retarded children in the UK it's happening here too and telling them
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.640]  you're transgendered so they can then basically sterilize them but let's go to
[08:29.640 --> 08:33.600]  Paul Joseph Watson's report where they're also teaching these little girls this
[08:33.600 --> 08:39.200]  as well and and just understand this is the most hardcore Marxist brainwashing
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.000]  you can get this is how you create weatherman terrorist here it is welcome
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.640]  to radical cram school we're gonna learn about social justice revolution
[08:48.640 --> 08:59.240]  hello my young comrades just when you thought we'd run out of cancer along
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.040]  comes a fresh supply now to be clear I'm not being mean to these kids I feel
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.040]  sorry for them they're victims of brainwashing they've obviously been
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.760]  coached on what to say by either their parents Christina Wong or both I'm gonna
[09:12.760 --> 09:16.200]  show a picture this is my way of figuring out we've been tainted by the
[09:16.200 --> 09:24.720]  patriarchy what do you think it is Harvey Weinstein because inside every
[09:24.720 --> 09:29.480]  white man there's a serial rapist just fighting to get out right all these white
[09:29.480 --> 09:34.920]  rape gangs everywhere it's an epidemic wait it gets worse there's just like
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.560]  this thing about white people that just makes me feel like they're like right
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.800]  there and I'm walking into the pool and they just give me the
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.640]  desk there then I'm just like what there's just like this thing about white
[09:47.640 --> 09:51.640]  people that just makes me and feel what kind of parent would teach their child
[09:51.640 --> 09:56.440]  to be afraid of a person based on their skin color what kind of person could
[09:56.440 --> 10:02.280]  possibly do such a thing oh yeah a racist so in a class for teaching kids
[10:02.280 --> 10:08.800]  that racism is bad you're actually teaching them to be racist genius
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.400]  what is she missing imagine being such a pathetic snowflake that you think
[10:14.400 --> 10:19.280]  hello kitty not having a mouth is some vast racist sexist conspiracy her
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.440]  mouth why doesn't she have a mouth the people who created her didn't want
[10:23.440 --> 10:31.400]  Asian girls to speak up about their very profound very profound yeah you
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.720]  obviously just told her to say that very profound the person who designed
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.480]  hello kitty is an Asian woman she explained why it was designed without a
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.440]  mouth years ago it's got nothing to do with silencing Asian women again the
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.720]  designer is an Asian woman I mean hello kitty doesn't have feet either is that
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.200]  a racist throwback to Asian women having bound feet or is it just a harmless
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.920]  design feature and you're a hysterical moron I'm guessing it's the latter very
[10:59.920 --> 11:15.480]  profound orange man bad orange man bad orange man bad orange man bad orange
[11:15.480 --> 11:22.640]  man how do we feel about this wall is blocking opportunity for people that
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.760]  don't live in America to come here for a better opportunity and we all came at
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.600]  some point from some other place yeah so let me teach you something if you
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.360]  don't have any borders and you allow everyone from some other place to come
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.720]  to America it stops being like America and starts being like some other place
[11:41.720 --> 11:46.680]  meaning the opportunities afforded to all those who came legally disappear my
[11:46.680 --> 11:51.840]  daddy came here and my mom came here too they came here from where Cambodia oh
[11:51.840 --> 11:55.160]  wow what do you think they think that they came from all the way to Cambodia
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.760]  and this is what they get to look at on the TV right because I'm sure they
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.480]  prefer to look at something else I don't know maybe the 23,000 mass graves
[12:03.480 --> 12:08.400]  containing the bodies of 1.3 million Cambodians who were all slaughtered as a
[12:08.400 --> 12:16.120]  result of a left-wing government genocide now that I think of it Christina
[12:16.120 --> 12:20.080]  and Paul Paul have similar tastes in headwear oh yeah and after Cambodia's
[12:20.080 --> 12:24.080]  communist regime got done killing a quarter of its own population the
[12:24.080 --> 12:30.000]  United States accepted 158,000 Cambodian refugees you know because it's so
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.240]  racist and all what does gender fluid mean like you can be any like any gender
[12:34.240 --> 12:38.440]  you want to be in a boy or like you're not just a boy and just a girl yeah does
[12:38.440 --> 12:40.920]  anybody know anyone who's gender but non-binary
[12:40.920 --> 12:47.360]  L? I am gender fluid. You're gender fluid? Yeah. That's that's a wonderful thing yeah
[12:47.360 --> 12:53.000]  sounds more like child abuse to me I have friends in the pool and I was
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.200]  telling them that I wanted to be a boy girl and one of my friends said I can't
[12:58.200 --> 13:02.960]  because I was born as a girl and gone made you as a girl what does a six-year-old
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.760]  know about anything yet you're imposing sexuality and your warped ideas about
[13:07.760 --> 13:14.400]  gender on a six-year-old that's just creepy stop I have lived in America my
[13:14.400 --> 13:23.400]  whole life this is a case of structural racism say it with me structural racism
[13:23.400 --> 13:29.240]  structural racism so structural it gives non-white people giant public corporate
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.680]  sponsored media platforms to endlessly lecture white people about how evil they
[13:33.680 --> 13:37.640]  are when Donnie the boy was calling Hannah Rochelle Ching-Chong Choo or
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.760]  things like that has anybody ever had that happen to them no it didn't so that
[13:41.760 --> 13:45.760]  kind of suggests that America is nowhere near as racist as you relentlessly
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.480]  claim it to be 75% of what white men earn why do they get to earn more because
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.200]  they work longer hours and when that factor is eliminated the gender wage
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.120]  gap virtually disappears that's what we would have to do to get a full cookie is
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.520]  for my union no you just have to work the same hours because in most evil white
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.240]  Western countries gender employment discrimination is illegal so what are
[14:08.240 --> 14:18.160]  the few things that fathers have to think about resting yeah now I'm not
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.520]  calling Christina one but she did literally dress up as a vagina before
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.720]  proceeding to reel off politically correct statements always ask what
[14:27.720 --> 14:35.000]  someone's preferred gender pronoun is and called it comedy yeah really
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.120]  does have the power to end racism I'm gonna have sex with the entire state of
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.040]  Alabama now weird flex but okay believe it or not according to salon.com that
[14:44.040 --> 14:49.600]  video was one of the funniest political comedy moments of 2014 yeah I had funny
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.400]  of bowel movements in 2014 but then again Salon's number one political comedy
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.560]  moment of 2014 was a stand-up show about white people in the United States
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.480]  becoming a minority because racism is so hilarious is the point this is just some
[15:04.480 --> 15:10.200]  crappy YouTube web series oh look at that ratio comments disabled but wait I
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.680]  thought people being silenced was a bad thing except when they're trying to
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.320]  criticize you imagine that so it's just a crappy YouTube web series but schools
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.200]  and colleges across the West are already imposing elements of this on your kids
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.480]  this is what they want your children brainwashed indoctrinated and turned into
[15:28.480 --> 15:38.200]  NPCs so orange man bad teaching hatred to fight hatred teaching racism to fight
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.080]  racism just like this thing about white people that just makes me feel using kids
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.960]  as political weapons to amplify racist regressive lies that foster more
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.480]  division and more bigotry yet another perfect illustration of why everyone
[15:52.480 --> 15:59.720]  should homeschool we'll be right back for the live global transmission most of
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.400]  you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US what
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.240]  if I told you for just 5495 a month you could fight against heart disease
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.440]  naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.200]  get back to a healthier heart don't just take my word for it check out all of the

[16:29.400 --> 16:33.040]  uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.840]  and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.800]  cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way the minimum rocket
[16:40.800 --> 16:44.960]  stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.040]  sticks and twigs for fuel the Minuteman stove is easy to use smokeless portable
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.880]  powerful and sustainable for the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.400]  starters made right here in the USA go to Minuteman stove.com that's Minuteman
[16:57.400 --> 17:02.040]  stove.com what if there was a social media network only for the
[17:02.040 --> 17:05.240]  conservative what if there was a social media network not only for the
[17:05.240 --> 17:08.640]  conservative right general public but also a platform for conservative
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.800]  politicians and advertisers and what if the social media network was the only
[17:12.800 --> 17:18.000]  free speech network in existence there is it's right social net right social
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.240]  net a response to president Donald Trump's direct presidential order right

[17:42.000 --> 17:48.080]  two left England broken its former colony the US had to save the Empire was

[17:59.480 --> 18:03.400]  info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.640]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.000]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.720]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.520]  researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs experience
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.080]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.920]  research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.800]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an anti histamine
[18:41.800 --> 18:45.960]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[18:45.960 --> 18:49.760]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[18:49.760 --> 18:54.280]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.600]  head to info wars life calm and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[18:59.600 --> 19:05.120]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23
[19:05.120 --> 19:08.440]  years on air obviously water filtration is a great thing it's a good thing and

[19:54.680 --> 20:07.960]  and for store.com or call AAA 253-3139 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:07.960 --> 20:21.640]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[20:38.960 --> 20:45.600]  it is November 19 2018 on this Monday global broadcast as we head into
[20:45.600 --> 20:52.640]  National Turkey Day Thanksgiving celebrating the original successful
[20:52.640 --> 21:02.640]  mission to begin the development of this continent by our illustrious ancestors
[21:02.640 --> 21:07.880]  let's let's do this in this segment because when I'm about to cover something
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.480]  so momentous I have trouble getting into it because I want to be calm about it
[21:12.480 --> 21:16.560]  but I also want to cover all the facets be much easier if I just told the
[21:16.560 --> 21:21.440]  audience what's happening and what I believe is going to happen next and a
[21:21.440 --> 21:24.440]  lot of folks do pay attention because they know that I know what I'm talking
[21:24.440 --> 21:28.000]  about on most issues establishments certainly paying attention that's why
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.160]  they don't want me to be able to reach new people that's where you come in
[21:31.160 --> 21:35.200]  carrying the football down the field by word of mouth when you take action
[21:35.200 --> 21:43.360]  you're unstoppable when you don't we're done I was told covering Bilderberg in
[21:43.360 --> 21:51.160]  2006 that the whole meeting was basically about large portions of it was
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.720]  about social media being the future of things and then the next year we covered
[21:56.720 --> 22:01.840]  it in Istanbul and Zuckerberg was there we had a reporter there Jim Tucker
[22:01.840 --> 22:09.920]  rest in peace and so I heard a lot of this then and Tucker's asked me on the
[22:09.920 --> 22:12.800]  phone when he gets back from Turkey goes what do you know about them
[22:12.800 --> 22:16.040]  internet say out this young whipper snapper they think this thing will
[22:16.040 --> 22:19.600]  spy on everybody so they'll be able to control all the elections with this
[22:19.600 --> 22:25.680]  thing and that's what I got from the sources in there only got more of a
[22:25.680 --> 22:33.560]  gravelly voice than me was old Jim spoken those filter was Paul malls that's it
[22:33.560 --> 22:40.600]  us at Bilderberg few years later and give your radio listeners are putting
[22:40.600 --> 22:47.320]  images up on TV to the TV viewers and now in hindsight and now is what we know
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.960]  and now it's the Pachinic said a year ago and two months ago here on there and
[22:50.960 --> 22:57.760]  we've broken down we know what's gonna happen to Facebook and we know what's
[22:57.760 --> 23:03.160]  that's going to trigger now obviously if people would have listened to us a
[23:03.160 --> 23:05.880]  couple years ago you'd have made a lot of money in the stock market knowing this
[23:05.880 --> 23:10.460]  but people always remember that we were right later because we actually go
[23:10.460 --> 23:14.000]  crawl around the ground and sneak into buildings and get thrown off and get
[23:14.000 --> 23:24.640]  arrested and Jim Tucker's been shot at so the system is doing everything it can
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.720]  to keep you from getting this information because the average political
[23:28.720 --> 23:35.880]  talk is nothing but a distraction it's nothing but a diversion from the real
[23:35.880 --> 23:39.240]  things going on in the world people will look at Jim Acosta clearly pushing the
[23:39.240 --> 23:43.240]  woman's arm down jerking the mic back from her and he says I didn't touch her
[23:43.240 --> 23:46.400]  it's meant to just to create a debate about did he touch her or not and while
[23:46.400 --> 23:49.640]  we're debating whether he touched her or not and I can't help it because I'm in
[23:49.640 --> 23:55.240]  the middle of it they're claiming we're lying they give us offers we can't refuse
[23:55.240 --> 23:59.120]  when they make it about us almost all the time we've got to respond or people
[23:59.120 --> 24:06.040]  will believe we actually lied so while we're delayed fighting with the
[24:06.040 --> 24:15.040]  disinfo the roadbox they throw out there the whole future's being stolen from us
[24:15.040 --> 24:22.360]  so it's very frustrating to know what's going to happen
[24:22.720 --> 24:28.000]  don't know exactly when or exactly how but we know in the main what's going down
[24:28.000 --> 24:35.040]  real accurate the globalists here this and they say you got to get that off the
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.840]  ear you got to shut that down whatever you do or we're screwed everybody ought
[24:39.840 --> 24:44.640]  to go oh if this is what they want shut down so bad maybe something's getting
[24:44.640 --> 24:51.040]  said here that's important and I know most of you understand that but folks
[24:51.040 --> 24:57.560]  this isn't a thing now of were we right about Facebook a lot of people say good
[24:57.560 --> 25:02.800]  I hope Facebook goes belly up I hope that's one-dimensional thinking yes I
[25:02.800 --> 25:06.520]  told you when they were first setting up Facebook it was going to be a pump and
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.600]  dump and we were sure of it then like eight years ago when Zuckerberg went
[25:12.600 --> 25:21.880]  again over in Germany so we've been laying it all out for you here but out of
[25:21.880 --> 25:27.040]  the collapse of Facebook and the reorganization of it is going to come the
[25:27.040 --> 25:35.680]  new rules of the Internet and a global social score and draconian censorship
[25:35.680 --> 25:41.680]  and the web will now be a surveillance grid commanded by the new officer class
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.880]  professors and corporate operatives who will oversee armies of bots armies of
[25:46.880 --> 25:54.720]  sensors to shut down all thought they don't agree with there's a Chinese
[25:54.720 --> 26:05.080]  gentleman running in New York for national office presidency he's already
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.440]  getting all this big hype but he's just there to put these issues in and he wants
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.640]  us to adopt the Chinese Communist social score oh but you'll be paid a
[26:11.640 --> 26:16.840]  thousand dollars a month to do it universal income which then is meant to
[26:16.840 --> 26:20.520]  control your whole life it's called slavery we surveil everything you do
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.600]  and you get a thousand dollars you young idiots and they're just here pitching it
[26:25.600 --> 26:33.240]  to all the young Millennials that want something free as they put Andrew Yang
[26:33.240 --> 26:39.520]  so it's here this is the invasion this is the takeover and Trump can win on
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.160]  jobs and he can win on the economy and he can do so many things he can defend
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.520]  the border but if he doesn't stop the digital invasion and the digital use
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.280]  are patient and the takeover of the Internet will lose everything because
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.600]  the Internet is the industry it is the communications it is the jobs it is the
[26:56.600 --> 27:03.040]  whole system and there are sickening articles in the New York Times and Wired
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.240]  magazine and others today salivating over how they're going to shut
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.360]  everybody's communications down and how they're going to shut nationalists and
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.720]  Christians and conservatives banking down when they're done they're coming for
[27:15.720 --> 27:19.960]  you and there's no amount of submission that'll get you out of it we're going to
[27:19.960 --> 27:26.240]  have to fight our way out of this one folks so get ready now we come back I'm
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.080]  going to get into the nuts and bolts of this then we've got incredible SJW
[27:30.080 --> 27:32.920]  footage we're going to premiere here of our crew down at the border showing the
[27:32.920 --> 27:37.040]  caravan invasion that they said didn't exist and the local Antifa shows up so
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.800]  we're going to show you this bleep video but it is unbelievable no one's seen it
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.800]  yet meanwhile Mexicans agree with Trump call migrant caravan an invasion the
[27:45.800 --> 27:48.480]  mayor in Tijuana says there are a bunch of criminals they're waving foreign
[27:48.480 --> 27:53.080]  flags they're burning American flags and Trump's like they want to get in and
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.360]  they're burning flags and now the Mexicans are marching against the
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.920]  Honduras because they know an invasion when they see one they've got their head
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.920]  screwed on straighter than the average dumbass American which is a real shame
[28:06.920 --> 28:14.280]  so good for the Mexicans it's all coming up now and it's on info wars.com
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.080]  article Mexicans agree with Trump call migrant caravan an invasion get this out
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.880]  there what I was at a barber shop this morning I got to in South Austin you know
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.840]  blue collar barbershop most of us work their Hispanics get great haircut really
[28:26.840 --> 28:31.000]  nice people and they don't really know who I am but but they're bringing up to me
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.360]  about yeah the Mexicans want them out and they're burning American flags and
[28:34.360 --> 28:38.680]  why are we letting people in and their criminals and those Mexicans by the way
[28:38.680 --> 28:41.200]  a lot of them like 60-year-old guys they were not virtue signaling at me
[28:41.200 --> 28:45.360]  they're American they just have a Mexican background so that's what we're

[33:55.600 --> 33:59.760]  in support nation seriously and we're gonna play this coming up next segment
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.120]  because it dovetails with the mexicans and over the side of the border and
[34:03.120 --> 34:06.840]  their mayor saying we've never seen such criminals and that's what other mexican
[34:06.840 --> 34:10.280]  towns said when these people are coming through by the tens of thousands
[34:10.280 --> 34:15.600]  robbing stealing raping smuggling kids it's insane the mexicans are saying get
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.280]  the hell out of here this is out of control here's a little snippet of
[34:19.280 --> 34:29.040]  what's coming up with savannah black eye over here come over as he's hunting
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.240]  people and give us a nazi salute you think color matters you think your

[34:38.640 --> 34:51.000]  to show everyone part of a racist organization stop right there yeah
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.600]  you're funded by George Soros a real nazi you're the one spewing race why do
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.720]  you have to look like a meth head to be an antifa so we're gonna be getting to
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.440]  this exchange coming up and the tying it in with all the amazing footage that
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.600]  they got but also local news what Mexico is actually saying about tens of
[35:07.600 --> 35:13.120]  thousands of people 80 plus percent military age men engaging in all sorts
[35:13.120 --> 35:21.360]  of crime attacking police killing people you name it it's simply crazy all right
[35:21.360 --> 35:24.600]  look let's stop right there
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.480]  and I always have this quandary should I just get it all the proof or should I
[35:32.480 --> 35:37.280]  just get directly to what's about to happen or should I point out that we
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.120]  told you this was coming
[35:45.200 --> 35:50.880]  because this is bigger than Facebook it's bigger than the economy this is the
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.840]  next domino to fall to get our free speech and you just saw how they were
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.360]  able to steal many of the elections because they totally shut down all
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.840]  their opposition which became an in-kind donation to the Democrats by big tech
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.880]  and you saw how that's now in bold in the Democrats to call for even more
[36:08.880 --> 36:15.760]  censorship we're gonna get to that but how is Facebook gonna go down why would
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.880]  the establishment do this to Facebook why were we able to predict the pump and
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.360]  dump you're about to see a long time ago because we watch the globalist we
[36:25.360 --> 36:31.040]  study them we also talked to insiders like dr. Steve Pachinic former head of
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.820]  psychological warfare operations for a three-letter word agency doesn't like it
[36:34.820 --> 36:37.760]  when I say the name of the agency even though it's in history books which
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.400]  agency he's worked for he'll be joining us to get into this as well one of the
[36:42.400 --> 36:45.880]  founders of Delta Force and let's just say you know is where a lot of the bodies
[36:45.880 --> 36:50.560]  are buried so that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour we'll continue
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.880]  with this discussion so we're gonna plunge into this here in just a moment
[36:55.880 --> 37:08.520]  and then at the start of the next hour I'm going to specifically get into how
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.600]  the new censorship will be implemented and the phases it's going to be rolled
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.000]  out in until everyone realizes it wasn't just censorship of conservatives
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.520]  it's a total social score of everything you're doing being surveilled in
[37:21.520 --> 37:29.840]  live time to then literally oppress and control everyone no amount of submission
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.720]  is going to be enough because this is a post industrial economy killing form of
[37:35.720 --> 37:41.800]  siege or a post industrial world technotronic technocracy era so how do I
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.800]  know exactly where we're going because the destinations been announced by the
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.240]  globalist now they can drive the train faster or slower maybe make a few more
[37:51.240 --> 37:55.360]  stops or a few less stops but we know where this train track grows this is
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.600]  not like a highway with a car where you go wherever you want this is the driver
[38:00.600 --> 38:09.040]  takes you where he was told to take you so again I suggest everyone pay
[38:09.040 --> 38:17.720]  particular attention we'll go to that information here in just a moment I was
[38:17.720 --> 38:22.320]  about to do a plug this weekend for the Black Friday specials that run all week
[38:22.320 --> 38:27.720]  and I just come up with a specials not really even a formula to it I just make
[38:27.720 --> 38:31.280]  sure they're massive in the belief that if we have the best prices out there
[38:31.280 --> 38:34.640]  people will buy more and that that'll equal out it's certainly been the case
[38:34.640 --> 38:39.640]  so far but I was doing an ad about how Black Friday usually isn't the best
[38:39.640 --> 38:43.160]  time to buy products that stores raise their retail than lower on the day
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.960]  before and or they have a really sought after item in a limited amount when you
[38:46.960 --> 38:51.320]  get there it's not really there but you go ahead and impulse buy things that say
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.280]  they're a sale but they're not really as big a sale as they say plus there's the
[38:54.280 --> 38:57.960]  big crowds and all the rest of it I was saying so this isn't our best sale of
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.800]  the year but it's one of our biggest and you know the best time of the year is
[39:01.800 --> 39:06.040]  generally right after Christmas when anything inventory we have left we need
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.760]  to sell so we don't have to pay income tax on which is basically inventory tax
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.120]  and in Texas they say we don't have an income tax if you got a company they do
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.080]  it's it's called a franchise tax and I got to pay on every desk every light
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.800]  bulb everything in here I'd have got a few percentage points on and over the
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.160]  years it's growing that's how they did it so Texas is lower than some states but
[39:26.160 --> 39:30.720]  it ain't as good as they tell you but I'm digressing excuse me I'm sorry so I'm
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.840]  sitting there reading the specials I came up with a few days before while I'm
[39:34.840 --> 39:38.720]  cutting the live ad and by ad I mean I cut a lot of these ads like it's live
[39:38.720 --> 39:42.440]  there's not a lot of editing maybe we put a few articles over it but it's usually
[39:42.440 --> 39:45.480]  I just if it's two minute ad one minute ad four minute ad I just have a clock and
[39:45.480 --> 39:51.160]  I talk for four minutes and halfway through I go wait a minute this is the
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.000]  best sale we've ever offered you're like well wait a bit the one you had a few
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.480]  weeks ago was the best ever yeah cuz they're trying to take our credit card
[39:56.480 --> 40:00.440]  processing away and shut us down so I want to sell everything we've got in the
[40:00.440 --> 40:04.080]  warehouse including stuff that I had for us to go into February there'll probably
[40:04.080 --> 40:10.600]  be a situation here where we don't even have any products really for a few
[40:10.600 --> 40:13.640]  months at the new year but that's better than them taking our credit card
[40:13.640 --> 40:18.520]  processing and things like that while I follow lawsuits and stuff and for a few
[40:18.520 --> 40:22.000]  months can't sell anything it's better to have those nuts for winter that will
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.200]  find the operations that's why you are getting the best sales we've ever had
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.520]  because you know if the army's coming over the hill to destroy it and you got
[40:29.520 --> 40:32.880]  a shop you might as well a dry good place you know back in the whole West
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.000]  might as well something you got for the Union Army slams in and burns your ass
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.160]  to the ground then they're just getting a building not your goods now we don't
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.080]  think that's going to happen we think we're going to beat all this but we're
[40:42.080 --> 40:48.880]  not we're not going to just sit here on our thumbs as they say so this is with
[40:48.880 --> 40:52.640]  the double Patriot points the biggest sale we've ever had because it's the
[40:52.640 --> 40:57.160]  sale we had earlier everything must go Christmas Black Friday Rollin one plus
[40:57.160 --> 41:03.880]  it's double Patriot points so instead of 5% you get 10% on your next purchase so
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.800]  it's literally money in the bank so instead of 5% it's 10% you had all these
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.200]  specials in like Santa for auto shipping additional 10% a bunch of these are big
[41:12.200 --> 41:19.120]  loss leaders so this is everything must go biggest sale ever it's not a secret
[41:19.120 --> 41:21.640]  they're trying to shut us down and I'm not believing they are going to shut us
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.960]  down but they're all over the news today licking their lips saying here's how
[41:24.960 --> 41:27.720]  we're going to do it and that's we get his ass everybody else
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.440]  wait till I cover this stuff they have images of me being choked and pulled into
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.480]  darkness and killed by horrible evil Turkish writers that come from a
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.880]  dictatorship where they do that to you if you are a political dissident I mean
[41:41.880 --> 41:46.560]  they are important people folks that are very wicked there are a lot of good
[41:46.560 --> 41:50.240]  Turkish people I know as well who fled the evil a lot of Armenians can tell you
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.280]  about you know they've been in slaving and taking people down and silencing them
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.800]  since the Muslims took over Turkey when it was the Byzantine Empire yeah zoom
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.720]  out of that for folks to show them large magazine and the Turkish writer doing
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.720]  all this for TV viewers you just show it full screen if you'd like there it is he
[42:10.720 --> 42:14.560]  who must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common and then
[42:14.560 --> 42:20.960]  they image themselves as a big dark blackness sucking me in to a snatching
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.960]  grab I think that's Voldemort so that's coming up so we have 50% off storewide
[42:25.960 --> 42:29.640]  up to 50% off the high-quality storeable food that's unbelievable
[42:29.640 --> 42:35.280]  alexa pure water filtration system at 127 49% off and that's an overstock issue
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.920]  with them we've never gone that low it's the very best system alexa pure breeze
[42:38.920 --> 42:45.440]  40% off the air purification and a bunch of other huge specials up to 75% off
[42:45.440 --> 42:51.560]  storewide everything must go fund our spacecraft engines for the next jump
[42:51.560 --> 42:56.000]  we've already launched the new 1776 revolution when come back I'll tell you
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.520]  the next level the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and
[43:02.520 --> 43:06.040]  pump the environment from the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you
[43:06.040 --> 43:11.640]  name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.760]  quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.880]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.600]  hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.200]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.040]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.480]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[43:37.480 --> 43:42.200]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.760]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.920]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.480]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.240]  at m4slife.com please whatever you do realize that we're all getting punch
[44:02.240 --> 44:06.480]  drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts they say affiliated
[44:06.480 --> 44:09.520]  with info wars yes some of them are like little side accounts they know we had
[44:09.520 --> 44:13.360]  like info or store that just showed our products but they just banned them all
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.800]  yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.160]  folks that loved us your excitement about America your excitement about this
[44:21.160 --> 44:24.560]  broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick but the
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.760]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[44:28.760 --> 44:33.880]  pesky in the future I want to be troublesome and pesky I want to keep
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.400]  going I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially I
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.960]  want to push all the way I've committed to do that I've prayed for that and I've
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.600]  been told that's going to happen but you've got a back ish and I promise you
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.920]  this I will never falter I will never waver at the spiritual level I
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.400]  physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially support
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.920]  us and for short com to give you my absolute total commitment I have an
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.840]  opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air

[47:48.440 --> 47:52.000]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live
[47:52.000 --> 48:00.120]  November 19 2018 global transmission okay now remember liberty and freedom is not
[48:00.120 --> 48:03.640]  a spectator sport and that's why they hate this show until they hate this
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.720]  audience because you are the info war I'm not telling you something you're not
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.160]  already doing great job let's keep doing it let's let's absolutely go into the
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.480]  thick of battle every time we're gonna win this thing we're promoting freedom
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.600]  the globalist promoting authoritarianism poverty lies fraud big
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.040]  corporations have set up the internet that DARPA designed to control and
[48:24.040 --> 48:27.640]  track and consolidate power and shut down their competition they're going into
[48:27.640 --> 48:31.800]  that phase faster than they were planning because it the internet has been
[48:31.800 --> 48:37.440]  taken away from them and is being used by human intelligence to go out and
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.800]  actually educate and inform others but so nationalists and populist are being
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.600]  elected everywhere and so when you read these different CIA funded professors
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.840]  that are in the news from the left to stay behind network just like they left
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.680]  the Justice Department they left at CIA and funded the John Warner Defense
[48:55.680 --> 49:00.280]  Authorization Act 2017 that Obama signed before he left office in December
[49:00.280 --> 49:07.480]  2016 it says we have a global crisis of nationalist we're gonna fix our global
[49:07.480 --> 49:12.680]  order Google gave speeches that was sent out in the internal Google video that
[49:12.680 --> 49:16.400]  got released a few months ago two years ago saying oh my god we're gonna start
[49:16.400 --> 49:19.640]  censoring to stop the conservatives they were already doing it but they said
[49:19.640 --> 49:25.840]  we've got to do it completely now in the midst of all this I had been told that
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.880]  Facebook set up whatever was 14 years ago or whatever and then promoted you know
[49:31.880 --> 49:35.760]  to the top of the food chain less eight nine years was meeting with Bilderberg
[49:35.760 --> 49:38.720]  meeting with top globalists and we later confirmed Zuckerberg would been going
[49:38.720 --> 49:42.920]  to these meetings right out of Harvard he wasn't on the list he was a unannounced
[49:42.920 --> 49:49.520]  guest at a few of the earlier ones but by about ten years ago he was at the
[49:49.520 --> 49:55.520]  front of Bilderberg then they went public hundreds and hundreds of billions
[49:55.520 --> 50:00.040]  of dollars came in the top people at Facebook now for about three years have
[50:00.040 --> 50:04.640]  been quietly taking their money out that's the pump now here comes the dump
[50:04.640 --> 50:08.360]  and so we said they don't just have people in there because they've set up a
[50:08.360 --> 50:11.680]  social system to track people they're gonna want this for social control
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.600]  they're gonna want this for for political control they're gonna want this to
[50:16.600 --> 50:20.520]  track and trace everything you're doing for behavioral modification that's what
[50:20.520 --> 50:28.000]  we heard from sources over ten years ago that were inside the meetings then six
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.040]  years ago we get documents that Google is helping China design a social credit
[50:32.040 --> 50:35.040]  score that will track everything you do in real time info words is first to
[50:35.040 --> 50:45.000]  publish as usual outside of academic circles that pisses him off now you see
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.760]  oh the guy from China who loves Communist China he says we need a social score
[50:49.760 --> 50:52.800]  like China and he's running for president and oh the New York Times
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.120]  Washington Post oh Zuckerberg's gonna have a social score and face scanning
[50:56.120 --> 51:00.440]  even you know park your car and see if you're not a good globalist your face
[51:00.440 --> 51:03.440]  can turns off and you can't park your car you can't get on a bus you can't get
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.720]  on a plane and China is already doing it this year 11 million flights for people
[51:07.720 --> 51:14.080]  canceled because they got lowered in their social score so this is the most
[51:14.080 --> 51:23.040]  naked out-of-control authoritarianism the galaxies ever seen I use that term
[51:23.040 --> 51:26.080]  because lawyers and when contracts for rights they will say in all known
[51:26.080 --> 51:37.360]  universes and this galaxy so imagine and then it's a pump-and-dump meaning they
[51:37.360 --> 51:41.000]  pump it up they get all the schmucks in it they quietly take their money out of
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.960]  the Ponzi scheme and then they decide when to implode it but you don't stop
[51:43.960 --> 51:48.400]  there you then say it happened because they help Trump win when that was like
[51:48.400 --> 51:52.560]  not even 1% of what went on with people paying Facebook for analytics Trump
[51:52.560 --> 51:56.120]  just publicly scraped names of his conservatives to contact them Facebook
[51:56.120 --> 52:01.080]  in live time it's in the WikiLeaks said the Democrats own us he told Merkel you
[52:01.080 --> 52:07.760]  own us whatever you want they give them everything but see they let the EU come
[52:07.760 --> 52:12.160]  in and start regulating Facebook and Twitter and Google by Trump and the
[52:12.160 --> 52:15.960]  Republic is not regulating for two years and saying no regulation it's allowed the
[52:15.960 --> 52:20.040]  EU because our government hasn't protected our companies to come in and
[52:20.040 --> 52:28.840]  take over the regulation by fiat and Trump gets that now but we got to get
[52:28.840 --> 52:34.200]  moving and so then when they implode Facebook saying oh it spies on people it
[52:34.200 --> 52:37.440]  won't be for all the real reasons and out of that will come these new laws and
[52:37.440 --> 52:40.440]  regulations that the Democrats have written up and the EU have written up
[52:40.440 --> 52:44.840]  and the China have written up that will allow the internet globally under EU
[52:44.840 --> 52:50.880]  Chinese and US rules to merge under a new censored controlled system and this
[52:50.880 --> 52:56.320]  is all been announced now we first saw it coming we first knew about it we first
[52:56.320 --> 53:02.320]  went and to bars and local hotels and said after after after work hours were
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.760]  over we go there at midnight buy people drinks and say hey so you work over
[53:06.760 --> 53:10.200]  there at that hotel it's gonna be closed next week we hear you gotta have
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.400]  advanced teams go to these things they say oh we already told us we can't talk
[53:13.400 --> 53:17.680]  to you I'd say here's my number when you see how evil they are now you can't
[53:17.680 --> 53:21.880]  look them in the eyes when you hear all the evil things they say I want you to
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.240]  get stuff out of the trash can I want you to bring it to me we've got flows
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.040]  your cars following us and chasing us and you know Tucker in Istanbul and
[53:30.040 --> 53:32.960]  your guys on walkie-talkies I mean and ducking in and out of things trying to
[53:32.960 --> 53:36.760]  get documents and they tell you go here to get it and I mean this is this really
[53:36.760 --> 53:41.920]  goes on and then you find out they're gonna have a social score system and
[53:41.920 --> 53:45.320]  control everything and track everything you do and if you don't comply they'll
[53:45.320 --> 53:48.480]  not even allow you to operate in society and I'm like this is Mark of the
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.320]  Beast so I'm on the air now that I put the film out 11 years ago in game where
[53:52.320 --> 53:55.440]  I say they're gonna have a casual society Mark of the Beast where everything
[53:55.440 --> 53:59.680]  you do is track live time on the internet with a score you have this is in
[53:59.680 --> 54:05.960]  the film a score you have that they can then stop you from having a job or
[54:05.960 --> 54:10.360]  getting on an airplane or buying food if you're not a good globalist that's in
[54:10.360 --> 54:17.600]  the three-hour film because it's from the builder group now it's all over the
[54:17.600 --> 54:24.080]  news it's here take microchips microchip your kids blah blah blah and they now
[54:24.080 --> 54:26.760]  have a huge article written by an authoritarian from Turkey where they
[54:26.760 --> 54:32.800]  put people in dungeons saying Alex Jones should not even be allowed to be on
[54:32.800 --> 54:37.920]  the air period he lies and says vaccines can hurt you the damn insert says
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.080]  that and they lie to you and don't tell you and they list all these things I've
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.760]  supposedly done they either lie about what I say or they twist it but the
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.080]  point is it has me being grabbed by a black hand and drug into darkness and
[54:51.080 --> 54:56.200]  again they've got an authoritarian from Turkey who specializes in annihilating
[54:56.200 --> 55:06.000]  free speech Zaynep Tufti and what's the message and they say we're taking
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.400]  control of the Internet we're gonna censor everybody for everyone's good
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.680]  and Alex Jones is the devil but they're the devil coming in the dark to grab you
[55:16.680 --> 55:18.880]  and pull you into the dark and saying you don't have speech and then lying
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.800]  about you but see they get to be ruling class now they've been prepared and
[55:23.800 --> 55:27.240]  trained at the universities they're really intelligence operatives of the
[55:27.240 --> 55:38.280]  deep state to come in and take control of civilization they're gonna come in
[55:38.280 --> 55:42.040]  and they're gonna run your life they're gonna dominate you that they are

[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:22.640]  jones okay I just spent much of the last hour getting into the establishment
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.560]  getting ready to take down Facebook it'll take about two years but it'll be
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:32.000]  gone and they might decide to change course and resurrect it but they
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:38.360]  generally don't do things like that we have dr. Steve Pachett joining us that
[1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:41.080]  predicted a lot of this on air at the bottom of the hour and again a lot of
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.880]  folks will say good I hope Facebook goes away they're corrupt and bad not about
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.480]  that it's about a pump and dump on investors the big boys getting their
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:56.120]  money out years ago and it's about using the spectacle of its ongoing collapse to
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:00.160]  sell new forms of censorship and to muddy the waters and act like Facebook's
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:04.840]  being punished for surveilling people by focusing in on things that weren't even
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:08.960]  illegal to cover up all the real crimes that Facebook and others have been
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:15.120]  engaged in and to create fear in the other tech giants that they could be
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:24.520]  regulated because there's fear in the tech giants that they could be taken over
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:29.640]  by government but government has acted so pliant and pliable with it that now
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:37.160]  big tech's gotten big brushes and thinks that it actually runs thanks so you've
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:40.440]  got corporate powers vying with each other you've got the chai comms the EU
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:47.440]  Russia the United States and the global estate anybody who has allegiance to
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:54.880]  their country allegiance to free market allegiance to anything decent we've got
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.920]  top dem senator the one that's been running the censorship in the Senate
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.760]  who demanded I'd be taken off the internet four months ago and you saw the
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.840]  effect one month after he gave the order because he represents the globalist
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:13.000]  mark warner Google must do more to censor YouTube and other dem senators
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:19.960]  are saying the same thing so they're making their move because the
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:24.120]  establishment decided that an open and somewhat free internet will destroy them
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:29.000]  and so we have to know what's next and get Trump and the Congress to take
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.240]  action because the Republicans are hey you're free market companies we're
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:36.360]  gonna leave you alone but the Democrats are working through the EU and the chai
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:41.720]  comms to put regulations from overseas on these companies and so you're allowing
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:47.320]  them by not coming into the vacuum mr. president to take control and they're
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:50.440]  also fearful that ignorance by the Republican leadership without the
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:56.120]  internet works may allow them to get regulation through regardless so the
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:06.680]  Republican establishment are extremely stupid Trump's not and I only sat there
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:10.600]  in a committee hearing headed up with Warner a few months ago and I watched the
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:13.760]  only senator cotton bring up the chai comms and the spy chips and all of our
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:19.960]  electronics and how this is so dangerous and how they Google won't even work with
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:25.360]  the Pentagon on things now but will work with China on AI yeah the globalist are
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:35.560]  anti-america Google's move there Apple's move there turns out as big tech makes
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:39.560]  bigger profits they cut the pay to their own employees they don't pay taxes
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:44.920]  they're the most ruthless evil godless people they own the worst factories these
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:52.840]  tech companies are run by demons but because they dress like hippies and you
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:57.440]  know Jack Dorsey has a little nose ring a little booger collector must say you're
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:00.880]  bad if you like nose rings it's just like oh I'm an average guy I have a nose
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:08.520]  ring look I have tattoos it's like that deal we're billionaires will drive some
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:12.120]  old Ford Taurus and while they jump on some seven million dollar you know
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:15.960]  jet copter it flies into the airport where they get in their hundred million
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:23.440]  dollar jet it's all just virtue signaling crap these people are ruthless
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:30.240]  authorities absolutely enjoy making you poor want to suppress you want to take
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.960]  away your liberties and freedoms and then give you race based identities while
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:40.320]  they say they're fighting racism 180 degrees different from Martin Luther

[1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:31.080]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:36.080]  so in case you didn't hear I'm sure you did it's the top story on DrudgeReport.com
[1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:40.760]  for three straight quarters Facebook's been going straight down and a lot of
[1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:45.440]  people say it's not really profitable it's a giant pump and dump and there's a
[1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:53.200]  big fight taking place over who's gonna control Facebook well let me tell you
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:57.920]  Facebook was set up over a decade ago with Bilderberg money back in Zuckerberg
[1:06:57.920 --> 1:07:02.800]  we just got out of Harvard he was going to Bilderberg meetings and they were
[1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:08.920]  planning it as a social control mechanism that would then basically
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:15.160]  privatize illegal NSA spying and get people to opt into illegal spying and
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:18.840]  then they wanted to use NSA data on somebody illegally they would just go
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:23.240]  pay Facebook to reverse engineer it so they could have claims in court that it
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:28.000]  came from that and you know you saw the judge just ordered Alexis last week with
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:33.680]  Amazon it's little spy droid in a double murder case and then Amazon had to
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:36.800]  confirm yeah it was recording from the day they plugged it in even when it's
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:40.840]  off to the day it was unplugged by the police and it's got the audio everyone
[1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:48.200]  being murdered recorded that's the whole point of AI and you know beware
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:55.320]  Greeks bearing gifts they bring you the Trojan horse you put it in your house
[1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:59.000]  and then you wonder what's going on like well I'm not murdering anybody that
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.640]  doesn't matter it's run so they get a detailed profile on you and know
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:07.280]  everything about you and have high-tech AI scanning at all putting it into a
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:13.840]  database so they are getting ready to destroy Facebook they'll drive it way
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:17.080]  down it'll go back up a little bit the next year and then finally plane out
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:22.720]  forever that they'll want to sucker the suckers again remember Zuckerberg said
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:27.920]  our users trust us they're dumb efforts I can't believe how pathetic they are
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:33.400]  they're so stupid that's a quote he just loves screwing you over and he will
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:40.040]  don't because he acts liberal I'm a liberal oh as long as you go then
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:44.200]  everything's okay literally just like Tim Cook just like all of it it's very
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:50.440]  very funny it's very very funny and then if you want to censor the internet and
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:55.920]  take over well you you first demonize somebody for two years saying they're
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:01.040]  the dark heart they're the worst person on the planet they're a Nazi and then
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:06.240]  finally oh they have their moral moment the slave factory owning Apple that's
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.360]  given all the code keys to communist China Tim Cook bans me and that everyone
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:14.960]  else follows suit and then always a little virtue signaling companies they
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:21.680]  come along and they do the same thing so that no one stands up for me except
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:26.840]  Matt Rudge and Tucker Carlson and our listeners and then the president set
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:31.520]  for everyone else and it's wild how they were calling for me to be taken off a
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:34.960]  year ago and six months ago it was because I've done horrible things they
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:39.840]  never showed what I did they lie about it but now they just say oh we're in a
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:49.080]  crisis against nationalists we've got to shut them all down and Alex Jones was
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:56.160]  just the beginning and they have major academic papers working with the federal
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:59.560]  government you say well Trump's the federal government no he's not 90 plus
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:06.320]  percent of it does not follow his orders this is called mutiny against the
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:12.320]  nation against the people by these multinational corporations allied with
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:16.320]  the most murderous regimes on earth so this is the whole shooting game ladies
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:21.040]  and gentlemen I got lots of other incredible news but this right now is
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.360]  everything because if they take your communications away if they can selectively
[1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:29.840]  control what you can see and what you can do it's the ultimate form of
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:37.400]  discrimination so let's go over the latest news and then senator Warner but
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:41.240]  let's first look back a little bit because when I come back I'm gonna read

[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:01.600]  universities they bring in the controllers and then they deploy them to

[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:01.920]  illegal stuff and then when they won't totally ban everybody and commit
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:10.560]  suicide Soros says I will pump and dump you faster if you don't submit to me we
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.560]  told you months ago tech investors start to panic as Facebook stock price
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:19.400]  plunged more than 20% that was a few months ago so here we are in 2012 and
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:25.960]  info wars calm calling Facebook a pump and dump in the future so there's some
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.240]  background for you and now it's here and now it's happening and now they're
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:33.440]  going to bring in a social score we're every cuz that's what the suddenly the
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:36.680]  professors are all proposing it and the New York Times is proposing it and a
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.120]  nice man from China who's running for president you know to be on the stage and
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:44.960]  call for censorship being a good thing you'll be paid a thousand dollars a
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.360]  month you don't have to work but everything you do will be tracked by
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:52.920]  your smartphone the government gives you it's called slavery that's all over
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:58.520]  the news and then the senators come out and act like they're pressuring big tech
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:03.200]  to do it but it's all part of the larger plan top-dimmed senator mark Warner
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:12.480]  Google must do more to censor YouTube that's out today YouTube is one of the
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:14.720]  most censored places out there now unless you're promoting child
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.240]  molestation or devil worship or teaching six-year-old Asian girls that white
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:24.480]  people are inherently bad we played video last hour you can't allow stuff
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:30.080]  like that to be challenged it has to be in an echo chamber to succeed and so
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:34.360]  now he's come out and he's pushing this whole thing we must act against this we
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:38.320]  are allowing China and the EU and big tech with the Democrats to come in by
[1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:45.200]  fiat with regulation take total control of the internet censor everyone and then
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.480]  say that we're bad people and when I read when we come back this article and I
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:53.200]  play the clip he who must not be named what Alex Jones and Voldemort have in
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:56.760]  comment it is the most incredible projection I've ever heard we need to
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:01.080]  drag Alex Jones off into the darkness and silence him she comes from the
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:06.400]  authoritarian country where they do that turkey she goes on until all these lies
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:10.560]  and twist things and then talks about how we need to move to censor everyone
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:16.360]  that opposes us in this emergency we're in yes some people in Brazil and Italy
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:20.200]  and the United States and even Mexico and other areas are upset about this and
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:24.800]  people know this is bad and so you're calling it an emergency that people want
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:32.880]  to run their own countries and not have the globalist run them from afar it's
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:39.480]  it's it's it's just astounding it's completely incredible but you can
[1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:44.080]  override the censor you can override these these tyrants they'd like to
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:47.280]  bring people in from foreign regimes former Stasi and and and and

[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:08.480]  Lailani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:13.520]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:18.280]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:24.200]  levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:28.920]  pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:33.720]  and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:38.640]  gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:44.440]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:49.400]  Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:54.360]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:59.120]  good water filtration system will purify it
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:05.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:19.560]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:28.040]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide very powerful article by Jamie white
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:33.200]  just went up on info wars.com veteran GOP congressman schools Dems who claim
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.360]  Trump attacks press freedom that videos coming up also Democrat
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:42.320]  presidential candidate wants government sponsored social credit system
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:48.200]  compatible to China's it's all coming up ladies and gentlemen and if you're on
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:51.520]  welfare you'll have to be on it but you can opt in to get a thousand dollars a
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:55.440]  month to be totally tracked that's just to begin it it's called slavery so you
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.000]  domesticate wild animals you start feeding them a little bit you build a
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.600]  cage a pin you put the food inside the pin they go in you close the gate the
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:11.840]  circle is now complete all right so bring them this to a head they're trying
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:14.800]  to bring down Facebook right now to terrorize the other big tech companies
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.560]  to get in line for total censorship George Soros is threatening Google and
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:23.480]  others that you'll go like Facebook if you don't submit we will absolutely take
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:28.000]  your stock down this is economic terrorism and the president and others
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.480]  going oh we're free market we'll leave it alone is allowing the vacuum of the
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:33.760]  chai comms the EU Soros and others to come in
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:39.280]  meanwhile Obama declared an emergency sign the emergency into law in the
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:44.840]  defense authorization act in December of 2016 for the next fiscal year that's
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:52.320]  done it before the year and recruited stay-behind networks of operatives for
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:58.800]  the emergency to stop the the Russian takeover and that's just that they know
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:01.280]  it's all a joke that's the cover then they have congressional hearings and
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.400]  said Jones is a Russian operative we must get him off the internet in 2017
[1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:11.040]  by the middle of 2018 they'd begun to do that so if you're outside globalists
[1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:17.960]  taking down the country you call the loyal nationalists the outsiders because
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:22.040]  the Achilles heel of the globalist is they are the outsiders usurping an
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:26.600]  enslaving the country and now the president says we're a nation we shouldn't
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:31.400]  have one-sided trade deals where Canada has a 280 percent tariff on milk and we
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:36.560]  don't they go that's the most racist evil thing your nation doesn't exist but
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:39.840]  Alex Jones is evil and he works for the Russians because he's red white and blue
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:45.320]  and loves the country see I know you know this is an audience but this is what
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:48.840]  they're doing then they bring in a bunch of former Stasi they bring in people out
[1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:52.480]  of Turkey out of the Middle East real authoritarians a lot of Chinese
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:55.600]  operatives are brought in most these Democrat senators actually have a
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:59.720]  Chinese officer from the Intelligence Board as part of the Chinese funding of
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:03.400]  any high-level den you have to have one of their operatives usually as a chief
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:08.040]  of staff or as your their top assistant like Diane Feinstein who then runs the
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:12.320]  whole off we of course the first to expose that she was Chinese run we
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:19.440]  already knew that was known we've got that out there let me continue here so he
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:23.680]  who must not be named and then it shows me and it's gonna be reportedly one of
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:29.720]  the cover stories on the December Wired magazine coming out here in just a week
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:35.200]  is total darkness with a black hand that means an assassin's hand this image
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:42.200]  means in intelligence operations this image but it's normally just a normal
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:47.520]  looking face not my face is the symbol of a snatch and grab one woman it's a
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:50.400]  total darkness and a black hand grabbing over the mouth it means you're
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:55.480]  going into a dungeon which Turkey is very famous for so we have this Turkish
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:00.560]  individual over here who's about women's rights of course don't the
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:05.440]  Islamists always do that he who must not be named what Alex Jones and
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:11.400]  Voldemort have in common this demon snake creature from Harry Potter that I'm
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:14.200]  not into magical thinking so I haven't followed Harry Potter if you want to be
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:21.120]  into that that's fine I've seen pieces of them but you read this she's the one
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:24.440]  calling for censorship she's part of the big evil cabal and then she's talking
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:28.400]  about how I'm the devil and the one that must not be named remember David Hogg
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:33.040]  talking about this and said oh I'm not supposed to say his name because you're
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.640]  not supposed to say my name here it is I'm saying Alex Joe sorry I want to
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.240]  mention his name when individuals say these things to us I think it's
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.840]  important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make
[1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:47.920]  money off them for example one of the main people in this situation that I
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:52.440]  don't want to name the name of but as you said it's from info wars he shots a
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:55.880]  lot I'll just give you that and he looks red
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:00.520]  he's advertising many of these things and the power lies in these advertisers
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:03.680]  to pull out of these fear-mongering hate-loving people that just want to
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:08.400]  spread hate and division in America for example on info wars one of the main
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:12.320]  things that he spoke one of his famous things is saying that one of his most
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:16.280]  famous statements was saying that top water is turning the frogs gay and will
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.600]  turn you gay too first off gay people are awesome I don't think that's a
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:24.000]  problem at all and secondly if you notice at the end of that video he
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:33.520]  advertises water filters yeah that's the point the waters toxic and here's the
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.880]  best water filter at the best price by the way of the best deal ever on Alexa
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:40.440]  pure pro that's their biggest nice sustainable still model the one that
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:44.920]  does the most water the best model out there 127 leading competitors for
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:48.440]  something similar a 350 400 they're normally a great deal at 240 they're
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:51.360]  selling it to us at cost because they ordered too many of them they don't want
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:54.880]  to get hit obviously with the end of your inventory tax so that you've never
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:59.280]  been a better time to get Alexa pure breeze it is literally 127 right now at
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:05.680]  info wars store.com info wars live.com or triple 82533139 see he he's he is an
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.540]  actor not a crisis actor the shooting happened he's an actor on the acting
[1:26:09.540 --> 1:26:13.520]  deal a Democrat he admits he's given lines and his lines are don't say Alex
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:17.040]  Jones his name and you know turn the frogs gay even though the chemicals are
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:22.400]  actually sterilizing with frogs is what we said now he must not be named I got
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:27.640]  Dr. Steve Pacinic coming back on the broadcast and he's predicted a lot of
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:30.320]  this we're gonna look at how big this is and what this really means to
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:34.080]  everything there's a lot bigger than just Facebook and then when he leaves I'll
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:38.680]  get into all the latest Antifa and the rest of it but to read this
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:46.080]  authoritarian's article she says the most ridiculous things in here it shows
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:51.840]  how childlike their minds are these want to be authoritarian's she goes on to
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:58.440]  say I will now say his name because now he has no more Voldemort power he has
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:02.800]  been banished and is nothing and I think she must believe in Harry Potter like
[1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:06.120]  she's saying this oh she's a five-year-old girl and it just happened
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:11.280]  hey cupcake I have some smart advisors but I do what I think I should do they've

[1:32:58.280 --> 1:33:09.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:25.400]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:34.120]  listening to alex jones show we are in the middle of a epic move by different
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:39.400]  powers and different forces to openly take control of the internet and sensor
[1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:44.560]  nationalist conservatives christians you name it and then use it for a social
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:48.720]  score that tracks everything you do and only favors elite corporations and it's
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:53.440]  being now promoted everywhere we first told you about this six years ago now
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.880]  they have the New York Times all of them today wired magazine you name it
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:02.000]  saying he who must not be named what alex jones and Voldemort have in common
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:06.480]  then has me being snatched and grabbed and drug off into the dark pit so I love
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:09.760]  about some woman who fled authoritarian turkey to come over here and be a
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:14.600]  professor and do it here but that's what they're pushing that's what they are
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  are bringing in now you got all these democratic senators saying oh Google
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:23.160]  hasn't done up a censored pro-trump people oh Facebook you know you're going
[1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:27.240]  down because you let Cambridge Analytica publicly scrape some names when
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:30.160]  that's nothing compared to what Facebook Google and Twitter have done so I wanted
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:33.360]  to get Dr. Steve Pacinicon because he's talked about a lot of this he's he's
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:38.440]  predicted a lot of it he was on a few months ago with Owen and said that it
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:42.320]  was pretty obvious to me talked about before that that Facebook was being
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:47.120]  prepared to be taken down it was obviously set up as a pumping up a long
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.640]  time ago and then to spy on people but out of that process they're gonna try to
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.560]  sell all the censorship so there's a war for the internet happening right now
[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:59.640]  and because Trump hasn't come in and put prohibitions on it that's allowed other
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:04.320]  outside interests in my view to come in like the chai comms the EU with their own
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:08.480]  regulations and basically take control of the web so I wanted to get Steve
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:12.720]  Pacinic's take on this because he knows a lot of folks that are involved at the
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:16.040]  upper levels with at least how this was created and what it was supposed to do
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:20.080]  versus how it's been hijacked for authoritarianism and to me this is one
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.600]  of the biggest issues globally right now so doc thanks for joining us no
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.480]  problem what I told you well over a year ago was that Facebook was in
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:36.480]  financial trouble I don't need any information from above or elsewhere I
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:43.320]  was tracking it and I was shorting a lot of that stock right now Facebook is not
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:51.040]  in great shape the maximum value of Facebook was 212 and now it's at 138 at
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:56.240]  the bottom that's the fifth 52 week high and low and what I was saying well a
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:01.600]  couple of months ago is that Zuckerberg doesn't know how to run this the company
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:07.240]  shan but a sandbird doesn't know how to run it she has been a serious problem to
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:12.160]  this company and other people and as a woman she wanted to talk about how great
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:16.560]  it was as a woman how she could lead a company and how smart she was and blah
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:22.120]  blah blah basically what you got is two Jewish exceedingly narcissistic characters
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:28.920]  who are very self-destructive I said it years ago and ironically she used her
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:37.520]  Jewishness to basically hire the pro-trump or let's say the opposition
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:44.640]  party company to create anti-semitism and then make it sound as if they were
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:49.680]  being attacked for being Jews which is despicable I mean I think that should be
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:54.440]  enough to get rid of her and to the face of completely but the other part that
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:59.160]  was a real problem for Facebook which I've been monitoring I said years ago and
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:05.200]  that is the concept that Facebook in some ways was a positive force in the
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:10.520]  world when in fact it was a facilitator to the genocide that occurred in
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:15.640]  Minimar and I had talked about that and that's when the 700,000 Roangies the
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:19.840]  Muslims were getting killed by another so-called liberal who is the Prime
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:25.000]  Minister of Minimar Burma named Aung Suu Kyi so the notion that women are
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:30.520]  especially entitled to run anything and are better than men is really not
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:37.040]  proven by Sandberg or Aung Suu Kyi so what we have here in Facebook is a very
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:42.760]  serious problem both financially politically and in terms of viability
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:46.240]  if I were the board of directors I would throw out Zuckerberg even though he
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:51.680]  owns 60% of the company but at this rate the company will go probably down to its
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:57.360]  lowest value right now in 52 weeks which is 132 and my suspicion is it'll go
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:02.520]  below 120 and then to 110 and possibly a hundred if it does that then it will
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:07.080]  bring down the other thing stocks so Zuckerberg it's not in a position to
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:12.360]  really run anything right now the issue of Zuckerberg was very interesting to me
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:16.840]  because eight years ago when I saw a social network it was obvious to me that
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:21.360]  this was a young man who was self-aggrandizing who was a misogynist
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:27.320]  quite frankly because what he did in order to create Facebook was to basically
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:34.320]  ask all his friends at Harvard to rate the the looks of the women at Harvard
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:39.000]  and if that's not misogyny I don't know what it is and in turn he didn't turn
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  out to be a geek he really went to Phillips Exeter and in New Hampshire
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.280]  was the head of the fencing team so everything about him the speaks for
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:55.280]  in grandiosity and narcissism that's so out of control but has no sense and I
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:58.240]  should add you're a psychiatrist too so we're not just have people randomly up
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:02.360]  we're saying this but expanding on the bigger picture here yeah they're going
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:05.880]  after Facebook for supposed spying on people but they're going after the least
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:09.000]  of it and then they're using it to threaten the other tech companies to
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.040]  go along with the Democratic Party and others that won't even increased
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:16.320]  censorship and this is one reason that the Republicans didn't keep the house in
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:20.360]  the midterms and now they're saying all over the news they're going to intensify
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:23.400]  it they're even trying to take my banking away they're going after
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:26.880]  everybody I know this is real authoritarianism and so I want to get
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:31.800]  into specifically what you think about what needs to be done to counter the
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:36.160]  fact that this is just green-lighted even more censorship that that Trump says
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:40.960]  he's about to take action but we haven't seen it yet well whoa I'm not sure
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.840]  you've got more censorship here than you think the the notion why the
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:51.120]  Democrats won on the midterms and I was involved at the local level it was very
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:57.080]  clear Nancy Pelosi ran an incredibly effective race whereas Trump did not and
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:02.680]  I have to you know I'm not a fan of Nancy Pelosi but I understand national
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:08.920]  politics when they came into every area of the country she ran a very effective
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:14.200]  very streamlined campaign which was highly focused but that's exactly what
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:18.560]  I'm saying is that Trump got elected because we had internet superiority and
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:22.240]  the grassroots went out and did the job for them they ran the same campaign because
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:26.360]  his people told him no sir you really want it going and doing rallies one
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:30.200]  Trump supporter putting a viral video out is bigger than a whole Trump rally
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.720]  and so they undercut everything and and and literally allowed the complete
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:39.080]  shadow banning basically of everybody and dialing back nationalist
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:43.760]  conservatives or anybody that isn't anti-america 96% that's why they lost
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:48.960]  and then allowed the targeting that Pelosi engaged in well I'm not in
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:54.000]  agreement I think we lost and here in Florida it was even clear to me I voted
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:59.320]  for the Sanctus and I I gave him money and we came in by only a few points the
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:04.240]  same thing with Rick Scott it had nothing to do with anything other than the
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.960]  fact that the campaigns on both side were not effectively run the Republican
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  Party had a very poor leadership issue Paul Ryan had left and we had no
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:20.720]  mere basic message it wasn't a type of you know just censorship that you were
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:24.640]  talking about this was really operational problems and what it meant for the
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.840]  future of the Republican Party is that we're in trouble the same way I said to
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:32.400]  you about Facebook the same way I'm telling you now the Republican Party is
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:37.240]  in trouble because it has no leadership if Trump is in fact the leader which
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:42.440]  he's not he's mercurial he has his own problems he's really out of control in
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:47.080]  many ways the Republican Party doesn't know which way to go and it doesn't have
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:50.360]  at least he's a cheerleader for the country and it's trying to do better
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:54.840]  deals on trading things but I agree that he doesn't have people around him that
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:57.240]  are really trying to turn the country around most of them are just trying to
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:01.400]  be popular with both sides and make a bunch of money and the fact that take
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:04.360]  campaigns out of this the fact that they're letting the Democrats come in
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.640]  with this mass targeting by cartels and censorship of certain groups is
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.000]  discriminatory it's very very dangerous and it's a dereliction of duty if they
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.840]  don't start doing something whoa whoa whoa look from the very beginning I
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:24.200]  told you he has a problem if you want to put Jared Kushner in there who has
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:29.960]  supported Mohammed bin Salman who in turn killed Basaji if you want to put in
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:34.600]  Ivana Trump who has done absolutely right you did say two years ago that you
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:38.160]  like Trump but the fact that Jared Kushner you believe could destroy Trump
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:42.840]  and now continually I was right I was right we got a war on Yemen my
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:46.760]  generals do not want that war they want to pull out and that's what's happening
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:52.880]  we had a Prime Minister of Lebanon who was taken hostage let's talk about it
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:56.560]  when we come back let's talk about it when you come back
[1:42:56.560 --> 1:43:01.120]  words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.320]  now info words is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party left to CIA
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:10.320]  operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:13.720]  syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them because they were
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:17.640]  already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:22.200]  future we didn't do this so we've already had incredible success but if you
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:26.680]  will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:30.880]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:35.760]  spread the word about our articles and videos info words.com we won't just
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:40.560]  continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags we'll win we have huge

[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:47.360]  shopping cart get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact of trying to block
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:51.160]  our commerce and you're right to the market but if you don't stand up and
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:54.520]  support us financially Soros the globalists may win this is info words
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:58.920]  darkest hour we hear support I'm counting on you. The globalists know that if they
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:02.120]  suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:07.880]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:12.040]  population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:17.040]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:20.800]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:24.520]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:29.200]  nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible. Now due to the
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.680]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:38.240]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:42.360]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:49.120]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available.
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:52.480]  Ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:57.440]  incredible discovery X3 now available at InfoWarsLife.com

[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:09.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:38.360]  You may be the heavyweight champion of the world. It may be a socialite with a long
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:42.800]  finger pulse but you're gonna have to save some. We're back. We're talking to Dr. Steve
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:45.720]  Pachennick. StevePachennick.com co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy, a really
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:49.280]  smart guy, worked in the U.S. Intelligence State Department. We should know about history
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:53.520]  sometime, really interesting stories you can tell. But specifically looking at
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:58.440]  internet censorship I understand you can sit there and say the Republicans ran
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:04.840]  incompetent campaigns. Yeah, Hillary said you shut down Alex Jones, you shut down
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  the conservatives, you kick them off YouTube and Facebook. They had hearage
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:14.240]  and they did it. And it wasn't me they were really blocking. It was all the
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:17.720]  little old ladies that might put out 20, 30 videos, but one of them gets 50 million
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:21.960]  views. We were getting 20, 30 million views on videos on Facebook for Trump.
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:27.240]  And then Carl Rove doesn't want that. He'd rather get a five million dollar package
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:33.000]  on Fox News and run those ads that only reached maybe the same five million,
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.760]  six million viewers over and over again who were already gonna vote Republican.
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:39.080]  So I get it Dr. Pachennick, yeah, targeted. The Democrats actually went
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.640]  after swing voters in key areas. I get it. The Republicans didn't even really do
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.760]  that. I get the incompetence. They're gonna continue to be incompetent because
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:51.800]  the blue bloods just want the money. I'm saying Trump coming in with some
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:55.360]  anti-trust busting or threatening he's gonna go after them like the Democrats
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:59.320]  threatened Senator Warner and others to take over Facebook, Google and Twitter
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:04.200]  and they rolled over and peed all over themselves like a dog. And that's why the
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:08.720]  Democrats were able to win. Okay, because Trump had his legs cut out from under him.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:14.200]  So I agree. It is incompetent that the Republicans have allowed this.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:21.280]  That's what I was getting at. The censorship of the internet is something
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:25.920]  that you correctly brought out and you've been part of it and I've been
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:31.000]  part of it. So I'll give you an example. When I have my own YouTube and we have
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.920]  50 or 60,000 people who view it, we're getting demonetized. Are we getting less
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:43.240]  money? Is there a fascist element to Google, YouTube, Facebook and the others?
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:48.760]  The answer is absolutely yes. To what degree is that fascist element? It's to
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:53.920]  the degree that people like myself who will trade on a daily basis will either
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:59.240]  start shorting the stock or anonymous will come in or the others in the
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:03.960]  intelligence community will say it's enough. This no longer serves our
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:09.200]  national service. The truth of the matter is the Chinese are ahead of us. They
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.800]  had quantum encryption. We're not anywhere near them. But at the same time
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:19.480]  we're wasting money on F-38s of fighter jets that are sitting there for $385
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:25.000]  million with parts that came from China. But I don't have enough money to make
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:31.480]  a senior general the secretary of cyber war instead of putting in them on their
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:37.320]  homeland security. You are absolutely correct. But the problem also lies in the
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:43.720]  White House. He is now changing elements and relying on his own family, Kushner,
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:51.160]  Ivana. Melania correctly fired a woman who was anti-matters. But if John Kelly
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:56.320]  leaves and you bring in Nick Ayers who's a Republican operative and is going to
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:00.280]  run the White House, you're gonna have troubles. I can predict that. If you keep
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.920]  John Bolton there and he has been a neocon his whole life, has had no
[1:51:04.920 --> 1:51:10.280]  national security experience on the ground, avoided the draft, avoided going
[1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:14.800]  into Vietnam, although he was a proponent of war. And I've worked with
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.080]  John. I don't personally dislike him, but I don't admire him. I think he's a coward.
[1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:24.600]  As is the neocons. Then you will have trouble. And the problem is we have put
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:31.760]  in matters. Kelly, Nakasone, Abazaid, all these generals and Pompeo because the
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:36.320]  civilians have not done a good job. I don't know how many times I've had to
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.800]  say it since the beginning of the Obama administration, the Bush Jr.
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:45.480]  administration. The fact that we have military generals is not an accident. And
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:50.760]  I will repeat it again. If civilians intend to go to war and if the president
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:55.680]  does not know what he's doing, we will keep squeezing on the military side. And
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:59.760]  it's as simple as that. You can call me treasonous. You can call me whatever you
[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:04.520]  want. But I said it years ago, I wrote about it in maximum vigilance. 20 years
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:09.320]  ago, we can no longer force civilians who had had no military experience. It's
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:13.760]  not that they're warlike. It's the other way around. Mattis wants to get out of
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:18.440]  Afghanistan. And who do we appoint? Zalmi Khaledzad, one of the most corrupt
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:22.120]  incompetent. No, I understand all that. Here's the difference. You have the
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:26.880]  Democrats openly out alive with the chai comms out to get the country. Alex, the
[1:52:26.880 --> 1:52:29.720]  neol-con, the liberals have nothing to do with the chai comms. No, I know the
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:33.520]  neocons are, I get it. I know the neocons are heavily involved, too. So the
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:36.960]  neocons are bad, the liberal establishments bad. All I'm saying is at least
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:42.200]  Trump's trying to get jobs back and promote that a nation-state exist. So
[1:52:42.200 --> 1:52:47.240]  I'm not even here defending Trump. I'm very upset that more isn't happening
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:50.640]  and that people like Jared Kushner having dinner with the head of Google
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:55.960]  who sits there and gladhands him. And so I'm not enemies with Jared Kushner, but
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:53:00.840]  certainly he's the guy that sold Trump reportedly on this whole deal with
[1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:04.800]  this Prince, whoever. And then it looks like this whole thing has blown up
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:10.880]  spectacularly. Correct. The point is, Alex, you have to direct some of your
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:14.840]  attacks to really where the incompetency lies within our own
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:20.640]  administration. We, Trump can only do what he can do. He came in, he's
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:26.080]  charismatic, he's mercurial. We've tried to stabilize that mercurial, but he will
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  continue. But if he cannot build an infrastructure and he did a brilliant
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:35.600]  job of appointing Nancy Pelosi, who's 80 years old to say, look, she has to
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:40.600]  remain the speaker at the house. Why? Because she and he are very much alike.
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:45.080]  They both come out of a background of the mafia construction. I remember
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:50.160]  Pelosi's father was the mayor of Baltimore when I had hotels there.
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:54.040]  Trump's father was in the mob. He had to build construction in Queens and
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:59.560]  Brooklyn. They both understand what it takes to create a unity function, but
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:04.200]  they have to build infrastructure. We don't have it. We need to keep moving on.
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:08.960]  We need to put more money into cyber command. I need more money into schools.
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:14.080]  I have kids whose education level is so bad. I'm in a state where the kids'
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:19.120]  education is the 46th in the state in Florida, and they say to me, oh, give
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:23.920]  the teachers more money. Well, Rick Scott didn't do anything. Bill Nelson hasn't
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:28.720]  done it. Let's see what the state is. So what I'm saying is Soros is a figure head
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:32.640]  of it, obviously, but the whole UN globalist combine wants to collapse
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:37.360]  nation-states, discredit the borders, discredit any ethos of believing in your
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:41.560]  nation. If we lose that, we're done. And so the big thing that Trump's doing versus
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:46.200]  the Democrats is he's being pro-America. The Democrats have radicalized with
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:50.560]  Eric Swallowell saying, we're going to confiscate all the guns. If you don't
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:55.520]  like it, we'll nuke your ass. I mean, the Democrats have literally degenerated
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:03.640]  into a group of like day-of-the-dead zombies. Alex, I always enjoy your
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:08.960]  analogies in your description. The truth of the matter is Soros was one of a few
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:15.360]  people who went after Facebook and said this is a very dangerous entity, and he
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.200]  particularly went after Zuckerberg and Sandberg saying she has no idea because
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:24.640]  he wanted to bully them and letting him direct them. No, not direct him, but
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:30.240]  telling them exactly where the problem would lie in terms of the ongoing
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:36.920]  genocide. Look, I met him 40 years ago when we were in the Soviet Union. I didn't
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:42.280]  know who he was. He used his own money to take Sacheroff off out of the Soviet Union.
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:45.040]  No, I know he was used during the Cold War, and I get all that, but it came out
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.360]  in the WikiLeaks. He wants to control what can be published. He has a
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:53.680]  database. Google and people are using him to say what should be up and what
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:56:00.640]  should be down. He's the real threat. I look, he's been in and out of so many
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.440]  things. There's no one man. I mean, honestly, he's not the threat. No, I know what
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:10.800]  he represents though. But what does he represent? He doesn't eat. The
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.080]  Council on Foreign Relations, which I left, isn't even relevant. Do you
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:19.920]  understand? I mean, the relevancy of all these institutions are gone thanks to you,
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:25.160]  others, myself. They're not relevant. No, I agree that's going on. But still, when
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:28.760]  they give orders, things happen. It doesn't mean it does what they want, but
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:32.200]  it still has repercussions. Like, they thought censoring me would get rid of
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:35.840]  us. It actually caused us to, like, mutate, get even more powerful in a way.
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:40.520]  But I didn't want to tell them that. The point is, is that... But the point is, you
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:46.240]  are more powerful. They made a big... That's my point. They made a serious
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:50.960]  judgment, Colin. I said it. When you were on the air, we would not let you go off
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:56.040]  the air. But in fact, what happened is, you became even more popular than before.
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:02.360]  And people talk about it. But the answer is, how are you getting transmitted? You
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:06.520]  know how you're getting transmitted. We know how you're getting transmitted, but
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:12.280]  the truth is, Soros isn't the problem. The Democrats are finished. That's not an
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:15.280]  issue. Even the Republicans... I'll do five more minutes then. We're gonna come back,
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:18.160]  give me your view on that. Because you were the guy, remember, like, you were
[1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:22.000]  coming on 18 years ago, but 15 years ago you go. The East was gonna collapse, and
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.600]  the West Coast is all gonna move into the Midwest, and Texas will be the new
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:28.320]  capital, and, you know, all that stuff. So, I know you're a smart guy, so I want to
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:31.560]  get where you think. The way we keep the country going, and we don't have a nuclear
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:35.640]  war, and I agree that Madison and people have been trying to stop wars. That's a
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:39.720]  good thing. And I agree the neocons are a big problem. In fact, really, if you look
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:43.720]  at it, in fact, the neocons were bragging at a defense deal in Germany last month
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:48.280]  that they're gonna take even more conservatives out. I have an opportunity
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:53.440]  for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air. Obviously,
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:56.480]  water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing, and I've had water filtration
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:00.400]  sponsors since the day I got on air. And over the years, I learned a lot about
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:04.720]  water filtration. I learned what the best was. Now, the Alexa Pure pros their
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.080]  biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:11.040]  amazing. Because all the bad stuff leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.200]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my page supply that have developed these
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:19.920]  filters ordered a huge amount of them this year. He has a glut of them. He's
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:25.240]  offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted using 200, it's
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:32.440]  127. He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20 something bucks on. So
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:36.400]  they're gonna sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the gift of
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:43.200]  health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or

[1:59:46.680 --> 1:59:58.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:13.680]  Alex Jones here back live. I'm gonna get into all the news. We have it covered a
[2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:17.220]  bunch of the breaking news, the next few segments. We're talking to Dr. Steve
[2:00:17.220 --> 2:00:20.400]  Pachennick of StevePachennick.com, best-selling author, researcher, former
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:24.560]  psychological operations head of the State Department, and we're getting into
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:29.840]  what happens next. And when I said after we quote lost the election a few weeks
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:34.600]  ago that I'm taking a new direction, it isn't that I don't like Trump as much as
[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:39.520]  I ever did. It's that Trump's done so much good I've been persecuted for
[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:43.040]  supporting him. So I said that making me not support it makes me supporting more
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:46.720]  because I'm getting persecuted because of it. I think oh then he must be really
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:49.440]  good because they're attacking him, but really it's just a power struggle going
[2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:53.040]  on. And Trump does care about the country. He doesn't want to screw the
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:58.480]  country over just to screw it over. But the fact is we have to get back to basic
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:03.040]  issues and talking about the news we cover instead of just the tug of war
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:07.680]  battling with the Democrats, you know, over whether Trump's an officer or not
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:11.200]  because I don't want to say I lost respect for Trump, but when he's one of
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:14.400]  the only people that even talked about censorship, so did Ted Cruz and Rand Paul
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:18.240]  and said something should be done, but when he didn't act, that really was the
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:22.080]  big area that he showed he didn't get what was going on. But I wanted to ask
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:25.040]  Steve Pachett in the last three and a half minutes we have what you think's
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:29.280]  coming next, what the other big trends are, and thanks for joining us.
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:34.560]  Well, if Facebook goes under and they're gonna keep going under, their
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:40.080]  RS rating is 16. That means 84% of all the other stocks are more
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:45.600]  valuable than Facebook. So you're gonna have problems with
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:49.600]  Google, you're gonna have problems with Netflix, you're gonna have problems with
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:52.800]  Amazon. So the fang stocks are gonna go down.
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:56.960]  They primarily account for about 30 to 40% of our economy.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:00.720]  So that's why we have a serious problem right there.
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.480]  Number two, Trump has to start making the overture to Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi has to
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:10.640]  take over the Democrats. The Democrats have to be united. We need
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:14.800]  an infrastructure program because it'll keep our economy going.
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:18.560]  There's fear in the markets that we have
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:23.280]  unemployment coming in, and we also have a deflation.
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:27.520]  I don't agree with it, but the markets today are terrible. They're uncertain.
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:31.280]  They've been vibrating up and down because they really don't know which way to
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  go with Trump. Trump has to allow the markets to have
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:39.760]  a certain amount of certainty. Otherwise, the markets will go against him,
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:45.280]  and the economy will do very poorly, and everything he wants to say or do will
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:50.080]  mean nothing. If the markets don't respond to a certain amount of certainty
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  and a sense of the future, then Trump is in trouble.
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:57.600]  Secondly, Trump has to understand he can't keep picking
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:01.680]  at Halman and the people he thinks are close to him or hasn't been
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:05.600]  effective. That doesn't work here in the White House. The White House
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:09.520]  needs a certain amount of consistency and reliability.
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:13.840]  70% of the world thinks right now that Trump is not reliable.
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.360]  That's not relevant to me as much as it is to the
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:20.880]  stock markets, which feel that... But isn't that our own corporate media
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:24.480]  doing the undermining? They blame Trump for that. I mean, isn't it Maxine Waters
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:26.720]  when she gets in control of that financial committee?
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:30.400]  She says she's going to roll back in the regulations. If they're the problem...
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:34.400]  Well, they're not the problem right now, because the markets are six months ahead.
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:39.040]  They don't even know about Maxine Waters at this point. What happened at the
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:45.040]  markets before midterm is that it allowed itself to go up, and then it came down
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:48.720]  with the fear that the Democrats would take over certain elements.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.320]  But at the same time, if you build an infrastructure program,
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:57.680]  it'll eliminate any doubts whatsoever. So the key issue right now isn't whether
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.680]  Maxine Waters can run it or not. Once you get into Congress,
[2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:06.400]  you don't become a Republican or Democrat. You become socialized as a
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:09.760]  congressional representative. The same thing with Kavanaugh.
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:15.200]  Once he gets into the Justice Department, or he goes into among his colleagues,
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:19.760]  Sotomayor said it very clearly. He said,
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.440]  Welcome. Sorry, Hillary Clinton literally broke into our feed.
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:29.360]  I'm sorry, go ahead. It's my dogs. No, no, no, no, no, it's Hillary.
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:35.040]  No, no, put it up. Oh, okay, I thought that was my dog.
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:39.840]  No, no, it's Hillary. Hey, I'm going to call you today at three o'clock
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:43.760]  my time, four o'clock your time. We got to talk about that thing.
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:48.160]  All right, see you later, buddy. Bye. A real character right there.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:55.840]  All right, infowars.com, newswars.com. Tomorrow's news today, straight ahead.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:59.760]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:03.840]  environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:08.160]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[2:05:08.160 --> 2:05:12.240]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:17.120]  we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed-based iodine that was
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:20.240]  pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:24.000]  supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.520]  nascent iodine, and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:31.200]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and
[2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:35.520]  secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But
[2:05:35.520 --> 2:05:39.280]  chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:43.600]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:48.560]  supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:51.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an
[2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:57.520]  incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.

[2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:26.720]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide. I'm Alex Jones, your host
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:32.640]  on this live Monday, November 19th, 2018, global transmission.
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:37.120]  If you're watching or listening to this, you are the resistance to the globalists.
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:40.320]  Their movement is the resistance to the nation-state, free market and
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:44.640]  capitalism. You know, I really love President Trump,
[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:52.080]  and not because he's in power. I remember many years ago when I had
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:07:00.480]  then governor becoming President-elect Bush, and they sent some federal
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:04.480]  marshals because he was President-elect over to
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:08.880]  access television. And they said, the governor's going to be
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:12.240]  watching, or the president-elect's going to be watching tonight,
[2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:15.600]  and he wants you to say some nice things about him,
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:19.040]  and then he, you know, sometimes go to dinner with you because you could be the
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:23.200]  next Rush Limbaugh. Now, I've since heard that from President
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:26.320]  Trump. Like, they say you're the next Rush Limbaugh. I'm like, well,
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:30.720]  I've already had bigger audiences than him, but okay, I'll take it. Thanks.
[2:07:30.720 --> 2:07:34.400]  You know, like, even though I'd already won him become number one in talk radio
[2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:38.240]  a long time ago. And yes, since they deplatformed me, it did
[2:07:38.240 --> 2:07:42.160]  kill some of the mega audiences. I mean, sometimes we would have, you know,
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:45.520]  30 million people tuning in a day. It wasn't always like that, but it was, you
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:48.400]  know, every day was four or five million, but some days, you know, it'd be like,
[2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:53.440]  what the hell? We'd be like, numero uno.
[2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.480]  But for me as a guy, it's not like, I've already been there. So it's kind of like,
[2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:59.200]  I already climbed that mountain, and people go, you know, someday you'll be up on
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:03.920]  that mountain. So I don't support Trump because he's
[2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:07.040]  the president and has a super hot supermodel wife and
[2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:11.200]  flies around on helicopters, and that impresses me. Because I already came from
[2:08:11.200 --> 2:08:17.040]  access television 24 years ago. I already have come from nowhere,
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:20.560]  and so them trying to take it away from me doesn't do anything,
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:24.080]  because what I want is freedom. What I want is America and the world to be
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:27.840]  successful. What I want is the future of my children.
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:32.320]  A car that runs nice, not having to worry about bills, that's good, but I don't
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.160]  worship money. You could say, I'm taking it all away,
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:41.600]  and I'd say, I'm going to try to take you out.
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:44.640]  Because you're a tyrant, you shouldn't be able to do that to people. I wouldn't
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:47.840]  then say, oh, let me kiss your ass. I'll get ahead more
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:51.920]  in this giant group of people going up a pyramid in a spiral staircase
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:55.680]  kissing each other's butts, but they all got daggers out for when the guy looks
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:08:58.720]  the way to stab them. That's not how I operate.
[2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:01.600]  It's not what I do.
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:06.720]  And when I talk about what I stand for, it's not the narcissistically said
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:09.360]  up there and say, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. Why are they so obsessed with
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:12.880]  inforwars? Why do they hate me so much? Why do they want me off air? Because
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:17.120]  we remind them, the sellouts, what scum they are.
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:21.040]  So, yes, I criticized Trump some in the last hour, and I agree with
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:24.720]  almost everything Pachennic was saying. He's a smart guy.
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:29.280]  But the good things Trump is doing show out way his
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:33.920]  failings that it's not even the same universe.
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:37.520]  Now, Pachennic was signaling what's going on. Trump has said,
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:40.720]  I'll work with you, Democrats. I'll share power. I'll give you some of the money
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:43.600]  you want on pork deals. He's trying not to do that.
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:47.760]  But just get off the country's back. Just let us have jobs.
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.960]  You already run the country. Why the hell do you want to run in the ground?
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:55.680]  See, that's his big failing with them is he doesn't like running you in the
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:59.520]  ground. And so, Pachennic signaling, hey,
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:02.800]  this is going on. And because Kushner hadn't been in the military, hadn't been
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:06.640]  in intelligence agencies for 30, 40 years, you know, there's this attitude
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:09.360]  from professionals like Pachennic that, oh, that guy, I know what the hell he's
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:12.080]  doing. If there's one thing I've learned, I don't
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.760]  know what's going on up at that level.
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:19.200]  And at so many levels, the top level is not the top level.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:22.960]  It's what we're doing here that really changes things
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:26.400]  at the greatest level. And then the establishment, once they figure out they
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:30.000]  can't stop something or once they figure out something worked, they'll take
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.280]  credit for it. And that's great. I'm all about people
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:37.360]  taking credit for what you've done.
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:41.360]  I'm going to say that again. It isn't some patronization
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.000]  where I just include you with a participation trophy on air
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.520]  and say, man, you've really done a great job, listener, spreading the word and
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:52.720]  taking action and standing up to the bullies and you've changed the world.
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:56.320]  People are waking up to capitalism being a better system, nationalism,
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:10:59.600]  people are waking up that Christianity's under attack, the family's under attack,
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:04.640]  the very genders are under attack. A lot of really good things are happening.
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:07.760]  And it's because of you.
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:14.560]  And that's not me up here including you. You're not just included. You're not
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:19.200]  just essential. You are the war.
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:24.720]  You're not part of it. You're it. Period.
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:27.920]  I'm just saying things you already inherently knew in your gut
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:32.800]  and creating a focal point so that you are given further confidence
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:37.040]  to see and to hear as we're mammals. We communicate. We care about each other.
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:40.640]  We live in communal groups to have a community.
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:43.920]  The left is all about taking people that have no community. First they take your
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:48.160]  community, then they create a new artificial community to control you.
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:51.760]  We're promoting an original Americana community
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:55.200]  that was the best community ever that everyone wanted to get involved in
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:58.400]  because despite the fact that our community was terrible compared to
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:02.000]  others, it was the best because the ideals of it
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:05.840]  were high and noble. It believed in the individual.
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:08.880]  It believed in the group. It believed in ideas. It believed in building something
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:11.280]  better. It believed in not just riding off the
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:14.720]  poor and the old, the infirm, but building them up.
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:18.000]  So the enemy came in and took our greatest strength. We cared about
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:24.800]  the children. We cared about those that are childlike.
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:29.120]  And they turned that against us and said, now you must be like the childlike
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:32.480]  or you must be mentally retarded or you must be down and
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:37.200]  ignorant because, well, you can't be better than somebody,
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:41.600]  which again is the ultimate tyranny. So that's where we are.
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:44.240]  And I never got to all these clips I have. I have a bunch of them. I'll get to them
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:47.760]  next segment. I'm going to get to them. But
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:50.720]  Trump's done a great job pointing out we have borders,
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:53.520]  pointing out we have one side of trade deals, standing up against the control
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.160]  corporate media, showing that they're a bunch of enemies.
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:01.680]  And he's had a great job trying to get regulations that were written to shut
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:05.040]  down our nation out of the way and medical
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:08.400]  laws that were meant to suppress new innovations. That's out of the way.
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:12.080]  I mean, Trump's doing a way better job than I could do. So it's very hard to
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:18.320]  criticize. But then I realize if we don't criticize,
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.640]  we'll lose everything because it's the few areas that he's not operating
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:26.160]  properly on that the enemy then puts everything behind.
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:31.760]  And those are the areas where if we fail, we will fail magnificently.
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:35.680]  So I could do a better radio show that had more listeners today where every five
[2:13:35.680 --> 2:13:39.280]  minutes I had an incredible new article or clip to talk about that was very
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:43.120]  interesting, that would keep you interested. But I'm not just trying to
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:46.720]  keep you interested. I'm trying to keep you engaged in
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:49.760]  your own destiny because we're in this together.
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:53.520]  And I'm trying to get people to focus in on the big
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:56.880]  enchilada that our speech is being taken,
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:00.400]  which means our right to commerce, which means our right to the digital system
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:06.800]  with digital IDs and a world social score that is
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.440]  the system of absolute control and absolute tyranny.
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:14.560]  And it must be opposed just like Christ said
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:18.240]  to John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos 2000 years ago.
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:24.320]  This is the big one. Woe to you on the planet
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:28.880]  for the devil sends a beast with wrath and his number to 666, the number of a
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:32.240]  man, neither buying or sell without the mark, the
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:36.080]  right hand or the forehead, the biometric scan.
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:38.720]  And it's here.
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:43.920]  And you say, well, I don't believe in God. Believe in reality that China
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:47.040]  is using it to control their people and it's now being exported here and to
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.760]  Venezuela to suppress people. This is the ultimate system of degradation.
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:55.120]  Just like trying to take our credit card processing and shut us down financially
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:57.760]  so we don't have the speech to warn you about what's happening.
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:00.960]  It's here. It's not coming. World government, all of it. This is the
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:04.240]  desperate fight to stop it.
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:08.560]  That said, please fund our operation and realize we're running
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:11.680]  the sale a few weeks ago. It was the biggest ever. Now this one's even bigger
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:14.800]  because it's the same sale more expanded with double
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:18.400]  Patriot points on every purchase set of 5% off each dollar.
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:22.000]  It's 10% off on your next purchase. Double Patriot points,

[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:34.320]  best water filter, normally like 240-something bucks.
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:37.600]  Now 127, we're selling it for them at cost
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:40.480]  as a favor because they ordered too many at the end of the year for an inventory
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:44.880]  issue. Now's the time to act on that and a bunch of other specials, 75% off
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:48.640]  store-wide plus free shipping. Everything must go, clearance sale
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.160]  to fund ourselves in the next year. InfowarStore.com, thank you for your

[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:30.800]  only for the conservatives? What if there was a social media network not
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:34.000]  only for the conservative right general public but also a platform for
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:37.680]  conservative politicians and advertisers? And what if the social media
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:41.040]  network was the only free speech network in existence?
[2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:45.920]  There is. It's rightsocial.net. Rightsocial.net. A response to President
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:50.000]  Donald Trump's direct presidential order. Rightsocial.net where you have the
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.960]  right to freely speak your mind. Rightsocial.net. The right place to be.
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:58.480]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:02.560]  cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:05.680]  or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:09.360]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.280]  requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:16.960]  easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable. For the finest
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:20.800]  in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:25.360]  go to Minutemanstove.com. That's Minutemanstove.com.

[2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:24.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:24.640 --> 2:20:49.920]  All right. I don't want to make the news about me, but it is, because they've decided to make us the
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:55.520]  heart of the debate, so they can then take us off the air and then misrepresent who we are,
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:21:01.920]  because the populist movement, the Americana movement, the Second Amendment Free Speech
[2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:07.600]  Movement had such a big victory when Trump got in that they had to then not let us be folk heroes
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.560]  and continue on to have great victories. They had to make us the shameful, horrible, bad people
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:20.720]  that were banned because they were so bad and were who, like, Voldemort from
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:29.840]  the Harry Potter series. It's all archetypal, so here's the new article up on M4Words.com.
[2:21:29.840 --> 2:21:35.360]  Petition launched to give Alex Jones' White House press pass. I want to be clear,
[2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:39.440]  unless you go grandstand and make yourself the news, like Jim Acosta,
[2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:46.880]  having these things is not really worth that much. So we had passes and CNN and others lobbied that
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:51.520]  we were fake news and somebody in the administration took it away from us. Jerome Corsi wanted it,
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:55.440]  we got an office there, did it all properly. We were there a few weeks, Corsi never even got
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:22:00.880]  questions in, and they act like, again, if I wanted to live in Hollywood, I'd move out there.
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:05.280]  I just want to be able to have my own broadcast and not be banned on other platforms, but
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:10.240]  everybody's pointing out that why is Jim Acosta there, but Alex Jones isn't. So that's people
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:17.280]  signing that petition to send it to the White House. It's pretty funny. Also, again, I never really
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:23.840]  read this article. I mentioned it. It's really powerful, powerfully evil by this person from Turkey
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.120]  who has the image of me being kidnapped and taken into the night and says after Alex Jones,
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:33.680]  we'll ban everybody else. It's just very authoritarian, and I thought I'd get to that
[2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:38.400]  later. But you know what? In the interest of time, I may just do a special report on that because
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:41.600]  there's so much other really important news I want to get into like this.
[2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:49.920]  In England and in Germany and Sweden by law, every year elementary students, middle school
[2:22:49.920 --> 2:22:55.200]  students, high school students, and college students at public schools are taken to mosque,
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:23:01.040]  and you take your shoes off, you worship Allah, you're given paperwork. If you're a 14-year-old
[2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:06.720]  girl, they introduce you to a 25-year-old man. They have a made-for-TV state-sponsored television
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:11.360]  that says 14-year-old German girls, Muslim men from Africa and the Middle East are here.
[2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:18.320]  They are good men. You need to learn to be with them. That pedophilia is legal by fiat in Europe
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:24.320]  if it's a Muslim with your daughter. We've played these clips here. I'm not kidding. This is the
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:31.840]  social engineering. German school girls asked to wear a jib for social experiment to test if
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:37.280]  German citizens acted racist towards them. Paul Watson has an article, racist, even though it's a
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:41.760]  religion, that doesn't let you not be in the religion. It's the cult coming in just like
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:47.280]  Heaven's Gate, Hellbop cult, made you cut your testicles off and your penis,
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:51.680]  and then you were going to be beamed up to be with the space aliens. Now they teach that your
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:24:01.680]  five-year-old son, it's a good thing. Continuing, China just dumped the biggest load of US treasuries
[2:24:01.680 --> 2:24:11.440]  in eight months. Now we're in a war with China. Chinese homoerotic router gets 10 years in jail.
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:19.680]  Well, it's okay because Tim Cook's okay. And it goes on from there. So that's just some of what
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:26.560]  we're going to be covering here. But what I want to get to now is the fact that
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:36.000]  conservatively there's dozens of migrant caravans funded by the UN at UN bases in Guatemala and
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:41.600]  Honduras, the other staging grounds in each country below them in Central America down all
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:45.760]  the way to Chile. These are just stopping off points, but to make sure you don't get the big
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:53.760]  sum up front of $10,000 to get all the way to El Norte, you're given on average whatever it takes
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:24:57.600]  to get from that country to the next. So it's a couple hundred dollars a year. Once you've
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:01.920]  been a good person and gotten all the way up some say from Venezuela, seven countries up to
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:10.480]  Mexico, you get $1,000 on a MasterCard prepaid visa with no name on it or the pin code on the back
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:15.440]  from US taxpayers through the State Department to George Soros. That's on record. We first
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:25.840]  broke that. Now it's mainstream news. And so that's why they caught Pito, I mean, Bito or whatever
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:34.240]  his name is, Bevo or Roark, Beto, I guess I said, funding millions out of the taxpayer money and
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:40.560]  out of campaign matching to sit there and send money down to a caravan that was arriving a month
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:44.800]  ago. You're like, but the caravan hadn't gotten here then. They're always arriving. We first showed
[2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:51.120]  them six years ago with our reporters. We broke this was going on under Obama. So Trump's just
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:56.480]  saying, no, we don't randomly let buses full of men, women and children, a lot of them smuggled
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:04.800]  kids in and the media says no to that. Like it's a bad thing. Well, now Mexicans agree with Trump
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:10.560]  call migrant caravan an invasion. It's all in Spanish, but I'm going to play some of it with
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:16.720]  audio here in just a moment. Paul Joseph Watson, powerful video. Protesters and Tia wanted to
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:21.040]  man migrants go home because at least 10,000 of the hundreds of thousands that are in Mexico at
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:26.640]  any one time are robbing, stealing, killing. Many of them are multi-time felons and the Mexicans
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:31.520]  know what's going on. They're saying, what in the hell is going on? You can't do this.
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:38.400]  Mexico has laws about their southern border, which got smashed over. Mexicans all saw that
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:44.080]  happen. They understand it's an invasion. And so let's play some of the audio of the Mexicans.
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:03.840]  Which is a normal response when hundreds of thousands of people ram over your borders and
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:09.280]  they're almost all military men are stomping around waving their flags and burning American flags.
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:15.440]  First thing the Mexicans noticed was there aren't even waving Mexican flags.
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:20.800]  They're waving Honduran and others. The protesters didn't want tax dollars spent on
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:26.480]  humanitarian aid. Yeah, they get the people coming up from Central South America are the
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:32.640]  dregs, the communists, who are an invasion force who want a bunch of free crap. You're not welcome
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:40.160]  here. You're a traitor if you help them. Right now there are detention centers the United States,
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:45.280]  but you're similar. Go to hell, go to hell.
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:54.240]  And the peace with the people, oh, they have concentration camps. Oh my god.
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:28:03.120]  Immigrants. Yes. Illegals. No. Notice your phone. Yeah. Yes, it goes on. We don't want them here.
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:08.800]  I mean, how obvious is it when hundreds of thousands of people come through your country
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:14.160]  running over your police waving flags and burning things and raping and killing people. So when
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:23.680]  we come back, that's Tijuana. Just north of that a few miles is the border near San Diego and our
[2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:32.960]  own Savannah Hernandez and crew were there. And here come the Antifa people, of course,
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:38.240]  screaming that we're all Nazis when George Soros, the collaborator, actual Nazi collaborators
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:42.880]  running this. And of course, you don't see these little Antifa guys going to Mexico and getting
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:46.960]  the people a bunch of men's face. They get their ass kicked in about two seconds. No, they wanted to
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:57.440]  mess with one man and one woman 10 to one bunch of thugs. The United States of Empire is a book
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:03.360]  that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:10.320]  foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:16.720]  Its former colony, the US had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[2:29:16.720 --> 2:29:23.600]  The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn available at
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:29.120]  Amazon Books. Water is the single most important thing your body needs. So you want to be sure

[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:10.560]  since the day I got on air and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration. I learned
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:15.840]  what the best was. Now the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the

[2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:39.280]  good deal at $249. When it's discounted using 200, it's 127. He's selling them to us at cost
[2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:44.560]  and we're making 27 bucks on them. So they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift

[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:08.480]  them are like little side accounts. They even know we had like info or store that just showed
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:13.680]  our products. But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally
[2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:18.000]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:22.160]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink. But the globalists
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:27.440]  now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:33.920]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate,
[2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:38.720]  not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that.
[2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:42.800]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen. But you've got to back it.
[2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:48.000]  And I promise you this, I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level.

[2:33:14.560 --> 2:33:41.360]  the information war it's Alex Jones. You know people are telling me all the time I should take
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:50.480]  off a few months but I may never come back. He only did what he had to do. I was about 24 and I
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:53.520]  was already on air and busy all the time and I used to work out like an hour and a half a day,
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:59.280]  two hours and then at one point I quit doing it and I stopped for about 10 years. That's why I
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:08.320]  got to stay on this horse. I can't get off now because I never come back. All right so if you
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:15.360]  just tuned in our own Savannah Hernandez and Drew go down to the border and I was griping
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:19.360]  them I said because it was kind of bad camera work. Drew does great camera work but he's got
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:22.560]  the camera hanging on the side because there are a bunch of men up there basically threatening a
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:26.640]  woman. They call themselves cop watch but that's religious to the anti-food group now. They're
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:30.960]  all dressed like anti-food they all look like. They haven't seen daylight in about 50 years
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:35.600]  and they're screaming FU Nazi all this stuff and Drew had to put his camera down because he was
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:40.480]  getting ready to have to fight and finally they left him alone but I said hey I told you not to
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:47.040]  have the info wars flag on the microphone. They said listen we did that they knew who we were
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:53.280]  and I guess they do know who Savannah is and said Savannah's a brave lady she's in the control
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:57.440]  room running things right now one of the producers and she said no I mean I'm proud of who I am so
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:02.400]  I'm gonna say my last name. A lot of folks on TV and radio have a fake name just because you can
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:07.280]  protect your identity with that like some of the other folks like Leigh Ann McAdoo is not Leigh Ann's
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:13.760]  name. Her first name is Leigh Ann but but you know if she got harassed quite a bit they didn't run
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:16.480]  her off she had to take care of some sick family she's getting ready to come back and work with
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:22.160]  us soon but and I don't blame her you know if I do all this now before I might have used another
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:25.920]  name just to throw people off you know so they don't really know what your real name is you know but
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:32.800]  it's really Alex Jones but here's just a nice woman doing a fair report down the border
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:39.600]  and here come these thugs and they they know who she is they recognize Drew and they and they get on
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:44.880]  them I was talking to them you only see a few of them because Drew was getting ready to defend
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:49.200]  Savannah and she was getting ready to defend herself there's about 10 guys got around them
[2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:55.360]  you see four or five but they got around them and we're really a thugging out like they were gonna
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:36:00.560]  I mean don't they get how disgraceful it is to encircle a man and a woman who are journalists and
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:06.800]  get in their face and start threatening people and calling them racist the Mexicans have it's
[2:36:06.800 --> 2:36:13.760]  estimated 5,000 have now arrived in Tijuana mainly men and you look these are thugs that were paid
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:19.120]  to come up here many of them have been deported before and so people know what's going on
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.480]  and but here are these guys they have this magic word you're a racist you're a racist you're a racist
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:30.240]  and they go oh a black guy came over here and hauled Hitler well you don't have proof of that
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:34.960]  but the whole point is they're so sick of you calling everyone a racist it becomes a joke
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:40.800]  I have a stack of news articles here I never got to see a document cam shot them to play this
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:46.000]  because one thing they put in the wired magazine article which is important because
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:49.120]  these are the top of operatives that are running the shutdown of free speech
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:37:02.160]  in the whole uh stay-behind group Obama set up and they say in there over and over and over again
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:10.480]  that Jones claims Jews stage attacks on themselves and that Jews are the Nazis are really Jews
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:19.600]  I never said that you lion weasel I said in almost every case at the Air Force Academy or the
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:27.760]  university or wherever somebody burns across in somebody's yard it's almost always either the
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:32.480]  husband or the black lady that's madder because he's thrown out of the house and he does it as a
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:38.560]  publicity stunt I mean you know they can't care about you idiots but you go around trying to
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:44.960]  burn crosses people's jar get your ass blown off I mean this isn't like the 1930s or something or
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:51.840]  not even 1960s in Alabama or Mississippi and so I I read the news every day there are very
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:59.920]  a few cases that I can remember where there were some real racist white people out killing black
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:04.880]  people or doing something now there was the case in east Texas where the guy had been one of the
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:08.480]  leaders in the black gang and they were the leaders in their white gang and they got them and drug
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:12.160]  him to death so his head came off and it was terrible but they'd all been in rival race-based
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:15.680]  gangs and they'd drive down the road one day and they go look there's a leader in one of the black
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:24.080]  gangs let's kill his ass terrible it's wrong but what I'm getting at is can you remember
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:27.520]  a swastika getting painted on a dorm
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:36.160]  or a black woman claiming five white guys raped her the lacrosse team where it was real
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.400]  and the answer is you can't there's also cases where white women claim black men all rape them
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.800]  and do this and it turns out that's fake too there's a lot of fakeness going on as the point
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:51.520]  but not with the islamist raping people that's really going on and that's being covered up so
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:58.240]  let's go over this rap sheet 639 acts of media approved violence and harassment against Trump
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:03.680]  supporters that's nothing they don't even list half the ones we know of meanwhile what the Air
[2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:11.360]  Force Academy hate crime hoax teaches us about mainstream media and race year in review 17 campus
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:20.480]  hate crimes that turned out to be hoaxes fake hate crimes a database of hate crime fake hoaxes in
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:27.920]  the u.s fake hate crimes dot org we should get the director of that on fabricating hate crimes
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:34.960]  is a byproduct of victim hood ideology on college campuses ohio university student
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:39.120]  senate member who claimed to have received a death threat arrested for making false claims
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:45.440]  false alarms racist note this is yesterday on kansas student door was written by himself
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:52.080]  beware inwards live here did it to themselves i'm gonna stop reading all these will run out of time
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:01.040]  but i said the leftist aging attacks the jewish leftist that turned over the gravestones and
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:05.440]  attacked synagogues trump already had been told by the state police in new jersey that it was
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.680]  leftist doing it trump said i think that's probably fake they said oh my god you're saying
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:15.600]  no one attacks jews he had to do a special skate of the union to say he didn't hate jews
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:20.480]  turned out the day after he was right the jewish guy committed uh pled guilty
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.400]  to the attacking himself it's not blaming jews it's blaming criminals that do self-inflicted

[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:32.640]  okay
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:44.080]  i'm not saying that arson was used to burn down millions of acres in california in the last
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:53.040]  month but the regulations that were put in place the last 30 years by the blm and state authorities
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:48:00.720]  not just federal have not let there be controlled burns or fire breaks put in directly caused the
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:08.000]  fires to be able to travel unimpeded and thousands of years of fire management and land management
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:16.080]  were thrown out the window and that's why now we've got all of the big firefighter associations
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:24.560]  and the big land management associations and others coming out saying president trump was
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:30.640]  right we don't build fire breaks in most areas of the country the military builds them around bases
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:38.000]  corporations do it and by zoning under regulations that george herbert walker bush signed on to
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:46.960]  a 92 the un tells us where we can and can't have fire breaks or land management under rewilding
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:55.360]  regulations much of the nation fact about half the west you can't trim out underbrush a tree falls
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:49:00.960]  over you can't cut it up and use it or sell it and that creates all that fuel for lightning strikes
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:07.440]  to really get giant infernos going that are able to cause the incredible debt of devastation so
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:11.920]  so here's some of these articles right here i'm going to show tv viewers loggers support trump's
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:20.240]  claim that wildfires are caused by poor forest management remember the media claimed a week
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:24.560]  and a half ago all the firefighters are mad but they didn't quote any firefighters even the
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:32.880]  autobahn society comes out and says no it's time for fire breaks we were wrong secretary zinke
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:40.880]  back trumps claims that years of mismanagement led to out of control record fires that's what's
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:47.920]  going on and then we've got all the history of it and what fire breaks do and why they're needed
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:53.680]  and the fact that they're trying to block us even having fire breaks there's san francisco chronicle
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:50:01.600]  calling for fire breaks that was in july of this year here's autobahn saying it's now time for fire
[2:50:01.600 --> 2:50:08.800]  breaks your stuff from 100 years ago posters telling farmers to build they were notice around
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:14.160]  fields old fields or old houses there's like a two foot wide three foot wide two foot tall
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:19.840]  hump of rocks or dirt you're like what does that keep out what does that do well there's a flood
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:26.080]  most floods are only a foot or two high it doesn't flood your house and fire doesn't jump it on average
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:32.240]  there are water breaks and they're fire breaks before we had insurance
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.480]  you can look up fire breaks for yourself and the fact that trump brings this up and they act like
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:46.160]  he's a liar is incredible so go to the next level our own greg reese get a breakdown there's a lot
[2:50:46.160 --> 2:50:51.120]  of people online notice whole houses are burned but trees aren't burned and then cars are burned
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:56.000]  with grass their park next to not burned but they're melted down i don't know what's going
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:03.120]  on no one can break down what this mystery is the internet's on fire with it but regardless
[2:51:03.680 --> 2:51:07.760]  not building fire breaks not allowing control burns for at least 30 years since the time of
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:13.280]  george herbert walker bush has allowed this to happen and all the experts agree so bottom line
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:18.320]  policy allowed this to get out of control so this is a form of deindustrialization just like
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:22.320]  getting rid of the dams or not building new ones this is a form of feudalism a form of siege
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:29.760]  was it energy beams from you know krypton i'm not ready to say that i'm being sarcastic
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:52.560]  but something's going on it should be investigated it's always good to ask questions here's the report
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:59.520]  jump from house to house cnn reported that the so-called forest fire jumped to the freeway
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:06.640]  hundreds of photographs show cars with melted trails of aluminum alloys from what must have been
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:13.040]  an unprecedented amount of power the average forest fire burns at 1100 degrees fahrenheit

[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:34.880]  it able to melt aluminum alloy but consistently every home that caught fire was leveled to wipe

[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:09.840]  continue but will grow larger every season they warn their investors that future liability will
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:16.160]  force pg and e into bankruptcy in june utility officials told state lawmakers that they needed
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:22.880]  protection to survive the coming fire season and on august 31st california state legislature

[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:37.280]  at sunrise on thursday november 8th the campfire wildfire began in california it has all the
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:44.560]  same anomalies as the tubs fire and is already twice as devastating many people are asking the
[2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:52.480]  same question is this an attack in 2003 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and general richard
[2:53:52.480 --> 2:54:00.400]  mires admit to the development of directed energy weapons and microwave technology in 2017

[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:13.360]  from the inside out the technology exists the evidence is there but the motive perhaps it
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:19.440]  could be found in the united nations agenda 21 wherein certain areas of the country are proposed
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:27.120]  to be off limits to human use it just so happens that these strange california fires seem to all
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:34.000]  be within the proposed no human use areas new regulations and insurance policies are preventing
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:40.080]  homeowners from rebuilding and meanwhile they claim it is the new normal and are now claiming
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:46.160]  it is a phenomenon of global warming one thing is for certain the governor of california has
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:52.400]  already assured that the people will pay for all of the damages this is greg reese reporting for info
[2:54:52.400 --> 2:55:01.040]  wars dot com the video is posted info wars dot com right now if you're a radio listener you want
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:07.200]  to see this please spread this everybody you know must watch the california wildfires and agenda 21
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:16.560]  and regardless agenda 21 is the global treaty and policy to not create fire breaks or control
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:21.120]  burns that let these fires do this but then i was looking at this last week when reese was working
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:26.240]  on this he's a smart guy former marine patriot journalist you know he does engineering stuff
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:30.480]  and i said you know what's weird that car is right by grass it's dry it's not even burned
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:37.360]  and these houses and it is weird but regardless they set the policy they knew would allow this to
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:44.320]  happen in the last 30 years on allowing the fire breaks so regardless policy by agenda 21 and the
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:50.960]  un treaty on biological diversity caused this but now the autobahn society's own members are like
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:55.600]  cut the fire breaks that'll save the kangaroo rat and everything else it's not about the kangaroo
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:01.120]  rat it's about taking property it's like a northern california in southern oregon with what they've
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:06.480]  done with quameth falls and all that huge high mountain lakes with dams saying you can't have
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:10.800]  the water for farmers because of an endangered fish it's not endangered and isn't even indigenous
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:18.080]  it's invasive but that's all the joke hey let's use an invasive species and because humans are
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:22.800]  invasive the globalists say they act like they're aliens down this hill let's not let them have their
[2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:29.440]  damn water that farmers paid for in the last 80 years farmers would pay to have those state
[2:56:30.240 --> 2:56:36.480]  dams built but then farmers 80 years later they don't know what granddaddy did
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:41.600]  they just hear you don't get the water anymore sonny boy they're like what the lake's full of water
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:49.200]  sorry we're gonna shut it all down we're going to not let you use the water and when we're going to
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:53.040]  run you off your property but then we're going to turn the water right back on later and have your
[2:56:53.040 --> 2:56:58.000]  farming and have your houses and have it all for pennies on the dollar that's how globalism works
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.840]  and that's why they want to bankrupt info wars so that we don't have a voice to fund ourselves they

[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:30.080]  in just a moment but i wanted to introduce a very important report by our own david night
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:36.160]  dealing with world war one and and really how it's a precursor to the nazi regime and then
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:41.520]  the european union and where the next world war many experts believe is going to start this is a
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:47.520]  powerful report with david night put together by harrison smith i hope all of you watching will
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:54.080]  spread this link to everyone you know stay with us we have been in a continual state of war since
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:00.640]  we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after world war two we have a saudi led
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:08.400]  attack on yemen on the port escalating in just a 24 hour span at least 150 people killed after weeks
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:13.040]  of deadly fighting tens of thousands of people have been killed in yemen any reporting on that
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:17.360]  no they don't care about the lives of people they don't care about the lives of these yemenis
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:23.840]  they don't care about the lives of their own soldiers and they don't care about the principles
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:28.960]  that these soldiers thought they were fighting for either the principles just like the lives of the
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:35.360]  soldiers are expendable in these manufactured wars for empyre we've got something that is much
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:43.280]  more dangerous that is coming up right now we're coming up to a cycle in human history a generational
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:49.200]  turning point and again you should read the book fourth turning if you haven't uh strauss and how
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:54.720]  went back 500 years in american and english british history to see this recurring cycle
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:02:01.360]  about every 80 years having a major restructuring of society frequently these restructuring are
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:07.360]  accompanied by wars things like the revolutionary war the civil war world war two those were all
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:16.800]  fourth turning now as we talk about resurging old demons that's what i see coming i see history
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:26.480]  being recycled and when you have these standing armies when you have these politicians who have
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:33.200]  an empire mindset like mackerel who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:38.640]  those are the elements that create things like world war one because it was the type of thing
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:45.200]  that the founders had always looked at europe is having these constant eternal european wars not
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:49.680]  a remaking of society because you know people look at that and they said that was a just war
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:53.840]  that was a justifiable war whatever they look at the revolutionary war the civil war they look
[3:02:53.840 --> 3:02:58.080]  at the at world war two they say yeah that was a time when we were really fighting for some
[3:02:58.080 --> 3:03:03.600]  world war one they weren't fighting for anything but patriotism was summed up by smithley butler
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:07.280]  he said talking about true patriotism he said we fight to protect our home
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:17.680]  and our constitution so we fight to defend our lives to defend our lives not in foreign wars
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:24.160]  of empire not for regime change in the middle east we fight to defend our homes he said everything
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:30.800]  else is a racket it is organized crime and he was exactly right when we fight to defend our
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:36.160]  constitution we're fighting to defend our values that is what nationalism about patriotism is about
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:42.400]  fighting to defend your homeland nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:47.280]  and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our constitution
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:52.240]  and if we had stuck to those values we would have never been drawn into world war one
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:59.520]  maybe immanuel macron should read the writing of our former president james mattis father of the
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:05.920]  bill brights he said throughout europe the armies kept under the pretext of defending
[3:04:06.720 --> 3:04:16.880]  have enslaved people and quite frankly that is the true purpose of macron's eu army he's not
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:21.360]  going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions he's inviting the foreign
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:28.720]  invader the fifth column coming into the country he's opened up the borders he's part of the globalist
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:37.680]  open border cartel he is not going to defend people he's going to use the army to attack the people
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:44.480]  who object to that to object to having their homes destroyed armies and debts and taxes
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:52.640]  are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:58.480]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:03.840]  bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:09.040]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:15.120]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:19.520]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:25.840]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:30.880]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:36.080]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:42.560]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:48.640]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to
[3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:53.680]  see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot com
[3:05:53.680 --> 3:06:03.120]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:14.400]  welcome back i'm roger stone and i'm proud to be sitting in for my colleague alex jones
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:21.440]  you're on the alex jones show i'm looking forward to a peaceful and restful and prosperous
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:27.440]  thanksgiving and i know you are too but until we get there there's a lot in the news we've got to
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:34.720]  review i think among the president's greatest accomplishments to date are his shepherding
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:41.600]  of a prison sentencing reform bill through the congress that has now gone through the house
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:48.720]  where it passed and now heads to the senate this is the single most important piece of
[3:06:48.720 --> 3:06:56.080]  social justice legislation that i have seen in my lifetime and as president trump pointed out
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:07:05.520]  only days ago it reverses a number of the policies of bill and hillary clinton policies under which
[3:07:06.640 --> 3:07:13.920]  people who were convicted of first time nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession
[3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:21.200]  were sentenced to long mandatory sentences in prison this not only caused in a you a
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:29.120]  the breakup of families the destruction of lives but also an enormous cost to the taxpayers
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:37.200]  in the costs of incarceration nobody was being rehabilitated nobody was being helped but it
[3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:46.080]  was politically motivated in 1994 when president bill clinton felt it was important for him to look
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:54.000]  tough on crime to get reelected in truth the president was courageous in pushing this legislation
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:08:02.320]  because there were and are conservatives in his own party who oppose it so bravo for president
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:08.720]  trump but look at some of the democrats in the house who voted against this landmark legislation
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:22.160]  congresswoman maxine waters congressman john louis of georgia congressman al green this is
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:30.080]  extraordinary where african-american members of congress would actually vote against a piece of
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:38.880]  badly needed legislation to redress historic wrongs just because donald trump sponsored it
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:47.920]  that i think tells you the moral bankruptcy and the hypocrisy of those who voted no it's
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:55.520]  really extraordinary i'd go so far as to say disgraceful this will go down as one of the
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:09:02.800]  president's signature accomplishments and yes even though i've talked to him about this need for many
[3:09:02.800 --> 3:09:10.880]  years i have to give some credit to kim kardashian who i think brought his attention to this important
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:21.680]  piece of reform legislation so bravo to the president for his uh his uh brave and courageous
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:31.280]  stand in standing up to those yes some in our own party who opposed this legislation uh interestingly
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:41.520]  enough a new news story in the guardian says that the fbi now classifies the powboys as
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:49.120]  an extremist terrorist organization or what do they think antifa is a bunch of
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:58.240]  of peace loving pacifists this is extraordinary because i know a number of uh individual proud
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:06.880]  boys and i have yet to meet one who is a white supremacist or a bigot or advocates violence
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:16.720]  they do advocate self-defense they do advocate physical fitness they do advocate clean living
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:26.560]  they do advocate love of country they do advocate patriotism but anyone who's met gavin mcginnis
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:35.200]  knows that he is not a bigot not a white supremacist and most certainly not a terrorist i guess this
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:43.040]  is what to be expected when you appoint a man like chris ray as the head of the fbi chris ray is a
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:49.200]  deep stator from the word go and if you look at him he looks like he'd be more comfortable
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:59.440]  as a croupier behind one of the tables in atlantic city or las vegas his uh response to the exposure
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:10.240]  of the excesses during the fbi's obama period was sensitivity training this is truly among
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:18.480]  the president's worst appointments christopher ray and sadly he has been part and parcel of the
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:25.760]  efforts to hide from the american people the truth regarding the surveillance of the obama
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:33.920]  administration on president donald trump's campaign for president to date we still do not have the
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:41.760]  unredacted fisa warrants that would tell the true story of how the obama administration
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:51.040]  abused power and utilize both the authority and the extraordinary capability of the state

[3:20:51.900 --> 3:20:53.060]  Roger Stone
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:21:01.460]  Welcome back. No, I'm not Alex Jones, I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:01.460 --> 3:21:06.880]  An extraordinary story on page 1 of the New York Times yesterday
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:10.180]  that says that Democrats are upset
[3:21:10.180 --> 3:21:15.920]  about the explosion of right-wing rhetoric on Facebook.
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:18.680]  Are these people on drugs?
[3:21:18.680 --> 3:21:24.440]  We have seen over the last year the wholesale censorship of conservative voices, starting
[3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:32.540]  with Infowars.com, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google, on Apple, on YouTube.
[3:21:32.540 --> 3:21:38.520]  And now we learn that Facebook executives have given Chuck Schumer, a man who says he's
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:46.940]  opposed to corporate welfare, $50,000 in campaign contributions in this cycle alone.
[3:21:46.940 --> 3:21:48.860]  But oh no, that's not enough.
[3:21:48.860 --> 3:21:55.900]  Chuck Schumer's, no doubt, highly talented daughter is a paid $160,000 a year on the
[3:21:55.900 --> 3:22:00.840]  Facebook payroll to do God Knows What.
[3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:07.220]  The single most important fight that we face, really, has to do with censorship of the most
[3:22:07.220 --> 3:22:12.060]  modern technique of communications, the Internet.
[3:22:12.060 --> 3:22:17.660]  There's no question in my mind that Republicans would have held the House of Representatives
[3:22:17.660 --> 3:22:23.520]  if we had had free, unfettered, and balanced access to the Internet.
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:25.900]  But that was not to be.
[3:22:25.900 --> 3:22:32.900]  And although the President has talked in tweets and in interviews about doing something regarding
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:40.940]  the racketeering and antitrust activities that are being used to kneecap Infowars and
[3:22:40.940 --> 3:22:48.300]  dozens of other conservative media outlets, sites, and bloggers, well, so far we have
[3:22:48.300 --> 3:22:51.180]  talk but no action.
[3:22:51.180 --> 3:22:55.820]  That's why if you're angry about the recent elections, if you're upset about the fact
[3:22:55.820 --> 3:23:01.540]  that we lost the House, if you think we got cheated, you can do something about it right
[3:23:01.540 --> 3:23:02.620]  now.
[3:23:02.620 --> 3:23:13.980]  You can go to righttrump.com, that's right, righttrump.com, that's w-r-i-t-e-trump.com.
[3:23:13.980 --> 3:23:17.420]  We're going to put that graphic up for you here in a second.
[3:23:17.420 --> 3:23:24.100]  This is a very important project that we're spearheading right here at Infowars.
[3:23:24.100 --> 3:23:31.740]  Our goal is to deliver one million letters to the President, urging him to direct his
[3:23:31.740 --> 3:23:39.700]  Justice Department to bring immediate antitrust action against the Internet giants.
[3:23:39.700 --> 3:23:43.740]  We as conservatives, generally speaking, are against regulation.
[3:23:43.740 --> 3:23:50.820]  But in this case, we have no choice because we have seen conservatives decapitated across
[3:23:50.820 --> 3:23:58.780]  the board on Facebook, literally millions of people de-platformed, thousands and thousands
[3:23:58.780 --> 3:24:02.660]  of pages disappearing overnight.
[3:24:02.660 --> 3:24:08.460]  My own friend, Jacob Engels, finds that overnight he's no longer on Facebook.
[3:24:08.460 --> 3:24:09.460]  Why?
[3:24:09.460 --> 3:24:14.340]  Because he's a conservative, because he is a Trump supporter.
[3:24:14.340 --> 3:24:19.020]  And nobody has borne the brunt of this more than Infowars.com.
[3:24:19.020 --> 3:24:20.020]  Why is that?
[3:24:20.020 --> 3:24:23.780]  It's because Alex Jones is a man of enormous courage.
[3:24:23.780 --> 3:24:29.780]  It's because Alex Jones is a man of enormous energy.
[3:24:29.780 --> 3:24:36.180]  It's because Alex Jones has the fortitude to say what others will not say.
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:42.860]  And the saddest thing is that other conservatives have stood by and said and done nothing while
[3:24:42.860 --> 3:24:46.380]  Infowars has been censored.
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:47.980]  There's a few standouts.
[3:24:47.980 --> 3:24:50.460]  Matt Drudge, Tucker Carlson.
[3:24:50.460 --> 3:24:55.460]  These are men of enormous courage who haven't been afraid to jump in this fight and point
[3:24:55.460 --> 3:25:01.140]  out that if it's Alex Jones today, well, who will it be tomorrow?
[3:25:01.140 --> 3:25:03.620]  Maybe even little Ben Shapiro.
[3:25:03.620 --> 3:25:08.500]  Oh, Ben thought it was perfectly all right when Infowars was being censored.
[3:25:08.500 --> 3:25:11.500]  But now that he's being censored, why?
[3:25:11.500 --> 3:25:13.780]  He screams like a little bitch.
[3:25:13.780 --> 3:25:19.700]  So, Ben, get on board, fight Internet censorship.
[3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:24.420]  Let me explain the importance of going to righttrump.com.
[3:25:24.420 --> 3:25:29.020]  When you get there, you can sign a letter to the president.
[3:25:29.020 --> 3:25:33.060]  You can put your own handwritten PS into that letter.
[3:25:33.060 --> 3:25:39.220]  And then Alex Jones has agreed to personally pay for the postage to deliver one million
[3:25:39.220 --> 3:25:44.500]  letters to the president, urging him to take immediate action.
[3:25:44.500 --> 3:25:52.380]  This is a true grassroots effort to express to the president the importance of this struggle.
[3:25:52.380 --> 3:26:00.220]  Because without a free, vibrant and robust Internet, there will be no Trump reform agenda.
[3:26:00.220 --> 3:26:02.740]  There will be no Trump reelection.
[3:26:02.740 --> 3:26:06.220]  There will be no Donald Trump legacy.
[3:26:06.220 --> 3:26:11.060]  You see, they realize that in 2016 they lost control of the political narrative in this
[3:26:11.060 --> 3:26:12.060]  country.
[3:26:12.060 --> 3:26:17.620]  ABC, NBC and CBS no longer calling the shots.
[3:26:17.620 --> 3:26:22.420]  And now they seek to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[3:26:22.420 --> 3:26:24.880]  Please take action and do it today.
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:28.940]  And spread the word among your friends and fellow Infowariers.
[3:26:28.940 --> 3:26:32.980]  Go to righttrump.com now.
[3:26:32.980 --> 3:26:39.380]  And if you scroll down, you will see the letter that we hope to deliver to the president.
[3:26:39.380 --> 3:26:45.380]  Now, you can print the letter out yourself and mail it on your own if you wish, but we're
[3:26:45.380 --> 3:26:47.180]  going to mail a copy ourselves.
[3:26:47.180 --> 3:26:52.420]  And as I say, Alex Jones has agreed to pay for the postage.
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:56.660]  The postage for one million dollars ain't Trump change.
[3:26:56.660 --> 3:27:00.700]  That's how strongly we feel about this vital program.
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:07.660]  So instead of complaining, instead of pissing and moaning about the results of the election,
[3:27:07.660 --> 3:27:12.380]  instead of complaining to your friends about how we should have done better.
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:14.540]  Take immediate action.
[3:27:14.540 --> 3:27:22.460]  If you don't want to see a repeat of 2018 in 2020, then we must have free and open access
[3:27:22.460 --> 3:27:23.900]  to the Internet.
[3:27:23.900 --> 3:27:32.520]  And we must stop those who are using monopolistic, antitrust-oriented, racketeering practices
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:37.540]  colluding together to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[3:27:37.540 --> 3:27:43.140]  If you love what Alex Jones does here on Infowars and you want it to continue, if you want to
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:50.540]  continue to get the truth, that's what you won't get from MSNBC and CNN and CBS, well
[3:27:50.540 --> 3:27:58.300]  then go to righttrump.com now and urge the president to take action.
[3:27:58.300 --> 3:28:04.620]  I must tell you, I work with Michael Zimmerman and Alex Jones and others on this vital program.
[3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:07.660]  And I know the president reads his mail.
[3:28:07.660 --> 3:28:14.220]  So please go to righttrump.com now and send this emergency letter to the White House.
[3:28:14.220 --> 3:28:19.100]  Help us in the struggle for a free and open Internet.
[3:28:19.100 --> 3:28:20.700]  I'm Roger Stone.
[3:28:20.700 --> 3:28:23.020]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:23.020 --> 3:28:25.620]  We've got more great stuff coming up for you.
[3:28:25.620 --> 3:28:30.620]  But before we leave, one more time, go to righttrump.com.
[3:28:30.620 --> 3:28:53.460]  The time for action is now.
[3:28:53.460 --> 3:28:57.180]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[3:31:53.820 --> 3:31:57.860]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[3:31:57.860 --> 3:32:03.100]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[3:32:03.100 --> 3:32:08.340]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[3:32:08.340 --> 3:32:12.900]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[3:32:12.900 --> 3:32:17.020]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[3:32:17.020 --> 3:32:18.980]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[3:32:18.980 --> 3:32:24.140]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[3:32:24.140 --> 3:32:25.140]  incredible.
[3:32:25.140 --> 3:32:30.180]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[3:32:30.180 --> 3:32:34.900]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists, scientists and others showed
[3:32:34.900 --> 3:32:39.900]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[3:32:39.900 --> 3:32:46.460]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[3:32:46.460 --> 3:32:49.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[3:32:49.540 --> 3:32:50.540]  discovery.
[3:32:50.540 --> 3:33:14.660]  So check out UX3, now available at m4slife.com.
[3:33:14.660 --> 3:33:27.620]  News, Analysis, Reports, it's the Alex Jones show and now your host, Roger Stone.
[3:33:27.620 --> 3:33:32.100]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:32.100 --> 3:33:35.940]  You know it's an extraordinary experience to wake up in the morning and see at least
[3:33:35.940 --> 3:33:42.580]  five fake news stories that say that you are on the cusp of being indicted by special counsel
[3:33:42.580 --> 3:33:49.060]  Robert Mueller on the basis of Russian collusion or collaboration with WikiLeaks.
[3:33:49.780 --> 3:33:55.940]  Last week I think I blew wide open the falsity of those who said that I had
[3:33:55.940 --> 3:34:02.980]  corresponded directly with WikiLeaks or Julian Assange and I proved by releasing a series of
[3:34:02.980 --> 3:34:12.260]  text messages that after Julian Assange said on CNN in June of 2016 that he had a substantial
[3:34:12.260 --> 3:34:19.780]  amount of material on Hillary Clinton and he would release it. I was tipped by Randy Credico,
[3:34:19.780 --> 3:34:28.660]  a New York City based talk show host on WBAI who told me that the WikiLeaks disclosures
[3:34:28.660 --> 3:34:36.420]  were both significant and that they would royal the race. Mr. Credico has denied that,
[3:34:36.420 --> 3:34:43.540]  repeatedly I'm MSNBC and I get the impression he's also denied it before the Mueller grand jury
[3:34:43.540 --> 3:34:51.060]  and in interviews with the FBI. The problem is I released this week a series of text messages
[3:34:51.060 --> 3:34:59.700]  that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Randy Credico was my source for the significance of
[3:34:59.700 --> 3:35:08.500]  those emails and that his long held defense that he couldn't have told me in June of 2016
[3:35:09.140 --> 3:35:17.220]  that the WikiLeaks disclosures were significant because he did not meet Julian Assange until
[3:35:17.220 --> 3:35:25.700]  late August is irrelevant because in these text messages he reveals that his source was not Assange
[3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:33.540]  or anyone else at WikiLeaks but a woman attorney that he describes as his best and closest friend.
[3:35:34.420 --> 3:35:44.260]  Busted. Perhaps that's why the special counsel now wishes to re-interview Mr. Credico. The notion
[3:35:44.260 --> 3:35:53.620]  that I have somehow intimidated him because I urged David Lugo, a filmmaker who's appeared here
[3:35:53.620 --> 3:36:02.340]  on Infowars, to either make a video or write an op-ed piece truthfully stating that Credico
[3:36:02.340 --> 3:36:09.780]  confirmed to him that he was my source regarding the significance of the WikiLeaks disclosures
[3:36:09.780 --> 3:36:17.540]  and that he was my source who told me they would come in October is laughable. How do you intimidate
[3:36:17.540 --> 3:36:24.580]  somebody through the exercise of your first amendment rights and in telling the truth,
[3:36:24.580 --> 3:36:33.700]  the provable truth? Also the question became on October 2nd when Assange held a press event but
[3:36:33.700 --> 3:36:44.660]  didn't release any information that particular day he did in fact announce a very specific schedule
[3:36:44.660 --> 3:36:51.780]  for future releases saying that there would be a release of material every week through the election
[3:36:51.780 --> 3:36:59.940]  and that all U.S. election related material would be released before election day. The Washington
[3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:06.660]  Post reported that and if I may quote Assange made some vague pledge for future disclosures.
[3:37:06.660 --> 3:37:15.380]  No, Roz, that's not what he said. Correction demanded typical of the fake news of the Washington
[3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:25.780]  Post. So this whole idea that Randy Credico was not my source has been disproved that Randy Credico
[3:37:25.780 --> 3:37:31.540]  couldn't have been my source because he didn't meet Assange till August is proven irrelevant
[3:37:31.540 --> 3:37:38.900]  and the fact that he tells me in the text messages that Assange has concerns about his own
[3:37:38.900 --> 3:37:47.540]  security and that that was the reason for the delay between October 2nd and October 7th for the
[3:37:47.540 --> 3:37:54.820]  release of the bombshell material. It's all there for you to read. Then there's the other falsehood
[3:37:54.820 --> 3:38:05.380]  hood that somehow I along with my colleague Jerry Corsi knew about the NBC Billy Bush grabbed them
[3:38:05.380 --> 3:38:13.380]  by the genitals tape and somehow communicated to WikiLeaks so that they would release their material
[3:38:13.380 --> 3:38:21.300]  to change the public narrative. That is a fairy tale. A fairy tale for which there is no evidence
[3:38:21.300 --> 3:38:29.860]  whatsoever. In fact, if on October 2nd, actually the 3rd in US time, Assange had already announced
[3:38:29.860 --> 3:38:37.540]  his schedule for future releases. I knew nothing about the NBC disclosures. I was as shocked about
[3:38:37.540 --> 3:38:43.140]  them as everyone else. And yes, I feared that they would damage Donald Trump's candidacy,
[3:38:43.140 --> 3:38:49.780]  which strangely enough, they did not. But the idea that I somehow reached out to WikiLeaks
[3:38:49.780 --> 3:38:57.620]  and coordinated their disclosure in order to change the public narrative, well, that's just
[3:38:57.620 --> 3:39:04.980]  delusional. There's no proof about that whatsoever. Now, some may say, well, you spoke to Jerry Corsi
[3:39:04.980 --> 3:39:11.620]  on the 7th and the 8th of October. Yes, true, but not about that. I also spoke to him before that
[3:39:11.620 --> 3:39:21.220]  and after that. Many times this proves absolutely nothing. What we have here is a mainstream media
[3:39:21.220 --> 3:39:28.740]  feeding frenzy. So, for example, Vanity Fair a week ago said, Paul Manafort is dishing on Roger
[3:39:28.740 --> 3:39:35.460]  Stone. But then ABC reported later in the week that Paul Manafort doesn't seem to have anything
[3:39:35.460 --> 3:39:43.620]  to give the special prosecutor regarding Roger Stone. So, proof again that Vanity Fair is among the
[3:39:43.620 --> 3:39:54.820]  very worst fake news violators. You have to take what you see in the mainstream media with an
[3:39:54.820 --> 3:40:03.300]  enormous grain of salt. What you see is based on speculation, conjecture, and in many cases,
[3:40:03.300 --> 3:40:11.060]  wishful thinking. Yes, I am the conservatives that liberals love to hate. Maybe this is payback
[3:40:11.060 --> 3:40:18.500]  for 40 years of defeating Democrats. Or maybe I've been targeted because I wrote the Clinton's
[3:40:18.500 --> 3:40:26.820]  War on Women and because I co-produced the film Banished the Danny Williams story, the true story
[3:40:26.820 --> 3:40:34.980]  of Bill Clinton's abandoned African American son banished by Hillary. So, I believe that I've been
[3:40:34.980 --> 3:40:42.340]  targeted for destruction not because I have broken the law, not because I've done anything wrong,
[3:40:42.340 --> 3:40:49.300]  but because I stood tall for Donald Trump and I helped defeat Hillary Clinton. Now I need your
[3:40:49.300 --> 3:40:57.140]  help. Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com. My legal expenses in fighting the deep state
[3:40:57.140 --> 3:41:07.540]  could top $2 million. That's right, $2 million. This threatens to destroy me and my family
[3:41:07.540 --> 3:41:14.180]  personally and therefore I need your help, not only to fend off the witch hunt investigations
[3:41:14.180 --> 3:41:21.940]  by the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committee, but the onslaught of Robert Mueller's investigation
[3:41:21.940 --> 3:41:28.900]  which seeks to destroy my Fourth Amendment rights and is being led by a woman attorney
[3:41:28.900 --> 3:41:36.100]  who was Hillary Clinton's legal representative at the Clinton Foundation in the illegal email server
[3:41:36.900 --> 3:41:43.620]  and missing email case. So, the same Democrats who say that acting Attorney General Matthew
[3:41:43.620 --> 3:41:51.300]  Whitaker should recuse himself based on his previous political activities now say it's
[3:41:51.300 --> 3:41:57.540]  perfectly all right for Hillary Clinton's personal legal attack dog to lead the charge
[3:41:57.540 --> 3:42:05.940]  against Roger Stone. Hypocrisy, thy name is a Democrat. I'm Roger Stone. You're on the Info

[3:45:00.180 --> 3:45:04.020]  water filtration is a great thing. It's a good thing, and I've had water filtration sponsors
[3:45:04.020 --> 3:45:08.340]  since the day I got on air. Over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration. I learned
[3:45:08.340 --> 3:45:13.620]  what the best was. Now, the Alexa Pure Pros, their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the
[3:45:13.620 --> 3:45:17.300]  most gallons an hour. It's amazing. It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the
[3:45:17.300 --> 3:45:22.020]  good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patriot supply that have developed these
[3:45:22.020 --> 3:45:27.860]  filters ordered a huge amount of them this year. He has a glut of them. He's offering a filter
[3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:36.180]  that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted, it's $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us
[3:45:36.180 --> 3:45:41.140]  at cost, and we're making $27 bucks on them. So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.

[3:46:01.140 --> 3:46:05.060]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper. It consists of the
[3:46:05.060 --> 3:46:09.140]  things that we're willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the
[3:46:09.140 --> 3:46:15.700]  Bill of Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[3:46:15.700 --> 3:46:20.340]  taking those God-given rights from us as individuals. We better understand that because
[3:46:20.340 --> 3:46:28.180]  they're taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21.
[3:46:28.180 --> 3:46:33.940]  Now, they call it the UN 2030 Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want people
[3:46:33.940 --> 3:46:39.700]  out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest
[3:46:39.700 --> 3:46:45.860]  for them to control everyone. It's The David Knight Show. I never missed your show,

[3:47:16.260 --> 3:47:25.700]  And now, your host, Roger Stone. Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:26.980 --> 3:47:33.060]  Well, the Florida recount is over and the results are pretty satisfying.
[3:47:33.860 --> 3:47:42.020]  Former Congressman Ron DeSantis, a supporter of Donald Trump and a strong critic of the Russian
[3:47:42.020 --> 3:47:50.820]  collusion investigation in the U.S. Congress, was elected governor of Florida by about 33,000 votes.
[3:47:51.860 --> 3:47:59.140]  Former current governor Rick Scott, who ran for the U.S. Senate, was elected to the U.S. Senate by
[3:47:59.140 --> 3:48:10.660]  a margin of about 12,000 votes. And then, sadly, Second Amendment advocate Matt Caldwell, a member
[3:48:10.660 --> 3:48:18.180]  of the state House, who ran for the position of commissioner of agriculture, seems to have
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:28.980]  lost his bid to medicinal marijuana advocate Nikki Freed by around 6,000 votes. Two major victories
[3:48:28.980 --> 3:48:37.460]  for the Republicans, one major victory for the Democrats. Now, it's extraordinary that once
[3:48:37.460 --> 3:48:45.380]  again, the election results came down to Broward County, which just happens to be my home county.
[3:48:45.380 --> 3:48:51.780]  There's big news in Broward County over the last two weeks. First of course, of course, is the
[3:48:51.780 --> 3:49:01.060]  ineptitude, the incompetence, and the corruption of the recount under Brenda Snipes, the elected
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:07.780]  supervisor of the Board of Elections. If I were a betting man, which of course I'm not,
[3:49:09.380 --> 3:49:18.820]  I would guess that Governor Ron DeSantis will exercise his authority to terminate Ms. Snipes
[3:49:18.820 --> 3:49:26.340]  and appoint a successor, which he has the authority to do. It's not as if we had no
[3:49:26.340 --> 3:49:34.100]  advance notice of the rank corruption and voter fraud that has manifested itself
[3:49:34.100 --> 3:49:42.260]  inside the Broward County Board of Elections. Two years ago in the Democratic primary for Congress,
[3:49:43.140 --> 3:49:49.780]  Progressive Tim Kanova, who was Bernie Sanders supporter and was challenging
[3:49:49.780 --> 3:49:58.900]  the ever-lovely Deborah Wasserman Schultz, was cheated when his name did not appear on almost
[3:49:58.900 --> 3:50:06.740]  a third of the ballots within the congressional district in which he was running. In some districts,
[3:50:06.740 --> 3:50:11.780]  more Democrats voted in the primary than are registered to vote in the district,
[3:50:12.420 --> 3:50:19.060]  and the Broward County Board of Elections steadfastly refused to give him the breakdown
[3:50:19.060 --> 3:50:26.180]  of early votes, the breakdown of absentee ballots, and the breakdown of election day voting.
[3:50:26.820 --> 3:50:33.940]  He went to court, and the courts ruled that Brenda Snipes had violated both state and federal law.
[3:50:33.940 --> 3:50:41.940]  In fact, the court ordered a recount only to find out that while the case was pending in the courts,
[3:50:41.940 --> 3:50:50.500]  Brenda Snipes had skillfully destroyed all of the ballots, making a recount literally impossible.
[3:50:53.220 --> 3:51:00.100]  Now we have extraordinary additional news from Broward County. News that was first reported here
[3:51:00.100 --> 3:51:09.460]  on Infowars and turns out to be correct. We found that during the Parkland shooting,
[3:51:09.460 --> 3:51:18.580]  the tragic Parkland shooting that as many as seven Broward County Sheriff's officers arrived on the
[3:51:18.580 --> 3:51:27.540]  scene but stood down along with Scott Peterson, the one officer who was assigned as a school
[3:51:27.540 --> 3:51:37.780]  monitor while active shooting was still going on. This was revealed in an extraordinary article
[3:51:37.780 --> 3:51:45.380]  first in the Miami Herald. Now the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is zeroing in on
[3:51:46.020 --> 3:51:52.740]  Ron Gunsburger, the counsel to the Broward County Sheriff. They want to know whether
[3:51:52.740 --> 3:52:02.180]  Gunsburger is the man who coordinated the perjury of the BSO command staff who man to man to man
[3:52:02.180 --> 3:52:08.580]  went before the official inquiry and perjured themselves about whether there was any delay
[3:52:08.580 --> 3:52:16.020]  between BSO officers arriving at the school and entering to stop the active shooting.
[3:52:17.060 --> 3:52:23.380]  Now I learned that Gunsburger's domestic partner of almost 20 years has left him in
[3:52:23.380 --> 3:52:31.860]  anticipation of his impending arrest for directoring the cover up that caused the tragic deaths
[3:52:31.860 --> 3:52:39.620]  of 17 individual students. Why is it that Broward County seems to be the centerpiece
[3:52:39.620 --> 3:52:49.780]  of this kind of corruption? I think it's because we are essentially a one-party county. I think
[3:52:49.780 --> 3:52:56.740]  it is essentially because you don't have the checks and balances that exist with two-party
[3:52:56.740 --> 3:53:03.060]  government where the Republicans watch the Democrats and vice versa. This county is so
[3:53:03.060 --> 3:53:12.020]  heavily Democratic that there is no oversight on behalf of the taxpayers. There is no balance.
[3:53:12.580 --> 3:53:19.860]  The one Republican member of the county commission, Chip Lamarca, quite fortunately was successfully
[3:53:19.860 --> 3:53:27.860]  elected to the state house. He now is the only Republican state legislator elected from the
[3:53:27.860 --> 3:53:34.820]  county of Broward to go to Tallahassee. That means there will be no oversight on the county
[3:53:34.820 --> 3:53:42.180]  board of commissioners, no oversight on the Broward County Board of Elections. We saw this
[3:53:42.180 --> 3:53:51.460]  graphically when Republican observers were not allowed to watch the recount in violation of
[3:53:51.460 --> 3:53:59.700]  the state's sunshine law. My prediction for you is quite simple. I think Brenda Snipes will resign
[3:53:59.700 --> 3:54:06.980]  before the new governor, Ron DeSantis, can fire her. And I would predict to you today
[3:54:06.980 --> 3:54:16.820]  that the governor will also terminate Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who has profoundly
[3:54:16.820 --> 3:54:24.180]  disappointed me by his prevarications because he assured me that there was no delay between the
[3:54:24.180 --> 3:54:30.980]  time that BSO officers showed up at the Parkland High School and the time they entered. They were
[3:54:30.980 --> 3:54:37.220]  standing by while active shooting was still going on. I do want to remind you we have the
[3:54:37.220 --> 3:54:44.500]  war room coming up and we will be taking your calls. Hopefully we can put that number up on
[3:54:44.500 --> 3:54:50.820]  the screen for you. Oh, and Shroyer and I are going to be talking about internet censorship.
[3:54:50.820 --> 3:54:57.940]  We'll be talking about the Florida recount. And there you see the number for the war room,
[3:54:57.940 --> 3:55:08.180]  888-201-2244. Those are the numbers for the hotline on the war room coming up in about
[3:55:08.180 --> 3:55:15.540]  two minutes. Lastly, folks, if you like the war room, if you like the news with David Knight in
[3:55:15.540 --> 3:55:23.700]  the morning, if you like the iconic Alex Jones show, then please give us your support on the

[3:56:57.700 --> 3:57:03.540]  I'll be right back on the War Room with my colleague Owen Shroyer, where we're going to talk about
[3:57:03.540 --> 3:57:10.340]  the fight over internet censorship. We're going to recap the results in Florida for you, and we're
[3:57:10.340 --> 3:57:17.380]  going to talk about the need for ballot security if Donald Trump is going to have any chance
[3:57:17.380 --> 3:57:43.380]  of getting reelected in 2020. Thank you, and God bless you.
[3:57:43.380 --> 3:57:49.300]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Infowars is being
[3:57:49.300 --> 3:57:53.860]  openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department,
[3:57:54.580 --> 3:57:58.500]  and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[3:57:59.060 --> 3:58:02.500]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground,
[3:58:02.500 --> 3:58:06.820]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success,
[3:58:07.380 --> 3:58:12.660]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why
[3:58:12.660 --> 3:58:17.620]  we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word
[3:58:17.620 --> 3:58:23.620]  about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these
[3:58:23.620 --> 3:58:43.620]  brutal scumbags, we'll win.
