[00:00.000 --> 00:18.040]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[00:18.040 --> 00:27.680]  That's right ladies and gentlemen, and everything that Alex Jones and Infowars has been covering
[00:27.680 --> 00:29.820]  has reached ahead.
[00:29.820 --> 00:41.840]  We are now in the final battle, or what could be the final battle for the future of America.
[00:41.840 --> 00:49.720]  And as we've been telling you, Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States, has placed
[00:49.720 --> 01:02.980]  his wager, placed his name, placed his treasure, put everything on the line, betting on you.
[01:02.980 --> 01:08.200]  And I'm not sure what the history books are going to say about President Trump's time
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.340]  in office, whether it be four or eight years.
[01:13.340 --> 01:21.800]  But history will remember this time, this blink of an eye in human history, in the very
[01:21.800 --> 01:29.320]  short history of the great experiment in self-government and self-reliance and independence we called
[01:29.320 --> 01:34.560]  the United States of America.
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.960]  And so President Trump has basically been dealing with things that you or I will probably
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.600]  never even imagine, or know.
[01:44.600 --> 01:47.680]  And he's surrounded.
[01:47.680 --> 01:49.480]  He can get very little help.
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.240]  Most of his appointees turn into Judas.
[01:55.240 --> 02:01.560]  But he's the man in the arena, and he realized something.
[02:01.560 --> 02:14.880]  He realized something like the great gladiators that were sent into the ring to lose intentionally.
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.720]  You start to win the crowd over.
[02:19.720 --> 02:26.640]  And so President Trump is just in there surrounded, being stabbed and snaked from every angle.
[02:26.640 --> 02:36.160]  You have Democrats dancing at bars because they screwed the American people over.
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.160]  There it is right there.
[02:37.160 --> 02:42.000]  They're dancing and celebrating how they screwed America as they stabbed Trump and America
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.680]  in the back.
[02:44.680 --> 02:51.920]  Lunatics, like Nancy Pelosi, whose state is highest in poverty, also highest in wealth,
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.880]  whose state was just named the dumbest state in the union today.
[02:56.880 --> 03:03.320]  And it's scum like that, and Diane Feinstein, a Chinese spy for 20 years that sold this
[03:03.320 --> 03:05.960]  country down the drain.
[03:05.960 --> 03:12.440]  So Trump got in and realized, my God, we don't have a breach in the hall.
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.200]  We don't have a leak.
[03:15.200 --> 03:17.320]  We're damn flooded.
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.880]  I'm just looking for oxygen in here.
[03:21.880 --> 03:29.160]  But just like the gladiator that is being ambushed and set up and the whole crowd realizes
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.480]  it, the crowd starts to get behind that gladiator.
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.280]  The crowd starts to chant that gladiator's name.
[03:37.280 --> 03:43.160]  And all of a sudden, the gladiator pulls the arrow out of his back, the knife out of
[03:43.160 --> 03:51.040]  his side, the sword out of his leg, bleeding half to death and wins the fight.
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.080]  Because of the masses and the momentum behind him.
[03:55.080 --> 03:58.120]  And that's where Trump is at right now.
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.880]  And so we've got the story at infowords.com.
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.000]  Trump thinks there'll be a revolt if deep state tries to remove him from office because
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.640]  Americans are too well armed.
[04:09.640 --> 04:12.040]  Well, that's one angle.
[04:12.040 --> 04:13.920]  And the president is absolutely right about that.
[04:13.920 --> 04:18.480]  But I don't even necessarily think he will come to that.
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.320]  I think like a force of nature.
[04:22.320 --> 04:31.040]  I think like an act of divine gravity, 20 million, 40 million, 50 million Americans
[04:31.040 --> 04:38.720]  will flock to DC in protest of the removal of Donald Trump.
[04:38.720 --> 04:45.720]  And all these little fake news minions and all these little people in Hollywood and all
[04:45.720 --> 04:51.480]  these Democrats are going to look awfully stupid when millions of Americans take to the street
[04:51.480 --> 05:00.480]  to support Trump, something they never thought they would ever see in their life.
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[05:04.520 --> 05:05.520]  law.
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.920]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[05:10.920 --> 05:15.800]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[05:24.160 --> 05:31.040]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.040]  truly independent.
[05:32.040 --> 05:35.560]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.440]  It really is amazing.
[05:37.440 --> 05:40.880]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners.
[05:40.880 --> 05:44.160]  Of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[05:44.160 --> 05:49.640]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[05:49.640 --> 05:54.360]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonplotter.com.
[05:54.360 --> 05:57.640]  Because if you don't spread the articles, the video goes, no one else will.
[05:57.640 --> 05:58.880]  We're all in each other's hands.
[05:58.880 --> 06:09.080]  God bless you all and thank you.
[06:09.080 --> 06:16.160]  Five from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:16.160 --> 06:21.600]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:21.600 --> 06:29.080]  Roger Stone flew into Austin, Texas last night and I took him and associated out to dinner.
[06:29.080 --> 06:40.400]  And he revealed to me a meeting he had had a few days before with an extremely prominent
[06:40.400 --> 06:47.880]  member of the media and subsequent meetings he'd had with others.
[06:47.880 --> 06:54.400]  I separately had already talked to one of the individuals that was at the meeting as
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.520]  well.
[06:56.520 --> 07:02.840]  And this individual was extremely fatalistic and upset after they heard what had been said
[07:02.840 --> 07:07.000]  and would not even repeat back to me what they'd been told.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.840]  Well, Roger Stone told me last night and it ties in to what the president said a few weeks
[07:14.840 --> 07:20.400]  ago when he made the statement, there's also a video of it, that if they try to take him
[07:20.400 --> 07:25.240]  out unconstitutionally, the American people will revolt.
[07:25.240 --> 07:34.000]  Well, the president told this extremely prominent member of the media, Household Name, specifically
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.360]  in a phone call about the tales of the plan to criminally take him out by what he called
[07:40.360 --> 07:45.120]  embedded groups in the government working for the deep state, the Democrats, the Chicoms
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.120]  and others.
[07:46.120 --> 07:53.000]  I've also talked to individuals separately in the military and the State Department
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.120]  that have also confirmed this information before I ever got it from Roger with specifics
[08:00.120 --> 08:03.200]  on President Trump's latest statements.
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.800]  We need to pray for this country, we need to pray for the world, we need to understand
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.040]  that we're all in extreme grave danger and that this country is fighting for its life
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.040]  right now.
[08:11.040 --> 08:14.760]  So, I ask everybody to pray for the president, Roger's going to be on in the second hour
[08:14.760 --> 08:17.200]  in studio covering all this.
[08:17.200 --> 08:23.480]  Joe and Troyer is hosting, I am going to be traveling to see some ill family, but I will
[08:23.480 --> 08:27.840]  be on air, popping in as well.
[08:27.840 --> 08:31.520]  All of this obviously ties together with the total demonization of the president, he promised
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.200]  to get our troops out of Syria and he's now done that.
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.000]  We basically, with Russia's help, annihilated ISIS, but now our media says, oh, Trump did
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.920]  nothing about ISIS, there's 2,000 of them still in this corner area.
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.920]  And it was Obama that helped create ISIS, it's just incredible how they think we have
[08:48.920 --> 08:49.920]  no memory.
[08:49.920 --> 08:56.960]  All right, again, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone next hour with ultra-massive news and
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.280]  specifics of what I just broke down.
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.880]  Please tell everyone you know, friends, family, neighbors, local radio listeners, TV viewers,
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.480]  folks on your Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, reach out to them and say they're coming after
[09:10.480 --> 09:13.920]  the president, the president's aware of it, and this country and the world's two minutes
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.840]  of that night, I'm Alex Jones, faithfully yours, God bless you all, back to the live
[09:19.840 --> 09:22.200]  broadcast of Alex Jones.
[09:22.200 --> 09:29.280]  And here we are on this Thursday, December 20th, 2018, Alex Jones from the Info Wars
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.400]  World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, we'll be hearing from Alex Jones quite a bit today.
[09:33.400 --> 09:39.040]  Guys, give me a doc cam shot here so we can just get a look at all this news that we're
[09:39.040 --> 09:41.120]  going to cover here today.
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.920]  Not to mention, as Alex said, Roger Stone in studio at 12 central here in 50 minutes
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.640]  to join me with an exclusive will be joined by Paul Joseph Watson at 11 30 central.
[09:53.640 --> 09:56.920]  He's got his story at info wars.com.
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.560]  Trump thinks they'll be a revolt if deep state tries to remove him from office.
[10:02.560 --> 10:05.600]  And then Millie Weaver is going to be joining me in the third hour.
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.360]  He's got a report on what's got Facebook in the news right now.
[10:11.360 --> 10:20.480]  And then Matt Bracken, always informative, is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.560]  And then of course, the war room starts and we go on with the rest of the live programming
[10:24.560 --> 10:26.240]  we have here.
[10:26.240 --> 10:38.880]  And to dovetail on what Alex was just saying, obviously Trump is, I mean, some people would
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.520]  say that George Washington of this second American Revolution, I would say more of a
[10:43.520 --> 10:50.800]  John Hancock, perhaps, just because of the namesake and the boldness.
[10:50.800 --> 10:57.080]  But there is no doubt you are currently living in the second American Revolution.
[10:57.080 --> 11:02.400]  Now, whether America comes out on the other side of this alive or not, you'll see.
[11:02.400 --> 11:09.480]  People tend to forget, though, that America is rather young, really, I mean, compared
[11:09.480 --> 11:15.200]  to China, they've been around for over 3000 years.
[11:15.200 --> 11:21.960]  This experiment that we have here in self-government independence, which created the freest market,
[11:21.960 --> 11:27.800]  the most prosperity, the most wealth, the highest standard of living in world history.
[11:27.800 --> 11:37.520]  And the deranged regressive left is trying to tear it all down in some propaganda-driven
[11:37.520 --> 11:46.560]  social justice virtue signaling campaign that has no bearings in reality and will ultimately
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.080]  be the total destruction of the West.
[11:50.080 --> 12:00.040]  And when you have total nincompoops like Alexandra Martini Cortez steering the Democrat Party
[12:00.040 --> 12:04.640]  to total communism and socialism, who then goes on her social media and says, I need
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.640]  to have a self-care day, I got news for you in Venezuela.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.720]  You know what that means?
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.680]  You hope you find a live animal that you can kill with your bare hands and eat, maybe.
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.400]  That's what you want to bring to America.
[12:17.400 --> 12:23.160]  But of course, it's not really you, you're just a useful idiot.
[12:23.160 --> 12:34.840]  But I got to say, I am really, truly sickened by media last night and today, and this goes
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.920]  across the entire spectrum, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, I've got a clip right here.
[12:39.920 --> 12:46.440]  In fact, let's go ahead and roll this clip because roll clip five guys, the entire cable
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.720]  news spectrum for the most part is mad that Trump is pulling our troops out of Syria.
[12:52.720 --> 12:59.840]  I am sickened at the pro-war hawks we have in our media and our government.
[12:59.840 --> 13:02.520]  Makes me sick.
[13:02.520 --> 13:08.640]  Here's an MSNBC host hoping that the military just ignores Trump and stays in Syria.
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.560]  Listen, to their credit, I'm cheered if you're telling me that the military doesn't listen
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.560]  to him.
[13:14.560 --> 13:15.560]  You are a sick person.
[13:15.560 --> 13:17.640]  But I read a lot of quotes of a lot of senior Pentagon officials who were alarmed by the
[13:17.640 --> 13:24.720]  news who had the rug pull or communicated as recently as yesterday.
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.720]  You want war.
[13:25.720 --> 13:26.720]  You want death.
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.720]  Say it.
[13:27.720 --> 13:32.800]  The president seems to have his foreign policy run through Moscow or Turkey or other countries.
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.000]  Are they happy just ignoring him?
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.960]  Stunning, sickening.
[13:43.960 --> 13:45.720]  Why don't you go to Syria?
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.320]  Why don't you send your kids to Syria?
[13:49.320 --> 13:54.280]  I mean, I am just floored.
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.080]  I tune into Fox News all morning.
[13:57.080 --> 13:58.600]  Bad move for Trump to go to Syria.
[13:58.600 --> 14:00.960]  Lindsey Graham, well, this is bad pulling people out.
[14:00.960 --> 14:07.320]  I mean, all of them makes me sick.
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.920]  And all Trump wants to do is just restore America, wants to make our economy big, wants
[14:11.920 --> 14:20.040]  to stop spending money, building infrastructures thousands of miles away from our homeland.
[14:20.040 --> 14:22.040]  Excuse me.
[14:22.040 --> 14:34.960]  But unlike the frauds on television, I don't want this country at war forever.
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.280]  I'm sorry, but this just really angers me that our media is angry that President Trump
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.880]  would bring the troops home.
[14:41.880 --> 14:44.680]  That is just that these are sick people.
[14:44.680 --> 14:49.000]  And I think maybe they should, maybe they should put publicly out.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.560]  I wonder if some of these people have shares in Lockheed Martin.
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.960]  One or some of these people have shares in Raytheon because why else would you be celebrating
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.440]  America being at war and people dying?
[15:03.440 --> 15:04.920]  I'm sorry.
[15:04.920 --> 15:06.920]  This just really made me sick.
[15:06.920 --> 15:07.920]  Washing that this morning.
[15:07.920 --> 15:08.920]  All right.
[15:08.920 --> 15:11.600]  I'm going to bring it back down to earth here.
[15:11.600 --> 15:15.600]  We're going to cover all the big news and we're going to talk about how President Trump
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.520]  is saying, look, you can try to remove me, the deep state, Mueller and all you corrupt
[15:19.520 --> 15:20.520]  Democrats.
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.920]  You can do whatever you think you want to do to try to destroy this country and remove
[15:24.920 --> 15:25.920]  me from office.
[15:25.920 --> 15:26.920]  But guess what?
[15:26.920 --> 15:32.520]  There will be a revolt and he is a hundred percent right, a hundred percent right.
[15:32.520 --> 15:38.000]  Now, in this short break, ladies and gentlemen, please go to infowarstore.com.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.120]  We have just decided to extend our Christmas sale all the way through the new year.

[15:59.880 --> 16:00.880]  Hear that?
[16:00.880 --> 16:06.360]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:06.360 --> 16:09.400]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[16:59.160 --> 17:04.520]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:04.520 --> 17:05.520]  the world.
[17:05.520 --> 17:08.560]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.520]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:14.520 --> 17:18.320]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.320]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:19.320 --> 17:20.880]  Who do we fight for?
[17:20.880 --> 17:27.440]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[17:27.440 --> 17:29.440]  at Amazon Books.
[17:58.440 --> 18:23.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.560 --> 18:26.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.880 --> 18:31.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.880]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.880 --> 18:37.880]  symptoms.
[18:37.880 --> 18:39.880]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:39.880 --> 18:41.880]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.280]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.240]  Visit infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.240 --> 19:04.200]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above
[19:04.200 --> 19:05.200]  the law.
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.720]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.480]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[19:14.480 --> 19:19.760]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[19:19.760 --> 19:23.880]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.760]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are
[19:30.760 --> 19:31.760]  truly independent.
[19:31.760 --> 19:35.280]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[19:35.280 --> 19:37.200]  It really is amazing.
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.880]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[19:43.880 --> 19:49.360]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.680]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswords.com, christenpana.com, because if you don't spread
[19:54.680 --> 19:57.360]  the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[19:57.360 --> 19:58.560]  We're all in each other's hands.
[19:58.560 --> 20:03.040]  God bless you all and thank you.
[20:03.040 --> 20:08.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:08.040 --> 20:23.040]  We're all living in America, America, it's wonderful.
[20:23.040 --> 20:32.040]  We're all living in America, America, America, we're all living in America, America, it's
[20:32.040 --> 20:38.040]  wonderful.
[20:38.040 --> 20:46.120]  It was about how Western culture has influenced the world and that's because it was the best.
[20:46.120 --> 20:47.320]  It was the free market.
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.240]  It was individual prosperity.
[20:51.240 --> 20:59.720]  And you now have control freaks, leftists, and quite frankly, psychopathic, mentally
[20:59.720 --> 21:07.240]  deranged individuals that are so regressive, but because of the PC culture and the fake
[21:07.240 --> 21:14.680]  social justice warrior movement are somehow paraded around as legitimate politicians.
[21:14.680 --> 21:19.480]  And you can put some faces and names to this description, but that's where we're at.
[21:19.480 --> 21:26.860]  And so let me just kind of give a short background before we get into the story from Paul Joseph
[21:26.860 --> 21:30.440]  Watson at infowars.com.
[21:30.440 --> 21:41.600]  The United States of America has been the crown jewel, if you will, in geoeconomic markets
[21:41.600 --> 21:46.480]  and systems and experiments and cultures.
[21:46.480 --> 21:55.760]  And it became so successful and such an example of how individual liberty and prosperity is
[21:55.760 --> 22:01.880]  the most empowering and prosperous thing a Republican have.
[22:01.880 --> 22:04.480]  It became the crown jewel.
[22:04.480 --> 22:17.160]  And so all the powers that beat on planet earth sought after that crown jewel.
[22:17.160 --> 22:28.080]  But they realized the best way to conquer this country would be to divide it from within.
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.840]  And once you've done that, you can do pretty much anything.
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.240]  You can demonize whoever you want.
[22:34.240 --> 22:38.640]  You can cause chaos in the streets.
[22:38.640 --> 22:45.360]  And so you've got a story out today that talks about there's only one thing that Americans
[22:45.360 --> 22:47.920]  can agree on and that's that they can't agree on anything.
[22:47.920 --> 22:57.720]  Well, how do you explain that simple corporate news with an agenda, which has been out to
[22:57.720 --> 23:05.080]  destroy America for years, but now has Donald J. Trump in their sights because he is now
[23:05.080 --> 23:11.080]  the warrior as the president of the United States actually defending America, saying
[23:11.080 --> 23:15.160]  it has a place in the future of earth.
[23:15.160 --> 23:20.920]  And so now you've got the most corrupt people right now in any form of the United States
[23:20.920 --> 23:21.920]  government.
[23:21.920 --> 23:27.800]  Bob Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, all of the Democrat cabal.
[23:27.800 --> 23:32.640]  Most of these people are now out, call me Lynch who was subpoenaed and had a close door
[23:32.640 --> 23:33.640]  testimony yesterday.
[23:33.640 --> 23:35.840]  She didn't look too pleased.
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.320]  And they're all trying to get Trump and they think they're going to do it and they're getting
[23:40.320 --> 23:47.680]  more aggressive and they're getting more brazen and they're just going to fully commit.
[23:47.680 --> 23:48.920]  We're going to take Trump out now.
[23:48.920 --> 23:51.400]  We tried everything to make you hate Trump and you just didn't.
[23:51.400 --> 23:55.040]  So we're just going to take him out.
[23:55.040 --> 23:57.760]  And this is where we're at, but Trump knows this is going on.
[23:57.760 --> 24:01.600]  And so he says, you know what, if you think you can take me out, you got another thing
[24:01.600 --> 24:03.740]  coming Americans will revolt.
[24:03.740 --> 24:07.040]  So the headline at info wars.com from Paul Joseph Watson, Trump thinks Americans will
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.320]  engage in an armed revolt if deep state tries to remove him from office.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.840]  Let's go ahead and read this.
[24:12.840 --> 24:16.240]  President Donald Trump told a prominent person during a phone call last week that he thinks
[24:16.240 --> 24:20.600]  the American people will revolt if the deep state tries to remove him from office via
[24:20.600 --> 24:25.800]  impeachment or any other method because Americans are too well armed.
[24:25.800 --> 24:29.320]  According to our sources, Trump thinks that Democrats are so intent on stopping America's
[24:29.320 --> 24:32.720]  recovery that they will set off a destabilizing crisis at the border.
[24:32.720 --> 24:33.720]  They've already done that.
[24:33.720 --> 24:37.680]  And economic collapse, they're working on that, and even civil war, they're working
[24:37.680 --> 24:41.080]  on that as well as a means of ejecting him from the Oval Office.
[24:41.080 --> 24:44.840]  However, Trump believes that both the US military and the American people would not stand for
[24:44.840 --> 24:47.560]  such a scenario and would rise up against it.
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.060]  And there would be a revolt because Americans are too well armed.
[24:51.060 --> 24:54.400]  And boy, would that be an interesting scenario to see pull out.
[24:54.400 --> 25:00.040]  And who do you think they would target first, ladies and gentlemen, Donald J. Trump or let's
[25:00.040 --> 25:03.880]  just say Bob Mueller.
[25:03.880 --> 25:10.560]  The phone call was further discussed during a meeting between three people and other prominent
[25:10.560 --> 25:14.360]  individuals close to the president have confirmed that what Trump said during the call was his
[25:14.360 --> 25:20.320]  ongoing state of mind over the past several weeks.
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.880]  The conversation was prompted following criticism from some figures on the right that Trump
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.760]  was not following through on his main campaign promises specifically regarding the wall and
[25:28.760 --> 25:31.320]  culture, the biggest example of that.
[25:31.320 --> 25:34.560]  And then there's a huge story Trump unfollowed on Twitter.
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.920]  The comments lined up with previous public statements made by Trump about how the American
[25:38.920 --> 25:42.560]  people would respond if he were to be impeached.
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.000]  I'm not concerned, no, the president told Reuters last month during a conversation in
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.360]  the Oval Office, I think that the people would revolt if that happened.
[25:53.360 --> 25:58.800]  So again, this story is at inforge.com.
[25:58.800 --> 26:03.280]  Trump himself is apparently extremely taken aback at the level to which the country has
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.160]  been sold out by embedded groups within the government, particularly with regard to the
[26:08.160 --> 26:10.160]  Chinese influence.
[26:10.160 --> 26:16.640]  He's now bought up Apple, working on buying up Google, had total access to Hillary Clinton's
[26:16.640 --> 26:18.800]  private server, not just hacking the server.
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.160]  It was basically a Chinese server that Hillary Clinton put in her home, really.
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.160]  And then you have Diane Feinstein with the Chinese spy for 20 years.
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.160]  It just goes on and on, nothing for that, no hearing, so that's nice.
[26:31.160 --> 26:34.920]  The president also now suspects that the Federal Reserve is working with the deep state to
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.480]  plunge the economy as a way of crushing his reelection hopes if he makes it that far.
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.800]  And I mean, Powell was appointed by Trump and here he is trying to sabotage him.
[26:44.800 --> 26:46.120]  It just makes you wonder.
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.240]  However, Trump expressed his confidence that the American people would choose the right
[26:50.240 --> 26:54.480]  side and have his back, which in turn sends a strong message to the establishment forces
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.600]  who are plotting his demise.
[26:55.600 --> 27:02.840]  And you know, if you look at history, specifically American history, whether you think it's organic
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.800]  or what, America goes through times of flux.
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.880]  There have been great depressions, there have been great wars, civil wars, you know, a lot
[27:14.880 --> 27:20.720]  of stuff and a lot of people think we're due for that, say, oh, well, there was the recession
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.880]  of 2008 and, you know, there was some other stuff, the recession after 9-11, folks, that
[27:25.880 --> 27:28.600]  is nothing.
[27:28.600 --> 27:30.040]  That is nothing.
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.680]  You know, we do have a large homeless population, but let me tell you something.
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.320]  This country is so well off, even with the rigged economy, even with the wealth distribution,
[27:40.320 --> 27:44.040]  even with all the poverty and homelessness, this country doesn't even know what it's like
[27:44.040 --> 27:47.320]  to be hungry, okay?
[27:47.320 --> 27:52.240]  So I'm not wanting there to be a civil war, obviously.
[27:52.240 --> 27:57.360]  I'd love the deep state to just back off President Trump and let him do his job and just quit
[27:57.360 --> 28:02.360]  trying to dominate the world, which means you have to destroy America because you can't
[28:02.360 --> 28:08.680]  have 300 million free Americans in the West with guns if you want to have a world government.
[28:08.680 --> 28:14.560]  It's not going to work because we're going to stop it from happening.
[28:14.560 --> 28:21.240]  But let me assure you, just as humanity is in the process of a new age right now, the
[28:21.240 --> 28:29.480]  dawn of a new era of humanity, America is in the process of going through another purification
[28:29.480 --> 28:31.720]  process right now.
[28:31.720 --> 28:37.600]  And we're going to be smelted and it's going to be hot, but America will come out on the
[28:37.600 --> 28:43.200]  other side of this purified if we're able to come out at all.
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.240]  And President Trump has bet his name, he's bet his fortune, he's bet his treasure, he's
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.160]  bet his family on you, on America, that you will see what's right.
[28:53.160 --> 29:01.080]  And I pray every night that God gives America that vision to see what is right.
[29:01.080 --> 29:03.560]  Want revenge on the common house fly?
[29:03.560 --> 29:09.560]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,
[29:09.560 --> 29:16.120]  a miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition, non-toxic and no
[29:16.120 --> 29:17.800]  batteries required.
[29:17.800 --> 29:18.800]  So much fun.

[29:56.640 --> 30:04.440]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they canned food during the falls they'd
[30:04.440 --> 30:05.440]  have it during the winter.
[30:05.440 --> 30:09.600]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4Stoor.com.

[31:00.360 --> 31:04.400]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[31:04.400 --> 31:05.900]  law.
[31:05.900 --> 31:10.800]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[31:10.800 --> 31:14.680]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[31:14.680 --> 31:19.880]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[31:19.880 --> 31:24.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[31:24.160 --> 31:30.760]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that
[31:30.760 --> 31:31.760]  are truly independent.
[31:31.760 --> 31:35.440]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[31:35.440 --> 31:37.320]  It really is amazing.
[31:37.320 --> 31:41.880]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[31:41.880 --> 31:44.000]  we're all in and how far we've come together.

[31:59.320 --> 32:00.320]  God bless you all and thank you.
[32:00.320 --> 32:06.040]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[32:06.040 --> 32:09.680]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories
[32:09.680 --> 32:14.280]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[32:14.280 --> 32:18.400]  it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[32:18.400 --> 32:24.360]  Using the Infowars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at
[32:24.360 --> 32:28.440]  least resistant to the globalist programming.
[32:28.440 --> 32:33.840]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[32:33.840 --> 32:37.000]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.680]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[32:39.680 --> 32:45.880]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be
[32:45.880 --> 32:52.000]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me, not behind
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.280]  us but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[32:55.280 --> 32:59.200]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute
[32:59.200 --> 33:04.080]  you.
[33:04.080 --> 33:19.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.520 --> 33:27.520]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[33:27.520 --> 33:39.600]  host, Owen Troyer, Paul Joseph Watson joins me now and he wants to talk about some censorship
[33:39.600 --> 33:46.440]  that we're seeing but Paul, it's gone beyond just the censorship and the attacks on PewDiePie.
[33:46.440 --> 33:53.280]  I don't know if you saw this story but now you have a school, a middle school in Seattle
[33:53.280 --> 34:02.800]  has called police officers after they found students posting subscribe to PewDiePie posters
[34:02.800 --> 34:04.800]  around the school.
[34:04.800 --> 34:08.480]  I remember in school, you had all kinds of stuff that would trend and you put stuff up
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.680]  or talk about it but now, Paul, now you're not allowed to do that so you're not allowed
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.720]  to talk about PewDiePie and someone showed up in a video game feed he had and his name
[34:18.720 --> 34:24.560]  was Sergeant Shekel so obviously he's a Nazi now so this is what's going on, Paul, this
[34:24.560 --> 34:27.320]  is the reality that we live in.
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.720]  Well exactly, you have this contrived moral panic around PewDiePie.
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.360]  Why are they so afraid of PewDiePie?
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.480]  You don't need to really know what he does to understand why they're so afraid of him.
[34:37.480 --> 34:39.920]  Mainly he reviews memes.
[34:39.920 --> 34:42.240]  The left does not understand memes.
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.520]  There have been scientific studies that prove they don't understand memes and the most effective
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.880]  memes in 2016 that basically won Trump the election came out of two places, 4chan and
[34:52.880 --> 34:54.040]  the Donald reddit.
[34:54.040 --> 34:56.800]  They're petrified because they don't speak the language.
[34:56.800 --> 35:01.160]  If you don't speak the language that all these younger people now obviously skewing
[35:01.160 --> 35:04.000]  younger speaking then how are you going to compete?
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.240]  How are you going to dominate that narrative?
[35:06.240 --> 35:11.320]  Plus with someone like PewDiePie, this is a guy with 77 million subscribers.
[35:11.320 --> 35:14.320]  This is a guy who's not under corporate control.
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.440]  He jettisoned or was forced to jettison all these Disney deals and everything like that
[35:18.440 --> 35:19.720]  a couple of years ago.
[35:19.720 --> 35:25.320]  So merely the threat of somebody who isn't even political, isn't even talk about politics,
[35:25.320 --> 35:30.760]  having control over a sizable audience that big represents such a threat to them that
[35:30.760 --> 35:36.400]  they try to bring him down on an almost daily basis at this point and this latest scandal
[35:36.400 --> 35:39.960]  is just another example of that.
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.840]  As he said he was playing a video game and somebody else in this video game is a VR video
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.880]  game so it's like a public thing, you go in you can end up playing with anyone and someone
[35:49.880 --> 35:56.000]  called Rabbi Shekels is in this shooter game with him, starts doing an effusive speech about
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.400]  PewDiePie like oh your videos really helped me get through some hard times and is shot
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.600]  by another player, PewDiePie laughs because that's funny because he was doing this very
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.920]  emotional effusive speech and it got cut short because the character in the video game got
[36:10.920 --> 36:11.920]  shot.
[36:11.920 --> 36:12.920]  That's what he was laughing at.
[36:12.920 --> 36:17.840]  Then Vox and Buzzfeed and all these other publications came out and said oh he was laughing
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.880]  at the Rabbi Shekels thing because he's a closet anti-semi and he's promoting white
[36:22.880 --> 36:24.320]  supremacy.
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.880]  So this leads us to the story you just mentioned, the school in Seattle.
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.920]  There was a viral video posted a few nights ago of a teacher, a history teacher telling
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.560]  middle school students in this Seattle school that they could be sued for retweeting PewDiePie
[36:41.560 --> 36:48.240]  videos and that basically in his own words PewDiePie was promoting quote genocide which
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.960]  is obviously completely absurd, the guy has no understanding of the law to begin with.
[36:52.960 --> 36:59.520]  PewDiePie is a mild-mannered Swedish video gamer, entertainer who laughs at memes and
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.520]  plays video games okay, he's not going to lead the forth rike, let's just get it straight.
[37:04.520 --> 37:07.720]  So obviously this went on Twitter, this got viral.
[37:07.720 --> 37:12.400]  The school responded to the PewDiePie subscribe to PewDiePie posters which is a different
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.440]  thing about his battle with T series and this viral rant by this teacher by calling the
[37:18.440 --> 37:23.720]  police and by the way also blaming Infowars, obviously it's our fault, they actually put
[37:23.720 --> 37:30.440]  out an article and this is K-O-U-W, why Alex Jones right wing conspiracy theorist is obsessed
[37:30.440 --> 37:32.440]  with this Seattle school.
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.760]  In our original article about this issue, we didn't even mention the school because
[37:36.760 --> 37:38.160]  I didn't know the school.
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.720]  Paul, I was going to say, I saw this story and I said, I've never heard of this school
[37:43.720 --> 37:46.560]  in my life.
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.520]  But we're obsessed with it apparently and our article about this issue came out after
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.280]  PewDiePie had retweeted the viral video, after it had already gone viral on Twitter
[37:57.280 --> 37:58.600]  the night before.
[37:58.600 --> 38:03.720]  So we hadn't even covered this, obviously they claim, oh we got threats from some people.
[38:03.720 --> 38:06.920]  We didn't even name the school, didn't even know the school, didn't even know the name
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.160]  of the teacher, didn't name it, oh but we're obsessed and it's those pizza conspiracy theorists
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.720]  once again causing problems for people, total abject fake news.
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.800]  On top of it, this article doesn't even name PewDiePie, they don't even know who he is,
[38:24.800 --> 38:28.760]  they just say, oh it's some YouTuber who is an anti-Semite.
[38:28.760 --> 38:35.640]  The guy's world famous, he's a globally famous entertainer, he's got 77 million subscribers,
[38:35.640 --> 38:39.360]  he's in the news every single day, they can't even name him.
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.680]  Similar with the Vox hit piece last week, they couldn't even spell PewDiePie correctly,
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.800]  it was like PieDiePie, PewDiePie, they couldn't even get his name right and they're talking
[38:49.800 --> 38:56.080]  about him being an anti-Semite and literally radicalizing the youth on YouTube, they literally
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.960]  accuse him of raising this neo-Nazi army which is being radicalized on YouTube.
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.520]  Of course they want to take out the rest of us by guilt by association, they also want
[39:06.520 --> 39:08.640]  to take down PewDiePie.
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.600]  But again, it's because they don't know how to meme and they're terrified of somebody
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.440]  in a position of influence who they don't control, that's what it comes down to.
[39:17.440 --> 39:25.520]  Yeah, this story from KUOW, why Alex Jones, right wing conspiracy theorist is obsessed
[39:25.520 --> 39:28.840]  with the Seattle School, this is the most fake news, I don't think Alex Jones has ever
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.760]  heard of this school, I'd never heard of this school and they blame everything on us, they
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.520]  even claim that they're putting in extra security because of us, we've never even heard of this
[39:38.520 --> 39:39.520]  school.
[39:39.520 --> 39:40.520]  They didn't even name it.
[39:40.520 --> 39:47.680]  And then they say, you know, the PewDiePie, his name is PewDiePie, PewDiePie is bad for
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.240]  putting anti-Semitic and Nazi imagery in his videos when again, it's not even that,
[39:53.240 --> 39:56.520]  it's some goofy name or is it PewDiePie.
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.560]  So that's like Paul, that's like if you went to the movie theaters in, I guess it was like
[40:00.560 --> 40:08.360]  2014 or something and you laughed at Inglorious Bastards or if you filmed the movie, you know,
[40:08.360 --> 40:12.040]  if you showed the movie Inglorious Bastards at your movie theater, you must be a Nazi
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.240]  too, you know, I mean, what are we going to do about that?
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.240]  Yeah, and of course the initial controversy was based on the fact that PewDiePie was recommending
[40:21.240 --> 40:23.560]  other channels on one of his videos.
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.840]  One of those channels had an anime review, which he liked, so he gave them a shout out,
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.480]  said this, I really enjoyed this anime review.
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.240]  And because this channel had other questionable content, that means that he was promoting
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.320]  white supremacists, neo-Nazi ideology, it's like the logical leap it takes to get to that
[40:41.320 --> 40:42.880]  level is absolutely insane.
[40:42.880 --> 40:47.760]  Look, they don't even understand the internet at this point, they've confused like a bunch
[40:47.760 --> 40:54.800]  of teenagers who engage in edgy banter for an actual fascist takeover of society.
[40:54.800 --> 41:00.960]  And we see this with TikTok as well, like 99% of TikTok, which is an app where basically
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.960]  teenagers just dance around and lip sync to videos, 99% of it is just mindless entertainment.
[41:06.960 --> 41:13.320]  There's like 1% of it, which is like edgy banter, which is political in some senses,
[41:13.320 --> 41:18.320]  and traditionalist and right wing in some senses, they call it ironic conservatism.
[41:18.320 --> 41:23.160]  So because 1% is that, not even 1%, probably 0.2% or something.
[41:23.160 --> 41:28.760]  I put out a video on Monday saying, and I'll use the exact quote, Monday, I said this,
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.720]  the same thing they're doing to PewDiePie, they'll do to TikTok.
[41:31.720 --> 41:35.640]  TikTok is a platform for hate speech, bullying, misogyny, racism, a gateway drug to the alt
[41:35.640 --> 41:36.640]  right.
[41:36.640 --> 41:37.640]  You're going to hear it all.
[41:37.640 --> 41:39.800]  That's what I said on December 17th.
[41:39.800 --> 41:45.280]  December 18th, Vice reports, TikTok, which is mega popular with children and teens as
[41:45.280 --> 41:51.400]  a problem with blatant violent white supremacy and Nazism, literally the day after they came
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.760]  out with that exact hippies, because there's a tiny minority of people who use TikTok for
[41:57.760 --> 42:03.720]  edgy political banter, and it's mainly conservative, it's mainly quote, right wing.
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.800]  So now they're trying to take down TikTok, because again, they don't understand it, vice
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.560]  box, they're not on it, they can't control it, and they hate the people who are on it
[42:13.560 --> 42:19.880]  because they don't care about being de-platformed, they don't care about being social media stars.
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.800]  Generation Z is the most conservative since World War II, and they like this edgy banter,
[42:23.800 --> 42:25.280]  they like to get political.
[42:25.280 --> 42:29.480]  The mainstream media doesn't like that because they can't control it.
[42:29.480 --> 42:33.920]  You know, the amazing thing about these leftists, these social justice warrior, virtue signaling
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.680]  leftists, Paul, they are turning into everything they claim to hate.
[42:38.680 --> 42:44.640]  They are turning into the intolerant, racist, you know what's that they claim to be against.
[42:44.640 --> 42:45.720]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.960]  You can't even have a free speech wall at Eastern Michigan University.
[42:49.960 --> 42:53.640]  Somebody wrote, it's okay to be white on a free speech wall, they said, we will not stand
[42:53.640 --> 42:54.640]  for this.
[42:54.640 --> 42:59.360]  We will have become the most racist, anti-free speech garbage in America.
[42:59.360 --> 43:05.160]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.800]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.400]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.360]  it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around
[43:18.360 --> 43:25.040]  the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the
[43:25.040 --> 43:27.520]  globalist programming.
[43:27.520 --> 43:32.920]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[43:32.920 --> 43:36.080]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.760]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[43:38.760 --> 43:41.600]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[43:41.600 --> 43:43.600]  2018 has been insane.
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.280]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.760]  beside me, not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting
[43:53.760 --> 43:54.760]  these globalists.
[43:54.760 --> 43:58.320]  So whatever you do, take action and realize, we're changing history together and I salute
[43:58.320 --> 43:59.320]  you.

[45:00.480 --> 45:04.560]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[45:04.560 --> 45:05.560]  law.
[45:05.560 --> 45:10.960]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[45:10.960 --> 45:14.680]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.080]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[45:24.080 --> 45:31.040]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are
[45:31.040 --> 45:32.040]  truly independent.
[45:32.040 --> 45:35.520]  And, of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[45:35.520 --> 45:37.440]  It really is amazing.
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight

[47:03.600 --> 47:15.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:15.720 --> 47:24.600]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Olin Shroyer.
[47:24.600 --> 47:30.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:30.280 --> 47:35.960]  So there have been stories about European women and American women who want to do a
[47:35.960 --> 47:42.120]  virtue signalling experiment, and so they go to the Middle East or some Muslim country
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.720]  and they say, oh, you know, I'm going to backpack through here, I'm going to walk through here,
[47:45.720 --> 47:49.760]  and everything's going to be great, and, you know, this is not something I'm celebrating.
[47:49.760 --> 47:56.440]  This is sad, but these women, a few of them have been raped and murdered.
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.680]  There was one even that was, I believe it was in Italy, a nice young woman who became
[48:00.680 --> 48:06.400]  friends with one of the migrants that was in this camp from Northern Africa, and she
[48:06.400 --> 48:09.200]  eventually disappeared one day, and it wasn't good for her either.
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.800]  But there's another story, backpackers found murdered at Morocco hiking spot.
[48:15.800 --> 48:21.280]  Paul, you've got this story down, you just brought this to my attention.
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.440]  What happened here to these backpackers?
[48:23.440 --> 48:30.520]  Yeah, so basically it was two Scandinavian tourists, one Danish, one Norwegian, about women
[48:30.520 --> 48:31.680]  in their 20s.
[48:31.680 --> 48:36.280]  They went to this remote region of Morocco, the High Atlas Mountains.
[48:36.280 --> 48:41.480]  So they were mountain climbing, they were hiking, ended up being raped and beheaded
[48:41.480 --> 48:42.880]  by ISIS.
[48:42.880 --> 48:46.320]  It turns out today that it almost certainly was a terror attack.
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.040]  It was politically motivated, and that these murders absolutely tragic were a result of
[48:53.040 --> 48:54.040]  a terror attack.
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.640]  They're talking about, there's video that's been circulating where they're actually being
[48:58.640 --> 48:59.640]  beheaded.
[48:59.640 --> 49:03.720]  I don't know if that's accurate, I haven't seen it, but absolutely tragic, obviously.
[49:03.720 --> 49:09.280]  But again, Owen, the question is, would you like your wife, your girlfriend, your daughter,
[49:09.280 --> 49:16.240]  go backpacking in a remote region in an Islamic country where ISIS militants are present
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.480]  on their own without a man?
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.280]  Now, I don't want to promote male chaperone culture, and I don't want to victim blame.
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.360]  Obviously, any woman should be able to do that, but in reality, we live in a very dangerous
[49:28.360 --> 49:29.360]  world.
[49:29.360 --> 49:30.360]  Wait a second, wait a second.
[49:30.360 --> 49:31.360]  Paul, Paul, Paul.
[49:31.360 --> 49:32.360]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.360]  You don't, hold on, hold on.
[49:33.360 --> 49:34.360]  Male chaperone culture.
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.120]  No, no, but here's the funny thing, here's the funny thing.
[49:38.120 --> 49:39.840]  That's actually Islam.
[49:39.840 --> 49:40.840]  Yeah.
[49:40.840 --> 49:44.600]  So, no, that's how you have to behave in their country is what I'm saying.
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.880]  You shouldn't have to, but we're of the understanding that that's how you have to behave.
[49:48.880 --> 49:50.320]  So, wait, so you're actually right though.
[49:50.320 --> 49:51.320]  You're actually right.
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.560]  If these ladies would have actually been Muslim, they would have had to have their man with
[49:54.560 --> 49:55.560]  them.
[49:55.560 --> 49:57.680]  Oh, almost certainly, yeah.
[49:57.680 --> 49:59.160]  But this is the point.
[49:59.160 --> 50:02.720]  I don't know if they were political in this instance, and obviously this is tragic and
[50:02.720 --> 50:05.760]  horrible, but you mentioned the previous cases.
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.680]  I had a headline up on the Tuesday show, Murdered by ISIS, Round the World, Cyclist Couple,
[50:10.680 --> 50:13.320]  who wrote of kind, lovely people in travel blog.
[50:13.320 --> 50:18.600]  This was a liberal couple, they were vegans, they were very left-wing, they went on a cycling
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.080]  trip through North Africa, through the Balkans, through the Middle East, and they wrote on
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.760]  their own blog, let me read this, before they were mowed down in a vehicle by ISIS and killed
[50:29.760 --> 50:34.920]  by terrorists, they wrote, quote, you read the papers and you're led to believe that
[50:34.920 --> 50:37.240]  the world is a big, scary place.
[50:37.240 --> 50:39.720]  People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted.
[50:39.720 --> 50:40.720]  People are bad.
[50:40.720 --> 50:41.720]  People are evil.
[50:41.720 --> 50:42.720]  I don't buy it.
[50:42.720 --> 50:48.320]  People is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans
[50:48.320 --> 50:53.040]  holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own, by and large, humans
[50:53.040 --> 50:57.680]  of kind, self-interested, sometimes myopic, sometimes kind, generous and wonderful and
[50:57.680 --> 50:58.680]  kind.
[50:58.680 --> 51:01.680]  No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.
[51:01.680 --> 51:07.840]  A few weeks later, mowed down in a vehicle by ISIS, dead, murdered, okay.
[51:07.840 --> 51:13.160]  They made the point, our understanding of different cultures that we're bigoted because
[51:13.160 --> 51:18.640]  we just can't understand different cultures being complex, being, you know, the more diverse
[51:18.640 --> 51:19.640]  than ours.
[51:19.640 --> 51:22.200]  No, evil exists in the world.
[51:22.200 --> 51:23.360]  You have to have this in mind.
[51:23.360 --> 51:27.840]  You have to be cognizant of this if you travel to these dangerous places in the world.
[51:27.840 --> 51:30.320]  And it's not as if they didn't know about it, Owen.
[51:30.320 --> 51:33.200]  When I did a video about this, I went through all their blogs.
[51:33.200 --> 51:34.680]  They did like 40 blogs.
[51:34.680 --> 51:36.920]  I probably went through like half of them.
[51:36.920 --> 51:42.800]  And in almost every place they visit, in Morocco especially, they get harassed.
[51:42.800 --> 51:45.440]  They get things stolen from them.
[51:45.440 --> 51:50.120]  They get run down by, in one case, a guy tried to run them over in his vehicle, tried to
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.000]  squash them.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.240]  His wife, his partner, gets harassed.
[51:54.240 --> 51:57.880]  They get harassed by people when they refuse to take pictures with them.
[51:57.880 --> 52:01.920]  So you look at their blog, in almost every country, they get stalked.
[52:01.920 --> 52:02.920]  They get harassed.
[52:02.920 --> 52:04.080]  They get violent threats.
[52:04.080 --> 52:09.080]  And yet they come out and they talk to the media and say, oh, the world's not a bad place.
[52:09.080 --> 52:10.080]  People aren't evil.
[52:10.080 --> 52:12.760]  It's just our misunderstanding of other cultures.
[52:12.760 --> 52:16.240]  No, some cultures are better than others.
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.920]  Some countries are safer than others.
[52:18.920 --> 52:23.680]  It's not to say you're not going to murder or harass in any other Western, white, European
[52:23.680 --> 52:27.200]  country or whatever, but some places are safer than others.
[52:27.200 --> 52:28.200]  That's a fact.
[52:28.200 --> 52:34.560]  If you go to a remote area in Tajikistan or Morocco or Islamic countries and you don't
[52:34.560 --> 52:40.840]  have a sense of wariness at least, then you're making a rod for your own back.
[52:40.840 --> 52:46.840]  So again, it ties into this cultural relativist, moral relativist idea that the world is a utopia
[52:46.840 --> 52:50.960]  and that just so long as we radiate love that we're going to be fine, we're going to be
[52:50.960 --> 52:51.960]  OK.
[52:51.960 --> 52:52.960]  You'd have to have discernment.
[52:52.960 --> 52:59.680]  They've had this, it's like the dodo bird because they've had no real threats to them
[52:59.680 --> 53:01.520]  or they don't even realize what's going on in the real world.
[53:01.520 --> 53:06.320]  They just walk up to like a T-rex like, oh, hey, and try to pet it and then it eats them.
[53:06.320 --> 53:08.880]  But I want to have a new word.
[53:08.880 --> 53:11.400]  I want to coin a new phrase right here, Paul.
[53:11.400 --> 53:19.440]  I've been thinking about this, cultural supremacy, cultural supremacy.
[53:19.440 --> 53:22.080]  Everybody wants to talk about white supremacy or this supremacy, that's right.
[53:22.080 --> 53:23.960]  How about cultural supremacy?
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.440]  I am a proud Western culture supremacist.
[53:28.440 --> 53:30.440]  Suck on that.
[53:30.440 --> 53:32.200]  Exactly.
[53:32.200 --> 53:34.720]  Some cultures are better than others.
[53:34.720 --> 53:39.880]  You mentioned another story and this was 2008, another example of this.
[53:39.880 --> 53:43.560]  New York Times, performance artist killed on peace trip is mourned.
[53:43.560 --> 53:44.560]  OK.
[53:44.560 --> 53:49.920]  So this performance artist went through the Balkans, the Middle East, to prove that Islam
[53:49.920 --> 53:55.480]  is a religion of peace, to send a message of peace and quote, marriage between different
[53:55.480 --> 53:57.040]  peoples and nations.
[53:57.040 --> 54:02.240]  What happened, raped and killed, you'd have case after case like this.
[54:02.240 --> 54:06.960]  In fact, I'm going to do a big video on this in the near future, tying them all together.
[54:06.960 --> 54:10.280]  And it is moral relativism, it's cultural relativism.
[54:10.280 --> 54:15.040]  You also had the case in Sweden, you probably remember this one, where there was a refugee
[54:15.040 --> 54:17.200]  who was set to be deported.
[54:17.200 --> 54:23.080]  He was on the plane and this 18-year-old, I think it was, Swedish left-wing activist
[54:23.080 --> 54:27.480]  literally grounded the plane by causing a disturbance on the plane to prevent him from
[54:27.480 --> 54:29.040]  being deported.
[54:29.040 --> 54:30.120]  Why was he being deported?
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.120]  It turned out because he tried to strangle his own wife and kids to death with a power
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.120]  cord.
[54:36.120 --> 54:39.120]  But that's his religion, so you have to be tolerant.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.120]  It's his culture, right?
[54:40.120 --> 54:41.120]  Yeah.
[54:41.120 --> 54:42.120]  Yeah.
[54:42.120 --> 54:46.640]  So the same thing with the Bacha Bazi in Afghanistan, again, this is old men raping
[54:46.640 --> 54:47.640]  children.
[54:47.640 --> 54:49.320]  Oh, it's just part of that culture.
[54:49.320 --> 54:53.360]  Well, unfortunately, Paul, you're going to have a lot of material for that video, unfortunately.
[54:53.360 --> 54:56.920]  So ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson is going to put up a new video breaking all
[54:56.920 --> 54:59.320]  this down on his channel, Prison Planet Paul.
[54:59.320 --> 55:00.320]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[55:00.320 --> 55:02.160]  We'll be looking forward to that video.
[55:02.160 --> 55:05.920]  And I know there's a lot of content, you just have a lot of content to go through to put
[55:05.920 --> 55:06.920]  into that video.
[55:06.920 --> 55:09.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there goes the great Paul Joseph Watson.
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.440]  Be on the lookout for his newest YouTube video and be sure to share that far and wide.
[55:13.440 --> 55:15.880]  Believe us, they want him banned as well.
[55:15.880 --> 55:19.680]  Now we're going to go to the most banned and censored individual on the Internet, the host
[55:19.680 --> 55:20.680]  of this show who's out.
[55:20.680 --> 55:26.640]  I'm filling in for Alex today, but he has just given us a new report that he's filed
[55:26.640 --> 55:28.480]  over audio.
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.760]  And so we are now going to Alex Jones and we'll be right back on the other side of that
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.760]  with more news and Roger Stone with an exclusive in studio.
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.880]  But here is the latest from Alex Jones.
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Alex Jones coming up in the next hour.
[55:45.240 --> 55:52.800]  Roger Stone is going to be in studio to relay to you some of the most important earthshaking
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.520]  news that we have ever broken down on this live broadcast.
[55:58.520 --> 56:04.520]  Roger Stone had dinner with a national media figure who's very close to the president who
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.840]  told him last week that the deep state is going to make their criminal move to remove
[56:10.840 --> 56:16.440]  him and that they're also trying to crack the stock market, obviously, at the level
[56:16.440 --> 56:22.160]  of Chinese communist penetration of the nation is just flabbergasting the president.
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.120]  The president has faith in the American people that if they illegally try to remove him from
[56:26.120 --> 56:32.480]  office with this whole fake Russia gate to the rest of it, the American people will rise
[56:32.480 --> 56:38.840]  up with their firearms and resist the deep state.
[56:38.840 --> 56:46.440]  These are incredible, incredible, incredible statements and are of maximum import.
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.080]  Please tell everyone you know to tune in now to mfullwars.com forward slash show.
[56:51.080 --> 56:53.360]  I'm Alex Jones on the road with my family.
[56:53.360 --> 56:56.640]  I'll be breaking in live as all this unfolds as well.
[56:56.640 --> 56:57.640]  This is not a drill.
[56:57.640 --> 56:58.640]  Repeat.
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.640]  This is not a drill.
[56:59.640 --> 57:00.640]  This is the real deal.
[57:00.640 --> 57:01.920]  America at the crossroads.
[57:01.920 --> 57:04.640]  We go forward or the Republic dies.
[57:04.640 --> 57:07.960]  Choose a side with America and nationalism or globalism.
[57:07.960 --> 57:14.960]  A pro human future or a technocracy nightmare future again, Roger Stone with the world exclusive
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.960]  breakdown.
[57:15.960 --> 57:21.440]  Now the president must strike back immediately with declassification to avert the civil war.
[57:21.440 --> 57:27.440]  I'm Alex Jones praying for peace and preparing to defend our Republic against all enemies,
[57:27.440 --> 57:29.440]  foreign and domestic.
[57:29.440 --> 57:35.200]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone on the other side of this break.
[57:35.200 --> 57:36.560]  There is no doubt.
[57:36.560 --> 57:39.640]  It is the American Revolution 2.0.
[57:39.640 --> 57:40.640]  It's going on.
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.640]  It's happening right now.
[57:42.640 --> 57:45.080]  Hope you don't miss it.
[57:45.080 --> 57:46.080]  It's thrilling.
[57:46.080 --> 57:47.080]  It's thrilling.
[57:47.080 --> 57:48.080]  All right.
[57:48.080 --> 57:54.640]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[57:54.640 --> 57:56.520]  That's the globalist only hope.
[57:56.520 --> 58:00.400]  So when you support mfullwars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.680]  at mfullwars.com, you are literally not just supporting mfullwars and free speech and
[58:04.680 --> 58:08.680]  standing and defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are
[58:08.680 --> 58:13.720]  standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system
[58:13.720 --> 58:16.040]  in America to stand against these individuals.
[58:16.040 --> 58:20.160]  When you order products at mfullwars.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but
[58:20.160 --> 58:21.840]  a global revolution against tyranny.
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.840]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part
[58:25.840 --> 58:28.000]  of a total store clearance.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.440]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[58:30.440 --> 58:31.560]  Every order gets free shipping.
[58:31.560 --> 58:34.720]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[58:34.720 --> 58:40.360]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout
[58:40.360 --> 58:43.680]  the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[58:43.680 --> 58:44.680]  We're on the march.
[58:44.680 --> 58:45.680]  The empire is on the run.
[58:45.680 --> 58:46.680]  I salute you all.
[58:46.680 --> 58:50.640]  Now please take action at mfullwarsstore.com.
[58:50.640 --> 58:54.720]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[58:54.720 --> 58:55.720]  law.
[58:55.720 --> 59:01.120]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[59:01.120 --> 59:05.000]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.160]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[59:10.160 --> 59:14.480]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[59:14.480 --> 59:21.200]  There's only two groups in the U.S., MFullwars and Matt Rudge of Rudgeport.com, that are
[59:21.200 --> 59:22.200]  truly independent.
[59:22.200 --> 59:26.240]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[59:26.240 --> 59:27.240]  Really is amazing.
[59:27.240 --> 59:31.080]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners.
[59:31.080 --> 59:34.320]  Some of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[59:34.320 --> 59:39.800]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of MFullwars.
[59:39.800 --> 59:44.520]  So please spread the links, mfullwars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.
[59:44.520 --> 59:47.800]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[59:47.800 --> 59:49.080]  We're all in each other's hands.
[59:49.080 --> 59:53.600]  God bless you all and thank you.
[59:53.600 --> 01:00:19.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:33.680]  Here's the deal.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:44.920]  Americans are finally starting to realize just how corrupt the media and the government
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920]  has become.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.440]  Of course, it's not the government, it's a bunch of unelected bureaucrats thinking they're
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]  above the law.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.560]  Of course, I guess when you've been above the law for so long, Allah, Hillary Clinton,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.360]  I suppose there's a justification for that belief.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.720]  You have the Democrat Party that's pretty much owned by the Chinese, at least at the
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.800]  very top.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:15.920]  You have the corporate media that, I mean, who knows, you can see who the corporate media,
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:23.560]  for example, like, I should spend, I mean, it's almost like we really, I mean, how do
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]  you decide?
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.600]  I was thinking about this today when I was rendezvousing with Alex.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.360]  How do we decide what is the biggest news?
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:45.040]  And it's really all about the moment and all about trends and all about general interest.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.880]  And so that's why we talk about the American Revolution happening right now.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.440]  That's why we talk about the Cold Civil War that's going on right now in the White House.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.600]  For example, something is happening literally right now in the White House.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.720]  President Trump has called an emergency meeting and stopped a congressional, I think, vote
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.560]  or something from going on.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.160]  Trump stopped the whole thing and called in the House GOP for an emergency meeting.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.360]  So I mean, that stuff is happening.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.080]  That's the Cold Civil War going on with the Democrats trying to destroy America, trying
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080]  to destroy Trump.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:25.660]  And then, of course, the media, for example, there's practically zero interest in a report
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.960]  when it comes to the 5G technology that they're about to roll out, which they're gonna do
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.760]  it.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.320]  They just announced yesterday, Steve Scalise, if you guys can find the tweet, Steve Scalise,
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.240]  all happy how AT&T is about to launch their 5G full-on rollout for 2019.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.000]  I think it was like 20 or 40 cities.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.120]  They're getting ready to roll it out.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.800]  And they're all celebrating it.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.280]  You had Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager excited about the 5G rollout.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.680]  Oh, it's so great.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.480]  No, it's not.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.400]  But see, yeah, there it is right there.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:14.120]  AT&T turns on its mobile 5G network tomorrow, starting with 12 cities.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]  You know what, guys?
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.600]  Go ahead and print that out for me, too, along with the Gateway Pundit story about President
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.160]  Trump's emergency meeting that he just called.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.800]  So, but here's what I'm saying.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.960]  This story impacts all of us.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960]  This is not political.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.000]  There's no bias.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.520]  Whether you're a libertarian, a Republican, or a Democrat, that 5G cell phone wave is
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:42.800]  going to radiate you and mess you up, mess your DNA up, mess your lineage DNA up.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:50.200]  Oh, yeah, you can be the best, most tolerant liberal in America, and that 5G is still going
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.160]  to fry you like a chicken.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.120]  But there's no interest.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.520]  Nobody wants to talk about it, but everybody wants a faster cell phone.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.600]  So give me that 5G, baby.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.960]  And we should all be covering that and focusing on that, but we don't, because why?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.840]  Well, because we're trying to save America right now, and we've got such a corrupt media.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.040]  Oh, but here's my point.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]  It just shows you.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]  Why do you think?
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.680]  I mean, you know, you shouldn't have to be a genius or like some sort of astrophysicist
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.400]  to figure this out, but why do you think cable news wouldn't want to cover 5G, at least
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.120]  perhaps negatively?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120]  Let's see.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.200]  Oh, it's a commercial.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.760]  New plan from Verizon, fastest speeds on the, in the internet.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.200]  AT&T's new cell phone, best coverage, cricket wireless, T-Mobile.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.200]  Oh, now I know why Fox News doesn't want to talk about 5G.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.880]  Now I know why the cable news doesn't want to talk about 5G.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.880]  It's making them filthy rich.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.520]  Roger Stone on the other side, exclusive news.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.560]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.060]  law.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:08.960]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.880]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.040]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.120]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:28.920]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920]  are truly independent.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.520]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.480]  It really is amazing.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.160]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.640]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.480]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.680]  you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.680]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.160]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160]  We've got it.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160]  We've got it.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:18.160]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:26.560]  Cut the Carlson, the number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:33.600]  patriot, a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones right now in front of all of us.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.440]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.680]  so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.320]  In fact, it came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents where
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.520]  they said, Ben Alex Jones, he also said Ben Tucker Carlson.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.720]  He was right under me on the list.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.280]  And I could already see once they did platform me that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.560]  That's why talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.800]  And I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.720]  He was already obviously covering all that on air.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.760]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.000]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.200]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is his evil racist place when
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.880]  we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.680]  In the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.960]  Everybody make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:41.040]  But today, we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:48.080]  coming into Europe and the US where people show up with cholera and leprosy and drug-resistant
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.560]  TB and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.480]  And we're told, don't even screen them.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:59.800]  Let them into the country and then under Obama, let them be child trafficked.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.120]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.280]  Gave the children to child traffickers because you can't even see who the kids are with.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280]  Sometimes unaccompanied.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.000]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party controlled buses.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.080]  If we go back to 10 years ago, seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.160]  eight, nine million viewers a night.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.520]  That's double what Sean Hannity has.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]  He's number one.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.720]  Carlson's number two with four million.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.080]  And what was he talking about?
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.120]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.440]  He was going off their own documents.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.000]  Lou Dobbs was taken off the air because he was number one because he was telling the
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.400]  truth and he was a patriot.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.880]  Now he's relegated to Fox Business with maybe a million viewers.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.120]  And Tucker Carlson is next and then Sean Hannity.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.520]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.120]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]  And here's why.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.200]  Our country's economy is becoming more automated and tech-centered by the day.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.600]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600]  we're getting.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.960]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960]  Nice people.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.760]  No one doubts that, but as an economic matter, this is insane.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.560]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.320]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.560]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.680]  Even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided, immigration is a
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]  form of atonement.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:36.600]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.840]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere and needles and the highest
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.400]  crime in every case.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.760]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas, because it's a system of dependency that they
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.760]  create.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.480]  So if Tucker Carlson is guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.000]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  dangerous.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.840]  We're San Francisco juries letting legal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.040]  well, she's white.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.720]  We have diversity signal.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.440]  This is the real cancer.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:16.640]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds and they have gay bars, have little children
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.120]  dancing and having money thrown at them.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.560]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with with the bullying of the left and their total
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]  cultural takeover?
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.160]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.600]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600]  Now it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.040]  We have to unify truth, be just saying, no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.600]  I can guarantee you this, then FullWars.com and NewsWars.com, we're not backing down.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.640]  We're doubling down.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.560]  So Roger Stone is in studio with us right now and Roger Muller is now coming after you.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.920]  And again, you know, the whole thing with this that frustrates me, Roger, you look at
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:02.400]  some of the names that Muller is going after yourself, Manafort, Corsi, Flynn, Papadopoulos.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.520]  There would be zero interest in any of these individuals, including yourself, from the
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.040]  FBI or anybody if it wasn't for Donald Trump.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.600]  But you notice how there's nothing they have on Trump, there's nothing that they have when
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.080]  it comes to Russia, they just have some associates of Trump that they're trying to destroy to
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.280]  then sell Trump out.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.320]  So it really shows you how, I mean, to me, it just totally proves that this whole thing
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.600]  is a political witch hunt by the fact that they're trying to go after all these men,
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.200]  including you, has nothing to do with Russia, really nothing, I mean, nothing to do with
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.560]  Trump other than you're associated with him, and it's all to try to destroy Trump, not
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.320]  to protect elections, not to protect American sovereignty, nothing just to destroy Trump.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.240]  You know, Owen, I haven't seen anything like this since 1974, the media tsunami of fake
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.800]  news focusing on a Russian real estate deal that never really happened, the Trump Foundation
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:03.280]  in New York, the constant barrage of attacks on the president, the inexorable move towards
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.400]  impeachment, which I think is a silent coup, and in the face of this, the president has
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.240]  been entirely sanguine.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.320]  I think we know the reason for that.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:18.520]  I point out to you a story about a week ago where he said, I believe correctly, that if
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.760]  there's an effort to illegitimately undo the results of the last election, if they trump
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.800]  up phony charges as the basis for impeachment, there'll be a revolt.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:34.160]  The president has told at least two people that I know, a very prominent publisher and
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.840]  another Trump intimate, that he just doesn't think the American people will stand for it,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.000]  that the American people are well armed and he believes there'll be an insurrection.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.200]  I don't think he's advocating an insurrection, but I think he realizes that they will cause
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.080]  a civil war in this country.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.960]  Well, and Roger, look, you and I have been talking about this for months, really.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.720]  I mean, this has been a talking point that we've had because to me, it's just common
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720]  sense.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.720]  I mean, look at the support President Trump has.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.000]  Look at the support he has when he goes to rallies, tens of thousands of people.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.840]  They stand outside for days, literally, in the rain.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.200]  Of course, these people are going to come to Trump's defense should they try to remove
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]  him.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.360]  Of course, they're going to be a revolt.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.280]  Well, it's not 1974.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.520]  Actually, in 1974, we had a completely controlled monolithic media, you had three major networks.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520]  That was it.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.280]  You had a couple of national newspapers.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.440]  This is why they are so desperate to snuffinfowars.com.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:33.080]  It's why they want to shut us down because they realize that we're the moderate.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:39.040]  They realize that there will be a clarion call across the country for civil disobedience
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.720]  at a minimum.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.280]  And the president knows that there will be an uprising.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.680]  There will be a revolt.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.200]  And he's pointed out to several people that I know that we have a very well armed populace.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:57.440]  I don't think he wants a civil war, but he also does not want to be illegitimately decapitated
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.200]  by the deep state who is now in high gear in an effort to destroy him.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.200]  You know, I mean, let's actually war game this out here.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200]  You know what?
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.200]  Let's war game this out in the next segment, Roger.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.440]  We got just over a minute.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.560]  So let's actually war game this out.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.400]  What would happen because I think we both have an idea.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.920]  So let's come back in the next segment and actually war game this out.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.440]  What might happen should that situation ensue?
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.240]  But during this break, go to infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.800]  Now we have just announced we are going to extend our Christmas sale to the end of the
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.800]  year.

[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  going to break down the possible scenario should the deep state remove Trump and should
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.240]  there be a revolt or what that means.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.560]  But go to this short break, folks, because they're trying to censor us.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.440]  They don't look, you can't even tune into conservative television cable news without
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.160]  them telling you we should be at war in Syria.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  Okay.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160]  We're not corporate news.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  We're independent.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.880]  We're pro America, literally to the core.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.360]  That's why you have to support us, folks.

[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  Hear that.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:04.480]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.240]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed this year.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.400]  Resolve not to be the next victim of a break in go to fake TV dot com and discover a device
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.880]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.080]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.720]  Be vigilant, but not fearful fake TV dot com.

[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.400]  my mother's house.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.960]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.920]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.440]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.760]  I can help you too.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.760]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.520]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website danpilla dot com.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.520]  It's danpilla dot com, danpilla dot com.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.600]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.600]  law.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.960]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.760]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:18.040]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:28.920]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report dot com that
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920]  are truly independent.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.480]  And of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world, it really is amazing.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.040]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.160]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.640]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.960]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswords.com, prisonpana.com, because if you don't spread
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.640]  the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.640]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.640]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.240]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.280]  alternative, Infowars Life has the formula for you.

[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.040]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.800]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high-quality Crill Oil Concentrate.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.240]  Paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately, it's time to see what Crill Oil
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:20:15.240]  can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:44.400]  So here's how I see this going down, and I really believe it's organic, Roger.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.240]  I don't think this is something where we have to go on air and be like, go to DC to
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.240]  defend Trump.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.440]  I don't think that's going to be the case.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:55.920]  I think if Trump is removed, whatever that means, people are going to flock to DC just
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.160]  like they flock to a Trump rally, and it's going to be some sort of national phenomenon
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.320]  really.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:08.120]  And what I think will happen, Roger, is that the military, which for the most part is behind
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.520]  President Trump, if not, obviously nothing is fully behind Trump, but military mostly
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.080]  behind Donald Trump.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.720]  And I think what you'd have is a situation where you basically have the president either
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:24.800]  impeach or remove from office somehow, but whatever the Democrats decide to put in there
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.240]  or whoever gets put in there, it'll be like it never happened.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:36.000]  Trump will still be the president in theory, and the military will still listen to Trump,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.360]  the American people will still listen to Trump.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.720]  And I really think that even though it could get bad, Roger, that could be the death blow
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.160]  to the deep state to realize that the American people are not putting up with their garbage
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160]  anymore.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.360]  Well, I think I've been pretty clear about how I think this is going to go down.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.760]  The House Democrats are going to vote articles of impeachment on Donald Trump no matter what.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.440]  They may have no evidence whatsoever.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.600]  They certainly will have no evidence of Russian collusion because there is none.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:07.000]  So they will vote articles of impeachment against the president on some other phony
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.560]  trumped-up charge, perhaps even a campaign finance-related charge contained in Mr. Mueller's
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.040]  final report.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.400]  We have the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission coming out saying this
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:22.040]  isn't even a crime, but that's the best they can do because they have no Russian collusion.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:28.240]  Then you'll move to the Senate where it requires a two-thirds vote to remove the president.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.840]  What they would hope to do at that point is to ramp up a Kavanaugh-style insanity, a mass
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.320]  national hysteria about Donald Trump.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.600]  But I think what they will find is it'll be like France in 1968, the American people,
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:48.520]  the hard-working, middle-class Trump-supporting American people, they too will travel to America.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.400]  They too will engage in civil disobedience.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.680]  They too will take to the streets, and you will have a major insurrection, which in turn
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:04.720]  will put pressure on the US Senate, and I think the two-thirds vote will be incapable of mustering.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:12.960]  Now if there is a mass movement, mass mobilization on the left and no mobilization on the right
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.120]  or among Trump supporters, perhaps they have a chance.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.160]  But if the American people do what I think they will do, and I agree with you, it'll
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.160]  be indigenous.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:25.960]  There'll be no call from the president or the vice president or Alex Jones or anyone
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.120]  else, it'll be unnecessary.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.840]  It will be clear to the American people, and patriots will head to Washington to flood
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:38.040]  the streets, patriots will head to the offices of their congressmen, their senators, and
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.800]  demand that this farce be ended.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.080]  Totally agree, and it'll almost be like the shot heard around the world part two, where
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.760]  people, Trump is so popular, Trump is supported around the world too, it's all this fake
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.280]  news acting like it's unpopular, and people around the world will see that Americans
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:57.040]  are finally standing up again, they're not dead weight watching the Kardashians on television
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.840]  every day, and they're trying to take back their democracy that had fallen so far.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.240]  So I think it'll be good for the world to see that as well, almost restoring a little
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.480]  hope in America for the world's eyes to see.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:14.080]  But Roger, I was, I shouldn't say surprised, but it really frustrates me that this happens
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.680]  where Loretta Lynch gets subpoenaed to go testify behind closed doors to the Dugitiary
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.440]  Committee yesterday.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440]  Nobody covered it.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.440]  It wasn't a big story.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.160]  There wasn't a lead headline on Drudge or The New York Times or The Washington Post.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:32.360]  There wasn't media freaking out 24-7, Loretta Lynch subpoenaed, but you know, if it was
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.440]  Roger Stone that was subpoenaed, it'd be the number one story.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.400]  It'd be proof Roger Stone colluded with Russia and Martians and Pluto from the Disney cartoon.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.640]  But oh, Loretta Lynch from the Obama administration subpoenaed, oh, nothing to see here, Roger.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.040]  Yeah, no, there's an extraordinary double standard.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.320]  Look, the big story this morning, you can see it everywhere, is that the House Intelligence
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.400]  Committee voted this morning at 10 a.m. Eastern to release the transcript of my testimony
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.920]  over a year ago before the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:05.840]  Now, as you remember, Owen, I wanted to testify in public because I have nothing whatsoever
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840]  to hide.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.960]  I demanded to testify in public and they would not agree to let me do so.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.880]  So I testified for four and a half hours.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  At the end of two hours, Trey Gowdy said, well, Mr. Stone, you've answered all of our questions.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.080]  You're not here under subpoena.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.080]  You're free to go.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.080]  I said, no, I want to stay here and answer questions until nobody has any more questions.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.800]  I stayed for another two hours.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.440]  Did Shifty Schiff have some more questions for you?
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.600]  That's the whole point here, which is I now have called on the committee to release my
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.120]  transcript to the American people.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.680]  Let's get it all out there right now.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.880]  You know, it will be proven not that I lied, but that Adam Schiff and Eric Swallow as well
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.920]  and Joaquin Castro, they are the ones who have lied.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.120]  They have lied consistently about what I said under oath, but the bottom line of this is
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.800]  really clear.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.600]  Where's the Russian collusion?
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.640]  Where's the WikiLeaks collaboration?
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  Where's the evidence that I received anything, including allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.160]  emails from Julian Assange or WikiLeaks or Russian intelligence or Goose for 2.0 or Jerry
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.240]  Corsi or Bozo the Clown for that matter.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.120]  They have no such evidence.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.680]  So now what we're down to is trying to set a perjury trap, arguing about what the definition
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.600]  of the word is, is.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.080]  Or Mr. Stone, you said you were wearing a blue necktie last Thursday and it was a red
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]  necktie.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080]  Actually, I think it was Navy.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080]  We got you.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080]  We got you.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.080]  So this is an absurdity.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:38.680]  A perfect example, Joaquin Castro says, Stone lied when he said that he didn't have advanced
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.520]  knowledge of the WikiLeaks disclosures.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.520]  Not what I said.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.800]  What I said was, I didn't know the exact disclosure.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.360]  I knew it would be in October.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.640]  I identified the source that told me that.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.880]  But Joaquin, I know this is hard for you to grasp.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.680]  October has 31 days.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680]  I didn't know what you did.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680]  It was going to come out.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.200]  There's no inconsistency in my testimony.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.280]  What this will prove if it is released to the American people, which I just called for.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.800]  Oh, and if I feared what was in this transcript, what I'd be calling for the public release,
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.280]  it will show that Adam Schiff is the biggest con man, the biggest huckster, the biggest
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.040]  fraudster, the biggest liar to ever sit in the US Congress.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.280]  They called him tricky dick.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.880]  Let me tell you something.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.320]  Next to Adam Schiff, Richard Nixon looks like St. Thomas Aquinas.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.680]  Well, and who knows what ends up coming out about the shifty shift over there in Hollywood
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:36.080]  and all the corruption and sickness that goes on over there that he's been in power over
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080]  there for a while.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:44.000]  Roger, I just feel like, okay, so yes, the deep state, the left, the globalists, yeah,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.960]  they've got their media all hopped up ready to go that will go along with whatever they
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.960]  want them to say.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.520]  Oh, yes, Stone colluded with the Martians in the 1800s or whatever in time travel to come
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.800]  here and win it for Trump.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800]  And the media will run with that.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.080]  And they've got a bunch of deranged, mentally ill leftists that are all hopped up too that
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.040]  hate Trump and fall for this whole Russian collusion thing.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:06.960]  But I don't think that this rubber meets the road, Roger.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.680]  I think if they actually try to put this to the road outside of their controlled corporate
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.480]  media and their brainwashed propaganda stooges, I think they fail miserably.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.880]  And then that's why I think this whole, I mean, I'm talking 50 million Americans go
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  to the streets if they try to take out Trump organically.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.560]  That's why, because there is no Russian collusion, people aren't that stupid.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.640]  They may be dumbed down a little bit, but they're not that stupid.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.480]  Well, I think it's significant that this was a two-part take down.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.240]  In other words, you saw a spate of stories yesterday saying Roger Stone admits to spreading
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.600]  lies on info wars.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.280]  I never said anything of that kind.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.200]  I have never willfully, knowingly said anything on info wars or any other platform that I
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.600]  knew to be false at the time I said it.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.120]  And when I did learn that I made an error, no matter how minor, I corrected it and I
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120]  apologize.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:04.360]  And that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.400]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.880]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:16.040]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.840]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.040]  Security is a mindset.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.040]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.560]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.600]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.440]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.360]  So when you support Infowars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.600]  at InfowarsTour.com, you are literally not just supporting Infowars in free speech and
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.600]  standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.720]  standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.960]  America to stand against these individuals.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.080]  When you order products at InfowarsTour.com, you fund not just an American revolution,
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.160]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.760]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.880]  of a total store clearance.

[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.480]  Every order gets free shipping.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.960]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance and that funding allows us to go into the
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.840]  new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.560]  just fight, but to expand.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.560]  We're on the march.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.560]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.560]  I salute you all.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.640]  Now please take action at InfowarsTour.com.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:03.520]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.000]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.040]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:18.240]  That's why InfowarsLife created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.640]  standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:58.600]  Mineral Fusion today, available at InfowarsTour.com.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.640]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]  law.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:09.080]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:13.280]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.120]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.440]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:29.160]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Rudge of RudgeReport.com that are
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.160]  truly independent.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.640]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.560]  It really is amazing.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.040]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.280]  Some of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.760]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.480]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswords.com, chrisandpudda.com.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.760]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.960]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:26.800]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800]  You'll be back on the war room today, correct?
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.000]  I've been invited to come on with Aaron Burnett at CNN.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.160]  I think I'm going to take my opportunity to do that because I have to push back on this
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.160]  narrative.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:40.840]  The release of the transcripts of my testimony for the House Intelligence Committee will
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:46.080]  prove definitively that Adam Schiff is a stone cold liar and that I have been telling the
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.080]  truth.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.080]  So this notion that stone fears the release of these transcripts, no, on the contrary,
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:55.840]  I want all of the American people to see exactly what I said.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.080]  Do I look like a man who's afraid to you?
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.680]  No, I can confidently say no.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.840]  And I'm not afraid for you.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.440]  So you'll be on Aaron Burnett out front, way behind later today.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:13.640]  But Roger, just speak briefly about, I mean, you're the target here, but this doesn't just
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640]  affect you.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.160]  I mean, your family has been impacted by this.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.640]  I mean, you look at what's happened to General Flynn and others, I mean, Robert Mueller is
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.840]  not just coming after you because he thinks you did anything illegal or anything.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.040]  He's trying to destroy you.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.920]  He wants to destroy you to make an example of anybody else who wants to stick their neck
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:33.200]  out there for Trump in America.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.440]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.760]  So part of the tactic is to destroy you financially.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.400]  In other words, make sure that you don't have the financial resources to pay for the lawyers
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.780]  to defend yourself.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:46.120]  That way they can squeeze you to testify against Donald Trump.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:52.600]  I think I made it clear with George Stephanopoulos on ABC three weekends ago that there's no
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.480]  circumstance whatsoever in which I'm going to lie about Donald Trump.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.560]  I'm not going to make up stories.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.560]  Just not going to do it.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:04.320]  And I was gratified when the president praised me in a tweet saying that I had guts, but
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.320]  it doesn't take guts.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.720]  It just takes a commitment to the truth.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.360]  But you're right about one thing.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.320]  This has virtually destroyed my family financially.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.960]  We're looking at a pretty darn bleak Christmas because frankly, every dollar I can earn, I
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:22.160]  have to pay over to my lawyers who are fighting 24 seven to defend me.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.040]  Not only against the onslaught of Robert Mueller, who has unlimited tax dollars, which try to
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:34.760]  destroy me, but also the Adam shifts of the world, who constantly raises a veritable
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.640]  shift storm of disinformation.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:44.640]  As you know, Al Owen, recently I announced the sale of these Roger Stones.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.160]  This is an official Roger Stone.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.840]  It's a stone in which I have signed my name.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.840]  It's a paperweight.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.480]  That's the purpose of it.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:58.520]  It says the exact replica of the stone that David used to take down Goliath.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.760]  And you can get them at the Stone Cold Truth Shop website.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:09.160]  And we sold a few of them here and there until Talking Points Memo and Rolling Stone both
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.520]  mocked me for the sale of these.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.320]  100% of the proceeds go to pay for my legal defense.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.720]  Just being attacked by Rolling Stone and Talking Points Memo, these babies are flying off the
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.720]  shelf.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.600]  So you can go to StoneColdTruth.com, click on shop, and you'll find your very own Roger
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.600]  Stone.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.560]  And I just have to say, this stone live in studio is glorious Roger.
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.040]  Well, and I have magnanimous over there.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:42.400]  And I have brought a stone for the entire crew as my Christmas present to the crew here
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.400]  at InfoWars.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.480]  Here is your very own Roger Stone.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.480]  Wow, thank you.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.480]  Merry Christmas, Roger.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.480]  Look at that.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.480]  My own Roger Stone right there.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.920]  It's going to be sitting at my desk, hanging out with me all the time now.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.840]  So you can get your own Roger Stone.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.440]  And as you said, this was a replica of the stone from thousands of years ago.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.640]  It is a historical artifact, it's an exact replica of the stone that little David used
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.800]  to take down Goliath.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.800]  It's a paperweight.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.040]  Let's be clear about that.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.440]  That's the purpose of this.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.920]  And I sold them last Christmas just kind of as a joke.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.600]  But now it's no longer a joke.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.400]  I need the money.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.080]  Every penny goes to my legal defense fund.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.320]  We just showed the there it is stonedefensefund.com.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.440]  You can go directly there to make a contribution by credit card or choose you where you can
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  mail a check.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.040]  Folks, I am fighting for my life.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.680]  This is a serious matter.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.840]  I'm not crying wolf.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.600]  They want to destroy me financially in order to uke me into testifying against Donald Trump.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.640]  They'd like to turn me into Michael Cohen.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.960]  I refuse to do that.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:48.960]  But I need your support.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.280]  If you want me to have Donald Trump's back, I need you to have my back.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.740]  And there's actually an animated reenactment of the original Roger Stone taking down Goliath.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:05.480]  But like you said, Roger, it's just like how the Democrat Party and the Clintons and
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:10.360]  all of their legal funds and just the swass of cash that they have in the bank, you know,
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.160]  from Soros and all these leftist donors, they use all that money to fund lawsuits against
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.840]  Alex and Info Wars to try to destroy us.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:24.880]  Muller has just a trove, 30 million plus spent so far on the Russian probe, 30 million, like
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.400]  you said, just, you know, unlimited funds, taxpayer funds, spending all of it.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.720]  And you know what the real crime here is, Roger, is that they know there was no crime
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.360]  to begin with.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.440]  That's the real crime.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:42.980]  They're destroying innocent people's lives because they want to use it as a political
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:46.480]  tool because they didn't like the results of a presidential election.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.880]  It's so sick.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.680]  It's such a miscarriage of justice.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:55.480]  The only justice to me in this situation, Roger, is that all involved with the Russian
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.320]  collusion witch hunt, all parties involved with Robert Muller's team belong in prison.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.680]  Well, this really isn't complicated, but it is perplexing why I don't understand why
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:11.240]  the president does not direct the acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to appoint
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:17.320]  a special counsel to examine the illicit and illegal use of FISA warrants during the last
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:23.960]  election and to examine the financial transaction of Uranium One, which is the largest treasonous
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:26.680]  financial crime in American history.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.600]  It's an open and shut case.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.640]  You want to see the Russian collusion?
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.680]  There it is, right out there in the plain sight where everyone can see it.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:42.160]  But instead, we are spending millions of dollars, 25 million last time I looked, in a two-year
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:48.320]  inquisition in which they have found no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:54.080]  They keep pointing to half-assed Russian meddling in the election on social media, which was
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.160]  completely ineffective and underfunded.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.080]  The big study that was put forward by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a fraud.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.800]  It was conducted by a bunch of left-wing Trump-hating academics.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.480]  It proves nothing, but it's on the front page of the Washington Compost and the New York
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.200]  Times and all the other fake news organs, as if it matters.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.560]  I'm sorry, but Russian meddling did not affect the outcome of the last election.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.680]  Hillary Clinton spent close to a billion dollars, Donald Trump spent close to 275 million,
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  and he beat her.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.640]  Do you really think a couple hundred thousand dollars spent by the Russians meant anything?
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.520]  Their ads were so poorly written, you couldn't even understand what they were trying to accomplish.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.760]  That's Russian meddling.
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.200]  Don't confuse Russian meddling with Russian collusion.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.760]  That's what they want you to do.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:47.400]  Well, and again, all the evidence, if anything, has been produced by this special counsel,
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.400]  this probe.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.760]  It shows it's the Democrats colluding with Russia.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.160]  It shows that it was Hillary that colluded with Russia.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:41:00.280]  And Roger, the only influence that any social media activity from Russians had was the anti-Trump
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  march they did in New York City that was promoted by CNN and attended and promoted by Michael
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  Moore.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.880]  So even the facts of the matter that have come out from this special counsel only prove
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.320]  that if there's any collusion whatsoever, it's the Democrats with Russia via the fake
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:22.040]  dossier, and then it's the Democrats that fell for any Russian social media activity.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.000]  But Rod Rosenstein said, no proof of any Russian collusion, no proof any votes were changed.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.680]  The indictments that Mueller had put out did not say that it was clearly Russian-cluded
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.520]  with Trump to influence the election for him.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.120]  So it's like, why is this still going on, even though they've admitted the entire thing
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.320]  was a farce already?
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:39.960]  I could not agree more.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.600]  I urge people to go to the enforce.com site now and see this incredible story, because
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.680]  the president clearly thinks, and I think he's right, there will be a revolt by the
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:55.200]  American people if there is an illegitimate attempt to remove him in some kind of silent
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200]  coup.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.640]  We have a terrific piece up on Infowars right now, and we urge you to take a look at this,
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.240]  because it is earth-shattering.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.840]  As I said in the first segment, at least two intimates of the president have told me that
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.480]  the president told them that he's confident that there would be a revolt, and he knows
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:13.720]  the American people are armed.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.960]  He doesn't want to see a civil war, but I think he accurately predicts that there will
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:23.120]  be one if they try to decapitate him through some illicit means.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.120]  They have no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.720]  They have no evidence of treason.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.120]  They have no evidence of wrongdoing.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.760]  The New York State Attorney General, we got to get her picture.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.040]  This is one of the ugliest women I've ever seen in my entire life.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.040]  Barbara Underwood?
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  Yeah.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.000]  She doesn't look into the illegal and criminal activities of the Clinton Foundation, which
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.200]  is based in New York.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.120]  No, she's too busy trying to shut down the Trump Foundation.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.880]  Which actually does charitable work, and Trump doesn't even take a dime.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.720]  There's your Roger Stone right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.640]  We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone on the other side.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:57.440]  Share that link at infowars.com.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.480]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.980]  law.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:07.880]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.720]  the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if game over.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.960]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.000]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  truly independent.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.520]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.440]  It really is amazing.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.720]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.040]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together, just remind you that you are the
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.600]  power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.560]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prismpana.com, because if you
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.600]  don't spread the articles, nobody goes, no one else will.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:55.880]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.040]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:03.160]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.760]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:11.360]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.320]  it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to Infowars around
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.320]  the world.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:25.520]  The eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist program.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.880]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.080]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.800]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.920]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:49.120]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me, not behind
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.400]  us but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.280]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.280]  you.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:05.200]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test and those of you that
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.440]  have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.000]  and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.960]  all because you are the core, listening to Infowars around the world, the eyes and ears
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:26.720]  of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist program.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.120]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.320]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.920]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:44.160]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:50.000]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me, not
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.600]  behind us but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.520]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:24.240]  you.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:46.040]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.440]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to but the bare minimum you can
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:55.520]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:02.000]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:17.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:35.280]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:46.840]  So Roger Stone, who has Robert Mueller with his pitchfork and his pointy tail and his
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:53.800]  stinking breath breathing over his neck trying to destroy his life and his family's life.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.480]  That's what Roger Stone has to deal with.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:02.280]  And so he is selling Roger Stones right now, a great paperweight, to fund his legal defense
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.280]  fund.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.880]  Roger, then you see this story today, I believe you have the New York Times version, I have
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.680]  the Fox News version.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.200]  Democrat operatives created fake Russian bots designed to link Kremlin to Roy Moore and
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  Alabama.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.840]  It's admitted in Fox News, it's admitted in the New York Times and basically the story
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:21.840]  is here.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.560]  They say, well, we were just running a secret project on social media.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.240]  It cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars and we were just creating a bunch of fake Russian
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:36.960]  bots to act like they were connected to the Kremlin and then connect them to Roy Moore
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.880]  so we could run our story about how the Russians are influencing everything and oh yes.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.760]  But they say, Roger, it wasn't enough to have an impact even though it was more money than
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:52.760]  the actual Russians ever spent on any election.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.120]  So here's the Democrats admitting they actually literally did what their claiming Russian
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  did.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.760]  You know, I'm really not upset about this, Owen, because I'm highly confident that after
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:07.760]  January when Adam Schiff takes over the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee, I'm certain
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.800]  he's going to subpoena all these people and ask the tough questions so the American people
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.200]  can find out what really happened here.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  Not.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.440]  You see, there's no interest in the activities of Democrats.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:25.560]  The Democrats can collude with Ukraine, which Alicia Stranahan has documented extensively.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:33.720]  The Clintons can be deeply associated with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.240]  Tony and John Podesta literally made millions of dollars in aluminum, in uranium, in gas,
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:44.040]  in banking from the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.200]  But the New York Times isn't interested in that.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.960]  The Washington Post is not interested in that.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:55.520]  Instead, it's enormous news that Donald Trump explored the possibility of a real estate
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.640]  development in Russia that he never actually went forward with and was probably pushed
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.640]  and advocated more heavily by Michael Cohn than Donald Trump.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.600]  It's a farce, but it achieves the goal, which is to get Russia in the headline.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.600]  Since they're empty-handed of any evidence of real Russian collusion and they realize
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.840]  the American people aren't as stupid as they would hope they are, we've got to get Russia
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.840]  in the headline here so that the casual person can look at it and say, oh, they finally nailed
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:22.120]  Trump on Russia.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.720]  They have nothing.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:29.840]  Michael Cohn is being manipulated by the Clintonistas and he's now being used as a blunt
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.440]  instrument on Donald Trump.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.720]  And he chose to be the rat.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.720]  He chose that role.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.960]  Now he's eating the cheese.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.040]  Well, he's literally dumb as a box of some rocks.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.880]  I mean, I've known the guy since 2012.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.200]  I had very limited contact with him in 2015.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.560]  I don't think any content in 2016.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:49.120]  I don't believe any because Donald Trump did not want him in the campaign and Donald Trump
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.160]  did not want him in the White House quite obviously.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:59.320]  And now he spent $5 million paying lawyers to go out and read all of his email and tell
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.040]  him what it said.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.120]  I can't afford to do that.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:04.240]  I have over one million emails.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.440]  My little legal team has got to go search for things every time we get a request.
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.800]  There's no evidence of rushing collusion.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.280]  Eric Swawa, a week ago, we want Roger Stone's emails.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.760]  We want Roger Stone's phone calls.
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:17.560]  We want all of Roger Stone's texts.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.040]  Hey, Eric, don't worry.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:23.840]  Robert Mueller's had them for two years and you'll find no evidence of rushing collusion
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:26.960]  or WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal act.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.520]  So let's be clear.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.440]  I was under government surveillance in 2016.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.640]  The New York Times reported it.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.040]  We were together that day in Washington.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:42.040]  They reported it on January 20th, 2017 on page one that three Trump Trump advisors were
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.720]  under surveillance by the Obama administration.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:47.200]  I was one of them illegally illegally.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:52.440]  And I have been had a microscope and had this proctological examination of every aspect
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.320]  of my life for two years.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:59.160]  And now they're attempting to drive me into bankruptcy all for one reason.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.840]  If we squeeze Stone hard enough, maybe he'll make up crap against the president.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.760]  Maybe he'll testify against him.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.240]  Not happening.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:11.080]  Roger, the big story is being reported nationwide.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.960]  We have the story at Infowars.com, share it far and wide, ladies and gentlemen, from
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.200]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.880]  President Trump believes that there will be an armed revolt should the deep state try
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:21.880]  to remove him.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:28.400]  But I'm thinking about this more, Roger, and if President Trump genuinely doesn't want
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.640]  that to happen, he has to act now.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.480]  He has to move against the deep state.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.080]  He has to move against Mueller.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.720]  He has to either announce or reveal a special counsel that's been investigating them.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:44.200]  All the crimes that happened during the Clinton email scandal cover up with Comey, Lynch
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.640]  meeting illegally with Clinton on the tarmac, I'm telling you, Roger, I think Trump has
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.120]  to put it all out there now if he wants to stop there from being any type of revolt or
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:56.280]  hot civil war, this cold civil war that's going on behind closed doors.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.280]  What are your thoughts on that, Roger?
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.120]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:02.840]  A story that didn't make the front pages today, but is very significant is the fact that the
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:08.600]  ethics office of the Department of Justice approved acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.200]  oversight of the Mueller investigation.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:16.120]  That theoretically would mean that any indictment brought by Mr. Mueller would require the approval
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.280]  of the acting Attorney General.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:22.880]  This is oversight that Rod Rosenstein never did supply.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:29.320]  Rosenstein, having been deeply involved himself in the firing of Comey, had an egregious conflict
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:33.520]  in terms of the Mueller investigation, a matter that has never been brought to the courts,
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.000]  but will be over time.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.440]  The fact that Comey himself, pardon me, that Mueller himself auditioned for the job of FBI
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:47.600]  director was turned down and within 24 hours was appointed special counsel, therefore a
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:52.560]  motive for his efforts to destroy the president, the fact that he's passed over for the FBI
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:53.560]  director.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:58.040]  People ask me, well, do you fear being put on trial?
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.040]  What if you're indicted?
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.040]  Well, fine.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:05.400]  If I am indicted, we're going to talk about Mr. Mueller's involvement in 9-11, in BCCI,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:14.160]  in Pan Am 103, in Lockerbie, in the Anthrax scandal, in Whitey Bulger, Enron, and most
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.440]  specifically Uranium One.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:19.480]  I would say that he has far more to hide than I do.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.720]  Well, and President Trump has already announced that he's got the report.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.920]  As soon as Mueller releases his, Trump's going to release his counter-reported game over
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.920]  for Mueller.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.480]  But I would say this to President Trump, and you know that Infowars has basically been
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.160]  blocked from getting to Trump's desk.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:36.040]  That may change, and Trump tries to get as much info as he can.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:39.200]  But I think President Trump needs to realize something, Roger.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:47.000]  And that's the odds of him being the White Knight that he thinks he would be if he just
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.120]  let the deep state take him out, and then he thinks there'd be some armed revolt.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.840]  We don't want to get to that point, okay?
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.960]  And I don't think that that is a good thing for Trump to bank on.
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.720]  Not that I don't think it would happen.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.040]  Trump needs to realize he has to be the Dark Knight, and he has to do the things that the
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:04.880]  media is going to say is wrong.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.560]  He's going to have to take the bows and arrows like he's been.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.600]  He has to just go after these people and straight up arrest them, Roger.
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.840]  That's what he has to do.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.880]  And if he doesn't do that, there probably is going to be some sort of revolt, and there's
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.680]  going to be some sort of chaos.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.240]  He's going to be at the center of it, and then it's going to reach the American streets.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.960]  So do you agree with me?
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.640]  And I know you've already said yes, but again, Trump has to move against these people now.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.760]  That is the right thing to do if he doesn't do it.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.760]  He's right.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.840]  There will be a revolt, there will be chaos, but he can stop all of it, Roger.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:37.120]  You know, I saw this incredible interview with Devin Nunes two days ago where he was
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:41.880]  literally begging the president to declassify what's in his hands.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:46.360]  Let's recognize that Chairman Nunes has seen what the president has.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.280]  He has the security clearance, and he knows the entire scam.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:56.560]  He knows that the approval of the FISA warrant and their illicit use went all the way to
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:57.560]  the top.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.920]  He's likely approved or directed by Barack Obama himself.
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:04.000]  That is hinted at in Peter Strock's emails.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.400]  So I think the president has to move, and I would urge him to move now.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:14.000]  I would not wait until Mr. Mueller releases his report, because the New York Times will
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.560]  put his report on page one, and they will put whatever is learned in the declassification
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:21.280]  of these documents on page 27.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.000]  Beyond that, oh, and it looks to me like the president is about to go to a confrontation
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  with the Congress.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.760]  He's not going to sign this bill that they're sending him, which means he is prepared to
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:34.880]  shut down the government over their failure to secure our borders over the failure to
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:35.880]  build the wall.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.760]  Well, I'd cheer a government shutdown, and President Trump called an emergency meeting
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.840]  about an hour ago to address this.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.320]  Paul Ryan was addressing the House caucus.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.320]  Trump interrupted that meeting, called an emergency meeting, an emergency session, and these reports
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  are now coming out.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:50.880]  So yes, the bill was not signed.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.640]  The $10 billion going to Central America, five bill of it going to Mexico.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.280]  The bill has not been signed.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  Trump is standing strong, it looks like, for now against that, and then hopefully can counter
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.040]  it and maybe get some funding for a wall, or at least stop the billions of dollars
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:10.480]  from going to Central America as economic development while ours gets destroyed by the
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.360]  Democrats and the Federal Reserve.
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.160]  All right, Roger, great stuff as usual.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.360]  What is coming up for you the rest of the day?
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.200]  Well, first of all, as I said, my colleague Jacob Engels is going to be joining the war
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.760]  room today.
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:29.480]  I'm going to go on with Aaron Burnett and lay out to the American people why it's essential
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.720]  that my testimony for the House Intelligence Committee be released to the American people
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.160]  because it will show that Adam Schiff is the liar, not Roger Stone.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.160]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, support free press right here, infowarstore.com, big
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:47.440]  specials going Christmas specials to the end of the New Year's, infowarstore.com.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:52.520]  law.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:57.840]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:01.680]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:07.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:18.040]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.040]  truly independent.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:22.560]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.480]  It really is amazing.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.160]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:36.640]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:41.360]  So please spread the links, infowarstore.com, newswarstore.com, christenpana.com.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:44.640]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.880]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:49.320]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:54.000]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by Infowars Life.

[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:51.480]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:55.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:09.720]  These large tech companies are struggling to manage content perpetuating conspiracy
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:10.720]  theories.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.480]  They're so vulnerable to outside interference, isn't that a focus that could have been a
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:17.120]  missed opportunity?
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.040]  So it's a very good point you make.
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.920]  I would love if I could have more than five minutes to question witnesses.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.680]  Unfortunately, I don't get that opportunity.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.360]  However, I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.200]  The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:40.120]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers,
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  alleging that these were actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.000]  thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.120]  The video violated YouTube's rules against bullying and it was removed.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  I said it was a child act, I said it was a male drama club, and I put out here because
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.120]  they were both spoken.
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:04.120]  And you sat there and you lied about me, you didn't have hearing, but you didn't call me
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  to testify.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.120]  You didn't call me to testify in America?
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:07.120]  I have a right to fix my accusers.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.600]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.280]  It's a big red pill that we all must swallow.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:18.840]  The United States Congress is occupied by a corporatocracy, and it has been for at least
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:24.600]  over a century, a brazen corporate government, allowing foreign interests to drop cash on
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:30.000]  the barrelhead via their minions in large American corporations, putting a down payment
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.120]  on the influence of our elected representatives in bulk.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.560]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.400]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.400]  search results.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.400]  Google is evil.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.960]  Google is evil.
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:52.320]  The mere suspicion that Google manipulates its products and features for self-serving
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:57.880]  or even political purposes raises serious concerns about its business practices, its
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.760]  impact on free speech and our democratic process, and Americans' trust that the information
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:08.680]  gathered about them in their day-to-day lives is done with their knowledge and is not being
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:10.400]  used against them.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:13.560]  This is what a corporatic politician sounds like.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.240]  But before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:23.040]  issue, which is the fantasy, dreamed up by some conservatives, that Google and other
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.720]  online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:32.440]  As I have said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:35.760]  I have little doubt that my Republican colleagues will spend much of their time presenting a
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:41.440]  laundry list of anecdotes and the out-of-context statements made by Google employees as supposed
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.720]  evidence of anti-conservative bias, but none of that will actually make it true.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.280]  But this fact-free propaganda does help generate the mistrust that the majority leader referred
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.120]  to a few moments ago.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.200]  Clearly, Google has engaged in nefarious foreign collusion.
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.800]  Just last month, Google employees walked out protesting Google's Orwellian Chinese Dragonfly
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:10.000]  search engine, Nadler and company's fantasy that there isn't any anti-conservative bias
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.640]  amongst the hijacked public square now controlled by ultra-liberal Silicon Valley is laughable.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:22.600]  In fact, the bias is reaching epidemic proportions that violate a First Amendment that can no
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.680]  longer exist under this growing corporatic government.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:32.960]  House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler's 2018 re-election campaign received
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:42.560]  a total of $26,458 from Google's parent company, Alphabet, the largest donation Nadler received.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.640]  Breitbart wrote, records from the Federal Election Commission found that Nadler received
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:54.680]  donations from Google during the 2012, 2013, and 2014 election cycles, usually totaling
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.920]  $10,000 every year.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:02.520]  Obviously, any further investigation into Google's treasonous activities brings corporatic
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:06.400]  lap dogs like Mr. Nadler into question as well.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.720]  And all the while, China has subtly used its corporatic influence to infiltrate the United
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:17.680]  States as was uncovered during a recent hearing, including the Judiciary, FBI, and Homeland
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:23.080]  Security officials concerned about the impending horror of the state of Chinese espionage.
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:29.040]  What we have to understand again is this idea that the Communist Party reigns supreme.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:35.280]  It means those businesses ultimately are beholden to the Chinese government.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:41.640]  And so what happens when the Chinese government asks those businesses to engage in activity
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.280]  contrary to U.S. interests?
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.520]  Those businesses have a choice.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:50.800]  If they want to continue to do business, they basically follow the order of the Chinese
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.360]  government if they decide not to follow those orders.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:00.440]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.920]  law.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:06.840]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:10.760]  the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if game over.
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:15.920]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.880]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.840]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:27.840]  are truly independent.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:31.360]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.400]  It really is amazing.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:37.960]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:40.080]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.560]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:50.880]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswords.com, christenpana.com, because if you don't spread
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.560]  the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:54.560]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:06:20.960]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:27.480]  Welcome to the third hour of the Alex Jones show, I still have barely even gotten to all
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.720]  the news I want to cover.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:39.320]  I've got some great video clips I want to get to here, including just some really odd
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:46.080]  and strange behavior now coming out of some college leftist, nothing new, but always entertaining.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.680]  Billy Weaver is going to be joining me in the bottom half of the hour, she just filed
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:59.800]  a report, students react to Facebook, selling private messages, you know, it seems to be
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:08.120]  like a, people are like numb, the new generation, the younger generation, I think, boy, I mean,
[02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:14.160]  this is like a whole show, honestly, because I was right on the cusp of it before it like
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:21.040]  my generation was still like raised on books and like playing outside, but like the generation
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:29.400]  right below me, I mean, it is just screen time, cell phone, just total addiction, right
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.600]  when they're kids.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.600]  And so there's like a numbness, I think to the not having privacy, because you know anything
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:44.040]  you do on the internet is pretty much not private, I mean, but to talk about them selling
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.800]  your messages and stuff, like I said, it's kind of past say like people don't really
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:47.800]  care.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:54.600]  It's time to highlight the criminal activity of these companies, lying under oath, I mean,
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:59.880]  when is it going to come out that that Facebook and Twitter and these people or someone at
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:04.680]  these people or someone involved in this is rigging the stock market.
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.680]  But we'll talk about that with Millie Weaver.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:13.480]  You know, I had Leo Zagami on yesterday, it was a great two segments I did with Leo,
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:21.000]  as always, and then news breaks just today.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.720]  More than 500 priests accused of sexual abuse, not yet publicly identified by the Catholic
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:35.160]  Church, the Illinois Attorney General finds 500 more than 500.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:50.280]  In fact, the number in this story from the Chicago Tribune, 690 priests, my God, my God.
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:59.720]  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't even LA Bishop resigns 13 years after church learned of sex life.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:00.720]  You know what?
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:01.720]  Let's roll the video.
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:02.720]  I think we have it.
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:09.840]  This really hurts me, so we don't have it, guys.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:14.440]  Okay, well, you know what, that's probably better.
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:19.680]  But it's basically a St. Louis Archbishop saying he didn't know having sex with a child
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:21.080]  was a crime.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.760]  You know what, that's fine that we don't have it because I can't handle this stuff,
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.760]  honestly.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.400]  And then for it to be tied to my hometown of St. Louis, even hurts more.
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:37.400]  And then for Chicago, it's like the brother city of St. Louis is just, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.920]  Need to get my head off of that.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:48.320]  So people are now learning that the bill to fund, and you know, I'm actually glad that
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.280]  we freaked out about this because this is how you keep Trump from doing this crap.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:58.680]  And he can be upset with Ann Coulter or whatever for calling him out, and that's fine.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:04.280]  But it's good that we call President Trump out when we see things happening in our government
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:10.760]  that he can stop, like giving $10 billion to Central America for economic development
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.440]  when we don't get crap.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.400]  I mean, what happens to all the billions of dollars of aid we send to these Central American
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:18.840]  companies to build their infrastructure?
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:23.640]  They get nothing, and then they send, honestly, the number is staggering.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.080]  But I mean, folks, you're talking about in the last 30 years, 50% of Central America
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.520]  basically trying to migrate to the United States.
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:40.760]  In fact, I've got a couple stories that actually kind of go along with this.
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:46.520]  For example, US population grew at slowest pace in more than 80 years, but there's a
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:49.160]  silver lining to this.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.200]  What this means is that Americans are no longer having kids.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.680]  What this means is that the Americans are not having kids.
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:03.480]  The population is being replaced by migrants from the Middle East and from Central America,
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:06.080]  and it's all part of a Democrat operation to get more votes.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:11.960]  But Alex Jones is joining us on the phone right now with the latest breaking news.
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.240]  Alex Jones, what is the latest?
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:19.440]  I just wanted to pop in because I've been listening often on my travel and my family,
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:23.120]  my wife, dad, and we've got power for the broadcast.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.480]  I want to say in time, we're in.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.760]  Trump has said he's not going to sign the big bill, first thing he showed the government
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:36.120]  down, but actually the Democrats have set the border down, and so Trump did not blink.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:42.440]  He's saying he's not going to sign it, and again, Trump has been to the interviews, saying
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.000]  that he thinks he'll be an uprising, so they try to take him out of office, and then you
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.080]  hear about the sources, multiple sources, that he thinks he'll be an armed uprising.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:55.200]  Think about what a crazy time in American history this is.
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.000]  Now, there's lots of sound, the center of the fake question problem, sitting right in
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.920]  our office while they have to talk the story of the country as a distraction from all the
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:06.320]  things the globalists are doing.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.360]  It's just surreal that this is happening, and then the audience, what's saying that
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:13.360]  message?
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  It's where I'm at.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.360]  It's myself.
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.640]  But the audience of this broadcast is literally the American resistance.
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:25.040]  The world resistance, the heart of the resistance, the globalists, it's just how obvious it is
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:28.040]  when you get out of the new world war.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:34.200]  The pedophile groups are literally running the whole globalist operation, and every rock
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.800]  we turn over, every major institution's run by them, and then now they have drag queens,
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  11-year-olds dancing at day strip bars, having money thrown out of them.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:46.800]  I mean, it's just nothing these globalists won't do.
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:51.320]  It's like they're on a mad dog craze, cringy, and they're going to push and push and push
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  and always say no.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.280]  And that's why we talk about what's going to happen when they kill Trump for removing.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:02.080]  And then he pulls out of Syria like he said he would do three years ago in the campaign,
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.000]  and they call him a traitor, and it was Obama, the Democrats created ISIS, and what a man.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.760]  I mean, it is just unbelievable how bad the globalists are and how stupid they think we
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:12.760]  are now.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:13.760]  They think we have no memory.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:17.320]  As the president pointed out, he said, always campaign to do this, and why should we be
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:19.200]  arming the Turks and attack Turkey?
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.480]  We need to analyze the world, not quickly describe it as your tension.
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:28.760]  So, it blows me away how mainstream media are especially cheaters, but how we really
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:33.200]  are on target film, the truth, that's why every day that takes me works like tears,
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.200]  we're liars, and we're bad.
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.200]  It's because they're bad.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:41.320]  And so, I just can't believe we're in epic fight, because there's not a lot of coldwars.com
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.360]  about President Trump, at least the deep state tries to remove him from office, okay, violent
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.720]  armed civil war, and that will win, let's not get to that point, but I think he's right
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:53.720]  as they go there.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:58.600]  So, it's just back to the great job of everybody in that rise of the coldwars.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.120]  The war room and everything coming up today, but the coldwars don't fall, the coldwars
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  don't fall, and there's more.com.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.120]  With the president's thinking, believe it will be an armed insurrection.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.120]  That is such a giant news.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.120]  The doctors are sources, because President's is armed revolts.
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  He's on the news saying there'll be a revolt, that means armed anyways.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:10.120]  So, this is all concerned, and because we're looking at it on the left with the allied
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:11.120]  with the group, it's such a clear, tight example of what we should choose.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:12.120]  So, everybody, now more than ever, this is the second American revolution.
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.120]  I can't believe we're critical every day, every week, yes.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:14.120]  And so, it's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.120]  It's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  And so, it's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  It's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.120]  It's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  It's not going to be a big deal.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.120]  There goes Alex Jones, thank you so much, Alex, and it's incredible to think about this.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  We're here having an American revolution.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.440]  I mean, the stock, 2018 was a bad year for the stock market, but you look at the overall
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.840]  growth since Trump, it's like up 5,000 still or something.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:01.720]  And that's just because the American economy is back to that level.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.120]  So yeah, you're going to see fluctuations now, but we're here having this American revolution.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:09.760]  The economy's booming again, unemployment record lows, millions of people getting off
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  welfare.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:11.760]  We're trying to have a border again.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:14.560]  You know, we're trying to figure some stuff out.
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:16.200]  And this is our American revolution.
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:18.040]  And then what do the Democrats do?
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.480]  What does the corporate media do?
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:25.360]  They want Central America to have its revolution and to replace the population in the United
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  States.
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:30.640]  They want the Middle East to have a revolution over there like the Arab Spring or bring a
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.760]  bunch of migrants over here or into Europe and then have regime change in Syria.
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:44.760]  So we want an American revolution, we're ready for 1776, 2.0, get on board or get run over.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:47.840]  President Trump is right.
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:55.360]  There will be an armed revolt if they try to take him out, don't even try it.

[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:30.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  the world.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:34.200]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:40.160]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.960]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:46.480]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:49.400]  The Deep State began with World War I.
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:56.520]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:00.200]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the falls
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.720]  they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:05.520]  That's what I'm talking about at M4WarsTour.com.

[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.240]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.240]  law.
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:06.640]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.680]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:15.720]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh, and Tucker Carlson
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.880]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:26.640]  There's only two groups in the U.S. M4Wars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:31.240]  are truly independent, and of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:33.200]  It really is amazing.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.480]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.800]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together, just remind you that you are the
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:45.360]  power, you're the strength, you're the will of M4Wars.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.680]  So please spread the links, M4Wars.com, NewsWars.com, ChrisNPata.com, because if you don't spread
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:53.360]  the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.360]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:20:24.200]  God bless you all, and thank you.
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.360]  I have stacks of news that I haven't got to today, and Millie Weaver is about to be joining
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:30.360]  us.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:34.960]  So I am going to bear down, focus, get through this news before Millie Weaver comes on.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:39.680]  She's got a report she just did talking about the illegal activity, what I believe is illegal
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:41.760]  activity by Facebook.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.960]  There are some reports out talking about what the government shutdown really means.
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:48.600]  I'm not going to get into the nuts and bolts and bore you with that, but be aware of all
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:50.800]  the fake news saying that, oh, it means this or that.
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.240]  It's truly not even a shutdown, quite frankly, I kind of wish it were.
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:00.080]  We already covered this, in fact, we'll cover this more with Millie, but the Democrat, I
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:01.360]  mean, folks, this is sober.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:09.000]  I can't even believe, every damn thing that the Democrats claim Trump did, they do, like
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  on record.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.920]  See, this is what happens to me.
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:17.480]  I'm on focus here, and I'm ready to plow through all this news, and then it just hits you.
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:22.560]  It's like, these people are total liars and total frauds, and the American media goes
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:23.560]  along with it.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:27.960]  And then I can't even focus and get to the rest of the news, because it's like, how do
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.800]  I awaken America?
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:36.000]  How do I open America's eyes to say, look at these damn Democrats, look at Bob Mueller
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:41.320]  claiming that the Russians are rigging social media for Trump, the Russians are colluding
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.320]  with Trump.
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:51.400]  They're the damn Democrats every time, on record.
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.400]  Sick of this, man.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:58.400]  Do I have to come on here every fricking day to show you how the Democrats, I mean, look
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:08.360]  at this, Hillary Clinton pays Fusion GPS through Perkins Cooey to get the Russian dossier,
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.680]  which came from Russian intelligence.
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:17.920]  That's literally the Clinton campaign getting Russian intelligence against Donald Trump.
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:19.680]  That's Russian collusion.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:26.160]  Then you have that dossier used by the Obama administration to spy on President Trump.
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.480]  That's Russian collusion.
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:35.800]  Then you have the Democrats making fake Facebook and social media accounts pretending to be
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:36.800]  Russians.
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.480]  They're all on record, and then the American media and Bob Mueller spend all their time
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:46.120]  and all their money pointing the finger at Trump when it's fricking them.
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:48.640]  And I have to come on here for two years.
[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:53.640]  For two years, I've been banging my head against the desk.
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.640]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:58.080]  It's honestly just unbelievable.
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:02.000]  President Trump just, you know what?
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.360]  I get what President Trump is doing.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:09.600]  And honestly, every day he waits, more people come to his side.
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:10.760]  These people are so corrupt, man.
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.280]  They're such criminals.
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:14.280]  They're such criminals.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:19.240]  And you have Vladimir Putin talking yesterday about the real threat we have right now of
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.880]  worldwide nuclear war.
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:23.280]  Why do you think he's talking about that?
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.600]  Not because Russia wants to blow anybody up.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:29.040]  Hell, not because even China wants to blow anybody up.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:36.240]  Because the deep state, the corrupt American political establishment is so desperate they
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:40.040]  would rather nuke America than see Trump succeed.
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:41.480]  Do you understand that?
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:42.960]  That's what Putin is talking about.
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:46.640]  And Russia's not going to sit idly by and let that happen.
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:53.640]  Oh, and you better believe pulling these troops out of Syria is going to help us avoid a war
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:56.640]  we don't want with Russia, folks.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:57.640]  I'm sorry for screaming.
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:04.440]  It's just like, and then Trump says we're going to pull the troops out of Syria and
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:11.920]  I tune into all American cable news and they're mad that Trump is bringing the troops home.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.640]  What is wrong with you?
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.800]  How much stock do these people own in Raytheon?
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:21.000]  You know what?
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.360]  How much stock does Lindsey Graham own in Raytheon?
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.880]  How much stock does Lindsey Graham own in Lockheed Martin?
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:33.160]  I mean, I just want to, every time there's a, oh, folks, this is so unbelievable.
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:41.760]  I mean, pretty much any time there's a rocket launch from Saudi Arabia or Israel or even
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:46.360]  the Middle East folks, it's made in America and Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and all these
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:52.120]  weapons manufacturers, they're making a hundred thousand bucks a pop.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.240]  You see why they want war in the Middle East?
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:56.480]  You see why we have to keep troops in the Middle East?
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:58.840]  You see why they want these never ending wars?
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:06.000]  It's all about money and you know people in Congress have interest in this.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.120]  You know people in the media have interest in this.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.640]  It's all sick.
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.640]  It's all sick to me.
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:16.600]  Oh, yeah, I'm stunned that Lockheed Martin stock went down now that Trump's pulling the
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:20.240]  troops out of Syria, stunning, stunning.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:22.640]  I bet you the same thing happened to Raytheon.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:23.760]  I haven't even seen these stocks.
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:26.200]  I bet you Raytheon dropped today too.
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:28.640]  Pull up the Raytheon stock today guys.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:33.760]  Probably bowing too.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:38.040]  And the American media complains that Trump is getting the troops out of Syria.
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:40.480]  You all make me sick.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:42.800]  Now Raytheon down big too.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.360]  I got to say you all, people that I think that aren't America's enemy that are on Fox
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:54.000]  News every day, upset, oh we can't pull out of Syria, bad move from Trump, we need the
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  troops there.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.480]  It could destabilize worth.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:58.040]  You people make me sick.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.400]  Why don't you go over there and fight for Syria's independence?
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:06.160]  Which by the way, see these people are so out of touch with the Valley.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:10.520]  There's actually more freedom and independence in the Middle East right now since Trump came
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:11.520]  in.
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:13.640]  You can blame Trump or say it's other factors, Russia, whatever.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.560]  ISIS is actually being depleted and it's probably mostly because you don't have Obama
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:20.320]  in office funding and arming them.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:25.800]  If you really want to know why ISIS has taken such a hit, it's not necessarily because we're
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:31.000]  fighting them more than we ever have, it's because we're not fricking funding them anymore.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.840]  People say oh and Obama funding ISIS, give me a break, 500, you know what, I want to
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:39.960]  say 1,000, I bet it was million, yeah bowing's down too.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:46.600]  Look up the story, President Obama wanted to give $500 million and they say, I think
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:52.680]  it was 500,000 or 500 million, they say moderate rebels, moderate rebels, you know who there's
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:27:01.800]  moderate rebels are folks, ISIS, all right.
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:06.640]  So we can fund that, luckily President Trump is not going to sign that bill that had us
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:09.000]  all panicked.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.840]  But you know what, this is actually the future of government right here.
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:19.480]  This right here is the future of government, this is where we need to go.
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:23.680]  So we can't get a wall from our president who promised it, we can't get a wall from
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.840]  the government who funds anything under the sun but not our own border.
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:38.400]  A veteran, a triple amputee, purple heart recipient, Brian Colfidge, excuse me, it was
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:44.000]  just two days ago, started a, we the people will fund the wall, go fund me account, $1
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.400]  billion goal, $4.5 million raised so far.
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.680]  This is the future of government right here.
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.560]  Instead of putting out a project that Democrats and Republicans and these bureaucrats and
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.440]  everybody gets to decide behind closed doors what gets funded, what doesn't, let's actually
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:07.880]  leave it to the people, let's put projects, it's over, it's a $6 million now, $6 million.
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.600]  This is the future of government, this is where we should go.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:16.680]  I'm done with the rigged voting, I'm done with Republican Democrat, all the crap they
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.640]  do sit up there debating and really at the end of the day they just care about in their
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:20.640]  own pocketbook.
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.480]  This is the future of government.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:25.720]  You want to fund a government project, you put it out there and you let the people fund
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:26.720]  it.
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:29.640]  How many people do you think would donate voluntarily to Planned Parenthood?
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:37.160]  Do you think Planned Parenthood would get $2 billion in government funding?
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:42.280]  Do you think Planned Parenthood would get $2 billion from U.S. taxpayers in four years
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.360]  if that was a voluntary thing?
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:47.800]  Course not, that's why they make you pay for it.
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:51.800]  The future of government, you put a project out on the Internet and you say do you want
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:55.760]  to pay for this or not, instead of stealing from us.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:59.480]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:05.280]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year and every day it's transforming more
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:07.840]  and more Americans into millionaires.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.720]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:13.720]  one of them.
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:17.280]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:20.600]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.760]  Join online at www.acs2018.com.
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:28.200]  This event is the first of its kind ever.
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:33.200]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel will reveal which cannabis stocks are primed to deliver
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:36.480]  life-changing windfalls in the weeks and months ahead.
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.920]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor, backing the hottest startups
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:45.520]  before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:50.880]  Join American Cannabis Summit online at www.acs2018.com.
[02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:51.880]  Attendance is free.
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:56.440]  That's www.acs2018.com.
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:30:00.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:01.520]  law.
[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:06.800]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:10.800]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:15.960]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:20.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:27.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Rudge of Rudge Report.com that are
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  truly independent.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.040]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:33.440]  Really is amazing.
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:37.720]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:40.120]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.

[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:54.600]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:56.600]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:59.040]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[02:31:56.200 --> 02:32:01.440]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:03.320]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:07.200]  So when you support Infowars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products
[02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:11.480]  at InfowarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting Infowars in free speech and
[02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:15.440]  standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:20.520]  standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:22.800]  in America to stand against these individuals.
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:26.960]  When you order products at InfowarsStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution,
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.600]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:32.640]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.760]  of a total store clearance.
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:37.240]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:32:37.240 --> 02:32:38.360]  Every order gets free shipping.
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:43.840]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding allows us to go into the
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:48.720]  new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:50.440]  just fight, but to expand.
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:53.320]  Whether on the march, the empire is on the run, I salute you all.
[02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:59.440]  Now please take action at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:09.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:15.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:18.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:20.800]  Millie Weaver is in studio with me.
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:27.760]  She has just filed a report talking to students about what has just been exposed from Facebook
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:33.000]  really lying to its customers and selling their private messages and data.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.560]  Here was Millie's report.
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:37.600]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.600]  I don't know.
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:40.760]  What do you mean?
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.880]  Will you let me read your private Facebook messages?
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:43.880]  I don't know.
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.880]  I wouldn't want you to, no.
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:45.880]  Why not?
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:46.880]  Because they're private.
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:57.000]  Recently, documents came out detailing how Facebook has been allowing big corporations
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.680]  to pay to have access to their users' private information.
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:07.280]  They even go so far as to allow Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada access
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.080]  to their users' private messages.
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:14.600]  That means they could write them or delete them or even read them.
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:18.920]  Let's go ask some of these students at UT whether or not they would let me read their
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:24.680]  private Facebook messages, given that Facebook is already letting all these other corporations
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.960]  read their private Facebook messages.
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:30.320]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:31.320]  No.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:34.160]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:35.160]  I know.
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.160]  Why not?
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:37.160]  Because they're private.
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:39.720]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.640]  They're private.
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:44.760]  That's probably some stuff you don't want to read in there.
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:48.280]  I don't really message on Facebook, but I'd say no.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.640]  Can I read your guys' private Facebook messages?
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:52.640]  No.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.640]  Sure.
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:55.960]  I would barely ever use Facebook.
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:56.960]  Sure.
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:57.960]  Yeah?
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:58.960]  You okay with that?
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:34:59.960]  Yep.
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:02.960]  And I can do whatever I want with the messages?
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:05.320]  I would say no.
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:07.880]  I don't have any private Facebook messages.
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:08.880]  I don't really use Facebook.
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:10.520]  Yeah, I don't have anything on there.
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:12.800]  I never use Facebook messages.
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:16.240]  I feel like it's just as personal sometimes as text messaging.
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.520]  So do you think that that's an odd request?
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.520]  Yeah.
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.200]  Do you think that that's kind of an unreasonable request?
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:23.520]  It's kind of weird.
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.240]  Why do you think that that's an unreasonable request?
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:28.640]  Because it's an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:32.880]  What do you say to the fact that it came out that Facebook has been allowing several big
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.040]  companies to have access to read your private messages?
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.120]  It makes me pretty upset because, you know, they're supposed to be private.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.120]  I feel like that could be an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:44.120]  I don't know.
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:45.760]  I don't think it's an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:47.560]  It's definitely a breach of trust.
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.560]  It's kind of horrifying.
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:49.560]  Yeah?
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:50.560]  Yeah.
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:51.560]  I mean, it's pretty crazy.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:53.280]  You really have like no privacy anymore.
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.360]  That's why I really don't use Facebook that much.
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:03.240]  Like, it is definitely a negative and definitely hinders like my one team to use Facebook.
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:07.920]  It's precisely why I don't put a lot of information on Facebook so that people can't access my
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:08.920]  information.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:11.120]  I don't really use Facebook that much, so it doesn't really affect me.
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:12.120]  I don't know.
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:13.120]  I guess it's not really an issue.
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:15.600]  I don't use Facebook Messenger at all.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:18.520]  Do you think that Facebook should be held accountable for this?
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:19.520]  Very much so.
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:20.520]  All right.
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:23.320]  So you can see the entire report from Millie Weaver, the stories at Infowars.com.
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.080]  Guys, go ahead and pull up that story so we can direct the audience where they can
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.840]  find the full video from Millie Weaver.
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.800]  Students react to Facebook selling private messages and, of course, your YouTube channel,
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:36.280]  your YouTube channel is still up millennial Millie with a ton of views over there, a ton
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:37.280]  of subscribers.
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:43.480]  So, Millie, the story is Facebook, and they've even said, oh, we're going to protect your
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.480]  private data.
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:46.480]  You know, you don't have to worry about us selling it.
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:47.480]  It's all good.
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:48.480]  It's all fine.
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.720]  And then the reports comes out, oh, wait, they were selling it, and they were selling
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:54.520]  it to the highest bidder, and anybody could basically get in there.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.520]  And there's other reports, too.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:59.280]  I mean, I got a whole stack of news when it comes to social media stuff we'll get to.
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:04.480]  But it seems to me that most of the people you talk to were either, A, just kind of not
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.800]  really interested in Facebook, or B, they were stunned that their messages were being
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:10.800]  sold.
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:12.600]  Yeah, a lot of them were very creeped out, Owen.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:16.760]  But what seemed to be interesting is amongst college students and young people, they don't
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.360]  really even see Facebook as something cool and trendy anymore.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:24.600]  Most of them don't even use Facebook, and those who go into social media tend to exercise
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:25.600]  caution.
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.000]  It's mostly going to be the millennials and Generation X that are the ones using Facebook
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.040]  and that are the ones who are going to have their data mostly being exposed because of
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:36.840]  these big corporations having access to them.
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:43.160]  Now Facebook did actually have an agreement with the FTC in 2011 that they had to give
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.840]  notice to their users if they were going to share any of their private information.
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:53.640]  So this is a breach of Facebook's agreement with the FTC, and the FTC could hold Facebook
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:54.940]  accountable for this.
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:57.520]  This is why we're seeing Facebook's stock plunged.
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:01.200]  Today, their stock has plunged almost around 10%.
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:05.240]  Look, I wouldn't want to be owning Facebook stock right now.
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:09.240]  It just does not seem like the company is looking very good in the future.
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:14.240]  Or maybe you were if you were doing insider trading with them, which some reports may
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:16.200]  indicate that's going on.
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:18.360]  But that's an interesting thing.
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:24.240]  I wonder if Facebook was smart enough, because you know what they do is they say, oh, click
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:28.680]  here to agree to the terms and conditions, it's like an 800-page textbook.
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.000]  Everybody ever knows what you could agree to.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.480]  You agree to be a bird feeder outside of Facebook's offices or something.
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:37.480]  You have no idea.
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:41.960]  So I wonder if they slipped something in there into some agreement that you click sign over
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:44.120]  and oh, now they can sell our rights.
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:47.960]  But it's like, would Facebook admit that, because that just shows you how underhanded
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:48.960]  they are?
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.960]  Well, it was a breach of trust, because like I said, that FTC agreement meant that they
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:56.240]  had to give notice if they were going to sell it to third parties.
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.800]  And what Facebook's trying to say is, oh, well, we didn't actually sell their data and
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:05.280]  private information, we just allowed companies to access it by paying us and contracting
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:06.280]  with us.
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.840]  One of the creepy things here is we have over 150 big corporations that all had access to
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:15.800]  private information, including private messages, contacts, everything that you possibly could
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.280]  get from Facebook.
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:22.000]  So the interesting thing here is all of this information floating around here from these
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.560]  big corporations going to eventually one day be compiled into the social credit score system,
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:31.960]  where private messages that you once shared with your friends over Facebook are now going
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:34.800]  to be impacting your social credit score.
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:36.360]  Is that what we're looking at?
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:40.560]  I think that that's definitely what we're looking at here, and that's kind of why you
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:43.800]  start to see big tech aligning itself with China.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:46.960]  But you know, this is kind of a story, Millie, that people don't really talk about.
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:48.040]  Now, there's a great story.
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:49.040]  The crew just pulled up.
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:51.560]  Facebook app loses a quarter of Americans.
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:53.160]  Facebook is actually in big trouble.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:59.120]  And there's this whole thing with the phenomenon of Facebook and this too big to fail notion.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.200]  But Facebook is actually in big trouble.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:04.880]  They've got huge fines that they've had to pay in Europe.
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:08.920]  They've got huge data breaches where they're breaking contracts in Europe, in America and
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:10.280]  all of this stuff.
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:11.280]  Stock is plunging.
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:12.280]  You just did the man on the street.
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:15.640]  Most people seem like they're uninterested in Facebook.
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.440]  Now you have even leftist liberals bragging about how they're deleting their Facebook.
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:23.080]  This is kind of a story that doesn't really get covered.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.400]  Facebook is actually perhaps in a lot of trouble right now.
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  Yes.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:29.560]  In fact, if you go see some of the most recent appearances, Mark Zuckerberg has been at,
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:34.480]  I mean, he's always kind of socially awkward, but he looks like, he looks like scared almost
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  now.
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:37.400]  Facebook is the next my space.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.280]  And what I'm going to say is this, look, I have had the privilege of talking with an
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.560]  insider that worked in intelligence for decades.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.240]  And months ago, just after Alex Jones was booted off of social media, this person reached
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.800]  out and said, look, the CIA, the intelligence agencies, they're the ones who even allowed
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:59.240]  Facebook and these social media big tech companies to exist and rise.
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:04.440]  They are going to tank the social media networks because they are a fail.
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:08.800]  They were originally put in for regime change like we saw with the Arab Spring, but they
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:10.520]  lost control of them.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:11.800]  They allowed Brexit to happen.
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:13.520]  They allowed Trump to be elected.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.840]  So now what are they going to do?
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:16.800]  They are going to tank Facebook.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.600]  That is why you're seeing all of these mainstream media outlets coming out against Facebook all
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:21.600]  at once.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:27.160]  There have been so many mainstream media articles we saw CNBC, CNN, several of these saying,
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:28.320]  delete your Facebook account.
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:30.000]  Here's how you can delete your Facebook account.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.040]  You've got MSNBC host bragging about it and everything.
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:34.040]  Yes.
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:36.720]  So I'm not saying Facebook is a good guy here or some kind of a victim.
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.000]  What I'm saying here is that these are all sharks and they're all trying to bid for power
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.200]  place here.
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.960]  If you want to look at the history of this social media operation they had going on,
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.920]  you look back into DARPA.
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:54.200]  When DARPA first started with a project called LifeLog, LifeLog was essentially going to
[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:57.160]  track everything people did.
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:02.920]  I mean, it was going to be this huge database run by the military industrial complex.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:04.200]  The people found out about it.
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:10.440]  A lot of libertarian organizations and civil liberty organizations came out against it,
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:11.760]  tried to sue over it.
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.160]  So in 2004, they stopped it and they canceled LifeLog.
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:18.520]  Well guess what else popped up in 2004?
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.520]  Facebook.
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:20.520]  Yeah.
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:24.200]  All they did was transfer LifeLog into Facebook, into the private sector.
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:26.840]  They allowed Facebook to exist for regime change.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:28.000]  They lost control of it.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  Now they're going to take it.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  Exactly.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.480]  You pivot it to make it like a social media trendy thing even though it's just a huge
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:39.160]  data collection base and this is all on record and people are starting to realize this now.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:41.440]  But it's a basic question.
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:46.120]  How did Facebook and Twitter get all the money to become so powerful?
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:49.280]  How did they get all the money for the bandwidth and the storage and everything?
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:55.360]  I mean, people don't even think where and how did Facebook and Twitter get so powerful?
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:59.400]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:00.400]  law.
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.840]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:08.880]  the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS.
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:09.880]  It's game over.
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:14.880]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:19.120]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:25.760]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:26.760]  are truly independent.
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:30.360]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:32.320]  It really is amazing.
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.600]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:39.920]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together, just remind you that you are the
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:44.480]  power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:49.320]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:52.480]  you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:53.720]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.200]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:59.240]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.480]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.400]  It literally dumps the population down.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.560]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:13.560]  gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.440]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:20.360]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:25.200]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:26.200]  That's been incredible.
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.560]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.280]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:41.280]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:47.840]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:50.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:51.920]  discovery.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:56.320]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:01.520]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:03.440]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:07.320]  So when you support M4 Wars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:12.040]  at m4warstore.com, you are literally not just supporting M4 Wars in free speech and standing
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.280]  in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:21.400]  for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:22.920]  to stand against these individuals.
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:27.040]  When you order products at m4warstore.com, you fund not just an American revolution,
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:28.760]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:32.800]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:34.920]  of a total store clearance.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:37.400]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:38.520]  Every order gets free shipping.
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:44.000]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance and that funding allows us to go into the
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:48.880]  new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.600]  just fight, but to expand.
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:52.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:53.400]  I salute you all.
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:56.640]  Now please take action at m4warstore.com.
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:59.040]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:03.160]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:05.520]  get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:19.720]  All right, we're discussing the future of Facebook and social media.
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:21.560]  There's all kinds of different angles to cover here.
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:29.440]  The censorship angle, the lying under oath angle, the stock market, pump and dump angle,
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:30.440]  there's all this stuff.
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:36.760]  When it comes to the privacy issue, this is some crazy stuff that's going on.
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:42.200]  Amazon Error allowed Alexa user to eavesdrop on another home.
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:50.760]  And see, a story like this, you have to understand, Millie, if this can happen by mistake, this
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:57.040]  can happen on purpose, and people can figure out how to hack into your Amazon, whatever,
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:58.720]  and listen to your conversations.
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:01.640]  Maybe it's your neighbor, maybe it's the government, maybe it's Jeff Bezos.
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:07.320]  The point is, these things in your home, they are a recording device.
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:08.320]  That is a fact.
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.560]  In fact, there's already stories about how intelligence agencies and bureaucracies are
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.400]  going to these companies like Apple, and they're actually pulling, they're going and pulling
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:21.720]  conversations that were recorded on certain devices.
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:23.320]  That's extremely creepy, Owen.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:27.440]  At what point in the future, I mean, this might sound a little dystopic, but at what
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:31.640]  point in the future are you going to be driving along in your smart car, and all of a sudden
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.960]  your car tells you, you can't use those words.
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:35.000]  Well, the smart car will be driving for you.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  You're not allowed to drive.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.360]  Well, you're sitting in your smart car as it's driving you to your destination, and
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:43.120]  you're having a conversation with your friends, and then your smart car says, sorry, those
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:46.800]  words aren't permitted, we're going to start finding you, and you're losing the money that
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:49.920]  you have to feed your children because you keep using words that aren't allowed.
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:53.040]  And your social credit score just went down, so the car just stopped, and now you have
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.040]  to walk.
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:55.040]  Exactly, right?
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:56.040]  No cars.
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.040]  Sorry.
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:00.320]  Because that's what a lot of these leftist trendies here in Austin have been promoting
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:03.920]  all these car share programs where nobody even owns a car.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.360]  You actually just use one up like an Uber, and it comes and gets you and takes you to
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:11.880]  your destination so that we can all be green and environmental.
[02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:17.040]  This is kind of a side issue, but how about all of these scooters?
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:18.040]  Where do they come from?
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:19.040]  I saw that.
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  Who owns these things?
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.520]  There's like thousands of scooters, no seriously, strung about the city.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.440]  People just throw them in the middle of the road, or people get on these scooters and
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:32.240]  they're just like, and they just drive right in front of traffic, and it's like, what the
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  hell?
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:37.280]  Yeah, we're seeing this pop up along Blue Cities.
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:39.560]  It's more of that move towards Agenda 21.
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:40.560]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:42.960]  I mean, even in Austin, they've banned homes.
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.560]  You can't build homes now.
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.840]  In Austin, you have to build high rise apartments and housing.
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:51.920]  This is Agenda 21, it's what the Democrats want.
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.600]  They want to just bring in all of these illegal immigrants from Mexico or wherever.
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:01.040]  And the problem with that is that most of these people don't even have high school
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:08.040]  education and right now with technology, automation, we are actually needing more skilled workers
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:13.440]  that are having education and tech backgrounds, especially so like the people from India are
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:18.400]  coming to Austin and they're able to get high tech jobs because those jobs are available.
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:24.440]  What happens when there's no more really industrial worker jobs, yet we have this massive influx
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:27.160]  of industrial workers coming from third world nations?
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:28.160]  Well, it's all written.
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:30.160]  We're just going to have a huge burden on our hands.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:34.200]  And this is all written into legislation where they literally say, okay, we're going to
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:39.600]  bring in 100,000 college graduates from India and to work at these companies.
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:43.080]  You know, people talk about how they're trying to turn Texas into California.
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:49.320]  Millie, Austin is like, honestly, the city of Austin is about one year away from being
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:50.820]  San Francisco.
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:53.600]  And now they have the Apple headquarters coming here.
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:58.280]  They're expecting, I think the number was 100,000 jobs in this one Apple campus.
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:50:59.280]  It's going to be downtown.
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:00.560]  They're not building any new houses.
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:04.600]  They're not expanding the reach of Austin city limits.
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:06.880]  They're just compacting everything more into downtown.
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:13.040]  So more traffic, like I said, more high rises, more congestion, more population density.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:18.320]  And then Austin just slowly turns into San Francisco under the Democrat leadership.
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:22.400]  I strategically try to avoid traffic in this town.
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:25.480]  But I'm telling you, I think Austin, this is, this is so bad.
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:31.320]  Well, this is why so many Americans are aware of the fact that we need a wall because Austin
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:36.360]  is another area that has been affected by illegal immigration and this is a great city.
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:41.480]  This is a great, beautiful city that's not torn to shreds with, you know, feces and needles
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:42.480]  on the streets.
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:45.640]  There's some, you know, homeless issues and poverty issues.
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:46.800]  It's pretty much condensed.
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:49.000]  And most of the reason of that is actually, you can look this up.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.040]  This is one of the craziest things.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:54.600]  The city of Houston and the city of San Antonio and the city of Dallas, literally three years
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:58.480]  ago, bust their entire homeless population in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:58.480 --> 02:51:59.480]  It's incredible.
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:00.480]  You can look at the homeless numbers.
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:04.440]  Three years ago, in all those cities shot right down, Austin, Texas shot right up.
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:05.640]  But so that's one issue.
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:10.240]  But the point is it's only going to get worse.
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:14.080]  And the more they congest it, the traffic's going to get worse.
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:18.480]  It just sucks because this is a great, beautiful city, great infrastructure, new buildings,
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:20.240]  actually a booming economy.
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:24.320]  And they're going to turn it into San Francisco and it's just going to suck.
[02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:25.320]  And you want to even build it.
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.920]  You can't even drive across town in this city.
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:30.480]  Honestly, if you want to drive across town in the city, let's say 10 miles, it's going
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:35.760]  to take you 45 minutes and you're just praying to God that you don't hit a pothole big enough,
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:37.920]  you know, 500 times that bust your axle.
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:42.560]  Yeah, because the cities are taking that funding, the public funding that should be going towards
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:47.320]  potholes and they're putting them towards sanctuary cities and all these other Democrat
[02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:48.320]  run-
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:50.720]  Or Planned Parenthood gets a rent for a dollar, like, oh.
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:53.320]  But somehow we can't get our government to fund the wall.
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:58.000]  I mean, I know Trump said that we're going to have Mexico pay for it, but there's ways
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.240]  to have Mexico pay for it on the back end here.
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:05.880]  We could pay for it up front with our tax dollars and then have Mexico pay for it through
[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:08.320]  trade tariffs in the long run.
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:13.720]  Now I wanted to say something, Owen, I am just absolutely stunned with the support
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:16.720]  with this GoFundTheWall campaign on GoFundMe.
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:18.480]  This has been quite miraculous.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:21.640]  I think it's already up to about what, $6 million?
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.080]  And it's still the number one trend on, what are right now?
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:26.120]  Like three days old, I think, like 72 hours maybe?
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:28.880]  But really today, it's just skyrocketed.
[02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:31.400]  Which means tomorrow it's probably going to be even a bigger skyrocket.
[02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:32.600]  I mean, what do you think, Owen?
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:34.960]  Do you think that we're going to reach the goal here?
[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:37.920]  A million dollars is a really big goal to try to reach.
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:38.920]  Yeah.
[02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:40.560]  Well, a billion dollars.
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:41.800]  I do not.
[02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:44.040]  I'd be stunned if we could reach a billion dollars.
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:50.360]  To me, this is just an exercise in showing the world and President Trump we're behind
[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:51.360]  the wall.
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:52.360]  We'll fund the wall.
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:58.080]  See, doesn't this, this is the perfect actually paradox because here you have our elected
[02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:03.520]  leaders in government screwing us sideways, not giving the voters anything they want.
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:06.200]  And we literally have to take matters into our own hands.
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:11.000]  I say, shut the government down, shut the whole damn government down, let's just fund
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:12.000]  everything privately.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.160]  Well, because even the one billion dollar goal is not enough to build the full wall.
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:18.960]  I think we're looking at about five billion to fund the wall.
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:20.800]  So this would just be a start.
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:25.440]  And here's the thing, Owen, actually they're saying that if every person that voted for
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:29.480]  Trump gave $80, they could reach this goal here.
[02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:30.480]  So it is a possibility.
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:35.000]  And I've been seeing a lot of people dropping about $100 or so on average.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.560]  And there is a maximum of about 50,000 to donate.
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:45.920]  So if we start seeing big players here, big business owners, wealthy people jumping in,
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.080]  celebrities like Kid Rock, who knows, they start throwing money in the pot here.
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:53.640]  We could see Americans reach this goal and this could actually speak volumes.
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:56.360]  You know, and here's my frustration and I'll just put it all out there.
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:01.720]  I'm not going to donate to this fund because I'm ticked off that I even have to I have
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:08.120]  I have proposed legislation to give $10 billion taxpayer dollars to Central America.
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:14.360]  But I have to fund a wall that we need for national security out of my own pocket voluntarily.
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:18.840]  Just as an issue, I can't even do that because it just it just feels so wrong.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:21.520]  But let me just because because just kind of highlight this.
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:26.360]  Well, I'll donate to it because honestly, I think that the American people need this
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:27.360]  wall.
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:31.080]  I think it's something that's going to benefit benefit of all personally.
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:33.920]  If the government shuts down, then maybe I'll contribute.
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:34.920]  If the government shut down.
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:39.040]  Well, the good news here is that if I'm pretty sure how GoFundMe works is if you don't
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:40.040]  refund it, yes.
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:43.600]  If they don't reach the goal, you'll get refunded, you'll get your money back.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:48.080]  So you know, it's just, are you willing to put up the money or you're not surprised that
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:50.120]  GoFundMe, it may still happen.
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:53.400]  They could shut this down for being racist and bigoted and xenophobic.
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:56.560]  That could be just around the corner and that's no joke.
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.560]  But look at this to kind of go back to the issue of Austin turning into California here,
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:02.240]  which just breaks my heart.
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.160]  You know, I'm not from here, but moving here, it's a beautiful city.
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:09.880]  California cops frustrated with sanctuary laws, stopping them from working with ICE
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:11.400]  over twice-deported criminals.
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:15.600]  So again, just non-citizens here illegally get more government protection than the citizens
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:17.120]  that pay for everything.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:21.200]  You have Democrats dancing at a DC bar, getting drunk, celebrating how they denied the American
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.960]  people what they need, what they want.
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:26.200]  And by the way, so here's California.
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:30.600]  It's the richest state as far as the richest area codes in the United States.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:33.880]  It has 40 of the 50 top richest area codes.
[02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:38.680]  It also has the most poverty, most homelessness, most drug-ridden, feces-ridden streets.
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:43.960]  And now it's just come out, it's also the least dead last when it comes to education.
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.700]  That's what you get from a California city.
[02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:51.560]  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, the dumb get dumber, and you get nothing.
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:54.640]  And then this also ties into the California-Texas thing.
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:57.080]  New York leads nation and population loss.
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:03.200]  These are tax exoduses happening because of Democrat states like New York and California
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:07.240]  that now are finally paying their fair share of taxes for the first time in decades because
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:11.200]  they don't have the, we don't have to pay the federal tax.
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:14.480]  So now they're all leaving those states that they're destroying, and then they're coming
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:17.520]  to conservative states like Texas and Utah.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:21.520]  So they're gonna destroy all the wealth and economic prosperity of our states after they
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:22.520]  destroyed there.
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:24.800]  Oh yeah, and then they'll come here and they'll vote Democrat.
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:31.880]  So the Democrats can come in and put the high taxes and the bad policies in to destroy Texas.
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:37.800]  And it just sucks, man, because, I mean, can't we just have one state, can't we just have
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:42.480]  one place that the Democrats don't destroy, can I have one city with beautiful infrastructure
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:45.320]  that the left doesn't destroy, just one?
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:49.360]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  law.
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:55.760]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.520]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.840]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:08.960]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:15.760]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:16.760]  are truly independent.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:20.400]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.320]  It really is amazing.
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:26.600]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:29.000]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:34.480]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:39.440]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prismpana.com, because if you
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.480]  don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:43.480]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:58:43.480 --> 02:58:45.480]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:51.000]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.200]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with Infowars.
[02:58:54.200 --> 02:58:58.040]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts, they even know we had like Infowars stores
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:02.360]  that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that
[02:59:02.360 --> 02:59:06.240]  I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:09.760]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:59:09.760 --> 02:59:14.600]  and the world back from the brink, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:17.480]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.480 --> 02:59:20.560]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:21.560]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:25.520]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:27.520]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:28.800]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:31.680]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:35.720]  But you've got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter.
[02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:38.040]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:43.160]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at foreshore.com
[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:49.840]  to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.840 --> 03:00:04.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:09.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:11.120]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:17.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.920 --> 03:00:20.920]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:20.920 --> 03:00:26.320]  All right, last segment with Millie Weaver here and then I'm going to check out and
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:27.320]  get ready for the War Room.
[03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:29.360]  Matt Bracken is going to take over, folks.
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:35.920]  We have just extended the Christmas sales at Infowarsstore.com to the new year.
[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:38.800]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take advantage of all the great specials.

[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:49.720]  health.
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:50.720]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:53.120]  It's how everything we do here is made possible.
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:55.880]  Free t-shirt with every order, free shipping store wide.
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:59.160]  All right, Millie and I are just going to kind of hit some topics here and just banter
[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:00.560]  back and forth.
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:03.080]  This was a story that just came out today.
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.680]  Survey one in four adults, check phone less than a minute after waking up.
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:09.000]  I'd be shocked if it's not more than this.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  I know I fall into this category.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.640]  In fact, what I decided to do, Millie, to try to make this into a positive thing, because
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:15.640]  I just can't help it.
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:20.520]  It's like, I just want to get info as soon as I wake up, you know, check, you know how
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:21.520]  it goes.
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:22.520]  You're in the same business.
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:23.520]  Exactly.
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:27.160]  But what I did to try to kind of mitigate the negative side effect of this is I installed
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:29.120]  a Bible app on my phone.
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:32.720]  So now when I go to my phone, the first thing I do is actually read the Bible instead of
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.320]  like checking my Twitter messages or who's adding me or go to Drudge Report or something
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:38.320]  like that.
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:43.000]  I think it does just lend credence to the fact that these apps and more so even your
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  cell phone is addicting.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  I mean, it is an addicting thing.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  Exactly.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:50.640]  And, you know, there have been several studies that have come out that says that Facebook
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.960]  usage is linked with depression and other mental health issues because what happens
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:00.320]  is people go on these social media sites and they don't get the likes they were hoping
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:02.320]  or expecting or the comments they were hoping or expecting.
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.320]  Or they see what they see.
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:04.320]  They see their hero that looks amazing.
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:05.320]  Exactly.
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:08.480]  They see fake boobs, fake makeup, fake hair, fake life.
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:10.640]  It's like, oh, why isn't everybody that happy?
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:14.880]  Well, because everyone's just posting, look at me, look how great my life is.
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.360]  And then everyone in reality is depressed because they're using social media.
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:24.200]  And I don't know about you, Owen, but I've noticed that I've kind of lost touch with
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:27.720]  a lot of like my school friends and high school friends in a way because of social
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:30.560]  media because everyone can just look at each other's lives.
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:33.000]  Nobody really feels the need to pick up a phone and call.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:34.200]  Or like visit even.
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:35.200]  Or even visit.
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:36.200]  Even with family.
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:37.200]  Yeah, interesting.
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:38.200]  It's not good.
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:43.240]  One of the things I wanted to touch on here with Facebook though and Twitter is that recently
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:48.600]  Facebook and Twitter just deleted a bunch of accounts that had, they're claiming these
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:54.040]  accounts were spreading fake news that could influence the Bangladesh elections.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:56.680]  Just 10 days before the Bangladesh elections.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:02.400]  So this just goes to show that Facebook is engaging in election meddling, not just in
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:04.640]  America but in other countries as well.
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:08.200]  Which you reported on Sheryl Sandberg admitting that in her hearing.
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:09.200]  Yeah.
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:10.200]  And who knows what the fake news is.
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:11.720]  I mean, who decides what's fake news?
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:12.720]  They're fake news.
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:17.760]  I call her big mother because she literally sounded like big brother but a female version.
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:19.680]  And didn't she put that vibe off too?
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:22.200]  Like she had that vibe, that domineering.
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:24.360]  Yes, it was so creepy.
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:25.360]  She's big mother.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:30.200]  She sat there and said, we will make sure that we censor and crack down on fake news.
[03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:31.200]  That is big mother.
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:32.200]  It is big mother.
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:33.200]  She's big mother.
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:34.560]  She's making a big mother.
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:37.120]  A sweatshop firing on all cylinders.
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:39.800]  What it's like to work at Amazon during Christmas.
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:41.520]  That's from The Guardian.
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:42.520]  So that's nice.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:49.360]  By the way, the Justice Department charges Chinese nationals an extensive global hacking
[03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:50.360]  campaign.
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:52.040]  So they make this whole thing about Russia, Millie.
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:53.040]  It's China.
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:55.200]  China is the one with the back door and the cell phones.
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:56.840]  China is the one buying up Apple.
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:00.120]  China is the one stealing intellectual property from the United States by spying on us.
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:01.280]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:03.720]  And then they say, oh, Russia is the boogeyman.
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:05.720]  Russia is just minding its own business.
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:08.800]  China is the one hacking and stealing everything.
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:14.680]  These big tech companies are more capable of engaging in election meddling and rigging
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:16.320]  than the Russians.
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:22.480]  My goodness, even Sundar Pichai said it was only what, $4,700 that these supposed Russian
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:25.320]  accounts put towards election meddling.
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:26.320]  Give me a break.
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:27.320]  That's nothing.
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:32.320]  This is a multi-billion-dollar corporation that has the ability to spy on every American,
[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:37.480]  including our politicians, and then try to sway people to go look at certain articles
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:40.440]  that say, woo-hoo, vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:45.880]  Well, in case you thought things were crazy, the winner of CNN's journalist of the year
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:48.320]  is a known liar on record.
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:54.400]  And the Financial Times man of the year is George Soros, so that's what we get.
[03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:58.440]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.440]  law.
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:04.840]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:07.920]  the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS.
[03:05:07.920 --> 03:05:08.920]  It's game over.
[03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:13.920]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:18.120]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:24.800]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that
[03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:25.800]  are truly independent.
[03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:29.400]  And, of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:31.360]  It really is amazing.
[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:35.640]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:38.040]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:05:38.040 --> 03:05:43.520]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:48.360]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if
[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:51.520]  you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:05:51.520 --> 03:05:52.520]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:05:52.520 --> 03:06:17.800]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:22.600]  Okay, I've got the rest of the hour and we will be taking some phone calls in a little
[03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:23.600]  while.
[03:06:23.600 --> 03:06:35.400]  So the call in numbers to the studio are 877-789-2539, also known as 877-789-ALIX.
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:40.160]  But I'm sure that folks already have those numbers on speed dial, so we'll be watching
[03:06:40.160 --> 03:06:42.760]  that fill up pretty quick.
[03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:49.440]  I wanted to finish a few thoughts, I was watching Owen and Millie, and one of the final comments
[03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:56.840]  was about what was the value of the Russian meddling in American social media, and you
[03:06:56.840 --> 03:07:03.600]  think how do you put a monetary value on Google, YouTube, which is the same company, Facebook
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:08.840]  and Twitter, slanting their algorithms against conservatives.
[03:07:08.840 --> 03:07:13.520]  And they can literally dial your volume down to 1%, so that none of your followers see
[03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:14.520]  your tweets.
[03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:18.160]  I mean, what's the monetary value that would be put on that?
[03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:23.960]  I mean, it's incalculable, and it's just ho-hum, no problem, it's a private business.
[03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:29.960]  If they want to turn down the volume on the conservatives, that's up to them.
[03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:34.960]  You probably've already heard this, I was banned six months out of the last year, six
[03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:37.680]  different 30-day Facebook bans.
[03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:40.480]  So I self-censored there like crazy.
[03:07:40.480 --> 03:07:46.960]  Was kicked off of Twitter completely for an anti-Burka meme that didn't even name a religion.
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:53.880]  Now Twitter is so bad that they get regated by Muslims who call somebody an Islamophobe,
[03:07:53.880 --> 03:07:56.440]  and the next thing you know, you're off of Twitter.
[03:07:56.440 --> 03:08:04.720]  So we can see the writing on the wall, liberal big social media is going the way of Myspace,
[03:08:04.720 --> 03:08:10.640]  and the thing to do is spread your internet action around, you know, get an alternative
[03:08:10.640 --> 03:08:19.880]  social media like Freezoxy, Gab, use Bitshoot, use Vimeo, use Brideon.
[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:27.280]  Try not to use the big brother networks that are basically a backdoor for the CIA and NSA.
[03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:32.720]  Anybody that didn't think that their private messages were being tracked all along is crazy.
[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:38.880]  The only surprise I guess is that it was part of their advertising package to the big corporations.
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:45.920]  But I mean, let's face it, Facebook, Google, YouTube, they didn't just appear overnight.
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:52.000]  Warehouses full of servers, you know, drawing hydroelectric dams worth of power, nuke plants
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:58.680]  worth of power, they didn't self-fund, you know, they didn't spring up organically.
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:05.320]  Anybody that's tried to get a big social media project going knows it costs a fortune, and
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:07.440]  it takes a hell of a lot of power.
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:12.600]  So anybody that thinks that Facebook just miraculously found the money as it went along
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:13.880]  is crazy.
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:21.560]  These things were paid for and funded by the deep state as an intelligence gathering tool.
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:25.800]  In terms you need to know our data mining, obviously that's been around, but social
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:31.720]  network analysis is also really key, even if you don't use social media much.
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:38.600]  The computers today can crunch all of your contacts in real time, your credit card use,
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:41.680]  things that you're saying that your cell phone is overhearing.
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:44.440]  These were all being stored and data crunched.
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:49.040]  If big brother ever decides to come after us, it's going to be real easy.
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:54.640]  They'll be able to make a list from, you know, the biggest enemy of the state down to, you
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:10:01.400]  know, any number you can calculate, tools that Stalin, Mao, Hitler, they never had tools
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:02.400]  like that.
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:08.200]  So, you know, we had better stay on top of this because there's a real monster growing
[03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:13.520]  in our midst, and right now it's a friendly monster or at least it's not chewing our arm
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:19.360]  off at the present time, you know, like it would be in China with a social credit system.
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:24.560]  But when it ever wanted to, if this government ever turned tyrannical, you can bet that
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:32.040]  the bad comrades would have their cell phones shut down, their ATM access denied, and it
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:33.480]  will all happen in a blink.
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:39.000]  All of these tools are already being built, and you just know that it's coming.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:44.400]  So like I said, try to, as much as possible, I mean, I still post on Facebook, but mainly
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:48.280]  as a way to steer people towards other social media.
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:56.040]  I mean, let's face it, it's the 500-pound gorilla along with, fate with YouTube and,
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:10:57.320]  of course, Google.
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:02.760]  I use DuckDuckGo in a lot of ways, it's not as good as Google, it can't compare to Google
[03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:08.480]  Maps, but as soon as you allow Google Maps a presence in any, you know, when your phone
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:12.880]  or in your computer, it becomes a personal tracking device.
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:16.600]  Even when your phone is off, it's tracking where you're going.
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:21.080]  It can tell whether you're walking, driving, standing still, I mean, it knows how long
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:22.800]  you've been everywhere.
[03:11:22.800 --> 03:11:27.840]  And just imagine trying to, you know, run a gorilla outfit against a tyrannical government
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:31.040]  when they've already got these tools in existence.
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:36.640]  Then the question will become, who is actually going to carry out the arrests?
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:41.240]  It's easy enough for artificial intelligence to make a list of people, but, you know, for
[03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:44.440]  now, robots can't go door-to-door picking people up.
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:48.840]  Eventually, it's going to have to be federal law enforcement agents that are going to be
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:51.600]  doing this door-to-door roundup business.
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:53.880]  And that's what it's going to get pretty ugly.
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:12:00.960]  You know, right now in the state of New Jersey, they just passed a law that it's now illegal
[03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:07.200]  to possess a magazine for a rifle or pistol that holds more than 10 rounds.
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:13.080]  That means virtually every modern carbine has no means of loading it, of using it.
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:18.920]  That means that every modern semi-automatic pistol, almost every except for a few backup
[03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:23.960]  pistols, has a standard magazine that carries 15 or more rounds.
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:25.800]  They're all illegal today.
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:28.280]  It's a felony to possess it.
[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:33.000]  Nobody's turning them in, so there's now a huge backlog of, you know, millions of New
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.760]  Jersey felons that are just wondering what the hell's going to happen next.
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:45.640]  And when you combine that with these red flag laws in Florida, they call it an RPO, a risk
[03:12:45.640 --> 03:12:47.440]  protection order.
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:54.280]  You can imagine it's going to be pretty easy either for an ex-girlfriend or an employee
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:57.720]  to swat you because they know you've been to the range with you.
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:03.640]  They know you're a shooter, and they're going to say, a Joe Blow on Elm Street is terrorizing
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:04.640]  the neighborhood.
[03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:06.760]  He's aiming his AR-15 out the window.
[03:13:06.760 --> 03:13:11.040]  The next thing, you know, there's the SWAT team at the door, and Joe might have some
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:13.680]  30-round mags in his basement.
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:17.360]  We're gearing up for some rough times ahead if this happens.
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:23.920]  So I expect New Jersey to be right on the cutting edge of where any of this blowback
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:25.600]  might happen.
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:31.000]  But realistically, it's going to have to come down to law enforcement.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:34.960]  Are the police going to say, hell no, I'm not going door to door, you know, looking
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:39.400]  for 30-round or 15-round magazines, I'm just not going to do it.
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:44.360]  These things were legal for the last 100 years, and they were legal last month.
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:50.000]  Suddenly it's a felony to possess these things, and without them, everybody's carbines and
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.680]  pistols are useless.
[03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:57.360]  So if police officers in New Jersey, you know, really care about the oath they swore to uphold
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:01.280]  and defend the Constitution, they won't go along with these laws.
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:07.040]  But I kind of suspect that, like in most places, Britain, Germany, the police will very willingly
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:13.720]  become the stasi, and they will go door to door arresting Americans, basically for no
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:18.560]  reason other than that they don't believe in the Second Amendment in New Jersey.
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:23.520]  So these are some of the flashpoints that we're going to expect to see coming ahead
[03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:25.240]  in the next few months.
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:31.680]  Just imagine once the Democrats get in, then it's going to be, you know, Katie bar the
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:32.680]  door.
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:37.680]  I expect that after any new shooting, or even before the next mass shooting, the Democrats
[03:14:37.680 --> 03:14:44.280]  are going to move to ban standard capacity magazines, meaning magazines that hold 15
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:50.240]  to 30 rounds, whatever the gun that they're designed for is meant to hold, that the Democrats
[03:14:50.240 --> 03:14:52.520]  are going to move to outlaw them.
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:56.400]  They just did the bump stock ban, which was sort of a test case.
[03:14:56.400 --> 03:15:02.000]  Can we just by fiat declare a certain object to be illegal?
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:03.360]  Who cares about the bump stock?
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:06.360]  It was a perfect trial balloon.
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:07.880]  It went right through.
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:11.240]  But next it's going to be 30 round magazines.
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:17.520]  And what I expect from the Rhino Republicans is they're going to say, oh, no, not 30 round
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:23.600]  magazines, but how about nothing over 30 rounds, it's all of those 40 or 50 round magazines,
[03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:24.600]  they'll go.
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:26.160]  So it'll be the salami tactic.
[03:15:26.160 --> 03:15:30.640]  Then after the next shooting, it'll be 20 round magazines and down you go.
[03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:32.520]  That's what I expect to see coming ahead.
[03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:33.520]  All right.
[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:37.600]  And maybe after the next section, we'll start to take some calls.
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:41.600]  So I'm hanging in there and we'll be back after the ads.
[03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:48.080]  And just remember, get to the InfoWars store and you'll get a free Gadsden flag InfoWars
[03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:49.680]  t-shirt with your order.
[03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:53.800]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:54.800]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:16:00.320]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[03:16:00.320 --> 03:16:03.280]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:06.760]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:11.960]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:14.720]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:18.920]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.

[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:29.880]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[03:16:29.880 --> 03:16:30.880]  I buy some.
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:31.880]  I use some.
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:32.880]  I store some.
[03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:33.880]  Awesome.

[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:39.560]  Bacon.

[03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:54.560]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:58.480]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:00.040]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:00.040 --> 03:17:03.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:08.520]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.520 --> 03:17:09.840]  I can help you too.
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:12.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:15.080]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:15.080 --> 03:17:23.280]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:27.040]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:31.800]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:33.720]  at Heart and Body Extract.
[03:17:33.720 --> 03:17:36.880]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:54.240]  take charge of it.
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:18:00.880]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test and those of you that
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:05.160]  have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism
[03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:09.680]  and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's
[03:18:09.680 --> 03:18:14.640]  all because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears
[03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:22.440]  of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:27.800]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:31.880]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it and that's why they're
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:33.680]  trying to eradicate you.
[03:18:33.680 --> 03:18:39.840]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:45.680]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me, not
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:49.280]  behind us but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:53.200]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:54.200]  you.
[03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:58.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:04.840]  law, if there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:08.760]  that the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if game over.
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:14.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.240]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:24.920]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:29.560]  are truly independent and of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the
[03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:30.560]  world.
[03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:31.560]  It really is amazing.
[03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:35.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:38.160]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:43.640]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:48.480]  But please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenplata.com, because if
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:52.440]  you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will, we're all in each other's
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:53.440]  hands.
[03:19:53.440 --> 03:19:57.360]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:19:57.360 --> 03:20:16.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:16.880 --> 03:20:23.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:31.320]  Okay, I'm back and I'm going to be talking about the wall, but we're going to start in
[03:20:31.320 --> 03:20:35.640]  Syria and move on through Syria to the wall.
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:41.240]  But first, I want to just mention that the Infowars store is having an end of year clearance.
[03:20:41.240 --> 03:20:46.680]  This is the golden opportunity you're ever going to have to clean out the warehouse.
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:53.280]  It's going to go right through the end of the year and everything is 55, 60% off.
[03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:58.400]  Unforced, super male vitality, super blue toothpaste, everything.
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:05.760]  And best of all, you'll get that really cool, I am Alex Jones, Infowars, black and white,
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:09.120]  gadston flag, t-shirt with every order.
[03:21:09.120 --> 03:21:12.960]  And of course, the bumper stickers and all the other good stuff.
[03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:20.000]  Now, I want to tie something together that I don't know if probably other people have
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:21.720]  thought of this.
[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:27.360]  Trump is not, you know, sometimes it seems like he's firing off the hip, but he just
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:31.240]  announced yesterday that we're pulling out of Syria.
[03:21:31.240 --> 03:21:36.800]  And this is in the same news cycle that he's getting sandbagged on funding for the border
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:38.120]  wall.
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:43.560]  I think he's been trying to get out of Syria ever since he came into office.
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:47.760]  And even within the military, there's a strong deep state element.
[03:21:47.760 --> 03:21:52.440]  It's not just the intelligence agencies, even the military.
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:56.720]  You have to consider that every general is a Senate appointee.
[03:21:56.720 --> 03:22:03.880]  So once you put on stars, you're basically a politician beholden to the Senate.
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:09.280]  And the generals, when Trump came in and he started talking about let's finish off ISIS
[03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:14.200]  and get out, he actually got very strong pushback from the military.
[03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:18.600]  I think that he felt that he was never going to be able to convince them he just had to
[03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:20.920]  give the order.
[03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:26.160]  And coming at the same time as getting no funding for the border wall, I mean, it's
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:27.160]  a joke.
[03:22:27.160 --> 03:22:32.800]  It's what, an eight trillion dollar economy and five billion for the border wall is what?
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:36.920]  Less than 1%, you know, 1%, it's a tiny percentage.
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:39.200]  It's really nothing.
[03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:47.480]  The Obama administration pulled $150 billion out of a hat to send to Iran, you know, without
[03:22:47.480 --> 03:22:50.720]  any congressional authority.
[03:22:50.720 --> 03:22:57.320]  They just came up with something like $150 billion, sent it to the Iranians.
[03:22:57.320 --> 03:23:01.480]  And yet they look at us with a straight face and say, we just can't find any money for
[03:23:01.480 --> 03:23:03.360]  that wall.
[03:23:03.360 --> 03:23:08.800]  And I think that what Trump is trying to do is he's setting up an optic, like a balance.
[03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:15.480]  All right, we just saved 20 billion in Syria, and I want to move that funds to the wall.
[03:23:15.480 --> 03:23:19.800]  And I think that he might even make some kind of announcements to that effect in the coming
[03:23:19.800 --> 03:23:29.400]  days as this continuing resolution poker game with the government shutdown looming tomorrow.
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:33.840]  I think that he's going to start putting it in these terms.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:40.840]  Now, if you go back to the beginning of Syria, Syria is really a result of Hillary Clinton
[03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:47.880]  and Obama blowing up the Middle East by taking the side of the Muslim Brotherhood and pushing
[03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:49.040]  the Arab Spring.
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:55.840]  It started in Tunisia, it spread to Libya and Egypt, and then to Syria.
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:24:01.760]  So Syria was a, you know, it's not a happy country overall, I would say, you know, in
[03:24:01.760 --> 03:24:07.640]  the best of times, but Syria was a more secular country than almost anywhere else in the Middle
[03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:08.640]  East.
[03:24:08.640 --> 03:24:14.800]  It had, you know, at least in the western parts of Syria, it had, you know, Christians
[03:24:14.800 --> 03:24:21.400]  and Alloites who formed a coalition that ran the country so that it wasn't just the Sunni
[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:28.000]  fanatics, the Wahhabi Sunni fanatics running the country, they actually were keeping them
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:29.440]  in check.
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:36.480]  And during the Arab Spring, that's when the whole place blew up, which is, to me, I put
[03:24:36.480 --> 03:24:42.560]  that on the ledger for Hillary and Obama wrecking the Middle East.
[03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:46.040]  We're still dealing with the consequences of that today.
[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:52.000]  And in that civil war, we basically, I think, took the wrong side, because there are a lot
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:56.880]  of factors that aren't even really openly discussed here, you know, that there are things
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:03.320]  like oil pipelines and military highway routes and big geopolitical factors in play.
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:06.360]  And it's not just, you know, the good guys, bad guys.
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:12.400]  If anything, we took the side of ISIS, not directly, but we were funding, we were funding
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:17.320]  Islamist factions that were supposedly moderate.
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:22.440]  But every time we shipped them weapons, they wound up in ISIS territory every time.
[03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:27.240]  And we continued to do it, you know, year after year, right until Trump came in.
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:32.240]  Once Trump was in, he actually had the military drop the hammer on ISIS.
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:37.400]  And I think that he wants to show the deep state that, yeah, he is the commander-in-chief.
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:44.480]  Now, moving to the wall, not just considering the money will save not being in Syria, there's
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:48.960]  something that, you know, I don't know why Trump hasn't clued in on this, because he
[03:25:48.960 --> 03:25:54.080]  could sit down on TV with this on the wall behind him, right in the Constitution, it
[03:25:54.080 --> 03:26:00.320]  gives the commander-in-chief the authority to defend the border any way he needs to.
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:05.040]  Before World War I, I think it was Woodrow Wilson, he sent General Pershing right into
[03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:06.040]  Mexico.
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:12.680]  I mean, on a punitive mission after a border raid by Pancho Villa in Texas, or New Mexico,
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:13.680]  I forget.
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.800]  Anyway, a little border raid by Pancho Villa, we sent the U.S. Army right into Texas kicking
[03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:18.960]  an ass.
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:24.840]  The president could send the army tomorrow to the entire border with orders to string,
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:31.000]  you know, six rows of concertina wire from the Gulf of Mexico to California and do it
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.560]  all within DOD funding.
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:40.320]  This is the essence of his mission as a commander-in-chief to defend the United States, not to defend
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:48.320]  Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, you know, Mali, Niger, but America, and it's disgraceful that
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:51.680]  there are any Republicans that go along with this.
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:27:00.040]  And really what it boils down to is the globalists, which includes all of the Democrats and way
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:04.920]  too many Republicans, the globalists want open borders.
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:08.800]  It's not that they don't think walls are immoral or anything like that.
[03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:11.120]  The globalists want open borders.
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:19.640]  Where it affects Democrats, every uneducated, non-English speaking, preferably sick, ill,
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:26.480]  lame, you know, with problem children that arrives in America is a perpetual funding
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:29.000]  machine for the Democrat Party.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  Not only will that person and their family in offspring eventually all become Democrats,
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:39.440]  but they're going to require platoons of government workers, social workers, to take
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:43.840]  care of their needs, to educate them, to medicate them, to incarcerate them.
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:45.640]  Those are all government jobs.
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:48.120]  So they don't care if the country is ruined.
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:51.800]  They don't care if Americans' standard of living crashes.
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:53.520]  That means nothing to them.
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:28:00.280]  Basically, the Democrats would rather rule the ruins of a failed socialist country than
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:05.480]  compete for power in a successful, prosperous republic.
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:10.560]  You look at the worst cities in America, they've been run by the Democrats forever.
[03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:16.880]  Baltimore, Detroit, the state of California now, well, that doesn't bother the Democrats.
[03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:20.760]  They look at Venezuela and you know what they think of that?
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:25.000]  The socialists sure do know how to stay in power and they're living great.
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:31.400]  So they'd rather rule the ruins in a failed socialist country than compete with Republicans.
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:35.320]  And too many Republicans go along with that because they just want cheap labor for their
[03:28:35.320 --> 03:28:37.560]  factories and farms.
[03:28:37.560 --> 03:28:40.840]  And we Americans, we get stuck with the bill.
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:43.960]  Okay, when we come back, we'll start taking some phone calls.
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:56.080]  This is Matt Bracken for Infowars.
[03:28:56.080 --> 03:29:22.400]  This is Matt Bracken for Infowars.

[03:29:54.120 --> 03:29:58.760]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:29:58.760 --> 03:30:02.440]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[03:30:02.440 --> 03:30:05.400]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:30:50.720 --> 03:30:54.200]  Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[03:30:54.200 --> 03:30:58.240]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:30:58.240 --> 03:30:59.240]  law.
[03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:04.640]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:31:04.640 --> 03:31:08.560]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:31:08.560 --> 03:31:13.720]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:31:13.720 --> 03:31:17.960]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:31:17.960 --> 03:31:24.640]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that
[03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:25.640]  are truly independent.
[03:31:25.640 --> 03:31:29.280]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:31:29.280 --> 03:31:31.200]  It really is amazing.
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:35.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[03:31:35.760 --> 03:31:37.880]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:31:37.880 --> 03:31:43.360]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[03:31:43.360 --> 03:31:48.320]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prismpana.com, because if you
[03:31:48.320 --> 03:31:51.360]  don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:31:51.360 --> 03:31:52.560]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:54.160]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:31:54.160 --> 03:31:58.200]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:01.520]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states.
[03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:05.560]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about
[03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:08.160]  ash and acid rain.
[03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:11.280]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:15.080]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:21.600]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:25.560]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:32:25.560 --> 03:32:27.000]  in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:31.200]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.200 --> 03:32:36.720]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored
[03:32:36.720 --> 03:32:38.360]  to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.360 --> 03:32:43.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.240 --> 03:32:48.120]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:49.120]  supply.
[03:32:49.120 --> 03:32:57.440]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.440 --> 03:33:15.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:15.760 --> 03:33:21.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:24.000]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:31.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:31.080 --> 03:33:34.160]  Matt Bracken back again for the last half hour.
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:36.720]  I had a few more thoughts on the wall.
[03:33:36.720 --> 03:33:43.280]  You know, this GoFundMe account that's a veteran has raised a good amount of money, but really
[03:33:43.280 --> 03:33:46.800]  just to drop in the bucket in terms of what's required.
[03:33:46.800 --> 03:33:49.520]  This reminds me of back in the early 2000s.
[03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:52.280]  This is even before the Tea Party, I believe.
[03:33:52.280 --> 03:33:54.480]  There's a group called the Minutemen.
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:34:00.360]  This was an internet, you know, grassroots internet effort of folks to go down and actually
[03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:05.240]  watch the border and then call to the border patrol and they saw incursions.
[03:34:05.240 --> 03:34:10.440]  These were just, you know, basic good-hearted Americans sitting in lawn chairs with binoculars,
[03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:12.440]  you know, sun umbrellas.
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:19.000]  And they were portrayed in the media as the worst, you know, racist, Gestapo Nazi, you
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:21.200]  know, hateful people.
[03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:24.880]  And all they were trying to do is help to keep an eye on the border.
[03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:30.760]  So this GoFundMe account, no doubt it'll be also portrayed as a bunch of, you know, anti-immigrant
[03:34:30.760 --> 03:34:34.160]  racists, which is really a shame.
[03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:40.240]  But getting back to Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution that basically says the government
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:43.320]  is responsible to protect the states from invasion.
[03:34:43.320 --> 03:34:45.120]  And that's what's going on, is an invasion.
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:49.480]  It's actually changing the demography of the country.
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:53.600]  People that don't speak English, never heard of the Constitution, don't care about the
[03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:56.800]  Constitution, they're going to vote Democrat.
[03:34:56.800 --> 03:35:03.480]  I've read recently that two-thirds of the illegal aliens are on welfare, two-thirds,
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:06.680]  which is far higher than Native Americans.
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:11.720]  So not only are we importing future Democrat voters with lots of, you know, physical and
[03:35:11.720 --> 03:35:18.200]  mental disabilities to be paid for by us, but we're, you know, we're importing folks
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:23.440]  that for the foreseeable future are going to be a pure drain on us.
[03:35:23.440 --> 03:35:28.280]  And the Democrats don't care, and not, and even a lot of Republicans don't care.
[03:35:28.280 --> 03:35:32.160]  Basically the elite-gated community crowd that runs the country, they don't care if
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:37.160]  the entire country looks like Caracas in 10 years.
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:42.960]  If you go to the worst third-world countries, there are all Zona Roses that look like, you
[03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:49.640]  know, the, like the, a Latin American telly novella mansion, you know, like the mansion
[03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:51.920]  in Sicario at the end.
[03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:53.520]  That's how these guys live.
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:57.600]  They don't care if it's, if it's Mad Max right outside of the gate.
[03:35:57.600 --> 03:35:58.600]  They don't care.
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:00.280]  They fly in helicopters.
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:03.520]  They ride in convoys of armored SUVs.
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:04.520]  They own the police.
[03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:10.160]  You know, they can go out and grab anybody off the street like they were Saddam Hussein's
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:11.160]  kids.
[03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:16.480]  You know, so it's really fantastic to live in a failed third-world country if your name
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:18.960]  is Chavez or Maduro.
[03:36:18.960 --> 03:36:23.520]  And that's what the Democrats and a lot of the Republicans are looking forward to.
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:30.800]  So anybody that says they're against building the wall is an open borders globalist, period.
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:37.200]  Now Trump made a mistake early on by defining it strictly as a wall, when in fact the better
[03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:44.320]  solutions have been, have been multiple fence systems like they have in Israel and Hungary
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:45.320]  and other countries.
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:52.280]  You know, if you have a Jeep trail along a triple wire fence, nobody's getting through.
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:53.600]  They're just not.
[03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:59.360]  When you have no, no effective wall and the border patrol is forced to defend, you know,
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:05.040]  50, 100 miles in depth, imagine the number of square miles, 2000 miles of border times
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:09.280]  100 miles deep, that same number of border patrol.
[03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:14.800]  If they're at an effective barrier of like a double fence, that same number of border
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:19.840]  patrol spread out over 100 miles times 2000 miles of square miles.
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:24.280]  If they're right along an effective barrier, there's like a border patrol guy every 100
[03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:25.280]  feet.
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:29.960]  Nobody is sneaking through ever where they've been tried like Israel and Hungary.
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:34.480]  They reduce illegal crossings like 99.9%.
[03:37:34.480 --> 03:37:37.560]  And that's why the Democrats don't want it.
[03:37:37.560 --> 03:37:44.200]  Every illegal alien crossing the border and their children are future Democrat voters.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:46.080]  And they know it's going to ruin the country.
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:50.000]  They know the country is going to wind up looking like Venezuela.
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:54.760]  And they don't care because they know they'll be in the ruling class.
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:57.720]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[03:37:57.720 --> 03:38:01.080]  Democrats don't mind ruling the ruins.
[03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:07.760]  That's why all of these cities like Baltimore, Detroit, they're run by Democrats forever.
[03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:11.000]  But the Democrats in charge, they live like kings.
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:14.600]  And they've got job security for the rest of their lives.
[03:38:14.600 --> 03:38:17.880]  And that's the plan they have for the entire country.
[03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:22.440]  In fact, that's the plan that the globalists have for the entire world.
[03:38:22.440 --> 03:38:28.320]  Last week was Marrakesh, which at the time, some of the European leaders said, well, it's
[03:38:28.320 --> 03:38:31.400]  non-binding, but it actually is binding.
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:37.840]  When the General Assembly affirms the entire thing, the UN is now going to be saying there's
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:42.000]  a human right to free migration.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:46.680]  There's hundreds of millions of people around the world that would move to America tomorrow.
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:52.480]  Then you've got this crazy judge in Washington that just said, everybody who's been deported,
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:55.880]  we need to give them plane tickets to come back to America.
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:38:57.800]  I mean, these are the globalists.
[03:38:57.800 --> 03:39:01.120]  They absolutely do not give a damn about you.
[03:39:01.120 --> 03:39:07.360]  They just want to wreck the country so that they can rule the ruins from the castle.
[03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:13.240]  It's fantastic to be the king in a feudal society, but we don't want to be peasants.
[03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:15.840]  We want to be free men, free holders.
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:22.200]  We don't want to be third world peons with a king up in a castle on the hill.
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:24.880]  But that's the plan that they've got for us.
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:29.080]  And they've dressed it up in human rights.
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:33.920]  But look, we still have a sovereign country and we're going to have to fight for it.
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:36.760]  Come January, the Democrats are going to be in charge.
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:39.080]  And I don't see a fence coming then.
[03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:44.320]  Really, the only hope for Trump is to militarize the border as commander in chief, have the
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:48.480]  Army Corps of Engineers string concertino wire the whole way.
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:53.840]  Then at least the border patrol and the military will have something that they can guard instead
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:54.840]  of...
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:39:58.640]  I mean, they show these San Diego sections that actually have an effective fence, but
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:04.120]  half of the border looks like a rusty cattle fence, a few strands of barbed wire.
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:07.160]  That's what most of the border looks like, not like that.
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:10.440]  Most of the border is actually just walk through.
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:15.320]  It's just harder to get to, but people do walk through by the hundreds every day.
[03:40:15.320 --> 03:40:21.160]  All right, we have still have a couple of minutes, so I'm going to take a call now.
[03:40:21.160 --> 03:40:27.440]  The first person in today was a fellow Floridian, a lady Floridian, Emily in Florida.
[03:40:27.440 --> 03:40:29.320]  Are you stalling it on there?
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:32.000]  It says you want to talk about the Constitution.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.160]  Oh, yeah, actually a...
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:35.160]  Oh, Emile.
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:36.160]  Yeah.
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:37.160]  Okay, Emile.
[03:40:37.160 --> 03:40:42.560]  Anyway, yeah, I just want to call that...
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:47.920]  I think if we focus more on our representatives, then we could get this world done.
[03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:51.960]  We're not going to get it by just go funding me.
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:58.200]  What we have to do is do what the founding fathers did with the Declaration of Independence
[03:40:58.200 --> 03:41:01.840]  and what Newt Gingrich did with the contract with America.
[03:41:01.840 --> 03:41:07.120]  We wrote our grievances on a one-page bill that everybody could understand, and then
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:08.720]  we sent it to everybody.
[03:41:08.720 --> 03:41:12.240]  And that's what we should do with a bill called the Constitution Carta.
[03:41:12.240 --> 03:41:18.200]  It's a Tea Party bill that tells Congress to shut down federal departments and the problems
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:22.600]  will solve themselves until we focus, yeah.
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:32.200]  Well, yeah, that's nice, but I think it's a fantasy because in January, Nancy Pelosi
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:35.800]  is going to be in charge of the Congress and nothing is going to happen like that.
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:39.960]  The lame duck Republicans who did nothing for the two years that they had all three
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:46.560]  branches in their control, the lame duck Republicans, all they can do is try to pass a continuing
[03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:51.840]  resolution with some border funding, hopefully snuck in, which is a joke.
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:56.280]  So it's just going to get worse in January because there's going to be no funding coming
[03:41:56.280 --> 03:41:57.400]  from Congress.
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:42:03.600]  The only way any kind of border fence or wall or barrier is going to be built is if Trump
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:10.200]  takes it out of the DOD budget, declares it a national emergency and invokes Article 4,
[03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:14.080]  Section 4 of the Constitution, to defend the states from invasion.
[03:42:14.080 --> 03:42:18.320]  He can do that and completely circumvent Congress.
[03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:19.320]  Thanks, U.M.L.
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:23.040]  Let's see, we don't have time for another call.
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:25.000]  We'll get to one after the next break.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:28.240]  But yeah, there's no more funding for a wall.
[03:42:28.240 --> 03:42:32.840]  Even if something is snuck through in the next couple of weeks, the Democrats are going
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:36.680]  to find some bureaucratic way to hold the funding up.
[03:42:36.680 --> 03:42:39.640]  It's not going to be built with regular government contracts.
[03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:45.240]  It's going to have to be the president as commander-in-chief defending it with the Army,
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:46.240]  the Army Corps of Engineers.
[03:42:46.240 --> 03:42:48.080]  It's the only way it's going to get built.
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:50.680]  We'll be back in a couple minutes.
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:58.920]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:02.540]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories
[03:43:02.540 --> 03:43:07.160]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:12.120]  it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around
[03:43:12.120 --> 03:43:18.840]  the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the
[03:43:18.840 --> 03:43:21.320]  globalist programming.
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:26.680]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be
[03:43:26.680 --> 03:43:29.880]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:32.600]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:38.720]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be
[03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:44.560]  the big decision-maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me, not
[03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:48.160]  behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:43:48.160 --> 03:43:52.080]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute
[03:43:52.080 --> 03:43:53.080]  you.
[03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:57.120]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can't food during the fall,
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:43:59.120]  so they have it during the winter.
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:05.360]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4WarsTour.com, with M4 Wars Select, it's the full spectrum
[03:44:05.360 --> 03:44:10.680]  of my patriots supply on the top, most respected companies out there, but because I private
[03:44:10.680 --> 03:44:16.600]  label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able
[03:44:16.600 --> 03:44:17.600]  to do.
[03:44:17.600 --> 03:44:21.560]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[03:44:21.560 --> 03:44:22.560]  win-win.
[03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:27.560]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4WarsTour.com, on M4Wars Select storeable
[03:44:27.560 --> 03:44:32.640]  foods, they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, week
[03:44:32.640 --> 03:44:36.680]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three year
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:37.680]  supply.
[03:44:37.680 --> 03:44:42.240]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block, it's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:47.120]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:44:47.120 --> 03:44:54.240]  M4WarsTour.com and M4Wars Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:58.280]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:44:59.280]  law.
[03:44:59.280 --> 03:45:04.680]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:08.560]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:45:08.560 --> 03:45:13.760]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:45:13.760 --> 03:45:17.960]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:24.800]  There's only two groups in the U.S., M4Wars and Matt Rudge at rudgereport.com that are
[03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:25.800]  truly independent.
[03:45:25.800 --> 03:45:31.200]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world, it really is amazing.
[03:45:31.200 --> 03:45:35.760]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:37.880]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:43.360]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of M4Wars.
[03:45:43.360 --> 03:45:48.200]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if
[03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:52.200]  you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will, we're all in each other's
[03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:53.200]  hands.
[03:45:53.200 --> 03:45:54.440]  God bless you all and thank you.

[03:46:57.440 --> 03:47:16.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:21.760]  Okay last segment and I'm going to just try to get through some phone calls here since
[03:47:21.760 --> 03:47:27.240]  people have been patiently holding and I'll try not to monopolize the time and give everybody
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:33.120]  about a minute or so, a minute or two to make your point and I'll respond to it.
[03:47:33.120 --> 03:47:35.680]  So let's see, Julie in Michigan, are you still holding?
[03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:38.880]  I want to talk about the GoFundMe attempt.
[03:47:38.880 --> 03:47:39.880]  Go ahead, Julie.
[03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:40.880]  Hi Matt.
[03:47:40.880 --> 03:47:49.840]  Yeah, I donated to the GoFundMe account last night and it was like one and a half million
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:55.480]  and now it's like I think approaching seven million, which even though it is just a drop
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:48:01.480]  in the bucket like you said, I'm super excited about it because it really sends a message
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:12.320]  that what the people want, what the majority of the people want is border security and
[03:48:12.320 --> 03:48:20.320]  I'm really hoping it just really makes a big impact in the news and can be a point that's
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:25.880]  made to our representatives and everything that people are genuinely interested in this
[03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:33.800]  enough to fund it themselves, you know, second point, I'll just throw out my three points
[03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:36.120]  and then let you do your thing.
[03:48:36.120 --> 03:48:42.400]  Second point is I totally do not believe the outcome of the midterm elections.
[03:48:42.400 --> 03:48:49.240]  I think that there was a lot of voter fraud that went on just surely based on the record
[03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:52.920]  crowds that came out to Trump's rallies.
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:58.800]  I just don't believe it for one second that, you know, the Democrats legally took the house
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:05.600]  and then third of all, my third and last point is I think that for those who are willing,
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:10.160]  we could really use infowars the different shows to have maybe just a minute or two of
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:19.440]  collective prayer, which would be, I think, very powerful in, you know, helping our cause.
[03:49:19.440 --> 03:49:27.600]  Okay, well, as far as the GoFundMe, I think that it's useful for just a media event,
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:33.000]  but it won't actually lead to anything because any construction has to come through either
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:39.640]  a congressional appropriation, which the Democrats are going to choke off no matter what, or
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:47.120]  President Trump making it a military situation and doing it under article four section four.
[03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:48.120]  Prayer is always good.
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:49.800]  I'm not, I don't know about group prayers.
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:53.600]  It's really not my, you know, not my thing.
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:57.520]  I've got a bunch of calls here, so I'm just going to go through them now.
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:49:59.160]  Thanks, Julie.
[03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:03.640]  Doyle in Indiana is actually hopeful for the coming years.
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:04.960]  Go ahead, Doyle.
[03:50:04.960 --> 03:50:07.160]  Matt, you are great.
[03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:15.440]  You are articulate, you're calm, you're a perfect balance to Alex, and I wish Alex,
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:17.920]  if you're listed as this, you got to promote this guy.
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:23.600]  You got to get this guy because, dude, you can talk and you can do it in a calm way and
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:27.160]  a rational way and you're spot on.
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:32.440]  But my point is, I never, actually, I've never contacted Doyle before.
[03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:36.400]  So there's no kickback or anything going on here, but I appreciate it.
[03:50:36.400 --> 03:50:39.120]  No, it's just a fact, dude.
[03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:41.680]  Don't take my words, just it's reality.
[03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:48.560]  But anyway, I have hope for 2020 because the rhinos are gone.
[03:50:48.560 --> 03:51:00.240]  And if I may give you an analogy, in 2018, it's like the, oh gosh, what's his name?
[03:51:00.240 --> 03:51:05.720]  Paul Ryan was a quarterback to try to win, to keep the house.
[03:51:05.720 --> 03:51:07.080]  And he's a quarterback.
[03:51:07.080 --> 03:51:15.880]  And with one minute to go, the Republicans had the ball on the 30-yard line of the Democrats.
[03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:17.160]  Two points down.
[03:51:17.160 --> 03:51:19.280]  All we need is a field goal.
[03:51:19.280 --> 03:51:20.800]  And what does he do?
[03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:26.160]  Ryan kneels through all four downs.
[03:51:26.160 --> 03:51:32.460]  He kneels, just like the NFL players, kneel to the flag.
[03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:37.800]  He kneels to the Republican Party, to the people that vote him in office.
[03:51:37.800 --> 03:51:43.480]  These rhinos always make promises and then they go in and negotiate everything away.
[03:51:43.480 --> 03:51:47.360]  So I have hope.
[03:51:47.360 --> 03:51:51.040]  At least if you're on defense with a team that's actually trying to win the game, they
[03:51:51.040 --> 03:51:54.320]  might make an interception and run it back.
[03:51:54.320 --> 03:51:57.480]  Ryan was a quarterback who intentionally threw interceptions.
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:52:00.480]  Ryan was a quarterback who was working for the other team.
[03:52:00.480 --> 03:52:10.000]  But remember, the speaker of the house, he's elected by the Republican congressman.
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:15.840]  There aren't enough of the great freedom caucus guys, Meadows, Jordan, these guys are heroes.
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:24.480]  These guys need to be supported vocally in every way we can because at least a third
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:27.320]  of the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats.
[03:52:27.320 --> 03:52:31.520]  And at least I can respect the Democrats, they're socialists trying to turn the country
[03:52:31.520 --> 03:52:32.520]  into Venezuela.
[03:52:32.520 --> 03:52:33.960]  I get it.
[03:52:33.960 --> 03:52:37.600]  But a third of our Republicans are Benedict Arnold's.
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:39.280]  And I wish that they would all be gone.
[03:52:39.280 --> 03:52:45.560]  If I was Trump, I would say if you don't come out powerfully to support defending the border,
[03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:48.460]  then I'm going to have, I'm going to support primarying you.
[03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:50.460]  You should be out of Congress.
[03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:52.360]  You don't belong in our party.
[03:52:52.360 --> 03:52:53.880]  I mean, it's time to do that.
[03:52:53.880 --> 03:52:55.360]  Yeah, Matt gets there.
[03:52:55.360 --> 03:52:59.440]  They're great, they're a great freedom caucus guys, but there just aren't enough of them.
[03:52:59.440 --> 03:53:01.440]  All right, thanks to all.
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:02.940]  Let's go on.
[03:53:02.940 --> 03:53:06.360]  Ben in Massachusetts actually has a sell-out question, I think.
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:07.360]  Go ahead, Ben.
[03:53:07.360 --> 03:53:08.360]  You're there.
[03:53:08.360 --> 03:53:09.360]  Awesome.
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:11.560]  This is so great to be on the air with you.
[03:53:11.560 --> 03:53:14.440]  I need to second that caller.
[03:53:14.440 --> 03:53:16.440]  You need to be on the show every day.
[03:53:16.440 --> 03:53:21.560]  You need to be regular on the show.
[03:53:21.560 --> 03:53:23.640]  You're a demeanor.
[03:53:23.640 --> 03:53:25.680]  Actually you're a major talent.
[03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:36.920]  You're even possibly bigger than Info Wars, but yes, Alex needs to put you on every day.
[03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:47.920]  And so I was just, when I called in, I was misremembering the title of your article,
[03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:56.600]  your essay, it's called Get Yourself a 30-Footer and Go, and that's from 2013.
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:00.920]  And this is basically not the easiest thing in the world to find.
[03:54:00.920 --> 03:54:03.800]  I don't know if you have a website or what.
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:04.800]  There's links.
[03:54:04.800 --> 03:54:16.120]  I can Google it and then it'll take me to a link, but this is really so classic, so classic.
[03:54:16.120 --> 03:54:19.960]  And it's basically, I found it to be true.
[03:54:19.960 --> 03:54:25.120]  I looked at some of these websites I was looking at, and you're right, a 30-footer is small.
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:29.920]  40-footer is much more roomy.
[03:54:29.920 --> 03:54:31.800]  And more expensive to maintain.
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:32.800]  They're cheap.
[03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:33.800]  They're cheap.
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:37.400]  Yeah, they're giving 30-footers away.
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:38.400]  Fiberglass posts don't go away.
[03:54:38.400 --> 03:54:40.600]  And the fiberglass posts don't rot.
[03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:41.600]  Right.
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:43.640]  You're right about that, yeah.
[03:54:43.640 --> 03:54:48.240]  But what I've noticed is that generally, the engine is shot.
[03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:49.240]  Right.
[03:54:49.240 --> 03:54:56.960]  You know, either repair the engine or get a new one, but I can just gut out the whole
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:54:57.960]  boat.
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:01.680]  Some people will gut out the whole boat and start over, but the hull is sound.
[03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:02.680]  The hull is sound.
[03:55:02.680 --> 03:55:03.680]  Yeah.
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:05.160]  If there's any wood in there.
[03:55:05.160 --> 03:55:11.400]  Yeah, I wanted to mention, actually, I'm between novels right now, but I'm doing a,
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:15.280]  I have, on Kindle, I have something called the Bracken Anthology, which is a collection
[03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:16.880]  of my short stuff.
[03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:20.560]  But that ends four or five years ago.
[03:55:20.560 --> 03:55:25.160]  I'm making a printed version of the Bracken Anthology, which will go from 2010 until this
[03:55:25.160 --> 03:55:29.840]  year with all my essays and short fiction short stories.
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:34.880]  So that'll be in print and then in Kindle in the spring sometime.
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:39.000]  But yeah, anybody that's completely had a loss for what to do with their life, especially
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:43.840]  young men, I would say, look up that essay, get yourself a 30 footer and go.
[03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:48.440]  I mean, if you feel like you're just in a dead end job going nowhere and you're at
[03:55:48.440 --> 03:55:54.120]  a loss for what to do, consider that, that what I suggest in that, in that article, get
[03:55:54.120 --> 03:55:56.040]  yourself a 30 footer and go.
[03:55:56.040 --> 03:55:57.520]  Hey, thanks, Ben.
[03:55:57.520 --> 03:56:02.280]  And again, I didn't, I didn't have Ben call in either.
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:06.360]  Rob in Washington, we're almost out of time, but go ahead, Rob.
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:11.960]  Yeah, hey, Matt, thanks for taking my calls, Bobby Bishop from internetic.com.
[03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:16.440]  I know a lot of people understand that more security is critically important to the national
[03:56:16.440 --> 03:56:17.880]  security of the United States.
[03:56:17.880 --> 03:56:20.360]  Some people get it, some people don't get it.
[03:56:20.360 --> 03:56:28.320]  I'm wondering, with Trump doing what the Democrats called was temper tantrum, I'd get the wall
[03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:33.040]  or I shut the government down and now he seems to be conceding on that, but at the same time
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:38.400]  pulling troops out of Syria and bringing them home, do you think that Trump could possibly
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:44.520]  be bringing those troops home to strengthen our southern border and maybe get the military
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:47.400]  to build the wall without going to the government at all?
[03:56:47.400 --> 03:56:52.920]  And could there quite possibly be, could there quite possibly be a martial law in our future?
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:55.080]  No, no, no need for martial law.
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:59.600]  And it won't be the troops from Syria, which are mostly, you know, spec ops, marine artillery,
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:01.000]  things like that.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:06.840]  But those troops coming home, it'll be a visible symbol that look at the money we're saving
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:12.000]  by not having a perpetual war in Syria, don't tell me that we can't afford to defend the
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  border.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:15.680]  You know, it'll be different troops and it's a much easier job.
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:16.680]  Look how close they are.
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:19.240]  We have bases all along the south.
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:24.600]  So yeah, I definitely think that in his mind, Trump is tying these together as a means to
[03:57:24.600 --> 03:57:26.280]  sell border protection.
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:27.760]  Well, thanks a lot.
[03:57:27.760 --> 03:57:30.960]  I'm sorry, missed some calls here.
[03:57:30.960 --> 03:57:32.360]  There's always next time.
[03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:36.840]  For now, I'm whenever you have a Thursday and then whenever Owen or David Knight, you
[03:57:36.840 --> 03:57:40.880]  know, want me to come in, I'm usually here because I'm, I'm home.
[03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:42.880]  And we'll see you next time.
[03:57:42.880 --> 03:57:43.880]  Thanks a lot.
[03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:47.320]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:57:47.320 --> 03:57:48.320]  law.
[03:57:48.320 --> 03:57:53.720]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:57:53.720 --> 03:57:57.440]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:57:57.440 --> 03:58:02.800]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:06.960]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:58:06.960 --> 03:58:13.680]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that
[03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:14.680]  are truly independent.
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:18.240]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:20.240]  It really is amazing.
[03:58:20.240 --> 03:58:24.800]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[03:58:24.800 --> 03:58:28.440]  we're all in and how far we've come together, just remind you that you are the power, you're
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:32.400]  the strength, you're the will of Infowars.

[03:58:40.400 --> 03:58:41.600]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:58:41.600 --> 03:58:44.600]  God bless you all and thank you.
