[00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:10.669]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:17.954]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.396]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:29.782]  And everything that Alex Jones and InfoWars has been covering has reached ahead.
[00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:30.743]  We are now in
[00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:41.799]  The final battle, or what could be the final battle, for the future of America.
[00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:58.611]  And as we've been telling you, Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has placed his wager, placed his name, placed his treasure, put everything on the line betting on you.
[00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:13.271]  And I'm not sure what the history books are going to say about President Trump's time in office, whether it be four or eight years.
[00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:31.216]  But history will remember this time, this blink of an eye in human history, in the very short history of the great experiment in self-government and self-reliance and independence we called the United States of America.
[00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:44.429]  And so President Trump has basically been dealing with things that you or I will probably never even imagine or know.
[00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.651]  And he's surrounded.
[00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.372]  He can get very little help.
[00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:55.196]  Most of his appointees turn into Judas.
[00:01:55.196 --> 00:02:01.540]  But he's the man in the arena and he realized something.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.482]  He realized something like
[00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:12.273]  The great gladiators that were sent into the ring to lose.
[00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:14.835]  Intentionally.
[00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:19.679]  You start to win the crowd over.
[00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:25.604]  And so President Trump is just in there surrounded, being stabbed and snaked from every angle.
[00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:32.770]  You have Democrats dancing at bars because they screwed the American people over.
[00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:36.752]  There it is right there.
[00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:44.657]  They're dancing and celebrating how they screwed America as they stabbed Trump and America in the back.
[00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:56.804]  Lunatics like Nancy Pelosi, whose state is highest in poverty, also highest in wealth, whose state was just named the dumbest state in the Union today.
[00:02:56.804 --> 00:03:04.308]  And it's scum like that and Dianne Feinstein, a Chinese spy for 20 years, that sold this country down the drain.
[00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:17.350]  So Trump got in and realized, my God, we don't have a breach in the hall, we don't have a leak, we're damn flooded!
[00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.912]  I'm just looking for oxygen in here!
[00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:32.217]  But just like the gladiator that is being ambushed and set up, and the whole crowd realizes it, the crowd starts to get behind that gladiator.
[00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:37.989]  The crowd starts to chant that gladiator's name.
[00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:50.616]  And all of a sudden, the gladiator pulls the arrow out of his back, the knife out of his side, the sword out of his leg, bleeding half to death, and wins the fight.
[00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:54.939]  Because of the masses and the momentum behind him.
[00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.060]  And that's where Trump is at right now.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.522]  And so we've got the story at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:10.196]  Trump thinks there'll be a revolt if Deep State tries to remove him from office because Americans are too well armed.
[00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:11.938]  Well, that's one angle.
[00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.779]  And the president is absolutely right about that.
[00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.584]  But I don't even necessarily think it will come to that.
[00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:24.751]  I think like a force of nature, I think like an act of divine gravity,
[00:04:27.252 --> 00:04:38.537]  20 million, 40 million, 50 million Americans will flock to DC in protest of the removal of Donald Trump.
[00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:56.324]  And all these little fake news minions and all these little people in Hollywood and all these Democrats are going to look awfully stupid when millions of Americans take to the streets to support Trump, something they never thought they would ever see in their life.
[00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:05.965]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:15.732]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:23.818]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:32.724]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:05:32.724 --> 00:05:35.845]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:37.346]  It really is amazing.
[00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:44.049]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:46.670]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:49.568]  Of InfoWars.
[00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:50.869]  So please spread the links.
[00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.212]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:57.534]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:58.855]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:05:58.855 --> 00:05:59.976]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:06:08.992 --> 00:06:16.036]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:16.036 --> 00:06:21.559]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:28.964]  Roger Stone flew into Austin, Texas last night, and I took him and an associate out to dinner.
[00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:36.008]  And he revealed to me a meeting he had had a few days before
[00:06:37.802 --> 00:06:48.024]  With an extremely prominent member of the media and subsequent meetings he'd had with others.
[00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:56.326]  I separately had already talked to one of the individuals that was at the meeting as well.
[00:06:56.326 --> 00:07:06.168]  And this individual was extremely fatalistic and upset after they heard what had been said and would not even repeat back to me what they've been told.
[00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:11.609]  Well, Roger Stone told me last night.
[00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:26.260]  And it ties in to what the President said a few weeks ago when he made the statement, there's also video of it, that if they try to take him out unconstitutionally, the American people will revolt.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:34.667]  Well, the President told this extremely prominent member of the media, household name, specifically, in a phone call.
[00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:45.494]  About details of the plan to criminally take him out by what he calls embedded groups in the government working for the deep state, the Democrats, the Chi-Coms and others.
[00:07:47.057 --> 00:08:03.143]  I've also talked to individuals separately in the military and the State Department that have also confirmed this information before I ever got it from Roger with specifics on President Trump's latest statements.
[00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:04.103]  We need to pray for this country.
[00:08:04.103 --> 00:08:04.983]  We need to pray for the world.
[00:08:04.983 --> 00:08:05.904]  We need to understand that
[00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:11.206]  We're all in extreme grave danger and that this country is fighting for its life right now.
[00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:13.067]  So I ask everybody to pray for the President.
[00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:17.068]  Roger's going to be on in the second hour in studio covering all this.
[00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:19.769]  Owen Schroer is hosting.
[00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:27.772]  I am going to be traveling to see some ill family, but I will be on air, popping in as well.
[00:08:27.772 --> 00:08:31.053]  All of this obviously ties together with the total demonization of the President.
[00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:32.594]  He promised to get our troops out of Syria.
[00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:36.157]  And he's now done that.
[00:08:36.157 --> 00:08:38.439]  We basically, with Russia's help, annihilated ISIS.
[00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:40.980]  But now our media says, oh, Trump did nothing about ISIS.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.803]  There's 2,000 of them still in this corner area.
[00:08:44.803 --> 00:08:50.627]  When it was Obama who helped create ISIS, it's just incredible how they think we have no memory.
[00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:51.528]  All right.
[00:08:51.528 --> 00:08:53.510]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone, Next Hour.
[00:08:54.975 --> 00:09:15.419]  With ultra-massive news and specifics of what I just broke down, please tell everyone you know, friends, family, neighbors, local radio listeners, TV viewers, folks on your Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, reach out to them and say, they're coming after the president, the president's aware of it, and this country and the world's two minutes to midnight.
[00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:18.559]  I'm Alex Jones, faithfully yours.
[00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.400]  God bless you all.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.860]  Back to the live broadcast, Owen Schroer.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.803]  And here we are on this Thursday, December 20th, 2018.
[00:09:24.803 --> 00:09:31.210]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones from the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.931]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones quite a bit today.
[00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:40.990]  Guys, give me a doc cam shot here so we can just get a look at all this news that we're going to cover here today.
[00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:49.676]  Not to mention, as Alex said, Roger Stone in studio at 12 Central here in 50 minutes to join me with an exclusive.
[00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:53.519]  We'll be joined by Paul Joseph Watson at 1130 Central.
[00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.721]  He's got his story at Infowars.com.
[00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:00.804]  Trump thinks there'll be a revolt if Deep State tries to remove him from office.
[00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:05.451]  And then Millie Weaver is going to be joining me in the third hour.
[00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:11.255]  She's got a report on what's got Facebook in the news right now.
[00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:18.960]  And then Matt Bracken, always informative, is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:26.084]  And then, of course, the war room starts and we go on with the rest of the live programming we have here.
[00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:30.107]  And to dovetail on what Alex was just saying,
[00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:41.991]  Obviously Trump is, I mean, some people would say the George Washington of this second American Revolution.
[00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:50.595]  I would say more of a John Hancock, perhaps, just because of the namesake and the boldness.
[00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:57.038]  But there is no doubt you are currently living in the second American Revolution.
[00:10:57.038 --> 00:10:59.939]  Now, whether America comes out on the other side of this alive or not,
[00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:02.208]  You'll see.
[00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:07.991]  People tend to forget, though, that America is rather young, really.
[00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:15.095]  I mean, compared to China, they've been around for over 3,000 years.
[00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:30.403]  This experiment that we have here in self-government, independence, which created the freest market, the most prosperity, the most wealth, the highest standard of living in world history, and the deranged, regressive left
[00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:50.014]  Is trying to tear it all down in some propaganda driven social justice virtue signaling campaign that has no bearings in reality and will ultimately be the total destruction of the West.
[00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:56.656]  And when you have total nincompoops like Alexandra Martini-Cortez
[00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:07.050]  Steering the Democrat Party to total communism and socialism, who then goes on her social media and says, I need to have a self-care day.
[00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.371]  I got news for you.
[00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:10.652]  In Venezuela, you know what that means?
[00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:15.515]  You hope you find a live animal that you can kill with your bare hands and eat, maybe.
[00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:17.856]  That's what you want to bring to America.
[00:12:17.856 --> 00:12:19.437]  But of course, it's not really you.
[00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:23.059]  You're just a useful idiot.
[00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:23.739]  But I gotta say,
[00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:36.545]  I am really, truly sickened by media last night and today, and this goes across the entire spectrum.
[00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.586]  Fox, CNN, MSNBC, I've got a clip right here.
[00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:45.288]  In fact, let's go ahead and roll this clip because, Roll Clip 5, guys.
[00:12:45.288 --> 00:12:52.871]  The entire cable news spectrum, for the most part, is mad that Trump is pulling our troops out of Syria.
[00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.051]  I am sickened!
[00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:59.566]  At the pro-war hawks we have in our media and our government.
[00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:02.389]  Makes me sick!
[00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:08.537]  Here's an MSNBC host hoping that the military just ignores Trump and stays in Syria.
[00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:13.864]  Listen, to their credit, I'm cheered if you're telling me that the military doesn't listen to him.
[00:13:13.864 --> 00:13:14.344]  You are a sick person.
[00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:26.791]  But I read a lot of quotes of a lot of senior Pentagon officials who were alarmed by the news, who had their rug pulled, who were, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:43.856]  Sickening!
[00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.798]  Why don't you go to Syria?
[00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:48.379]  Why don't you send your kids to Syria?
[00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:54.364]  I mean, I am just floored!
[00:13:54.364 --> 00:13:56.905]  I tune into Fox News all morning!
[00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:58.547]  Bad move for Trump to go to Syria.
[00:13:58.547 --> 00:13:59.247]  Lindsey Graham!
[00:13:59.247 --> 00:14:01.149]  Well, this is bad, pulling people out.
[00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.851]  I mean, all of them!
[00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.293]  Makes me sick!
[00:14:07.293 --> 00:14:09.355]  And all Trump wants to do is just restore America!
[00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:19.819]  Wants to make our economy big, wants to stop spending money building infrastructures thousands of miles away from our homeland!
[00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:35.024]  Excuse me, but unlike the frauds on television, I don't want this country at war forever!
[00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:36.685]  I'm sorry, but this just really angers me.
[00:14:38.049 --> 00:14:41.811]  That our media is angry that President Trump would bring the troops home.
[00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:44.613]  That is just, these are sick people.
[00:14:44.613 --> 00:14:52.218]  And I think maybe they should, maybe they should put publicly out, hmm, I wonder if some of these people have shares in Lockheed Martin.
[00:14:52.218 --> 00:14:56.561]  I wonder if some of these people have shares in Raytheon.
[00:14:56.561 --> 00:15:01.724]  Because why else would you be celebrating America being at war?
[00:15:01.724 --> 00:15:03.545]  And people dying!
[00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:04.866]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:05.967]  This just really made me sick.
[00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:07.532]  Watching that this morning.
[00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.353]  Alright.
[00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:11.554]  I'm going to bring it back down to earth here.
[00:15:11.554 --> 00:15:20.117]  We're going to cover all the big news and we're going to talk about how President Trump is saying, look, you can try to remove me, the deep state, Mueller, and all you corrupt Democrats.
[00:15:20.117 --> 00:15:25.618]  You can do whatever you think you want to do to try to destroy this country and remove me from office.
[00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:26.579]  But guess what?
[00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:28.099]  There will be a revolt and he is 100% right.
[00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:28.299]  100% right.
[00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:37.977]  In this short break, ladies and gentlemen, please go to Infowarestore.com.
[00:15:37.977 --> 00:15:44.079]  We have just decided to extend our Christmas sale all the way through the new year.
[00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:54.222]  So, the huge discounts, the free shipping, the double Patriot points, the free t-shirt, the Christmas sale has now been extended to the end of the year.
[00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:56.002]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:15:56.002 --> 00:15:57.903]  It's how you make everything we do here possible.
[00:15:57.903 --> 00:15:58.483]  Anti-war!
[00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:00.934]  Hear that?
[00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:06.319]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:05.482]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:08.165]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:14.431]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:18.215]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the Empire.
[00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:19.496]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:20.497]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:27.043]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:27.043 --> 00:17:28.464]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:32.286]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.

[00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:03.829]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:05.591]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.591 --> 00:18:16.882]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:26.826]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:37.370]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.492]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.492 --> 00:18:42.213]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.213 --> 00:18:52.218]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.218 --> 00:18:54.860]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.563]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:05.708]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:15.472]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:19:15.472 --> 00:19:23.576]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:32.470]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.591]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.071]  It really is amazing.
[00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:43.773]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:46.474]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:49.296]  Of Infowars.
[00:19:49.296 --> 00:19:50.597]  So please spread the links.
[00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:53.961]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:57.265]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:19:57.265 --> 00:19:58.606]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:02.871]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:05.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.346 --> 00:20:15.049]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:18.111]  America es wunderbar!
[00:20:18.111 --> 00:20:20.833]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:21.273]  America!
[00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:22.174]  America!
[00:20:22.174 --> 00:20:24.675]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:29.219]  America es wunderbar!
[00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:34.462]  You know, when Rammstein wrote this song,
[00:20:38.394 --> 00:20:46.119]  It was about how Western culture has influenced the world, and that's because it was the best.
[00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.339]  It was the free market.
[00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:51.162]  It was individual prosperity.
[00:20:51.162 --> 00:21:03.429]  And you now have control freaks, leftists, and quite frankly, psychopathic, mentally deranged individuals that are so regressive,
[00:21:05.003 --> 00:21:14.612]  But because of the PC culture and the fake social justice warrior movement are somehow paraded around as legitimate politicians.
[00:21:14.612 --> 00:21:19.436]  And you can put some faces and names to this description, but that's where we're at.
[00:21:19.436 --> 00:21:28.244]  And so, let me just kind of give a short background before we get into the story from Paul Joseph Watson at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:30.387 --> 00:21:46.391]  The United States of America has been the crown jewel, if you will, in geoeconomic markets and systems and experiments and cultures.
[00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:54.253]  And it became so successful and such an example of how individual liberty and prosperity
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:04.364]  is the most empowering and prosperous thing a republic can have, it became the crown jewel.
[00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:16.909]  And so all the powers that be on planet Earth sought after that crown jewel.
[00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:19.530]  And they realized
[00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:27.903]  The best way to conquer this country would be to divide it from within.
[00:22:27.903 --> 00:22:32.827]  And once you've done that, you can do pretty much anything.
[00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:34.208]  You can demonize whoever you want.
[00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:38.571]  You can cause chaos in the streets.
[00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:47.877]  And so, you've got a story out today that talks about there's only one thing that Americans can agree on, and that's that they can't agree on anything.
[00:22:47.877 --> 00:22:49.699]  Well, how do you explain that?
[00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.763]  Simple.
[00:22:52.763 --> 00:23:13.022]  Corporate news with an agenda, which has been out to destroy America for years, but now has Donald J. Trump in their sights because he is now the warrior, as the President of the United States, actually defending America, saying it has a place in the future of Earth.
[00:23:15.134 --> 00:23:21.478]  And so now you've got the most corrupt people right now in any form of United States government.
[00:23:21.478 --> 00:23:27.682]  Bob Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, all of the Democrat cabal.
[00:23:27.682 --> 00:23:28.943]  Most of these people are now out.
[00:23:28.943 --> 00:23:33.566]  Comey, Lynch, who was subpoenaed and had a closed-door testimony yesterday.
[00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:35.768]  She didn't look too pleased.
[00:23:35.768 --> 00:23:38.450]  And they're all trying to get Trump.
[00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.490]  And they think they're going to do it.
[00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.113]  And they're getting more aggressive.
[00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.272]  And they're getting more brazen!
[00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:47.593]  And they're just gonna fully commit!
[00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:48.794]  We're gonna take Trump out!
[00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:54.981]  Now we tried everything to make you hate Trump and you just didn't, so we're just gonna take him out!
[00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:55.802]  And this is where we're at.
[00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:57.724]  But Trump knows this is going on.
[00:23:57.724 --> 00:23:58.665]  And so he says, you know what?
[00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:02.105]  If you think you can take me out, you got another thing coming.
[00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:03.706]  Americans will revolt.
[00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:06.047]  So the headline at Infowars.com from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:06.047 --> 00:24:11.269]  Trump thinks Americans will engage in an armed revolt if Deep State tries to remove him from office.
[00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:12.469]  Let's go ahead and read this.
[00:24:12.469 --> 00:24:24.234]  President Donald Trump told a prominent person during a phone call last week that he thinks the American people will revolt if the Deep State tries to remove him from office via impeachment or any other method because Americans are too well armed.
[00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:41.002]  According to our sources, Trump thinks that Democrats are so intent on stopping America's recovery that they will set off a destabilizing crisis at the border, they've already done that, an economic collapse, they're working on that, and even civil war, they're working on that as well, as a means of ejecting him from the Oval Office.
[00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:42.763]  However, Trump believes that both the U.S.
[00:24:42.763 --> 00:24:49.789]  military and the American people would not stand for such a scenario and would rise up against it and there would be a revolt because Americans are too well armed.
[00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:54.306]  And boy, would that be an interesting scenario to see pull out.
[00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:58.087]  And who do you think they would target first, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:24:58.087 --> 00:24:59.508]  Donald J. Trump?
[00:24:59.508 --> 00:25:03.829]  Or, let's just say, Bob Mueller?
[00:25:03.829 --> 00:25:09.651]  The phone call was further discussed during a meeting between three people.
[00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:17.794]  And other prominent individuals close to the President have confirmed that what Trump said during the call was his ongoing state of mind over the past several weeks.
[00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:31.227]  The conversation was prompted following criticism from some figures on the right that Trump was not following through on his main campaign promises, specifically regarding the wall and Coulter, the biggest example of that.
[00:25:31.227 --> 00:25:34.529]  And then there's a huge story Trump unfollowed on Twitter.
[00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:41.813]  The comments lined up with previous public statements made by Trump about how the American people would respond if he were to be impeached.
[00:25:42.614 --> 00:25:47.655]  I'm not concerned, no, the President told Reuters last month during a conversation in the Oval Office.
[00:25:47.655 --> 00:25:53.316]  I think that the people would revolt if that happened.
[00:25:53.316 --> 00:25:58.637]  So, again, this story is at Infowars.com.
[00:25:58.637 --> 00:26:09.920]  Trump himself is apparently extremely taken aback at the level to which the country has been sold out by embedded groups within the government, particularly with regard to the Chinese influence.
[00:26:10.834 --> 00:26:17.579]  He's now bought up Apple, working on buying up Google, had total access to Hillary Clinton's private server.
[00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:22.683]  Not just hacking the server, it was basically a Chinese server that Hillary Clinton put in her home.
[00:26:22.683 --> 00:26:24.104]  Really.
[00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:27.187]  And then you have Dianne Feinstein with the Chinese spy for 20 years.
[00:26:27.187 --> 00:26:28.208]  It just goes on and on.
[00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.248]  Nothing for that, no hearing.
[00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:31.149]  That's nice.
[00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:40.375]  The President also now suspects that the Federal Reserve is working with the Deep State to plunge the economy as a way of crushing his re-election hopes, if he makes it that far.
[00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:44.817]  And, I mean, Powell was appointed by Trump, and here he is trying to sabotage him.
[00:26:44.817 --> 00:26:46.418]  It just makes you wonder.
[00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:55.583]  However, Trump expressed his confidence that the American people would choose the right side and have his back, which in turn sends a strong message to the establishment forces who are plotting his demise.
[00:26:55.583 --> 00:26:59.806]  And, you know, if you look at history, specifically American history,
[00:27:01.434 --> 00:27:08.677]  Whether you think it's organic or what, America goes through times of flux.
[00:27:08.677 --> 00:27:17.841]  There have been great depressions, there have been great wars, civil wars, you know, a lot of stuff, and a lot of people think we're due for that.
[00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:25.264]  You say, oh, well, there was the recession of 2008, and there was some other stuff, the recession after 9-11.
[00:27:25.264 --> 00:27:26.665]  Folks, that is nothing.
[00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:29.960]  That is nothing.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.521]  You know, we do have a large homeless population, but let me tell you something.
[00:27:33.521 --> 00:27:45.987]  This country is so well off, even with the rigged economy, even with the wealth distribution, even with all the poverty and homelessness, this country doesn't even know what it's like to be hungry.
[00:27:45.987 --> 00:27:47.288]  Okay?
[00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:47.468]  So...
[00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:52.302]  I'm not wanting there to be a civil war, obviously.
[00:27:52.302 --> 00:28:08.549]  I'd love the deep state to just back off President Trump and let him do his job and just quit trying to dominate the world, which means you have to destroy America, because you can't have 300 million free Americans in the West with guns if you want to have a world government.
[00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:11.870]  It's just not going to work, because we're going to stop it from happening.
[00:28:15.629 --> 00:28:31.637]  Let me assure you, just as humanity is in the process of a new age right now, the dawn of a new era of humanity, America is in the process of going through another purification process right now.
[00:28:31.637 --> 00:28:41.902]  And we're going to be smelted, and it's going to be hot, but America will come out on the other side of this purified if we're able to come out at all.
[00:28:43.126 --> 00:28:57.189]  And President Trump has bet his name, he's bet his fortune, he's bet his treasure, he's bet his family on you, on America, that you will see what's right and I pray every night that God gives America that vision to see what is right.
[00:29:00.862 --> 00:29:04.026]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:08.271]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[00:31:00.302 --> 00:31:05.826]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:31:05.826 --> 00:31:15.594]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:23.681]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:31:24.687 --> 00:31:32.590]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.691]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:37.192]  It really is amazing.
[00:31:37.192 --> 00:31:43.895]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:46.576]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:50.918]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[00:32:04.229 --> 00:32:18.157]  This life is a test, and those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:32:18.157 --> 00:32:28.163]  Listen to them for wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:32.326]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[00:32:33.257 --> 00:32:36.919]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:39.580]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.281]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:32:42.281 --> 00:32:44.682]  2018 has been insane.
[00:32:44.682 --> 00:32:47.723]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker.
[00:32:47.723 --> 00:32:51.565]  And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:32:51.565 --> 00:32:55.246]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[00:32:55.246 --> 00:32:59.328]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:17.091]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:18.932]  Watch me!
[00:33:18.932 --> 00:33:19.573]  Watch me!
[00:33:19.573 --> 00:33:26.519]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:29.821]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer!
[00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:40.258]  Paul Joseph Watson joins me now, and he wants to talk about some censorship that we're seeing.
[00:33:40.258 --> 00:33:46.501]  But Paul, it's gone beyond just the censorship and the attacks on PewDiePie.
[00:33:46.501 --> 00:33:58.729]  I don't know if you saw this story, but now you have a school, a middle school in Seattle, has called police officers after they found students posting
[00:34:00.089 --> 00:34:04.551]  Subscribe to PewDiePie posters around the school.
[00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:09.194]  You know, I remember in school, you know, you had all kinds of stuff that would trend and you'd put stuff up or talk about it.
[00:34:09.194 --> 00:34:12.855]  But now, Paul, now you're not allowed to do that.
[00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:15.437]  So you're not allowed to talk about PewDiePie.
[00:34:15.437 --> 00:34:20.579]  And, you know, someone showed up in a video game feed he had and his name was Sergeant Shekel.
[00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:23.101]  So obviously he's a Nazi now.
[00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:24.461]  So this is what's going on, Paul.
[00:34:24.461 --> 00:34:25.702]  This is the reality that we live in.
[00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:28.177]  Well, exactly.
[00:34:28.177 --> 00:34:31.640]  You have this contrived moral panic around PewDiePie.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.301]  Why are they so afraid of PewDiePie?
[00:34:33.301 --> 00:34:37.165]  You don't need to really know what he does to understand why they're so afraid of him.
[00:34:37.165 --> 00:34:39.887]  Mainly, he reviews memes.
[00:34:39.887 --> 00:34:42.149]  The left does not understand memes.
[00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:46.673]  There have been scientific studies that prove they don't understand memes.
[00:34:46.673 --> 00:34:53.719]  The most effective memes in 2016 that basically won Trump the election came out of two places, 4chan and the Donald Reddit.
[00:34:54.306 --> 00:34:56.767]  They're petrified because they don't speak the language.
[00:34:56.767 --> 00:35:03.908]  If you don't speak the language that all these younger people now, obviously skewing younger, are speaking, then how are you going to compete?
[00:35:03.908 --> 00:35:06.049]  How are you going to dominate that narrative?
[00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:11.210]  Plus, with someone like PewDiePie, this is a guy with 77 million subscribers.
[00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.631]  This is a guy who's not under corporate control.
[00:35:14.289 --> 00:35:19.650]  He jettisoned or was forced to jettison all his Disney deals and everything like that a couple of years ago.
[00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:34.593]  So merely the threat of somebody who isn't even political, he doesn't even talk about politics, having control over a sizable audience that big represents such a threat to them that they try to bring him down on an almost daily basis at this point.
[00:35:34.593 --> 00:35:39.915]  And this latest scandal is just, you know, another example of that.
[00:35:39.915 --> 00:35:41.555]  As he said, he was playing a video game.
[00:35:42.228 --> 00:35:46.692]  And somebody else in this video game is a VR video game, so it's like a public thing.
[00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:48.674]  You go in, you can end up playing with anyone.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:36:01.870]  And someone called Rabbi Shekels is in this shooter game with him, starts doing an effusive speech about PewDiePie like, oh your videos really helped me get through some hard times, and is shot by another player.
[00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:11.437]  PewDiePie laughs because that's funny, because he was doing this very emotional effusive speech and it got cut short because the character in the video game got shot.
[00:36:11.437 --> 00:36:12.598]  That's what he was laughing at.
[00:36:13.078 --> 00:36:24.262]  Then Vox and Buzzfeed and all these other publications came out and said, oh he was laughing at the Rabbi Shekels thing because he's a closet anti-Semite and he's promoting white supremacy.
[00:36:24.262 --> 00:36:28.823]  So this leads us to the story you just mentioned, the school in Seattle.
[00:36:28.823 --> 00:36:39.587]  There was a viral video posted a few nights ago of a teacher, a history teacher, telling middle school students in this Seattle school that they could be sued
[00:36:40.194 --> 00:36:48.139]  For retweeting PewDiePie videos, and that basically, in his own words, PewDiePie was promoting, quote, genocide.
[00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:52.922]  Which is obviously completely absurd, the guy has no understanding of the law to begin with.
[00:36:52.922 --> 00:37:01.227]  PewDiePie is a mild-mannered Swedish video gamer, entertainer, who laughs at memes and plays video games, okay?
[00:37:01.227 --> 00:37:04.529]  He's not gonna lead the Fourth Reich, let's just get it straight.
[00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:06.791]  So obviously this went on Twitter, this got viral.
[00:37:07.739 --> 00:37:21.807]  The school responded to the PewDiePie, subscribe to PewDiePie posters, which is a different thing about his battle with T-Series, and this viral rant by this teacher, by calling the police, and by the way also blaming InfoWars.
[00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:23.207]  Obviously it's our fault.
[00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:31.652]  They actually put out an article, and this is K-O-U-W, why Alex Jones, right-wing conspiracy theorist, is obsessed with this Seattle school.
[00:37:32.469 --> 00:37:38.295]  In our original article about this issue, we didn't even mention the school because I didn't know the school.
[00:37:38.295 --> 00:37:44.302]  Paul, I was going to say, I saw this story and I said, I've never heard of this school in my life.
[00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.839]  But we're obsessed with it apparently.
[00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:55.484]  And our article about this issue came out after PewDiePie had retweeted the viral video.
[00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:58.566]  After it had already gone viral on Twitter the night before.
[00:37:58.566 --> 00:38:00.768]  So we hadn't even covered this.
[00:38:00.768 --> 00:38:03.150]  Obviously they claim, oh we got threats from some people.
[00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:08.874]  We didn't even name the school, didn't even know the school, didn't even know the name of the teacher, didn't name it.
[00:38:08.874 --> 00:38:10.615]  Oh, but we're obsessed.
[00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:16.219]  And it's those Pizzagate conspiracy theorists, once again, causing problems for people.
[00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:18.701]  Total abject fake news.
[00:38:18.701 --> 00:38:20.082]  On top of it, this article.
[00:38:20.743 --> 00:38:23.024]  Doesn't even name PewDiePie.
[00:38:23.024 --> 00:38:24.765]  They don't even know who he is.
[00:38:24.765 --> 00:38:28.728]  They just say, oh, it's some YouTuber who is an anti-Semite.
[00:38:28.728 --> 00:38:30.809]  The guy's world famous.
[00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.890]  He's a globally famous entertainer.
[00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.551]  He got 77 million subscribers.
[00:38:35.551 --> 00:38:37.452]  He's in the news every single day.
[00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:39.073]  They can't even name him.
[00:38:39.073 --> 00:38:42.215]  Similar with the Vox hit piece last week.
[00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:44.657]  They couldn't even spell PewDiePie correctly.
[00:38:44.657 --> 00:38:46.938]  It was like PiediePew, PewDiePew.
[00:38:46.938 --> 00:38:48.619]  They couldn't even get his name right.
[00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:55.484]  And they're talking about him being an anti-Semite and literally radicalizing the youth on YouTube.
[00:38:55.484 --> 00:39:01.950]  They literally accuse him of raising this neo-Nazi army which is being radicalized on YouTube.
[00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:06.013]  Of course, they want to take out the rest of us by guilt, by association.
[00:39:06.013 --> 00:39:07.735]  They also want to take down PewDiePie.
[00:39:08.519 --> 00:39:16.165]  But again, it's because they don't know how to meme, and they're terrified of somebody in a position of influence who they don't control.
[00:39:16.165 --> 00:39:17.126]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:39:19.727 --> 00:39:22.629]  From KUOW.
[00:39:22.629 --> 00:39:26.592]  Why Alex Jones, right-wing conspiracy theorist, is obsessed with the Seattle School.
[00:39:26.592 --> 00:39:27.833]  This is the most fake news.
[00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:29.814]  I don't think Alex Jones has ever heard of this school.
[00:39:29.814 --> 00:39:31.295]  I'd never heard of this school.
[00:39:31.295 --> 00:39:32.716]  And they blame everything on us.
[00:39:32.716 --> 00:39:36.839]  They even claim that they're putting in extra security because of us!
[00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:38.840]  We've never even heard of this place!
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.422]  And then they say... They didn't even name it.
[00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:41.783]  And then they say, they say...
[00:39:42.943 --> 00:39:56.488]  Uh, you know, PootiePoo, his name is PootiePoo, PootiePoo is bad for putting anti-Semitic and Nazi imagery in his videos, when again, it's not even that, it's some goofy name, or is it PieDiePie?
[00:39:56.488 --> 00:40:05.671]  So that's like, Paul, that's like, if you went to the movie theaters in, I guess it was like 2014 or something, and you laughed at Inglourious Bastards, or if you, you know,
[00:40:07.732 --> 00:40:11.014]  Film the movie if you showed the movie and glorious bastards at your movie theater.
[00:40:11.014 --> 00:40:14.196]  You must be a Nazi, too You know, I mean, what are we gonna do about that?
[00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:33.429]  Yeah, and of course the initial controversy was based on the fact that PewDiePie was recommending other channels on one of his videos one of those channels had an anime review which he liked so he gave them a shout out said this I really enjoyed this anime review and because this channel had other questionable content and
[00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:37.551]  That means that he was promoting white supremacist neo-Nazi ideology.
[00:40:37.551 --> 00:40:43.054]  It's like the logical leap it takes to get to that level is absolutely insane.
[00:40:43.054 --> 00:40:46.376]  Look, they don't even understand the internet at this point.
[00:40:46.376 --> 00:40:50.838]  They've confused like a bunch of teenagers who engage in edgy banter.
[00:40:51.378 --> 00:40:54.782]  For an actual fascist takeover of society.
[00:40:54.782 --> 00:40:57.425]  And we see this with TikTok as well.
[00:40:57.425 --> 00:41:04.554]  Like 99% of TikTok, which is an app, where basically teenagers just dance around and lip sync to videos.
[00:41:04.554 --> 00:41:06.256]  99% of it is just mindless entertainment.
[00:41:06.816 --> 00:41:16.221]  There's like 1% of it which is like edgy banter, which is political in some senses and traditionalist and right-wing in some senses.
[00:41:16.221 --> 00:41:18.262]  They call it ironic conservatism.
[00:41:18.262 --> 00:41:23.245]  So because 1% is that, not even 1%, it's probably 0.2% or something.
[00:41:23.245 --> 00:41:24.806]  I put out a video on Monday saying
[00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:27.305]  And I'll use the exact quote.
[00:41:27.305 --> 00:41:28.726]  Monday I said this.
[00:41:28.726 --> 00:41:31.406]  The same thing they're doing to PewDiePie, they'll do to TikTok.
[00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:36.167]  TikTok is a platform for hate speech, bullying, misogyny, racism, a gateway drug to the alt-right.
[00:41:36.167 --> 00:41:37.007]  You're gonna hear it all.
[00:41:37.007 --> 00:41:39.408]  That's what I said on December 17th.
[00:41:39.408 --> 00:41:48.310]  December 18th, Vice reports TikTok, which is mega popular with children and teens, has a problem with blatant violent white supremacy and Nazism.
[00:41:49.036 --> 00:42:03.670]  Literally the day after they came out with that exact hit piece because there's a tiny minority of people who use TikTok for edgy political banter and it's mainly conservative, it's mainly quote right-wing.
[00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:14.780]  So now they're trying to take down TikTok because again they don't understand it, vice, box, they're not on it, they can't control it and they hate the people who are on it because they don't care about
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.462]  Being de-platformed.
[00:42:16.462 --> 00:42:19.307]  They don't care about being social media stars.
[00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:22.211]  Generation Z is the most conservative since World War 2.
[00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:23.774]  And they like this edgy banter.
[00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.256]  They like to get political.
[00:42:25.256 --> 00:42:28.301]  The mainstream media doesn't like that because they can't control it.
[00:42:29.417 --> 00:42:38.624]  You know, the amazing thing about these leftists, these social justice warrior virtue signaling leftists, Paul, they are turning into everything they claim to hate.
[00:42:38.624 --> 00:42:44.669]  They are turning into the intolerant, racist you-know-whats that they claim to be against.
[00:42:44.669 --> 00:42:45.649]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:42:45.649 --> 00:42:49.732]  You can't even have a free speech wall at Eastern Michigan University.
[00:42:49.732 --> 00:42:51.954]  Somebody wrote, it's okay to be white on a free speech wall.
[00:42:51.954 --> 00:42:54.376]  They said, we will not stand for this.
[00:42:54.376 --> 00:42:58.079]  These people have become the most racist anti-free speech garbage in America.
[00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:05.080]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:17.283]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:43:17.283 --> 00:43:27.266]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:43:27.266 --> 00:43:27.866]  Everybody knows
[00:43:28.786 --> 00:43:36.034]  Who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[00:43:36.034 --> 00:43:38.717]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:43:38.717 --> 00:43:42.521]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:43:42.521 --> 00:43:43.361]  2018 has been insane.
[00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:46.845]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker.
[00:43:46.845 --> 00:43:49.808]  And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.364]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[00:43:54.364 --> 00:43:58.448]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.

[00:45:00.424 --> 00:45:05.947]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:45:05.947 --> 00:45:15.693]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:45:15.693 --> 00:45:23.798]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:45:24.807 --> 00:45:32.713]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:45:32.713 --> 00:45:35.816]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:37.317]  It really is amazing.
[00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:44.023]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:45:44.023 --> 00:45:46.705]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.537]  Of Infowars.
[00:45:49.537 --> 00:45:50.839]  So please spread the links.
[00:45:50.839 --> 00:45:54.203]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[00:45:54.203 --> 00:45:57.507]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:45:57.507 --> 00:45:58.829]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:59.770]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:46:04.469 --> 00:46:10.194]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:46:10.194 --> 00:46:18.060]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.223]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:46:21.403 --> 00:46:29.446]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:46:29.446 --> 00:46:38.590]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.272]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract,
[00:46:42.452 --> 00:46:43.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:15.627 --> 00:47:22.109]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:24.410]  It's Owen Troyer.
[00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:30.192]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.192 --> 00:47:31.793]  So there have been stories about
[00:47:32.777 --> 00:47:38.859]  European women and American women who want to do a virtue signaling experiment.
[00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:44.622]  And so they go to the Middle East or some Muslim country and they say, oh, you know, I'm going to backpack through here.
[00:47:44.622 --> 00:47:47.423]  I'm going to walk through here and everything's going to be great.
[00:47:47.423 --> 00:47:49.924]  And, you know, this is not something I'm celebrating.
[00:47:49.924 --> 00:47:51.764]  This is sad.
[00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:55.286]  But these women end up, a few of them have been raped and murdered.
[00:47:56.352 --> 00:48:05.476]  There was one even that was, I believe it was in Italy, a nice young woman who became friends with one of the migrants that was in this camp from Northern Africa.
[00:48:05.476 --> 00:48:09.117]  And, you know, she eventually disappeared one day and, you know, it wasn't good for her either.
[00:48:09.117 --> 00:48:10.978]  But there's another story.
[00:48:10.978 --> 00:48:15.760]  Backpackers found murdered at Morocco hiking spot.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.301]  Paul, you've got this story down.
[00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:21.182]  You just brought this to my attention.
[00:48:21.182 --> 00:48:22.963]  What happened here to these backpackers?
[00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:31.659]  Yeah, so basically it was two Scandinavian tourists, one Danish, one Norwegian, both women in their 20s.
[00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:36.244]  They went to this remote region of Morocco, the High Atlas Mountains.
[00:48:36.244 --> 00:48:38.307]  So they were mountain climbing, they were hiking.
[00:48:39.292 --> 00:48:42.894]  Ended up being raped and beheaded by ISIS.
[00:48:42.894 --> 00:48:46.336]  It turns out today that it almost certainly was a terror attack.
[00:48:46.336 --> 00:48:54.160]  It was politically motivated, and that these murders, absolutely tragic, were a result of a terror attack.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.223]  They're talking about, there's video that's been circulating where they're actually being beheaded.
[00:48:59.223 --> 00:49:01.484]  I don't know if that's accurate, I haven't seen it.
[00:49:01.484 --> 00:49:04.006]  But absolutely tragic, obviously, but again,
[00:49:05.032 --> 00:49:18.621]  Owen, the question is, would you let your wife, your girlfriend, your daughter, go backpacking in a remote region in an Islamic country where ISIS militants are present, on their own, without a man?
[00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:23.364]  Now, I don't want to promote male chaperone culture, and I don't want to victim blame.
[00:49:23.364 --> 00:49:28.608]  Obviously, any woman should be able to do that, but in reality, we live in a very dangerous world.
[00:49:28.608 --> 00:49:32.530]  Wait a second, wait a second, Paul, Paul, Paul, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't, hold on, hold on.
[00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.272]  Male chaperone culture.
[00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.875]  No, no, but here's the funny thing, here's the funny thing.
[00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:40.857]  That's actually Islam.
[00:49:40.857 --> 00:49:41.878]  Yeah.
[00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:44.560]  No, that's how you have to behave in their country is what I'm saying.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.744]  You shouldn't have to, but we're of the understanding that that's how you have to behave.
[00:49:48.744 --> 00:49:51.006]  So wait, so you're actually right though, you're actually right.
[00:49:51.006 --> 00:49:54.749]  If these ladies would have actually been Muslim, they would have had to have their man with them.
[00:49:56.147 --> 00:49:57.567]  Oh, almost certainly, yeah.
[00:49:57.567 --> 00:49:59.168]  But this is the point.
[00:49:59.168 --> 00:50:05.850]  I don't know if they were political in this instance, and obviously this is tragic and horrible, but you mentioned the previous cases.
[00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:13.212]  I had a headline up on the Tuesday show, murdered by ISIS round-the-world cyclist couple who wrote of kind lovely people in travel blog.
[00:50:13.212 --> 00:50:22.194]  This was a liberal couple, they were vegans, they were very left-wing, they went on a cycling trip through North Africa, through the Balkans, through the Middle East.
[00:50:22.955 --> 00:50:33.048]  And they wrote on their own blog, let me read this, before they were mowed down in a vehicle by ISIS and killed by terrorists, they wrote, quote, you read the papers.
[00:50:33.993 --> 00:50:36.956]  Then you're led to believe that the world is a big scary place.
[00:50:36.956 --> 00:50:39.518]  People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted.
[00:50:39.518 --> 00:50:40.378]  People are bad.
[00:50:40.378 --> 00:50:41.519]  People are evil.
[00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:42.500]  I don't buy it.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:52.248]  Evil is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own.
[00:50:52.248 --> 00:50:53.589]  By and large, humans are kind.
[00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:56.612]  Self-interested, sometimes myopic, sometimes... but kind.
[00:50:56.612 --> 00:50:58.313]  Generous and wonderful and kind.
[00:50:58.313 --> 00:51:01.176]  No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.
[00:51:02.045 --> 00:51:07.807]  A few weeks later, mown down in a vehicle by ISIS, dead, murdered, okay?
[00:51:07.807 --> 00:51:19.750]  They made the point, our understanding of different cultures, that we're bigoted because we just can't understand different cultures being complex, being, you know, more diverse than ours.
[00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:27.152]  Now, evil exists in the world, you have to have this in mind, you have to be cognizant of this if you travel to these dangerous places in the world.
[00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:30.215]  And it's not as if they didn't know about it, Owen.
[00:51:30.215 --> 00:51:33.156]  When I did a video about this, I went through all their blogs.
[00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.697]  They did like 40 blogs.
[00:51:34.697 --> 00:51:36.858]  I probably went through like half of them.
[00:51:36.858 --> 00:51:42.761]  And in almost every place they visit, in Morocco especially, they get harassed.
[00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:45.402]  They get things stolen from them.
[00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.822]  They get run down by vehicles.
[00:51:46.822 --> 00:51:49.904]  In one case, a guy tried to run them over in his vehicle.
[00:51:49.904 --> 00:51:51.585]  Tried to squash them.
[00:51:51.585 --> 00:51:54.186]  His wife, his partner gets harassed.
[00:51:54.186 --> 00:51:57.087]  They get harassed by people when they refuse to take pictures with them.
[00:51:57.822 --> 00:51:59.083]  So you look at their blog.
[00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:03.986]  In almost every country, they get stalked, they get harassed, they get violent threats.
[00:52:03.986 --> 00:52:08.810]  And yet they come out and they talk to the media and say, oh, the world's not a bad place.
[00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:09.690]  People aren't evil.
[00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.913]  It's just our misunderstanding of other cultures.
[00:52:12.913 --> 00:52:13.813]  No!
[00:52:13.813 --> 00:52:16.135]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:52:16.135 --> 00:52:19.037]  Some countries are safer than others.
[00:52:19.037 --> 00:52:24.481]  It's not to say you're not going to get murdered or harassed in any other, you know, Western, white, European country or whatever.
[00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:28.022]  But some places are safer than others, that's a fact.
[00:52:28.022 --> 00:52:40.766]  If you go to a remote area in Tajikistan or Morocco or Islamic countries and you don't have, you know, a sense of wariness at least, then you're making a rod for your own back.
[00:52:40.766 --> 00:52:51.289]  So again, it ties into this cultural relativist, moral relativist idea that the world is a utopia and that just so long as we radiate love that we're going to be fine, we're going to be okay.
[00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:52.710]  You have to have discernment.
[00:52:53.030 --> 00:53:01.473]  They've had this, it's like the dodo bird, because they've become so, they've had no real threats to them or they don't even realize what's going on in the real world.
[00:53:01.473 --> 00:53:06.215]  They just walk up to like a T-Rex like, oh hey, and try to pet it and then it eats them.
[00:53:06.215 --> 00:53:08.916]  But I want to have a new word.
[00:53:08.916 --> 00:53:11.616]  I want to coin a new phrase right here, Paul.
[00:53:11.616 --> 00:53:12.597]  I've been thinking about this.
[00:53:13.666 --> 00:53:16.308]  Cultural supremacy.
[00:53:16.308 --> 00:53:19.210]  Cultural supremacy.
[00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.991]  Everybody wants to talk about white supremacy or this supremacy, that supremacy.
[00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:24.193]  How about cultural supremacy?
[00:53:24.193 --> 00:53:28.275]  I am a proud Western culture supremacist.
[00:53:28.275 --> 00:53:31.517]  Suck on that!
[00:53:31.517 --> 00:53:32.058]  Exactly.
[00:53:32.058 --> 00:53:34.659]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:53:34.659 --> 00:53:36.441]  You mentioned another story.
[00:53:36.441 --> 00:53:37.301]  And this was 2008.
[00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:39.823]  Another example of this.
[00:53:39.823 --> 00:53:40.563]  New York Times.
[00:53:40.563 --> 00:53:43.165]  Performance artist killed on P-Strip is mourned.
[00:53:43.903 --> 00:53:56.909]  OK, so this performance artist went through the Balkans, the Middle East, to prove that Islam is a religion of peace, to send a message of peace and, quote, marriage between different peoples and nations.
[00:53:56.909 --> 00:53:57.990]  What happened?
[00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.830]  Raped and killed.
[00:53:59.853 --> 00:54:02.194]  You'd have case after case like this.
[00:54:02.194 --> 00:54:06.736]  In fact, I'm going to do a big video on this in the near future, tying them all together.
[00:54:06.736 --> 00:54:10.198]  And it is moral relativism, it's cultural relativism.
[00:54:10.198 --> 00:54:17.121]  You also had the case in Sweden, you probably remember this one, where there was a refugee who was set to be deported.
[00:54:17.121 --> 00:54:28.346]  He was on the plane and this 18 year old, I think it was, Swedish left-wing activist, literally grounded the plane by causing a disturbance on the plane to prevent him from being deported.
[00:54:28.926 --> 00:54:30.908]  Why was he being deported?
[00:54:30.908 --> 00:54:36.333]  Turned out because he tried to strangle his own wife and kids to death with a power cord.
[00:54:36.333 --> 00:54:39.096]  But that's his religion, so you have to be tolerant.
[00:54:39.096 --> 00:54:39.877]  It's his culture, right?
[00:54:39.877 --> 00:54:40.638]  Yeah.
[00:54:40.638 --> 00:54:40.758]  Yeah.
[00:54:41.508 --> 00:54:44.869]  So, same thing with Bacha Barsi in Afghanistan again.
[00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:47.930]  This is old men raping children.
[00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.151]  Oh, it's just part of that culture.
[00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:53.272]  Well, unfortunately, Paul, you're going to have a lot of material for that video, unfortunately.
[00:54:53.272 --> 00:54:58.654]  So, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson is going to put up a new video breaking all this down on his channel Prison Planet.
[00:54:58.654 --> 00:55:00.355]  Paul, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:55:00.355 --> 00:55:02.055]  We'll be looking forward to that video.
[00:55:02.055 --> 00:55:06.477]  And I know there's a lot of content, you have a lot of content to go through to put into that video.
[00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:09.440]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, there goes the great Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.184]  Be on the lookout for his newest YouTube video and be sure to share that far and wide.
[00:55:13.184 --> 00:55:15.827]  Believe us, they want him banned as well.
[00:55:15.827 --> 00:55:20.772]  Now, we're going to go to the most banned and censored individual on the internet, the host of this show, who's out.
[00:55:20.772 --> 00:55:27.880]  I'm filling in for Alex today, but he has just given us a new report that he's filed over audio.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:36.703]  And so we are now going to Alex Jones and we'll be right back on the other side of that with more news and Roger Stone with an exclusive in studio.
[00:55:36.703 --> 00:55:40.685]  But here is the latest from Alex Jones.
[00:55:40.685 --> 00:55:43.546]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Alex Jones.
[00:55:43.546 --> 00:55:57.291]  Coming up in the next hour, Roger Stone is going to be in studio to relay to you some of the most important, earth-shaking news that we have ever broken down on this live broadcast.
[00:55:58.496 --> 00:56:11.117]  Roger Stone had dinner with a national media figure who's very close to the president, who told him last week that the deep state is going to make their criminal move to remove him
[00:56:12.566 --> 00:56:15.908]  That they're also trying to crash the stock market, obviously.
[00:56:15.908 --> 00:56:22.131]  That the level of Chinese Communist penetration of the nation is just flabbergasting to the President.
[00:56:22.131 --> 00:56:37.640]  The President has faith in the American people that if they illegally try to remove him from office, with this whole fake Russiagate coup and the rest of it, that the American people will rise up with their firearms and resist the deep state.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:46.163]  These are incredible, incredible, incredible statements and are of maximum import.
[00:56:46.163 --> 00:56:51.184]  Please tell everyone you know to tune in now to mfulwars.com forward slash show.
[00:56:51.184 --> 00:56:53.425]  I'm Alex Jones on the road with my family.
[00:56:53.425 --> 00:56:56.566]  I'll be breaking in live as all this unfolds as well.
[00:56:56.566 --> 00:56:57.807]  This is not a drill.
[00:56:57.807 --> 00:56:58.787]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:56:58.787 --> 00:57:00.108]  This is the real deal.
[00:57:00.108 --> 00:57:01.888]  America at the crossroads.
[00:57:01.888 --> 00:57:03.849]  We go forward or the Republic dies.
[00:57:04.449 --> 00:57:05.350]  Choose a side.
[00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.073]  With America, nationalism or globalism?
[00:57:08.073 --> 00:57:12.737]  A pro-human future or a technocracy nightmare future?
[00:57:12.737 --> 00:57:15.820]  Again, Roger Stone with the World Exclusive Breakdown.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:21.545]  Now the President must strike back immediately with declassification to avert the Civil War.
[00:57:21.545 --> 00:57:23.667]  I'm Alex Jones praying for peace.
[00:57:23.667 --> 00:57:28.352]  Preparing to defend our Republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:35.117]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone on the other side of this break.
[00:57:35.117 --> 00:57:36.558]  There is no doubt.
[00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:39.562]  It is the American Revolution 2.0.
[00:57:39.562 --> 00:57:40.483]  It's going on.
[00:57:40.483 --> 00:57:43.827]  It's happening right now.
[00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.028]  Hope you don't miss it.
[00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:46.430]  It's thrilling.
[00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.251]  It's thrilling, alright.
[00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:54.496]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:57:54.496 --> 00:57:56.438]  That's the globalist only hope.
[00:57:56.438 --> 00:58:10.390]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future.
[00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:15.912]  And your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[00:58:15.912 --> 00:58:22.155]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:58:22.155 --> 00:58:27.157]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[00:58:27.817 --> 00:58:30.298]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[00:58:30.298 --> 00:58:31.439]  Every order gets free shipping.
[00:58:31.439 --> 00:58:34.621]  Every order gets 50 to 75 percent off in total clearance.
[00:58:34.621 --> 00:58:41.665]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year.
[00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:43.546]  To not just fight, but to expand.
[00:58:43.546 --> 00:58:44.266]  We're on the march.
[00:58:44.266 --> 00:58:45.527]  The empire's on the run.
[00:58:45.527 --> 00:58:46.487]  I salute you all.
[00:58:46.487 --> 00:58:47.988]  Now please take action at m4store.com.
[00:58:50.612 --> 00:58:56.116]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:58:56.116 --> 00:59:05.884]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:59:05.884 --> 00:59:13.991]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:22.882]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:59:22.882 --> 00:59:25.983]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:59:25.983 --> 00:59:27.483]  It really is amazing.
[00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:34.185]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:59:34.185 --> 00:59:36.886]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:39.724]  Of Infowars.
[00:59:39.724 --> 00:59:41.025]  So please spread the links.
[00:59:41.025 --> 00:59:44.367]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:44.367 --> 00:59:47.669]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:59:47.669 --> 00:59:49.010]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:53.372]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:59:53.372 --> 00:59:55.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.353 --> 01:00:32.979]  Here's the deal.
[01:00:32.979 --> 01:00:46.068]  Americans are finally starting to realize just how corrupt the media and the government has become.
[01:00:46.068 --> 01:00:47.609]  Of course, it's not the government.
[01:00:47.609 --> 01:00:52.293]  It's a bunch of unelected bureaucrats thinking they're above the law.
[01:00:53.353 --> 01:01:03.297]  Of course, I guess when you've been above the law for so long, a la Hillary Clinton, I suppose there's a justification for that belief.
[01:01:03.297 --> 01:01:09.740]  You have the Democrat Party that's pretty much owned by the Chinese, at least at the very top.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.882]  You have the corporate media that, I mean, who knows?
[01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:22.066]  I mean, you can see who the corporate media, for example, like, I should spend, I mean, it's almost like we really, I mean,
[01:01:23.405 --> 01:01:24.306]  How do you decide?
[01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:31.557]  I was thinking about this today when I was rendezvousing with Alex.
[01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:36.304]  How do we decide what is the biggest news?
[01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:44.976]  And it's really all about the moment, and all about trends, and all about general interest.
[01:01:44.976 --> 01:01:48.759]  And so, that's why we talk about the American Revolution happening right now.
[01:01:48.759 --> 01:01:52.422]  That's why we talk about the Cold Civil War that's going on right now in the White House.
[01:01:52.422 --> 01:01:56.385]  For example, something is happening, literally right now, in the White House.
[01:01:57.305 --> 01:02:04.367]  President Trump has called an emergency meeting and stopped a congressional, I think, vote or something from going on.
[01:02:04.367 --> 01:02:09.108]  Trump stopped the whole thing and called in the House GOP for an emergency meeting.
[01:02:09.108 --> 01:02:11.188]  So, I mean, that stuff is happening.
[01:02:11.188 --> 01:02:15.969]  That's the Cold Civil War going on with the Democrats trying to destroy America, trying to destroy Trump.
[01:02:15.969 --> 01:02:18.610]  And then, of course, the media.
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:24.891]  For example, there's practically zero interest in a report
[01:02:25.703 --> 01:02:28.484]  When it comes to the 5G technology that they're about to roll out.
[01:02:28.484 --> 01:02:30.705]  Which they're gonna do it!
[01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:41.368]  They just announced yesterday, Steve Scalise, if you guys can find the tweet, Steve Scalise, all happy, how AT&T is about to launch their 5G full-on rollout for 2019.
[01:02:41.368 --> 01:02:47.049]  I think it was like 20 or 40 cities, they're getting ready to roll it out.
[01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:48.730]  And they're all celebrating it.
[01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:54.392]  You had Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, excited about the 5G rollout.
[01:02:54.392 --> 01:02:55.232]  Oh, it's so great!
[01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:02.414]  No, it's not.
[01:03:02.414 --> 01:03:04.876]  But see, yeah, there it is right there.
[01:03:04.876 --> 01:03:14.042]  AT&T turns on its mobile 5G network tomorrow, starting with 12 cities.
[01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:14.462]  You know what, guys?
[01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:20.346]  Go ahead and print that out for me, too, along with the Gateway Pundit story about President Trump's emergency meeting that he just called.
[01:03:20.346 --> 01:03:21.667]  So, but here's what I'm saying.
[01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:24.909]  This story impacts all of us.
[01:03:24.909 --> 01:03:26.190]  This is not political.
[01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.131]  There's no bias.
[01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:39.966]  Whether you're a Libertarian, a Republican, or a Democrat, that 5G cell phone wave is going to radiate you and mess you up.
[01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:41.287]  Mess your DNA up.
[01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:42.888]  Mess your lineage DNA up.
[01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:44.449]  Oh yeah!
[01:03:44.449 --> 01:03:55.058]  You can be the best, most tolerant liberal in America, and that 5G is still going to fry you like a chicken.
[01:03:55.058 --> 01:03:56.919]  But there's no interest.
[01:03:56.919 --> 01:03:57.980]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[01:03:59.056 --> 01:04:02.437]  But everybody wants a faster cell phone.
[01:04:02.437 --> 01:04:06.519]  So give me that 5G, baby.
[01:04:06.519 --> 01:04:09.740]  And we should all be covering that and focusing on that, but we don't.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.400]  Because why?
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.922]  Well, because we're trying to save America right now, and we've got such a corrupt media.
[01:04:14.922 --> 01:04:15.682]  Oh, but here's my point.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.880]  It just shows you.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:31.324]  Why do you think... I mean, you know, you shouldn't have to be a genius or like some sort of astrophysicist to figure this out, but why do you think cable news wouldn't want to cover 5G, at least perhaps negatively?
[01:04:31.324 --> 01:04:32.464]  Hmm, let's see.
[01:04:32.464 --> 01:04:34.165]  Oh, it's a commercial.
[01:04:34.165 --> 01:04:35.505]  New plan from Verizon.
[01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.886]  Fastest speeds in the Internet.
[01:04:37.886 --> 01:04:38.426]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:04:39.728 --> 01:04:41.971]  AT&T's new cell phone.
[01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:43.232]  Best coverage.
[01:04:43.232 --> 01:04:44.393]  Cricket wireless.
[01:04:44.393 --> 01:04:46.075]  T-Mobile.
[01:04:46.075 --> 01:04:50.119]  Oh, now I know why Fox News doesn't want to talk about 5G.
[01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.802]  Now I know why the cable news doesn't want to talk about 5G.
[01:04:52.802 --> 01:04:54.944]  It's making them filthy rich!
[01:04:54.944 --> 01:04:56.566]  Roger Stone on the other side, Exclusive News.
[01:04:58.467 --> 01:05:03.990]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:13.734]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:05:13.734 --> 01:05:21.858]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.

[01:05:33.853 --> 01:05:35.354]  It really is amazing.

[01:05:42.057 --> 01:05:44.679]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:47.573]  Of InfoWars.
[01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:48.875]  So please spread the links.
[01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:52.241]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:55.546]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:05:55.546 --> 01:05:56.869]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:57.991]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:06.828]  We've got it.
[01:06:06.828 --> 01:06:11.233]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:16.858]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:33.480]  The number two talk show host in the country on television and who is a patriot, a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones right now in front of all of us.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:44.310]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:53.483]  In fact, it came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[01:06:53.483 --> 01:06:55.665]  He was right under me on the list.
[01:06:55.665 --> 01:07:01.169]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:01.169 --> 01:07:01.509]  That's why.
[01:07:02.813 --> 01:07:04.474]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[01:07:04.474 --> 01:07:07.737]  And I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:11.600]  He was already obviously covering all that on air.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.644]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[01:07:15.644 --> 01:07:19.487]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:28.801]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:36.529]  And the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:42.274]  But today we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the U.S.
[01:07:43.168 --> 01:07:59.575]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.895]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[01:08:01.895 --> 01:08:06.817]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes on a company.
[01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:10.539]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[01:08:11.892 --> 01:08:14.813]  We go back to 10 years ago, seems like ancient history now.
[01:08:14.813 --> 01:08:19.033]  Lou Dobbs had about 8, 9 million viewers a night.
[01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:21.374]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[01:08:21.374 --> 01:08:23.634]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[01:08:23.634 --> 01:08:24.614]  And what was he talking about?
[01:08:24.614 --> 01:08:29.075]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[01:08:29.075 --> 01:08:31.415]  He was going off their own documents.
[01:08:31.415 --> 01:08:36.376]  Lou Dobbs was taken off the air because he was number one, because he was telling the truth and he was a patriot.
[01:08:36.376 --> 01:08:39.457]  Now he's relegated to Fox business with maybe a million viewers.
[01:08:40.712 --> 01:08:43.894]  And Tucker Carlson is next, and then Sean Hannity.
[01:08:43.894 --> 01:08:47.435]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:54.058]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[01:08:54.058 --> 01:08:54.939]  And here's why.
[01:08:54.939 --> 01:08:59.141]  Our country's economy is becoming more automated and tech-centered by the day.
[01:08:59.141 --> 01:09:03.103]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:06.945]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[01:09:07.865 --> 01:09:12.710]  Nice people, no one doubts that, but as an economic matter, this is insane.
[01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:15.792]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:19.275]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[01:09:19.275 --> 01:09:26.662]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.765]  Immigration is a form of atonement.
[01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.467]  So if you import the third world, you are making it.
[01:09:33.388 --> 01:09:36.432]  More poor, more dirty, more divided.
[01:09:36.432 --> 01:09:42.280]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.923]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas.
[01:09:44.923 --> 01:09:48.608]  Because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[01:09:49.867 --> 01:09:53.951]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[01:09:53.951 --> 01:09:58.014]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous.
[01:09:58.014 --> 01:10:05.601]  Where San Francisco jury is letting an illegal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white, we have diversity signal.
[01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.443]  This is the real cancer.
[01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:13.288]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds and they have
[01:10:14.769 --> 01:10:19.212]  Gay bars have had little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[01:10:19.212 --> 01:10:25.355]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.377]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:31.038]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:10:31.038 --> 01:10:31.959]  We have to unify.
[01:10:31.959 --> 01:10:36.141]  Truthfully, just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:40.503]  I can guarantee you this, at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, we're not backing down.
[01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.344]  We're doubling down.
[01:10:43.593 --> 01:10:53.620]  So Roger Stone is in studio with us right now and Roger Muller is now coming after you and again you know the whole thing with this that frustrates me Roger.
[01:10:54.588 --> 01:11:02.312]  You look at some of the names that Mueller is going after, yourself, Manafort, Corsi, Flynn, Papadopoulos.
[01:11:02.312 --> 01:11:10.976]  There would be zero interest in any of these individuals, including yourself, from the FBI or anybody, if it wasn't for Donald Trump.
[01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:16.939]  But you notice how there's nothing they have on Trump, there's nothing that they have when it comes to Russia.
[01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:21.121]  They just have some associates of Trump that they're trying to destroy to then sell Trump out.
[01:11:22.322 --> 01:11:30.228]  It really shows you how, I mean, to me it just totally proves that this whole thing is a political witch hunt by the fact that they're trying to go after all these men, including you.
[01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:32.029]  It has nothing to do with Russia.
[01:11:32.029 --> 01:11:35.472]  Really nothing, I mean, nothing to do with Trump other than you're associated with him.
[01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:37.434]  And it's all to try to destroy Trump.
[01:11:37.434 --> 01:11:41.697]  Not to protect elections, not to protect American sovereignty, nothing, just to destroy Trump.
[01:11:42.281 --> 01:11:46.503]  You know, Owen, I haven't seen anything like this since 1974.
[01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:53.767]  The media tsunami of fake news focusing on a Russian real estate deal that never really happened.
[01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:56.968]  The Trump Foundation in New York.
[01:11:56.968 --> 01:12:01.150]  The constant barrage of attacks on the president.
[01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:05.933]  The inexorable move towards impeachment, which I think is a silent coup.
[01:12:06.873 --> 01:12:10.316]  And in the face of this, the president has been entirely sanguine.
[01:12:10.316 --> 01:12:12.618]  I think we know the reason for that.
[01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:28.172]  I point out to you a story about a week ago where he said, I believe correctly, that if there's an effort to illegitimately undo the results of the last election, if they trump up phony charges as the basis for impeachment, there'll be a revolt.
[01:12:28.792 --> 01:12:38.776]  The President has told at least two people that I know, a very prominent publisher and another Trump intimate, that he just doesn't think the American people will stand for it.
[01:12:38.776 --> 01:12:43.057]  That the American people are well armed and he believes there will be an insurrection.
[01:12:43.057 --> 01:12:49.680]  I don't think he's advocating an insurrection, but I think he realizes that they will cause a civil war in this country.
[01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:53.996]  Well, and Roger, look, you and I have been talking about this for months, really.
[01:12:53.996 --> 01:12:57.399]  I mean, this has been a talking point that we've had because, to me, it's just common sense.
[01:12:57.399 --> 01:12:59.622]  I mean, look at the support President Trump has.
[01:12:59.622 --> 01:13:01.864]  Look at the support he has when he goes to rallies.
[01:13:01.864 --> 01:13:06.829]  Tens of thousands of people, they stand outside for days, literally, in the rain.
[01:13:06.829 --> 01:13:10.593]  Of course these people are going to come to Trump's defense should they try to remove him.
[01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:12.055]  Of course there's going to be a revolt.
[01:13:12.515 --> 01:13:13.576]  Well, it's not 1974.
[01:13:13.576 --> 01:13:19.158]  See, in 1974 we had a completely controlled, monolithic media.
[01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:20.459]  You had three major networks.
[01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:21.039]  That was it.
[01:13:21.039 --> 01:13:23.180]  You had a couple of national newspapers.
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:26.862]  This is why they are so desperate to snuff InfoWars.com.
[01:13:26.862 --> 01:13:28.683]  It's why they want to shut us down.
[01:13:28.683 --> 01:13:31.244]  Because they realize that we're the modern...
[01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:40.592]  They realize that there will be a clarion call across the country for civil disobedience at a minimum.
[01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:43.194]  And the president knows that there will be an uprising.
[01:13:43.194 --> 01:13:44.614]  There will be a revolt.
[01:13:44.614 --> 01:13:50.297]  And he has pointed out to several people that I know that we have a very well-armed populace.
[01:13:50.297 --> 01:13:52.098]  I don't think he wants a civil war.
[01:13:52.098 --> 01:14:01.682]  But he also does not want to be illegitimately decapitated by the deep state who is now in high gear in an effort to destroy him.
[01:14:02.122 --> 01:14:05.124]  You know, I mean, let's actually wargame this out here.
[01:14:05.124 --> 01:14:05.424]  You know what?
[01:14:05.424 --> 01:14:07.546]  Let's wargame this out in the next segment, Roger.
[01:14:07.546 --> 01:14:08.386]  We got just over a minute.
[01:14:08.386 --> 01:14:10.388]  So let's actually wargame this out.
[01:14:10.388 --> 01:14:11.168]  What would happen?
[01:14:11.168 --> 01:14:13.189]  Because I think we both have an idea.
[01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:15.831]  So let's come back in the next segment and actually wargame this out.
[01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:19.334]  What might happen should that situation ensue?
[01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:22.195]  But during this break, go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:14:22.195 --> 01:14:29.040]  Now, we have just announced we are going to extend our Christmas sale to the end of the year.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.700]  Now, this is huge.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.702]  It's one of the biggest sales, if not the biggest sale.
[01:14:32.162 --> 01:14:34.563]  We've ever had at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:14:56.175 --> 01:15:06.160]  Which is big if you're making a big order or if you're purchasing a big ticket item like an air filter or a water filter, which why wouldn't you get clean air and clean water for your family this Christmas?
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.142]  So free shipping storewide, that's extended till the new year.
[01:15:10.142 --> 01:15:11.803]  And a free t-shirt!
[01:15:12.423 --> 01:15:20.373]  With every order free t-shirt with every order that is also extended to the end of the new year.
[01:15:20.373 --> 01:15:31.126]  So we're going to take a short break here and when we come back with Roger Stone we're going to break down the possible scenario should the deep state remove Trump and should there be a revolt or what that means.
[01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:34.529]  Go to this short break, folks, because they're trying to censor us.
[01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:40.574]  They don't... Look, you can't even tune in to conservative television cable news without them telling you we should be at war in Syria, okay?
[01:15:40.574 --> 01:15:41.835]  We're not corporate news.
[01:15:41.835 --> 01:15:42.676]  We're independent.
[01:15:42.676 --> 01:15:43.937]  We're pro-America.
[01:15:43.937 --> 01:15:45.698]  Literally, to the core.
[01:15:45.698 --> 01:15:47.359]  That's why you have to support us, folks.
[01:15:47.359 --> 01:15:49.942]  So, take advantage of the huge specials at Infowarshow.com.
[01:15:49.942 --> 01:15:52.143]  Do not let them shut us down.

[01:15:54.705 --> 01:15:55.266]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:57.836 --> 01:15:59.037]  Hear that?
[01:15:59.037 --> 01:16:04.420]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.322]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.322 --> 01:16:10.904]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:18.489]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:17:27.319 --> 01:17:28.540]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:32.462]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.462 --> 01:17:34.003]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:34.003 --> 01:17:36.965]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:42.529]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.529 --> 01:17:43.730]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:46.672]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.672 --> 01:17:48.893]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:53.336]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:55.677]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.459 --> 01:18:03.983]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:18:03.983 --> 01:18:13.749]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:18:13.749 --> 01:18:21.835]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:30.733]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:18:30.733 --> 01:18:33.856]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:18:33.856 --> 01:18:35.357]  It really is amazing.
[01:18:35.357 --> 01:18:42.062]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:18:42.062 --> 01:18:44.745]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:18:46.033 --> 01:18:47.574]  Of Infowars.
[01:18:47.574 --> 01:18:48.875]  So please spread the links.
[01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:52.217]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[01:18:52.217 --> 01:18:55.538]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:18:55.538 --> 01:18:56.859]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:18:56.859 --> 01:18:57.960]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:18:58.499 --> 01:19:05.966]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.

[01:19:46.127 --> 01:19:47.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:21.804 --> 01:20:26.667]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:39.313]  It's Alex Jones, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:39.313 --> 01:20:40.834]  So here's how I see this going down.
[01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:44.373]  And I really believe it's organic, Roger.
[01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:47.997]  I don't think this is something where we have to go on air and be like, go to D.C.
[01:20:47.997 --> 01:20:49.318]  to defend Trump!
[01:20:49.318 --> 01:20:50.539]  I don't think that's going to be the case.
[01:20:50.539 --> 01:21:01.691]  I think if Trump is removed, whatever that means, people are going to flock to D.C., just like they flock to a Trump rally, and it's going to be some sort of national phenomenon, really.
[01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:03.813]  And what I think will happen, Roger,
[01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:14.026]  Is that the military, which most for the most part is behind President Trump, if not, you know, obviously nothing is fully behind Trump, but military mostly behind Donald Trump.
[01:21:14.026 --> 01:21:20.614]  And I think what you'd have is a situation where you basically have the president either impeach or remove from office somehow.
[01:21:21.593 --> 01:21:30.121]  But whatever the Democrats decide to put in there, or whoever gets put in there, it'll be like it never happened.
[01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:46.637]  Trump will still be the president, in theory, and the military will still listen to Trump, the American people will still listen to Trump, and I really think that even though it could get bad, Roger, that could be the death blow to the deep state to realize that the American people are not putting up with their garbage anymore.
[01:21:47.247 --> 01:21:51.330]  Well, I think I've been pretty clear about how I think this is going to go down.
[01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:55.794]  The House Democrats are going to vote articles of impeachment on Donald Trump, no matter what.
[01:21:56.707 --> 01:21:58.388]  They may have no evidence whatsoever.
[01:21:58.388 --> 01:22:02.551]  They certainly will have no evidence of Russian collusion because there is none.
[01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:08.515]  So they will vote articles of impeachment against the president on some other phony trumped up charge.
[01:22:08.515 --> 01:22:13.979]  Perhaps even a campaign finance related charge contained in Mr. Mueller's final report.
[01:22:13.979 --> 01:22:18.682]  We have the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission coming out saying this isn't even a crime.
[01:22:18.682 --> 01:22:21.864]  But that's the best they can do because they have no Russian collusion.
[01:22:21.864 --> 01:22:26.447]  Then you'll move to the Senate where it requires a two thirds vote to remove the president.
[01:22:28.128 --> 01:22:37.177]  What they would hope to do at that point is to ramp up a Kavanaugh-style insanity, a mass national hysteria about Donald Trump.
[01:22:37.177 --> 01:22:40.100]  But I think what they will find is it'll be like France in 1968.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.443]  The American people, the hard-working
[01:22:43.843 --> 01:22:48.464]  Middle-class, Trump-supporting American people, they too will travel to America.
[01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:51.344]  They too will engage in civil disobedience.
[01:22:51.344 --> 01:22:53.385]  They too will take to the streets.
[01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:58.186]  And you will have a major insurrection, which in turn will put pressure on the U.S.
[01:22:58.186 --> 01:23:04.647]  Senate, and I think the two-thirds vote, they'll be incapable of mustering.
[01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:10.208]  Now, if there is mass movement, mass mobilization on the left,
[01:23:10.828 --> 01:23:16.054]  And no mobilization on the right or among Trump supporters, perhaps they have a chance.
[01:23:16.054 --> 01:23:20.338]  But if the American people do what I think they will do, and I agree with you, it'll be indigenous.
[01:23:20.338 --> 01:23:26.505]  There'll be no call from the president or the vice president or Alex Jones or anyone else.
[01:23:26.505 --> 01:23:28.106]  It'll be unnecessary.
[01:23:28.106 --> 01:23:33.312]  It will be clear to the American people and patriots will head to Washington to flood the streets.
[01:23:34.192 --> 01:23:40.517]  Patriots will head to the offices of their congressmen, their senators, and demand that this farce be ended.
[01:23:40.517 --> 01:23:41.438]  Totally agree.
[01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:46.802]  And it'll almost be like the shot heard around the world part two, where people... Trump is so popular.
[01:23:46.802 --> 01:23:48.303]  Trump is supported around the world too.
[01:23:48.303 --> 01:23:49.945]  It's all this fake news acting like he's unpopular.
[01:23:50.385 --> 01:24:00.810]  And people around the world will see that Americans are finally standing up again, they're not deadweight watching the Kardashians on television every day, and they're trying to take back their democracy that had fallen so far.
[01:24:00.810 --> 01:24:07.354]  So I think it would be good for the world to see that as well, almost restoring a little hope in America for the world's eyes to see.
[01:24:07.354 --> 01:24:11.216]  But, Roger, I was, I shouldn't say surprised, but...
[01:24:12.516 --> 01:24:21.221]  It really frustrates me that this happens where Loretta Lynch gets subpoenaed to go testify behind closed doors to the Judiciary Committee yesterday.
[01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:22.421]  Nobody covered it!
[01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:23.702]  It wasn't a big story.
[01:24:23.702 --> 01:24:27.104]  There wasn't a lead headline on Drudge or the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:29.345]  There wasn't media freaking out 24-7.
[01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:30.725]  Loretta Lynch subpoenaed.
[01:24:30.725 --> 01:24:31.286]  But you know!
[01:24:32.046 --> 01:24:35.391]  If it was Roger Stone that was subpoenaed, it'd be the number one story.
[01:24:35.391 --> 01:24:42.262]  It'd be proof Roger Stone colluded with Russia and Martians and Pluto from the Disney cartoon.
[01:24:42.262 --> 01:24:46.529]  But, oh, Loretta Lynch from the Obama administration subpoenaed, oh, nothing to see here, Roger.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.061]  Yeah, no, there's an extraordinary double standard.
[01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:55.142]  Look, the big story this morning, you can see it everywhere, is that the House Intelligence Committee voted this morning at 10 a.m.
[01:24:55.142 --> 01:25:01.144]  Eastern to release the transcript of my testimony over a year ago before the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:25:01.144 --> 01:25:06.946]  Now, as you remember, Owen, I wanted to testify in public because I have nothing whatsoever to hide.
[01:25:06.946 --> 01:25:10.887]  I demanded to testify in public and they would not agree to let me do so.
[01:25:10.887 --> 01:25:12.828]  So I testified for four and a half hours.
[01:25:12.828 --> 01:25:13.868]  At the end of two hours,
[01:25:14.628 --> 01:25:18.774]  Trey Gowdy said, well, Mr. Stone, you've answered all of our questions.
[01:25:18.774 --> 01:25:19.956]  You're not here under subpoena.
[01:25:19.956 --> 01:25:20.837]  You're free to go.
[01:25:20.837 --> 01:25:26.165]  And I said, no, I want to stay here and answer questions until nobody has any more questions.
[01:25:26.165 --> 01:25:28.008]  I stayed for another two hours.
[01:25:28.008 --> 01:25:29.991]  Did Shifty Schiff have some more questions for you?
[01:25:30.271 --> 01:25:37.975]  That's the whole point here, which is, I now have called on the committee to release my transcript to the American people.
[01:25:37.975 --> 01:25:39.636]  Let's get it all out there right now.
[01:25:39.636 --> 01:25:40.937]  You know what will be proven?
[01:25:40.937 --> 01:25:47.881]  Not that I lied, but that Adam Schiff and Eric Swallowswell and Joaquin Castro, they are the ones who have lied.
[01:25:47.881 --> 01:25:51.063]  They have lied consistently about what I said under oath.
[01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:52.804]  The bottom line of this is really clear.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.441]  Where's the Russian collusion?
[01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:57.542]  Where's the WikiLeaks collaboration?
[01:25:57.542 --> 01:26:11.468]  Where's the evidence that I received anything, including allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen emails from Julian Assange or WikiLeaks or Russian intelligence or Guccifer 2.0 or Jerry Corsi or Bozo the Clown for that matter?
[01:26:12.239 --> 01:26:14.061]  They have no such evidence.
[01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:18.107]  So now what we're down to is trying to set a perjury trap.
[01:26:18.107 --> 01:26:21.591]  Arguing about what the definition of the word is, is.
[01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:25.636]  Or Mr. Stone, you said you were wearing a blue necktie last Thursday and it was a red necktie.
[01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:26.918]  Actually I think it was navy.
[01:26:26.918 --> 01:26:28.300]  We gotcha, we gotcha.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.701]  So this is an absurdity.
[01:26:30.362 --> 01:26:42.475]  A perfect example, Joaquin Castro says Stone lied when he said that he didn't have advanced knowledge of the Wikileaks disclosures.
[01:26:42.475 --> 01:26:43.176]  Not what I said.
[01:26:43.176 --> 01:26:45.138]  What I said was, I didn't know the
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:47.880]  Exact disclosure.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.041]  I knew it would be in October.
[01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:51.603]  I identified the source that told me that.
[01:26:51.603 --> 01:26:53.945]  But, Joaquin, I know this is hard for you to grasp.
[01:26:53.945 --> 01:26:55.266]  October has 31 days.
[01:26:55.266 --> 01:26:57.488]  I didn't know which day it was going to come out.
[01:26:57.488 --> 01:26:59.549]  There's no inconsistency in my testimony.
[01:27:02.111 --> 01:27:06.057]  What this will prove, if it is released to the American people, which I just called for.
[01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:10.804]  Oh, and if I feared what was in this transcript, would I be calling for the public release?
[01:27:10.804 --> 01:27:17.173]  It will show that Adam Schiff is the biggest conman, the biggest huckster, the biggest fraudster, the biggest liar,
[01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:36.737]  Well, and who knows what ends up coming out about Shifty Schiff over there in Hollywood and all the corruption and sickness that goes on over there that he's been in power over there for a while.
[01:27:36.737 --> 01:27:37.678]  But, Roger,
[01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:48.735]  I just feel like, okay, so yes, the deep state, the left, the globalists, yeah, they've got their media all hopped up, ready to go, that will go along with whatever they want them to say.
[01:27:48.735 --> 01:27:56.700]  Oh yeah, Stone, you know, colluded with the Martians in the 1800s or whatever, and time-traveled to come here and win it for Trump, and the media will run with that.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:02.904]  And then they've got a bunch of deranged, mentally ill leftists that are all hopped up to that hate Trump and fall for this whole Russian collusion thing.
[01:28:04.392 --> 01:28:06.953]  I don't think that this rubber meets the road, Roger.
[01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:16.556]  I think if they actually try to put this to the road outside of their controlled corporate media and their brainwashed propaganda stooges, I think they fail miserably.
[01:28:16.556 --> 01:28:24.379]  And that's why I think this whole, I mean, I'm talking 50 million Americans go to the streets if they try to take out Trump organically.
[01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:27.180]  That's why, because there is no Russian collusion.
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.540]  People aren't that stupid.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.961]  They may be dumbed down a little bit, but they're not that stupid.
[01:28:31.961 --> 01:28:37.482]  Well, I think it's significant that this is a two-part takedown.
[01:28:37.482 --> 01:28:43.683]  In other words, you saw a spade of stories yesterday saying Roger Stone admits to spreading lies on Infowars.
[01:28:43.683 --> 01:28:45.324]  I never said anything of that kind.
[01:28:45.324 --> 01:28:45.844]  I have never...
[01:28:46.144 --> 01:28:52.726]  Willfully, knowingly said anything on Inforce or any other platform that I knew to be false at the time I said it.
[01:28:52.726 --> 01:28:57.748]  And when I did learn that I made an error, no matter how minor, I corrected it and I apologized.
[01:28:57.748 --> 01:28:58.308]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.308 --> 01:29:03.270]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:07.233]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.233 --> 01:29:10.817]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.817 --> 01:29:18.405]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:18.405 --> 01:29:23.010]  Security is a mindset and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:25.432]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:30:03.438 --> 01:30:05.379]  That's the globalist only hope.

[01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:54.439]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:54.439 --> 01:30:55.240]  I salute you all.

[01:30:58.602 --> 01:31:03.465]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:31:03.465 --> 01:31:12.310]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:17.694]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:31:58.564 --> 01:32:04.088]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:32:04.088 --> 01:32:13.855]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:32:13.855 --> 01:32:21.941]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:30.832]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:32:30.832 --> 01:32:33.953]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:32:33.953 --> 01:32:35.453]  It really is amazing.
[01:32:35.453 --> 01:32:42.155]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:32:42.155 --> 01:32:44.836]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:32:46.072 --> 01:32:48.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:21.357 --> 01:33:23.043]  Roger Stone is with me in studio.
[01:33:23.043 --> 01:33:24.890]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.597 --> 01:33:29.338]  And you'll be back on The War Room today, correct?
[01:33:29.338 --> 01:33:32.039]  Well, I've been invited to come on with Aaron Burnett at CNN.
[01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:37.080]  I think I'm going to take my opportunity to do that because I have to push back on this narrative.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:46.823]  The release of the transcripts of my testimony for the House Intelligence Committee will prove definitively that Adam Schiff is a stone-cold liar and that I have been telling the truth.
[01:33:46.823 --> 01:33:51.645]  So this notion that Stone fears the release of these transcripts, no, on the contrary.
[01:33:52.145 --> 01:33:55.790]  I want all of the American people to see exactly what I said.
[01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:59.194]  Do I look like a man who's afraid to you?
[01:33:59.194 --> 01:34:00.616]  No, I can confidently say no.
[01:34:00.616 --> 01:34:01.797]  And I'm not afraid for you.
[01:34:01.797 --> 01:34:06.363]  So you'll be on Aaron Burnett out front, way behind later today.
[01:34:06.363 --> 01:34:09.587]  But Roger, you know, just speak briefly about
[01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:14.181]  I mean, you know, you're the target here, but this doesn't just affect you.
[01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:16.363]  I mean, your family has been impacted by this.
[01:34:16.363 --> 01:34:18.305]  I mean, you look at what's happened to General Flynn and others.
[01:34:18.305 --> 01:34:24.690]  I mean, Robert Mueller is not just coming after you because he thinks you did anything illegal or anything.
[01:34:24.690 --> 01:34:27.032]  He's trying to destroy you.
[01:34:27.032 --> 01:34:33.097]  He wants to destroy you to make an example of anybody else who wants to stick their neck out there for Trump in America.
[01:34:33.297 --> 01:34:34.398]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:34:34.398 --> 01:34:36.759]  So part of the tactic is to destroy you financially.
[01:34:36.759 --> 01:34:42.683]  In other words, make sure that you don't have the financial resources to pay for the lawyers to defend yourself.
[01:34:42.683 --> 01:34:45.966]  That way they can squeeze you to testify against Donald Trump.
[01:34:45.966 --> 01:34:50.068]  I think I made it clear with George Stephanopoulos on ABC.
[01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.349]  I think?
[01:35:09.278 --> 01:35:12.261]  This has virtually destroyed my family financially.
[01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:22.089]  We're looking at a pretty darn bleak Christmas, because frankly, every dollar I can earn, I have to pay over to my lawyers, who are fighting 24-7 to defend me.
[01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:36.661]  Not only against the onslaught of Robert Mueller, who has unlimited tax dollars, which try to destroy me, but also the Adam Schiff's of the world, who, you know, constantly raises a veritable Schiff storm of disinformation.
[01:35:37.621 --> 01:35:44.584]  As you know, Owen, recently I announced the sale of these Roger Stones.
[01:35:44.584 --> 01:35:47.086]  This is an official Roger Stone.
[01:35:47.086 --> 01:35:49.787]  It's a stone in which I have signed my name.
[01:35:49.787 --> 01:35:51.047]  It's a paperweight.
[01:35:51.047 --> 01:35:52.448]  That's the purpose of it.
[01:35:52.448 --> 01:35:58.431]  It's an exact replica of the stone that David used to take down Goliath.
[01:35:58.431 --> 01:36:01.492]  And you can get them at the Stone Cold Truth Shop website.
[01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:12.355]  We sold a few of them here and there, until Talking Points Memo and Rolling Stone both mocked me for the sale of these.
[01:36:12.355 --> 01:36:16.115]  100% of the proceeds go to pay for my legal defense.
[01:36:16.115 --> 01:36:23.557]  Since being attacked by Rolling Stone and Talking Points Memo, these babies are flying off the shelf.
[01:36:23.557 --> 01:36:30.258]  So you can go to StoneColdTruth.com, click on Shop, and you'll find your very own Roger Stone.
[01:36:31.243 --> 01:36:36.885]  And I just have to say, this stone live in studio is glorious, Roger.
[01:36:36.885 --> 01:36:37.966]  Magnanimous over there.
[01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:42.968]  And I have brought a stone for the entire crew as my Christmas present to the crew here at InfoWars.
[01:36:42.968 --> 01:36:45.789]  So, Owen, here is your very own.
[01:36:45.789 --> 01:36:46.329]  Wow!
[01:36:46.329 --> 01:36:46.689]  Thank you!
[01:36:46.949 --> 01:36:47.990]  Merry Christmas, Roger.
[01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.611]  Look at that!
[01:36:48.611 --> 01:36:50.032]  My own Roger Stone right there.
[01:36:50.032 --> 01:36:53.855]  It's going to be sitting at my desk, hanging out with me all the time now.
[01:36:53.855 --> 01:36:55.757]  So you can get your own Roger Stone.
[01:36:55.757 --> 01:37:00.401]  And as you said, this was a replica of the stone from thousands of years ago.
[01:37:00.401 --> 01:37:02.163]  It is a historical artifact.
[01:37:02.163 --> 01:37:06.787]  It's an exact replica of the stone that little David used to take down Goliath.
[01:37:07.427 --> 01:37:08.588]  Um, it's a paperweight.
[01:37:08.588 --> 01:37:09.849]  Let's be clear about that.
[01:37:09.849 --> 01:37:12.070]  That's the purpose of this.
[01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:17.854]  Uh, and I sold them last Christmas just kind of as a joke, but now it's no longer a joke.
[01:37:17.854 --> 01:37:19.195]  I need the money.
[01:37:19.195 --> 01:37:22.057]  Every penny goes to my legal defense fund.
[01:37:22.057 --> 01:37:25.279]  We just showed the, there it is, stonedefensefund.com.
[01:37:25.279 --> 01:37:31.603]  You can go directly there to make a contribution, uh, by credit card, or it shows you where you can mail a check.
[01:37:31.603 --> 01:37:33.965]  Folks, I am fighting for my life.
[01:37:33.965 --> 01:37:35.966]  This is a serious matter.
[01:37:35.966 --> 01:37:37.087]  I'm not crying wolf.
[01:37:37.687 --> 01:37:42.672]  And there's actually an animated reenactment of the original Roger Stone taking down Goliath.
[01:37:42.672 --> 01:37:43.893]  But like you said, Roger,
[01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:12.093]  It's just like how the Democrat Party and the Clintons and all of their legal funds and just the swaths of cash that they have in the bank, you know, from Soros and all these leftist donors.
[01:38:12.093 --> 01:38:16.654]  They use all that money to fund lawsuits against Alex and Infowars to try to destroy us.
[01:38:16.654 --> 01:38:24.596]  Mueller has just a trove, 30 million plus spent so far on the Russian probe.
[01:38:24.596 --> 01:38:29.337]  30 million, like you said, just, you know, unlimited funds, taxpayer funds, spending all of it.
[01:38:29.337 --> 01:38:31.238]  And you know what the real crime here is, Roger?
[01:38:32.125 --> 01:38:35.151]  Is that they know there was no crime to begin with.
[01:38:35.151 --> 01:38:36.334]  That's the real crime.
[01:38:36.334 --> 01:38:38.718]  They're destroying innocent people's lives.
[01:38:39.625 --> 01:38:46.430]  Because they want to use it as a political tool because they didn't like the results of a presidential election.
[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:47.831]  It's so sick.
[01:38:47.831 --> 01:38:49.653]  It's such a miscarriage of justice.
[01:38:49.653 --> 01:39:02.263]  The only justice to me in this situation, Roger, is that all involved with the Russian collusion witch hunt, all parties involved with Robert Mueller's team, belong in prison.
[01:39:02.263 --> 01:39:04.705]  Well, this really isn't complicated, but it is perplexing.
[01:39:05.605 --> 01:39:26.597]  I don't understand why the President does not direct the Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, to appoint a special counsel to examine the illicit and illegal use of FISA warrants during the last election and to examine the financial transaction of Uranium One, which is the largest treasonous financial crime in American history.
[01:39:26.597 --> 01:39:28.539]  It's an open and shut case.
[01:39:28.539 --> 01:39:30.480]  You want to see the Russian collusion?
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.982]  There it is, right out there in plain sight where everyone can see it.
[01:39:34.542 --> 01:39:48.251]  But instead, we are spending millions of dollars, $25 million last time I looked, in a two-year inquisition in which they have found no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[01:39:48.251 --> 01:39:56.596]  They keep pointing to half-assed Russian meddling in the election on social media, which was completely ineffective and underfunded.
[01:39:57.116 --> 01:40:02.102]  The big study that was put forward by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a fraud.
[01:40:02.102 --> 01:40:05.787]  It was conducted by a bunch of left-wing Trump-hating academics.
[01:40:05.787 --> 01:40:13.936]  It proves nothing, but it's on the front page of the Washington Compost and the New York Times and all the other fake news organs as if it matters.
[01:40:14.377 --> 01:40:18.538]  I'm sorry, but Russian meddling did not affect the outcome of the last election.
[01:40:18.538 --> 01:40:25.459]  Hillary Clinton spent close to a billion dollars, Donald Trump spent close to $275 million, and he beat her.
[01:40:25.459 --> 01:40:30.541]  Do you really think a couple hundred thousand dollars spent by the Russians meant anything?
[01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:35.322]  Their ads were so poorly written, you couldn't even understand what they were trying to accomplish.
[01:40:35.322 --> 01:40:36.542]  That's Russian meddling.
[01:40:36.542 --> 01:40:40.003]  Don't confuse Russian meddling with Russian collusion.
[01:40:40.003 --> 01:40:41.423]  That's what they want you to do.
[01:40:42.193 --> 01:40:48.216]  Well, and again, all the evidence, if anything, has been produced by this special counsel, this probe.
[01:40:48.216 --> 01:40:50.738]  It shows it's the Democrats colluding with Russia!
[01:40:50.738 --> 01:40:53.079]  It shows that it was Hillary that colluded with Russia!
[01:40:53.079 --> 01:40:58.202]  And Roger, the only influence that any social media activity from Russians had
[01:40:58.982 --> 01:41:06.168]  Was the anti-Trump march they did in New York City that was promoted by CNN and attended and promoted by Michael Moore.
[01:41:06.168 --> 01:41:16.956]  So even the facts of the matter that have come out from this special counsel only prove that if there's any collusion whatsoever, it's the Democrats with Russia via the fake dossier.
[01:41:17.737 --> 01:41:21.941]  And then it's the Democrats that fell for any Russian social media activity.
[01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:26.966]  But Rod Rosenstein said, no proof of any Russian collusion, no proof any votes were changed.
[01:41:26.966 --> 01:41:33.492]  The indictments that Mueller have put out did not say that it was clearly Russian colluded with Trump to influence the election for him.
[01:41:33.492 --> 01:41:37.977]  So it's like, why is this still going on even though they've admitted the entire thing was a farce already?
[01:41:38.817 --> 01:41:39.858]  I could not agree more.
[01:41:39.858 --> 01:41:55.931]  I urge people to go to the InfoWars.com site now and see this incredible story because the president clearly thinks, and I think he's right, there will be a revolt by the American people if there is an illegitimate attempt to remove him in some kind of silent coup.
[01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:58.473]  We have a terrific piece up on InfoWars right now.
[01:41:58.473 --> 01:42:03.377]  We urge you to take a look at this because it is earth-shattering, as I said in the first segment.
[01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:13.660]  At least two intimates of the President have told me that the President told them that he's confident that there would be a revolt, and he knows the American people are armed.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:23.103]  He doesn't want to see a civil war, but I think he accurately predicts that there will be one if they try to decapitate him through some illicit means.
[01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:25.084]  They have no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:42:25.084 --> 01:42:26.664]  They have no evidence of treason.
[01:42:26.664 --> 01:42:28.565]  They have no evidence of wrongdoing.
[01:42:29.085 --> 01:42:31.706]  The New York State Attorney General, we gotta get her picture.
[01:42:31.706 --> 01:42:34.847]  This is one of the ugliest women I've ever seen in my entire life.
[01:42:34.847 --> 01:42:35.528]  Barbara Underwood?
[01:42:35.528 --> 01:42:36.288]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.288 --> 01:42:41.470]  She doesn't look into the illegal and criminal activities of the Clinton Foundation, which is based in New York.
[01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:44.031]  No, she's too busy trying to shut down the Trump Foundation.
[01:42:44.031 --> 01:42:48.753]  Which actually does charitable work, and Trump doesn't even take a dime!
[01:42:48.753 --> 01:42:50.694]  There's your Roger Stone right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:50.694 --> 01:42:53.455]  We'll be right back with more from Roger Stone on the other side.
[01:42:53.455 --> 01:42:55.136]  Share that link at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:57.401 --> 01:43:02.925]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:43:02.925 --> 01:43:12.693]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:43:12.693 --> 01:43:20.780]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:43:21.769 --> 01:43:29.693]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:43:29.693 --> 01:43:32.795]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:43:32.795 --> 01:43:34.296]  It really is amazing.
[01:43:34.296 --> 01:43:40.999]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:43:40.999 --> 01:43:43.621]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:43:44.892 --> 01:43:48.016]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember
[01:44:01.328 --> 01:44:03.048]  This life is a test.
[01:44:03.048 --> 01:44:15.251]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:44:15.251 --> 01:44:25.253]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:44:25.253 --> 01:44:29.414]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[01:44:30.339 --> 01:44:34.000]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.680]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:40.481]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:44:40.481 --> 01:44:41.321]  2018 has been insane.
[01:44:41.321 --> 01:44:48.662]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:44:48.662 --> 01:44:52.343]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[01:44:52.343 --> 01:44:56.424]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:44:58.482 --> 01:45:04.263]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[01:45:04.263 --> 01:45:16.465]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:45:16.465 --> 01:45:25.087]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:45:26.451 --> 01:45:35.217]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[01:45:35.217 --> 01:45:37.899]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:45:37.899 --> 01:45:40.601]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:42.542]  2018 has been insane.
[01:45:42.542 --> 01:45:48.987]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:45:49.881 --> 01:45:53.565]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:45:53.565 --> 01:45:57.649]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:46:07.904 --> 01:46:10.387]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:10.387 --> 01:46:11.768]  You are the InfoWard.
[01:46:11.768 --> 01:46:14.691]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:29.045 --> 01:46:40.432]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:40.432 --> 01:46:48.396]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:48.396 --> 01:46:55.460]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:58.202]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:01.781 --> 01:47:09.832]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.832 --> 01:47:17.141]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:17.141 --> 01:47:19.564]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:35.256 --> 01:47:52.172]  So Roger Stone, who has Robert Mueller with his pitchfork and his pointy tail and his stinking breath breathing over his neck trying to destroy his life and his family's life.
[01:47:53.697 --> 01:47:56.399]  That's what Roger Stone has to deal with.
[01:47:56.399 --> 01:48:02.662]  And so he is selling Roger Stone's, right now, a great paperweight to fund his legal defense fund.
[01:48:02.662 --> 01:48:05.564]  But, Roger, didn't you see this story today?
[01:48:05.564 --> 01:48:10.127]  I believe you have the New York Times version, I have the Fox News version.
[01:48:11.147 --> 01:48:18.011]  Democrat operatives created fake Russian bots designed to link Kremlin to Roy Moore in Alabama.
[01:48:18.011 --> 01:48:21.473]  It's admitted in Fox News, it's admitted in the New York Times, and basically the story is here.
[01:48:21.473 --> 01:48:27.517]  They say, well we were just running a secret project on social media, it cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars, and...
[01:48:28.649 --> 01:48:42.819]  We were just creating a bunch of fake Russian bots to act like they were connected to the Kremlin, and then connect them to Roy Moore so we could run our story about how the Russians are influencing everything, and oh yes.
[01:48:42.819 --> 01:48:52.726]  But they say, Roger, it wasn't enough to have an impact, even though it was more money than the actual Russians ever spent on any election.
[01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:58.270]  So here's the Democrats admitting they actually literally did what they're claiming Russians did.
[01:48:59.090 --> 01:49:13.332]  You know, I'm really not upset about this, Owen, because I'm highly confident that after January, when Adam Schiff takes over the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee, I'm certain he's going to subpoena all these people and ask the tough questions so the American people can find out what really happened here.
[01:49:14.213 --> 01:49:14.954]  Not.
[01:49:14.954 --> 01:49:18.436]  You see, there's no interest in the activities of Democrats.
[01:49:18.436 --> 01:49:25.561]  The Democrats can collude with Ukraine, which Lee Stranahan has documented extensively.
[01:49:25.561 --> 01:49:32.847]  The Clintons can be deeply associated with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:43.971]  Tony and John Podesta literally made millions of dollars in aluminum, in uranium, in gas, in banking from the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:43.971 --> 01:49:47.192]  But the New York Times isn't interested in that.
[01:49:47.192 --> 01:49:49.773]  The Washington Post is not interested in that.
[01:49:49.773 --> 01:50:02.418]  Instead, it's enormous news that Donald Trump explored the possibility of a real estate development in Russia that he never actually went forward with, and was probably pushed and advocated more heavily by Michael Cohen than Donald Trump.
[01:50:03.559 --> 01:50:07.503]  It's a farce, but it achieved the goal, which is to get Russia in the headline.
[01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:22.121]  Since they're empty-handed of any evidence of real Russian collusion, and they realize the American people aren't as stupid as they would hope they are, we've got to get Russia in the headline here, so that the casual person can look at it and say, oh, they finally nailed Trump on Russia.
[01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:22.841]  They have nothing.
[01:50:23.482 --> 01:50:31.390]  Uh, Michael Cohen is being manipulated by the Clintonistas, uh, to, and he's now being used as a blunt instrument on Donald Trump.
[01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:32.711]  And he chose to be the rat.
[01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:33.572]  He chose that role.
[01:50:33.572 --> 01:50:35.073]  Now he's eating the cheese.
[01:50:35.073 --> 01:50:37.216]  Well, he's literally dumb as a box of rocks.
[01:50:37.216 --> 01:50:38.957]  I mean, I've known the guy since 2012.
[01:50:38.957 --> 01:50:42.300]  I had very limited contact with him in 2015.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.263]  I don't think any content in 2016, not, I don't believe any.
[01:50:46.204 --> 01:50:59.953]  Because Donald Trump did not want him in the campaign and Donald Trump did not want him in the in the White House quite obviously And now he spent five million dollars paying lawyers to go out and read all of his email and tell him what it said
[01:51:01.147 --> 01:51:02.207]  I can't afford to do that.
[01:51:02.207 --> 01:51:04.208]  I have over one million emails.
[01:51:04.208 --> 01:51:08.329]  My little legal team has got to go search for things every time we get a request.
[01:51:08.329 --> 01:51:10.830]  There's no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.711]  Eric Swalwell, a week ago.
[01:51:12.711 --> 01:51:14.251]  We want Roger Stone's emails.
[01:51:14.251 --> 01:51:15.732]  We want Roger Stone's phone calls.
[01:51:15.732 --> 01:51:17.813]  We want all of Roger Stone's texts.
[01:51:17.813 --> 01:51:19.053]  Hey Eric, don't worry.
[01:51:19.053 --> 01:51:21.574]  Robert Mueller's had them for two years.
[01:51:21.574 --> 01:51:26.936]  And you'll find no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal act.
[01:51:26.936 --> 01:51:27.736]  So let's be clear.
[01:51:28.657 --> 01:51:30.262]  I was under government surveillance in 2016.
[01:51:32.432 --> 01:51:33.632]  The New York Times reported it.
[01:51:33.632 --> 01:51:36.033]  We were together that day in Washington.
[01:51:36.033 --> 01:51:44.855]  They reported it on January 20th, 2017 on page one, that three Trump advisers were under surveillance by the Obama administration.
[01:51:44.855 --> 01:51:45.716]  I was one of them.
[01:51:45.716 --> 01:51:46.516]  Illegally.
[01:51:46.516 --> 01:51:47.136]  Illegally.
[01:51:47.136 --> 01:51:55.258]  And I have been, had a microscope and had this proctological examination of every aspect of my life for two years.
[01:51:55.258 --> 01:51:59.139]  And now they're attempting to drive me into bankruptcy, all for one reason.
[01:51:59.139 --> 01:52:00.920]  If we squeeze Stoneharden up,
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.642]  Maybe he'll make up crap against the President.
[01:52:03.642 --> 01:52:05.544]  Maybe he'll testify against him.
[01:52:05.544 --> 01:52:07.887]  Not happening.
[01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:11.030]  Roger, the big story is being reported nationwide.
[01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:13.492]  We have the story at Infowars.com.
[01:52:13.492 --> 01:52:15.895]  Share it far and wide, ladies and gentlemen, from Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:21.360]  President Trump believes that there will be an armed revolt should the Deep State try to remove him.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.721]  But I'm thinking about this more, Roger.
[01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:30.565]  If Trump, if President Trump genuinely doesn't want that to happen, he has to act now.
[01:52:30.565 --> 01:52:32.406]  He has to move against the deep state.
[01:52:32.406 --> 01:52:34.007]  He has to move against Mueller.
[01:52:34.007 --> 01:52:39.632]  He has to either announce or reveal a special counsel that's been investigating them.
[01:52:39.632 --> 01:52:46.116]  All the crimes that happened during the Clinton email scandal cover up with Comey, Lynch meeting illegally with Clinton on the tarmac.
[01:52:47.230 --> 01:52:56.195]  I'm telling you, Roger, I think Trump has to put it all out there now if he wants to stop there from being any type of revolt or hot civil war, this cold civil war that's going on behind closed doors.
[01:52:56.195 --> 01:52:57.376]  What are your thoughts on that, Roger?
[01:52:57.376 --> 01:52:58.377]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:52:58.377 --> 01:53:11.044]  A story that didn't make the front pages today but is very significant is the fact that the Ethics Office of the Department of Justice approved Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller investigation.
[01:53:11.044 --> 01:53:15.607]  That theoretically would mean that any indictment brought by Mr. Mueller would require the approval
[01:53:16.407 --> 01:53:16.648]  I think?
[01:53:31.488 --> 01:53:35.972]  A matter that has never been brought to the courts, but will be over time.
[01:53:35.972 --> 01:53:50.444]  The fact that Mueller himself auditioned for the job of FBI Director was turned down and within 24 hours was appointed special counsel, therefore a motive for his efforts to destroy the President.
[01:53:50.444 --> 01:53:53.266]  The fact that he's passed over for the FBI Director.
[01:53:53.266 --> 01:53:53.946]  People ask me,
[01:53:54.767 --> 01:53:57.949]  Well, do you fear being put on trial?
[01:53:57.949 --> 01:53:58.769]  What if you're indicted?
[01:53:58.769 --> 01:54:00.150]  Well, fine.
[01:54:00.150 --> 01:54:08.614]  If I'm indicted, we're going to talk about Mr. Mueller's involvement in 9-11, in BCCI, in Pan Am 103 in Lockerbie, in the anthrax scandal.
[01:54:10.075 --> 01:54:16.556]  In Whitey Bulger, Enron, and most specifically Uranium One.
[01:54:16.556 --> 01:54:19.337]  I would say that he has far more to hide than I do.
[01:54:19.337 --> 01:54:22.698]  Well, and President Trump has already announced that he's got the report.
[01:54:22.698 --> 01:54:25.458]  As soon as Mueller releases his, Trump's going to release his counter report.
[01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:26.358]  It's game over for Mueller.
[01:54:26.358 --> 01:54:33.040]  But you know, I would say this to President Trump, and you know that InfoWars has basically been blocked from getting to Trump's desk.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.940]  That may change, and Trump tries to get as much info as he can.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:39.441]  But I think President Trump needs to realize something, Roger, and that's
[01:54:42.034 --> 01:54:52.039]  The odds of him being the white knight that he thinks he would be if he just let the deep state take him out and then he thinks there'd be some armed revolt.
[01:54:52.039 --> 01:54:54.761]  We don't want to get to that point, okay?
[01:54:54.761 --> 01:54:57.863]  And I don't think that that is a good thing for Trump to bank on.
[01:54:57.863 --> 01:54:59.483]  Not that I don't think it would happen.
[01:54:59.483 --> 01:55:04.826]  Trump needs to realize he has to be the dark knight and he has to do the things that the media is going to say is wrong.
[01:55:04.826 --> 01:55:07.528]  He's going to have to take the bows and arrows like he's been.
[01:55:07.528 --> 01:55:10.469]  He has to just go after these people and straight up arrest them, Roger.
[01:55:10.469 --> 01:55:11.210]  That's what he has to do.
[01:55:11.770 --> 01:55:17.553]  And if he doesn't do that, there probably is going to be some sort of revolt, and there's going to be some sort of chaos.
[01:55:17.553 --> 01:55:20.155]  He's going to be at the center of it, and then it's going to reach the American streets.
[01:55:20.155 --> 01:55:21.876]  So, do you agree with me?
[01:55:21.876 --> 01:55:26.418]  And I know you've already said yes, but again, Trump has to move against these people now.
[01:55:26.418 --> 01:55:27.799]  That is the right thing to do.
[01:55:27.799 --> 01:55:29.120]  If he doesn't do it, he's right.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.082]  There will be revolts, there will be chaos, but he can stop all of it, Roger.
[01:55:33.742 --> 01:55:41.767]  You know, I saw this incredible interview with Devin Nunes two days ago where he was literally begging the president to declassify what's in his hands.
[01:55:41.767 --> 01:55:46.310]  Let's recognize that Chairman Nunes has seen what the president has.
[01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:50.232]  He has a security clearance and he knows the entire scam.
[01:55:50.232 --> 01:55:51.913]  He knows that the approval of the
[01:55:52.213 --> 01:55:52.594]  I think?
[01:56:11.335 --> 01:56:11.915]  We're good to go.
[01:56:36.161 --> 01:56:41.845]  Well, I cheer a government shutdown, and President Trump called an emergency meeting about an hour ago to address this.
[01:56:41.845 --> 01:56:44.186]  Paul Ryan was addressing the House Caucus.
[01:56:44.186 --> 01:56:49.130]  Trump interrupted that meeting, called an emergency meeting, an emergency session, and these reports are now coming out.
[01:56:49.130 --> 01:56:50.871]  So, yes, the bill was not signed.
[01:56:50.871 --> 01:56:56.134]  The $10 billion going to Central America, five bill of it going to Mexico, bill has not been signed.
[01:56:56.134 --> 01:57:05.861]  Trump is standing strong, it looks like for now, against that, and then hopefully can counter it and maybe get some funding for a wall, or at least stop the billions of dollars from going to Central
[01:57:06.381 --> 01:57:12.265]  America's economic development while ours gets destroyed by the Democrats and the Federal Reserve.
[01:57:12.265 --> 01:57:13.606]  All right, Roger.
[01:57:13.606 --> 01:57:15.067]  Great stuff as usual.
[01:57:15.067 --> 01:57:17.769]  What is coming up for you the rest of the day?
[01:57:17.769 --> 01:57:24.753]  Well, first of all, as I said, my colleague Jacob Engels is going to be joining the war room today.
[01:57:24.753 --> 01:57:35.841]  I'm going to go on with Aaron Burnett and lay out to the American people why it's essential that my testimony for the House Intelligence Committee be released to the American people because it will show that Adam Schiff is the liar.
[01:57:44.047 --> 01:57:52.953]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:57:52.953 --> 01:58:01.460]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:10.817]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:19.726]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:58:19.726 --> 01:58:22.829]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.330]  It really is amazing.
[01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:31.035]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:58:31.035 --> 01:58:33.738]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.

[01:59:51.274 --> 01:59:53.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.536 --> 02:00:10.581]  Large tech companies are struggling to manage content perpetuating conspiracy theories.
[02:00:10.581 --> 02:00:12.983]  They're so vulnerable to outside interference.
[02:00:12.983 --> 02:00:15.425]  Isn't that a focus that could have been a missed opportunity?
[02:00:17.059 --> 02:00:19.100]  So, it's a very good point you make.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:23.023]  I would love if I could have more than five minutes to question witnesses.
[02:00:23.023 --> 02:00:25.604]  Unfortunately, I don't get that opportunity.
[02:00:25.604 --> 02:00:31.327]  However, I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech.
[02:00:31.327 --> 02:00:34.209]  The first amendment prevents me from doing so.
[02:00:34.209 --> 02:00:43.374]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers, alleging that these were merely actors.
[02:00:44.875 --> 02:00:49.981]  Not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[02:00:49.981 --> 02:00:52.985]  The video violated YouTube's rules against bullying and it was removed.
[02:01:00.073 --> 02:01:02.175]  It's a big red pill that we all must swallow.
[02:01:02.175 --> 02:01:05.338]  The United States Congress is occupied by a corporatocracy.
[02:01:05.338 --> 02:01:06.840]  And it has been for at least over a century.
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.321]  A brazen corporate government.
[02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:34.461]  Allowing foreign interests to drop cash on the barrelhead via their minions in large American corporations, putting a down payment on the influence of our elected representatives in bulk.
[02:01:34.461 --> 02:01:37.463]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar!
[02:01:37.463 --> 02:01:42.246]  We're aware of your activities trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[02:01:43.067 --> 02:01:45.469]  Google is evil!
[02:01:45.469 --> 02:01:46.931]  Google is evil!
[02:01:46.931 --> 02:02:09.851]  The mere suspicion that Google manipulates its products and features for self-serving or even political purposes raises serious concerns about its business practices, its impact on free speech and our democratic process, and Americans' trust that the information gathered about them in their day-to-day lives is done with their knowledge and is not being used against them.
[02:02:10.276 --> 02:02:14.098]  This is what a corporatocratic politician sounds like.
[02:02:14.098 --> 02:02:26.666]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy, dreamed up by some conservatives, that Google and other online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[02:02:26.666 --> 02:02:31.649]  As I have said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[02:02:32.469 --> 02:02:43.853]  I have little doubt that my Republican colleagues will spend much of their time presenting a laundry list of anecdotes and out-of-context statements made by Google employees as supposed evidence of anti-conservative bias.
[02:02:43.853 --> 02:02:46.634]  But none of that will actually make it true.
[02:02:46.634 --> 02:02:53.477]  But this fact-free propaganda does help generate the mistrust that the majority leader referred to a few moments ago.
[02:02:53.877 --> 02:02:57.980]  Clearly, Google has engaged in nefarious foreign collusion.
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:04.986]  Just last month, Google employees walked out protesting Google's Orwellian Chinese dragonfly search engine.
[02:03:04.986 --> 02:03:16.616]  Nadler and company's fantasy that there isn't any anti-conservative bias amongst the hijacked public square now controlled by ultra-liberal Silicon Valley is laughable.
[02:03:16.616 --> 02:03:19.939]  In fact, the bias is reaching epidemic proportions.
[02:03:20.279 --> 02:03:26.121]  that violate a First Amendment that can no longer exist under this growing corporatocratic government.
[02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:42.505]  Democratic House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler's 2018 re-election campaign received a total of $26,458 from Google's parent company, Alphabet, the largest donation Nadler received.
[02:03:42.505 --> 02:03:45.966]  Breitbart wrote, records from the Federal Election Commission
[02:03:46.186 --> 02:03:57.017]  We found that Nadler received donations from Google during the 2012, 2013, and 2014 election cycles, usually totaling $10,000 every year.
[02:03:57.017 --> 02:04:06.026]  Obviously, any further investigation into Google's treasonous activities brings corporatocratic lapdogs like Mr. Nadler into question as well.
[02:04:06.326 --> 02:04:23.122]  And all the while, China has subtly used its corporatic influence to infiltrate the United States, as was uncovered during a recent hearing including the judiciary, FBI, and Homeland Security officials concerned about the impending horror of the state of Chinese espionage.
[02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:29.006]  What we have to understand again is this idea that the Communist Party reigns supreme.
[02:04:29.006 --> 02:04:35.210]  It means those businesses ultimately are beholden to the Chinese government.
[02:04:35.210 --> 02:04:43.276]  And so what happens when the Chinese government asks those businesses to engage in activity contrary to U.S.
[02:04:43.276 --> 02:04:44.136]  interests?
[02:04:44.136 --> 02:04:45.637]  Those businesses have a choice.
[02:04:45.637 --> 02:04:51.381]  If they want to continue to do business, they basically follow the order of the Chinese government.
[02:04:53.391 --> 02:05:01.874]  If they decide not to follow those orders... The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:05:01.874 --> 02:05:08.456]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media, they can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes.
[02:05:08.456 --> 02:05:09.856]  They can call BS.
[02:05:09.856 --> 02:05:11.636]  It's game over.
[02:05:11.636 --> 02:05:19.719]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:20.728 --> 02:05:28.652]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:05:28.652 --> 02:05:31.754]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:05:31.754 --> 02:05:33.255]  It really is amazing.
[02:05:33.255 --> 02:05:39.958]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:05:39.958 --> 02:05:42.580]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:05:43.931 --> 02:05:45.472]  Of Infowars.
[02:05:45.472 --> 02:05:46.773]  So please spread the links.
[02:05:46.773 --> 02:05:50.136]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[02:05:50.136 --> 02:05:53.459]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:05:53.459 --> 02:05:54.760]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:55.040]  God bless you.
[02:06:06.744 --> 02:06:08.425]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:08.425 --> 02:06:10.147]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:10.147 --> 02:06:12.088]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.088 --> 02:06:16.252]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.252 --> 02:06:18.894]  Alright.
[02:06:18.894 --> 02:06:22.937]  We're into the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:22.937 --> 02:06:28.802]  I still have barely even gotten to all the news I want to cover.
[02:06:28.802 --> 02:06:33.386]  I've got some great video clips I want to get to here.
[02:06:36.195 --> 02:06:42.760]  Including just some really odd and strange behavior now coming out of some college leftists.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:46.002]  Nothing new, but always entertaining.
[02:06:46.002 --> 02:06:50.485]  Millie Weaver is going to be joining me in the bottom half of the hour.
[02:06:50.485 --> 02:06:52.967]  She just filed a report.
[02:06:52.967 --> 02:06:55.709]  Students react to Facebook selling private messages.
[02:06:55.709 --> 02:07:00.333]  You know, there seems to be like a
[02:07:02.278 --> 02:07:04.379]  People are, like, numb.
[02:07:04.379 --> 02:07:07.700]  The new generation, the younger generation, I think.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:10.641]  Boy, I mean, this is like a whole show, honestly.
[02:07:10.641 --> 02:07:13.462]  Because I was right on the cusp of it before it.
[02:07:13.462 --> 02:07:20.204]  Like, my generation was still, like, raised on books and, like, playing outside.
[02:07:20.204 --> 02:07:30.047]  But, like, the generation right below me, I mean, it is just screen time, cell phone, just total addiction, right when they're kids.
[02:07:31.516 --> 02:07:39.883]  And so there's like a numbness, I think, to the not having privacy, because you know anything you do on the internet is pretty much not private, I mean.
[02:07:39.883 --> 02:07:48.571]  But to talk about them selling your messages and stuff, like I said, it's kind of passe, like people don't really care.
[02:07:48.571 --> 02:07:52.435]  It's time to highlight the criminal activity of these companies.
[02:07:52.435 --> 02:07:53.376]  Lying under oath,
[02:07:54.278 --> 02:08:04.628]  I mean, when is it going to come out that Facebook and Twitter and these people or someone at these people or someone involved in this is rigging the stock market?
[02:08:04.628 --> 02:08:08.631]  But we'll talk about that with Millie Weaver.
[02:08:08.631 --> 02:08:10.213]  You know, I had Leo Zegami on yesterday.
[02:08:10.213 --> 02:08:18.601]  It was a great two segments I did with Leo, as always, and then news breaks just today
[02:08:20.876 --> 02:08:26.601]  More than 500 priests accused of sexual abuse not yet publicly identified by the Catholic Church.
[02:08:26.601 --> 02:08:32.986]  The Illinois Attorney General finds 500.
[02:08:32.986 --> 02:08:33.927]  More than 500.
[02:08:33.927 --> 02:08:40.672]  In fact, the number in this story from the Chicago Tribune, 690 priests.
[02:08:40.672 --> 02:08:41.012]  My God.
[02:08:41.012 --> 02:08:41.333]  My God.
[02:08:53.584 --> 02:08:56.205]  I'm sorry, I can't even.
[02:08:56.205 --> 02:08:56.405]  L.A.
[02:08:56.405 --> 02:08:59.646]  Bishop resigns 13 years after church learned of sex slander.
[02:08:59.646 --> 02:09:00.086]  You know what?
[02:09:00.086 --> 02:09:00.866]  Let's roll the video.
[02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:01.406]  I think we have it.
[02:09:01.406 --> 02:09:01.986]  Let's roll clip 13.
[02:09:01.986 --> 02:09:07.147]  This is... This really hurts me.
[02:09:07.147 --> 02:09:11.109]  Uh, so we don't have it, guys?
[02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.709]  Okay.
[02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:12.809]  Well, you know what?
[02:09:12.809 --> 02:09:13.689]  That's probably better.
[02:09:13.689 --> 02:09:16.450]  Uh, but, uh, it's basically a St.
[02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:20.651]  Louis archbishop saying he didn't know having sex with a child was a crime.
[02:09:22.244 --> 02:09:26.587]  You know what, that's fine that we don't have it because I can't handle this stuff, honestly.
[02:09:26.587 --> 02:09:28.248]  And then for it to be tied to my hometown of St.
[02:09:28.248 --> 02:09:29.729]  Louis even hurts more.
[02:09:29.729 --> 02:09:32.491]  And then for Chicago, it's like the brother city to St.
[02:09:32.491 --> 02:09:32.731]  Louis.
[02:09:32.731 --> 02:09:37.294]  It's just... Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:09:37.294 --> 02:09:38.675]  Need to get my head off of that.
[02:09:40.607 --> 02:09:54.177]  So people are now learning that the bill to fund, and you know, I'm actually glad that we freaked out about this because this is how you keep Trump from doing this crap.
[02:09:54.177 --> 02:09:58.481]  And he can be upset with Ann Coulter or whatever for calling him out, that's fine.
[02:09:58.481 --> 02:10:05.106]  But it's good that we call President Trump out when we see things happening in our government that he can stop.
[02:10:06.252 --> 02:10:12.034]  Like giving $10 billion to Central America for economic development, when we don't get crap.
[02:10:12.034 --> 02:10:18.797]  I mean, what happens to all the billions of dollars of aid we send to these Central American companies to build their infrastructure?
[02:10:18.797 --> 02:10:32.503]  They get nothing, and then they send... The number is staggering, but I mean, folks, you're talking about, in the last 30 years, 50% of Central America basically trying to migrate to the United States.
[02:10:32.503 --> 02:10:32.923]  In fact,
[02:10:35.706 --> 02:10:40.689]  I've got a couple stories that actually kind of go along with this.
[02:10:40.689 --> 02:10:42.891]  For example, U.S.
[02:10:42.891 --> 02:10:49.035]  population grew at slowest pace in more than 80 years, but there's a silver lining to this.
[02:10:49.035 --> 02:10:54.098]  What this means is that Americans are no longer having kids.
[02:10:54.098 --> 02:10:56.660]  What this means is that the Americans are not having kids.
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:59.422]  The population is being replaced
[02:11:00.356 --> 02:11:03.398]  By migrants from the Middle East and from Central America.
[02:11:03.398 --> 02:11:05.979]  And it's all part of a Democrat operation to get more votes.
[02:11:05.979 --> 02:11:12.003]  But Alex Jones is joining us on the phone right now with the latest breaking news.
[02:11:12.003 --> 02:11:15.365]  Alex Jones, what is the latest?
[02:11:15.365 --> 02:11:19.467]  I just wanted to pop in because I've been listening on for a while and traveling with family.
[02:11:19.467 --> 02:11:21.408]  My wife, my dad.
[02:11:21.408 --> 02:11:23.509]  And look how powerful the broadcast is.
[02:11:23.509 --> 02:11:26.251]  Come on, it's the same time we're in.
[02:11:26.251 --> 02:11:27.812]  Trump has said he's not going to sign.
[02:11:28.959 --> 02:11:29.599]  We're good to go.
[02:11:59.537 --> 02:12:06.258]  Sitting right in our office, while that's the top story in the country, as a distraction from all the things the globalists are doing.
[02:12:06.258 --> 02:12:10.679]  It's just surreal that this is happening.
[02:12:10.679 --> 02:12:13.560]  And the audience, I'm not just saying this.
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:19.621]  I've convinced myself that the audience of this broadcast is literally the American resistance.
[02:12:19.621 --> 02:12:21.301]  The world resistance.
[02:12:21.301 --> 02:12:22.502]  The heart of the resistance.
[02:12:22.502 --> 02:12:23.122]  The globalists.
[02:12:23.122 --> 02:12:26.182]  It's just how obvious it is we should get out of the New World Order.
[02:12:26.182 --> 02:12:28.583]  How obvious it is that the pedophile group
[02:12:29.605 --> 02:12:36.947]  They're literally running the whole globalist operation, and every rock we turn over, every major institution is run by them.
[02:12:36.947 --> 02:12:43.390]  And then now they have drag queens and 11-year-olds dancing at gay strip bars and having money thrown at them.
[02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:47.011]  I mean, there's nothing these globalists won't do.
[02:12:47.011 --> 02:12:53.273]  It's like they're on a mad dog crazed frenzy, and they're going to push and push and push until we say no.
[02:12:53.273 --> 02:12:55.974]  And that's why we've talked about what's going to happen when they kill Trump or remove
[02:12:57.083 --> 02:13:05.646]  Uh, and then, you know, he pulls out of Syria like he said he would do three years ago in the campaign, and they call him a traitor when it was Obama and the Democrats created ISIS and let him in.
[02:13:05.646 --> 02:13:13.948]  I mean, it is just unbelievable how bad the globalists are and how stupid they think we are and how they think we have no memory.
[02:13:13.948 --> 02:13:16.809]  As the President pointed out, he said, I'll always campaign to do this.
[02:13:16.809 --> 02:13:19.150]  And why should we be arming the terrorists and attack Turkey?
[02:13:19.150 --> 02:13:22.471]  We need to just outlaw the world, not create a strategy of tension.
[02:13:22.471 --> 02:13:25.352]  So, it blows me away how mainstream media are such
[02:13:26.348 --> 02:13:27.809]  Cheers.
[02:13:27.809 --> 02:13:31.033]  But how we really are on target to tell them the truth.
[02:13:31.033 --> 02:13:33.175]  That's why we're fake news.
[02:13:33.175 --> 02:13:33.855]  We're liars.
[02:13:33.855 --> 02:13:34.876]  We're bad.
[02:13:34.876 --> 02:13:36.338]  It's because they're bad.
[02:13:36.338 --> 02:13:38.640]  And so I just I just can't believe what an epic fight this is.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:39.701]  I don't know.
[02:13:39.701 --> 02:13:43.004]  On ColdWars.com about President Trump.
[02:13:43.004 --> 02:13:44.746]  Police in the deep state trying to remove him from office.
[02:13:44.746 --> 02:13:49.791]  It'll be a violent armed civil war that will win.
[02:13:50.524 --> 02:13:53.766]  Let's not get to that point, but I think he's right as they go there.
[02:13:53.766 --> 02:13:58.568]  So I want to just thank you for the great job of everybody and that Roger and Chris and everyone.
[02:13:58.568 --> 02:14:03.070]  The war room and everything coming up today, but this, this article on InfoWars.com.
[02:14:03.070 --> 02:14:05.231]  This article on InfoWars.com.
[02:14:05.231 --> 02:14:06.632]  And NewsWorks.com.
[02:14:06.632 --> 02:14:09.674]  With the President saying he believes there will be an armed insurrection.
[02:14:09.674 --> 02:14:11.234]  That is such giant news.
[02:14:11.234 --> 02:14:12.995]  It's not just our sources.
[02:14:12.995 --> 02:14:15.357]  We have furthered his armed revolt.
[02:14:15.357 --> 02:14:18.778]  He's on the news saying there will be a revolt, that means armed anyways.
[02:14:18.778 --> 02:14:19.759]  So this is all contented.
[02:14:21.077 --> 02:14:22.198]  There goes Alex Jones.
[02:14:22.198 --> 02:14:22.998]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:14:22.998 --> 02:14:24.799]  And it's incredible to think about this.
[02:14:24.799 --> 02:14:26.621]  We're here having an American Revolution.
[02:14:50.854 --> 02:15:01.703]  I mean, the stock, 2018 was a bad year for the stock market, but you look at the overall growth since Trump, it's like up 5,000 still or something, and that's just because the American economy is back to that level.
[02:15:01.703 --> 02:15:13.753]  So yeah, you're going to see fluctuations now, but we're here having this American revolution, the economy's booming again, unemployment record lows, millions of people getting off welfare, we're trying to have a border again, you know, we're trying to figure some stuff out.
[02:15:14.514 --> 02:15:16.135]  And this is our American Revolution.
[02:15:16.135 --> 02:15:17.976]  And then what do the Democrats do?
[02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:19.437]  What does the corporate media do?
[02:15:19.437 --> 02:15:26.001]  They want Central America to have its revolution and to replace the population in the United States.
[02:15:26.001 --> 02:15:34.587]  They want the Middle East to have a revolution over there like the Arab Spring or bring a bunch of migrants over here or into Europe and then have regime change in Syria.
[02:15:34.587 --> 02:15:35.427]  No!
[02:15:35.427 --> 02:15:37.669]  We want an American Revolution!

[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:50.984]  There will be an armed revolt if they try to take him out.
[02:15:50.984 --> 02:15:52.967]  Don't even try it!

[02:17:24.741 --> 02:17:31.104]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.104 --> 02:17:34.146]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.146 --> 02:17:40.069]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.069 --> 02:17:43.851]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.851 --> 02:17:45.112]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.112 --> 02:17:46.453]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.453 --> 02:17:52.676]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.676 --> 02:17:54.097]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.485 --> 02:18:02.513]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.513 --> 02:18:05.436]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:18:11.058 --> 02:18:20.200]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:25.542]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[02:18:31.344 --> 02:18:32.824]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:18:32.824 --> 02:18:36.805]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:18:36.805 --> 02:18:39.026]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:18:39.026 --> 02:18:40.106]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:18:40.566 --> 02:18:42.548]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:18:42.548 --> 02:18:45.110]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[02:18:56.175 --> 02:19:01.679]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:19:01.679 --> 02:19:11.445]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:19:11.445 --> 02:19:19.551]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:28.465]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:19:28.465 --> 02:19:31.547]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:19:31.547 --> 02:19:33.068]  It really is amazing.
[02:19:33.068 --> 02:19:39.773]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:19:39.773 --> 02:19:42.455]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:19:43.746 --> 02:19:45.267]  Of Infowars.
[02:19:45.267 --> 02:19:46.589]  So please spread the links.
[02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:49.932]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[02:19:49.932 --> 02:19:53.255]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:19:53.255 --> 02:19:54.576]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:19:54.576 --> 02:19:59.300]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:01.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.872 --> 02:20:29.493]  I have stacks of news that I haven't got to today, and Millie Weaver is about to be joining us.
[02:20:29.493 --> 02:20:34.914]  So I am going to bear down, focus, get through this news before Millie Weaver comes on.
[02:20:34.914 --> 02:20:41.696]  She's got a report she just did talking about the illegal activity, what I believe is illegal activity by Facebook.
[02:20:41.696 --> 02:20:44.996]  There are some reports out talking about what the government shutdown really means.
[02:20:44.996 --> 02:20:46.857]  I'm not going to get into the nuts and bolts and bore you with that.
[02:20:47.907 --> 02:20:50.629]  Be aware of all the fake news saying that, oh, it means this or that.
[02:20:50.629 --> 02:20:53.190]  It's really not even a shutdown, quite frankly.
[02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:55.232]  I kind of wish it were.
[02:20:55.232 --> 02:20:57.613]  We already covered this.
[02:20:57.613 --> 02:21:04.858]  In fact, we'll cover this more with Millie, but the Democrat, I mean, folks, this is so, I can't even believe.
[02:21:04.858 --> 02:21:11.902]  Every damn thing that the Democrats claim Trump did, they do, like on record.
[02:21:11.902 --> 02:21:13.163]  See, this is what happens to me.
[02:21:13.163 --> 02:21:15.965]  I'm all focused here and I'm ready to plow through all this news.
[02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.461]  And then it just hits you.
[02:21:17.461 --> 02:21:21.102]  It's like, these people are total liars and total frauds.
[02:21:21.102 --> 02:21:24.402]  And the American media goes along with it.
[02:21:24.402 --> 02:21:29.763]  And then I can't even focus and get to the rest of the news because it's like, how do I awaken America?
[02:21:29.763 --> 02:21:34.144]  How do I open America's eyes to say, look at these damn Democrats.
[02:21:34.144 --> 02:21:40.345]  Look at Bob Mueller claiming that the Russians are rigging social media for Trump.
[02:21:40.345 --> 02:21:42.145]  The Russians are colluding with Trump.
[02:21:42.145 --> 02:21:44.886]  It's the damn Democrats every time!
[02:21:46.033 --> 02:21:51.217]  On record!
[02:21:51.217 --> 02:21:52.097]  Sick of this, man!
[02:21:52.097 --> 02:21:59.623]  Do I have to come on here every frickin' day to show you how the Democrats... I mean, look at this.
[02:21:59.623 --> 02:22:04.006]  Hillary Clinton pays Fusion GPS through Perkins Coie.
[02:22:05.543 --> 02:22:10.427]  To get the Russian dossier, which came from Russian intelligence.
[02:22:10.427 --> 02:22:17.673]  That's literally the Clinton campaign getting Russian intelligence against Donald Trump.
[02:22:17.673 --> 02:22:19.515]  That's Russian collusion.
[02:22:19.515 --> 02:22:25.881]  Then you have that dossier used by the Obama administration to spy on President Trump.
[02:22:25.881 --> 02:22:27.142]  That's Russian collusion!
[02:22:28.356 --> 02:22:36.540]  Then you have the Democrats making fake Facebook and social media accounts pretending to be Russians!
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:38.060]  It's all on record!
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:46.044]  And then the American media and Bob Mueller spend all their time and all their money pointing the finger at Trump when it's frickin' them!
[02:22:46.044 --> 02:22:48.585]  And I had to come on air for two years!
[02:22:48.585 --> 02:22:52.046]  For two years, I've been banging my head against the desk.
[02:22:52.046 --> 02:22:54.568]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:22:54.568 --> 02:22:55.528]  It's honestly just unbelievable.
[02:22:57.762 --> 02:23:02.084]  President Trump just, you know what?
[02:23:02.084 --> 02:23:04.305]  I get what President Trump is doing.
[02:23:04.305 --> 02:23:09.467]  And honestly, every day he waits, more people come to his side.
[02:23:09.467 --> 02:23:10.647]  These people are so corrupt, man.
[02:23:10.647 --> 02:23:13.168]  They're such criminals.
[02:23:13.168 --> 02:23:13.889]  They're such criminals.
[02:23:13.889 --> 02:23:20.771]  And you have Vladimir Putin talking yesterday about the real threat we have right now of worldwide nuclear war.
[02:23:20.771 --> 02:23:22.012]  Why do you think he's talking about that?
[02:23:23.171 --> 02:23:25.853]  Not because Russia wants to blow anybody up.
[02:23:25.853 --> 02:23:28.716]  Hell, not because even China wants to blow anybody up.
[02:23:28.716 --> 02:23:40.125]  Because the deep state, the corrupt American political establishment is so desperate, they would rather nuke America than see Trump succeed.
[02:23:40.125 --> 02:23:41.206]  Do you understand that?
[02:23:41.206 --> 02:23:42.888]  That's what Putin is talking about!
[02:23:42.888 --> 02:23:48.012]  And Russia's not going to sit idly by and let that happen!
[02:23:48.012 --> 02:23:51.034]  Oh, and you better believe, pulling these troops out of Syria,
[02:23:51.929 --> 02:23:56.692]  Is gonna help us avoid a war we don't want with Russia, folks.
[02:23:56.692 --> 02:24:04.356]  I'm sorry for screaming, it's just like... And then, Trump says we're gonna pull the troops out of Syria?
[02:24:04.356 --> 02:24:08.499]  And I tune in to all American cable news, and they're mad?
[02:24:08.499 --> 02:24:11.761]  That Trump is bringing the troops home?
[02:24:11.761 --> 02:24:16.603]  What is wrong with you?
[02:24:16.603 --> 02:24:18.765]  How much stock do these people own in Raytheon?
[02:24:18.765 --> 02:24:19.185]  You know what?
[02:24:20.987 --> 02:24:23.329]  How much stock does Lindsey Graham own in Raytheon?
[02:24:23.329 --> 02:24:27.872]  How much stock does Lindsey Graham own in Lockheed Martin?
[02:24:27.872 --> 02:24:28.172]  How much?
[02:24:28.172 --> 02:24:29.293]  I mean, I just wonder.
[02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:33.215]  Every time there's a... Oh, folks, this is so unbelievable.
[02:24:33.215 --> 02:24:44.343]  I mean... Pretty much any time there's a rocket launch from Saudi Arabia or Israel or even the Middle East, folks, it's made in America.
[02:24:44.343 --> 02:24:48.565]  And Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and all these weapons manufacturers, they're making $100,000 a pop.
[02:24:52.076 --> 02:24:54.176]  You see why they want war in the Middle East?
[02:24:54.176 --> 02:24:56.417]  You see why we have to keep troops in the Middle East?
[02:24:56.417 --> 02:24:58.757]  You see why they want these never-ending wars?
[02:24:58.757 --> 02:25:01.258]  It's all about money!
[02:25:01.258 --> 02:25:05.919]  And you know people in Congress have interest in this.
[02:25:05.919 --> 02:25:08.039]  You know people in the media have interest in this.
[02:25:08.039 --> 02:25:10.539]  It's all sick.
[02:25:10.539 --> 02:25:11.860]  It's all sick to me.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:17.701]  Oh yeah, I'm stunned that Lockheed Martin's stock went down now that Trump's pulling the troops out of Syria.
[02:25:17.701 --> 02:25:18.241]  Stunning!
[02:25:19.727 --> 02:25:20.307]  Stunning!
[02:25:20.307 --> 02:25:22.208]  I bet you the same thing happened to Raytheon.
[02:25:22.208 --> 02:25:23.849]  I haven't even seen these stocks.
[02:25:23.849 --> 02:25:26.131]  I bet you Raytheon dropped today, too.
[02:25:26.131 --> 02:25:28.512]  Pull up the Raytheon stocks today, guys.
[02:25:28.512 --> 02:25:33.695]  Probably Boeing, too.
[02:25:33.695 --> 02:25:37.978]  And the American media complains that Trump is getting the troops out of Syria.
[02:25:37.978 --> 02:25:41.400]  You all make me sick.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.900]  Raytheon down big, too.
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:48.824]  I gotta say, you all... People that I think are America's enemy that are on Fox News every day,
[02:25:50.433 --> 02:25:50.973]  Upset?
[02:25:50.973 --> 02:25:52.454]  Oh, we can't pull out of Syria.
[02:25:52.454 --> 02:25:53.614]  Bad move from Trump.
[02:25:53.614 --> 02:25:54.715]  We need the troops there.
[02:25:54.715 --> 02:25:56.395]  It could destabilize worse.
[02:25:56.395 --> 02:25:58.956]  You people make me sick!
[02:25:58.956 --> 02:26:01.337]  Why don't you go over there and fight for Syria's independence?
[02:26:01.337 --> 02:26:04.859]  Which, by the way, see, these people are so out of touch with reality.
[02:26:05.731 --> 02:26:10.792]  There's actually more freedom and independence in the Middle East right now since Trump came in.
[02:26:10.792 --> 02:26:14.033]  You can blame Trump or say it's other factors, Russia, whatever.
[02:26:14.033 --> 02:26:20.315]  ISIS is actually being depleted and it's probably mostly because you don't have Obama in office funding and arming them.
[02:26:20.315 --> 02:26:27.116]  If you really want to know why ISIS has taken such a hit, it's not necessarily because we're fighting them more than we ever have.
[02:26:27.116 --> 02:26:29.277]  It's because we're not freaking funding them anymore!
[02:26:30.899 --> 02:26:33.260]  People say, oh, oh, and Obama funding ISIS.
[02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:34.180]  Give me a break.
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:36.620]  Five hundred, you know what?
[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:37.581]  I want to say thousand.
[02:26:37.581 --> 02:26:38.461]  I bet it was a million.
[02:26:38.461 --> 02:26:39.881]  Yeah, Boeing's down too.
[02:26:39.881 --> 02:26:40.661]  Look up the story.
[02:26:40.661 --> 02:26:48.203]  President Obama wanted to give $500 million and they say, I think it was either $500,000 or $500 million.
[02:26:48.203 --> 02:26:52.344]  They say, they say, moderate rebels, moderate rebels.
[02:26:52.344 --> 02:26:54.205]  You know who those moderate rebels are, folks?
[02:26:54.205 --> 02:26:58.406]  ISIS.
[02:26:58.406 --> 02:26:58.666]  All right.
[02:27:01.724 --> 02:27:04.206]  So we can fund that.
[02:27:04.206 --> 02:27:08.870]  Luckily, President Trump is not going to sign that bill that had us all panicked.
[02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:10.852]  But you know what?
[02:27:10.852 --> 02:27:13.634]  This is actually the future of government right here.
[02:27:13.634 --> 02:27:16.957]  This right here is the future of government.
[02:27:16.957 --> 02:27:19.459]  This is where we need to go.
[02:27:19.459 --> 02:27:22.342]  So we can't get a wall from our president who promised it.
[02:27:22.342 --> 02:27:27.266]  We can't get a wall from the government, you know, who funds anything under the sun, but not our own border.
[02:27:27.266 --> 02:27:27.286]  A
[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:48.277]  Veteran, a triple amputee, Purple Heart recipient, Brian Kolfage, two days ago started a We the People Will Fund the Wall GoFundMe account, $1 billion goal, $4.5 million raised so far.
[02:27:48.277 --> 02:27:51.300]  This is the future of government right here.
[02:27:52.423 --> 02:28:02.645]  Instead of putting out a project that Democrats and Republicans and these bureaucrats and everybody gets to decide behind closed doors what gets funded, what doesn't, let's actually leave it to the people.
[02:28:02.645 --> 02:28:05.925]  Let's put projects, it's over, it's to six million now!
[02:28:05.925 --> 02:28:07.726]  Six million dollars!
[02:28:07.726 --> 02:28:09.146]  This is the future of government.
[02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:10.626]  This is where we should go.
[02:28:10.626 --> 02:28:12.406]  I'm done with the rigged voting.
[02:28:12.406 --> 02:28:20.488]  I'm done with Republican, Democrat, you know, all the crap they do, sit up there debating and really at the end of the day they just care about their own pocketbook.
[02:28:20.488 --> 02:28:21.668]  This is the future of government.
[02:28:22.403 --> 02:28:24.067]  You want to fund a government project?
[02:28:24.067 --> 02:28:26.412]  You put it out there and you let the people fund it.
[02:28:26.412 --> 02:28:30.741]  How many people do you think would donate voluntarily to Planned Parenthood?
[02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:32.805]  Do you think Planned Parenthood would get
[02:28:34.602 --> 02:28:37.063]  Two billion dollars in government funding?
[02:28:37.063 --> 02:28:44.105]  Do you think Planned Parenthood would get two billion dollars from US taxpayers in four years if that was a voluntary thing?
[02:28:44.105 --> 02:28:45.485]  Of course not!
[02:28:45.485 --> 02:28:47.786]  That's why they make you pay for it!
[02:28:47.786 --> 02:28:53.008]  The future of government, you put a project out on the internet and you say, do you want to pay for this or not?
[02:28:53.008 --> 02:28:54.248]  Instead of stealing from us!
[02:28:55.601 --> 02:28:59.444]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[02:28:59.444 --> 02:29:03.147]  It's creating 10.8 billion dollars in new wealth a year.
[02:29:03.147 --> 02:29:07.791]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[02:29:07.791 --> 02:29:13.296]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.
[02:29:13.656 --> 02:29:16.738]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[02:29:16.738 --> 02:29:20.301]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.

[02:29:28.247 --> 02:29:36.453]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel will reveal which cannabis stocks are primed to deliver life-changing windfalls in the weeks and months ahead.
[02:29:36.453 --> 02:29:40.116]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor.
[02:29:40.376 --> 02:29:45.241]  Backing the hottest startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.

[02:29:56.394 --> 02:30:01.895]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:30:01.895 --> 02:30:11.657]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:30:11.657 --> 02:30:19.759]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:30:20.762 --> 02:30:28.667]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:30:28.667 --> 02:30:31.769]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:30:31.769 --> 02:30:33.270]  It really is amazing.
[02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:39.975]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:30:39.975 --> 02:30:42.677]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.

[02:32:01.287 --> 02:32:03.227]  That's the globalist only hope.

[02:32:42.706 --> 02:32:44.487]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:09.673 --> 02:33:15.157]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:15.157 --> 02:33:18.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.679 --> 02:33:20.760]  Millie Weaver is in studio with me.
[02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:32.909]  She has just filed a report talking to students about what has just been exposed from Facebook, really lying to its customers and selling their private messages and data.
[02:33:32.909 --> 02:33:35.490]  Here was Millie's report.
[02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:37.472]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:33:38.849 --> 02:33:39.551]  I don't know.
[02:33:39.551 --> 02:33:40.653]  What do you mean?
[02:33:40.653 --> 02:33:43.018]  Well, you let me read your private Facebook messages.
[02:33:43.018 --> 02:33:44.341]  I wouldn't want you to, no.
[02:33:44.341 --> 02:33:45.383]  Why not?
[02:33:45.383 --> 02:33:46.145]  Because they're private.
[02:33:50.925 --> 02:34:01.033]  Recently, documents came out detailing how Facebook has been allowing big corporations to pay to have access to their users' private information.
[02:34:01.033 --> 02:34:10.000]  They even go so far as to allow Spotify, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada access to their users' private messages.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.483]  That means they could write them, or delete them, or even read them.
[02:34:14.483 --> 02:34:20.448]  Let's go ask some of these students at UT whether or not they would let me read their private Facebook messages.
[02:34:20.888 --> 02:34:27.873]  Given that Facebook is already letting all these other corporations read their private Facebook messages.
[02:34:27.873 --> 02:34:30.916]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:30.916 --> 02:34:31.976]  No.
[02:34:31.976 --> 02:34:34.498]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:34.498 --> 02:34:35.179]  No.
[02:34:35.179 --> 02:34:35.639]  Why not?
[02:34:35.639 --> 02:34:37.020]  Is that private?
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:39.182]  Can I read your private Facebook messages?
[02:34:40.727 --> 02:34:42.508]  Uh, they're private.
[02:34:42.508 --> 02:34:44.549]  There's probably some stuff you don't want to read in there.
[02:34:44.549 --> 02:34:48.211]  I don't really message on Facebook, but I'd say no.
[02:34:48.211 --> 02:34:52.373]  Can I read your guys' private Facebook messages?
[02:34:52.373 --> 02:34:53.633]  No.
[02:34:53.633 --> 02:34:56.034]  Sure, I barely ever use Facebook.
[02:34:56.034 --> 02:34:56.294]  Sure.
[02:34:56.294 --> 02:34:57.515]  Yeah?
[02:34:57.515 --> 02:34:58.515]  You're okay with that?
[02:34:58.515 --> 02:34:59.336]  Yep.
[02:34:59.336 --> 02:35:01.477]  And I can do whatever I want with the messages?
[02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:05.135]  Um... I would say no.
[02:35:05.135 --> 02:35:07.518]  I don't have any private Facebook messages.
[02:35:07.518 --> 02:35:09.160]  I don't really use Facebook.
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.621]  Yeah, I don't have anything on there.
[02:35:10.621 --> 02:35:16.207]  I never use Facebook messages, so... I feel like it's just as personal sometimes as text messaging.
[02:35:16.207 --> 02:35:19.190]  So, do you think that that's an odd request?
[02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.810]  Yeah.
[02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:22.373]  Do you think that that's kind of an unreasonable request?
[02:35:22.373 --> 02:35:23.514]  Uh, it's kind of weird.
[02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:25.917]  Why do you think that that's an unreasonable request?
[02:35:26.834 --> 02:35:28.595]  Because it's an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:28.595 --> 02:35:36.319]  What do you say to the fact that it came out that Facebook has been allowing several big companies to have access to read your private messages?
[02:35:36.319 --> 02:35:38.480]  Um, it makes me pretty upset.
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:40.281]  Because, you know, they're supposed to be private.
[02:35:40.281 --> 02:35:43.223]  I feel like this could be an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:43.223 --> 02:35:43.563]  I don't know.
[02:35:43.563 --> 02:35:45.404]  I mean, I think it's an invasion of privacy.
[02:35:45.404 --> 02:35:47.485]  It's definitely a breach of trust.
[02:35:47.485 --> 02:35:48.425]  It's kind of horrifying.
[02:35:48.425 --> 02:35:49.406]  Yeah?
[02:35:49.406 --> 02:35:49.586]  Yeah.
[02:35:50.248 --> 02:35:51.548]  I mean, it's pretty crazy.
[02:35:51.548 --> 02:35:53.149]  You really have, like, no privacy anymore.
[02:35:53.149 --> 02:35:56.250]  That's why I really don't use Facebook that much.
[02:35:56.250 --> 02:36:03.392]  Like, it is definitely a negative and definitely hinders, like, my wanting to use Facebook.
[02:36:03.392 --> 02:36:08.433]  It's precisely why I don't put a lot of information on Facebook, so that people can't access my information.
[02:36:08.433 --> 02:36:11.454]  I don't really use Facebook that much, so it doesn't really affect me.
[02:36:11.454 --> 02:36:12.974]  I guess it's not really an issue.
[02:36:12.974 --> 02:36:15.095]  I don't use Facebook Messenger at all, so...
[02:36:15.555 --> 02:36:18.416]  Do you think that Facebook should be held accountable for this?
[02:36:18.416 --> 02:36:18.816]  Very much so.
[02:36:18.816 --> 02:36:21.996]  Alright, so you can see the entire report from Millie Weaver.
[02:36:21.996 --> 02:36:23.297]  The story is at Infowars.com.
[02:36:23.297 --> 02:36:28.618]  Guys, go ahead and pull up that story so we can direct the audience where they can find the full video from Millie Weaver.
[02:36:28.618 --> 02:36:30.898]  Students react to Facebook selling private messages.
[02:36:30.898 --> 02:36:37.800]  And of course, your YouTube channel is still up, Millennial Millie, with a ton of views over there, a ton of subscribers.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:39.080]  So Millie, the story is...
[02:36:40.546 --> 02:36:44.387]  Facebook and they've even said, oh, we're going to protect your private data.
[02:36:44.387 --> 02:36:46.388]  You know, you don't have to worry about us selling it.
[02:36:46.388 --> 02:36:47.048]  It's all good.
[02:36:47.048 --> 02:36:48.068]  It's all fine.
[02:36:48.068 --> 02:36:49.048]  And then the reports comes out.
[02:36:49.048 --> 02:36:51.729]  Oh, wait, they were selling it and they were selling it to the highest bidder.
[02:36:51.729 --> 02:36:54.450]  And anybody could basically get in there.
[02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:55.390]  And there's other reports, too.
[02:36:55.390 --> 02:36:58.731]  I mean, I got a whole stack of news when it comes to social media stuff.
[02:36:58.731 --> 02:36:59.191]  We'll get to.
[02:36:59.191 --> 02:37:09.914]  But it seems to me that most of the people you talk to were either a just kind of not really interested in Facebook or B, they were stunned that their messages were being sold.
[02:37:10.154 --> 02:37:12.517]  Yeah, a lot of them were very creeped out, Owen.
[02:37:12.517 --> 02:37:20.185]  But what seemed to be interesting is amongst college students and young people, they don't really even see Facebook as something cool and trendy anymore.
[02:37:20.185 --> 02:37:24.871]  Most of them don't even use Facebook, and those who go into social media tend to exercise caution.
[02:37:25.251 --> 02:37:36.776]  It's mostly going to be the Millennials and Generation X that are the ones using Facebook and that are the ones who are going to have their data mostly being exposed because of these big corporations having access to them.
[02:37:36.776 --> 02:37:47.781]  Now Facebook did actually have an agreement with the FTC in 2011 that they had to give notice to their users if they were going to share any of their private information.
[02:37:47.781 --> 02:37:54.464]  So this is a breach of Facebook's agreement with the FTC and the FTC could hold Facebook accountable for this.
[02:37:54.844 --> 02:37:57.786]  This is why we're seeing Facebook's stock plunge.
[02:37:57.786 --> 02:38:01.528]  Today their stock has plunged almost around 10%.
[02:38:01.528 --> 02:38:04.209]  Look, I wouldn't want to be owning Facebook stock right now.
[02:38:04.209 --> 02:38:09.032]  It just does not seem like the company is looking very good in the future.
[02:38:09.032 --> 02:38:15.196]  Or maybe you were if you were doing some insider trading with them, which some reports may indicate that's going on.
[02:38:15.876 --> 02:38:18.438]  But, but, so, you know, that's an interesting thing.
[02:38:18.438 --> 02:38:26.104]  I wonder if, if Facebook was smart enough, because you know what they do is they, they, they say, oh, you know, click here to agree to the terms and conditions.
[02:38:26.104 --> 02:38:28.346]  It's like a 800-page textbook.
[02:38:28.346 --> 02:38:30.528]  You know, nobody ever knows what you could agree to.
[02:38:30.528 --> 02:38:35.952]  You know, they're, they'll, you, you agreed to be a bird feeder outside of, you know, Facebook's offices or something, you know.
[02:38:35.952 --> 02:38:37.093]  And you have no idea.
[02:38:37.093 --> 02:38:43.979]  So, I wonder if they slipped something in there into some agreement that you click, sign over, and oh, oh, now they can sell our ice.
[02:38:44.699 --> 02:38:46.386]  It's like, would Facebook admit that?
[02:38:46.386 --> 02:38:48.374]  Because that just shows you how underhanded they are.
[02:38:48.905 --> 02:38:56.127]  Well, it was a breach of trust because, like I said, that FTC agreement meant that they had to give notice if they were going to sell it to third parties.
[02:38:56.127 --> 02:39:00.928]  And what Facebook's trying to say is, oh, well, we didn't actually sell their data and private information.
[02:39:00.928 --> 02:39:05.969]  We just allowed companies to access it by paying us and contracting with us.
[02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:16.671]  One of the creepy things here is we have over 150 big corporations that all had access to private information, including private messages, contacts, everything that you possibly could get from Facebook.
[02:39:17.191 --> 02:39:34.765]  So, the interesting thing here is, is all of this information floating around here from these big corporations going to eventually one day be compiled into the social credit score system where private messages that you once shared with your friends over Facebook are now going to be impacting your social credit score?
[02:39:34.765 --> 02:39:35.806]  Is that what we're looking at?
[02:39:36.583 --> 02:39:43.709]  I think that that's definitely what we're looking at here, and that's kind of why you start to see big tech aligning itself with China.
[02:39:43.709 --> 02:39:47.272]  But you know, this is kind of a story, Millie, that people don't really talk about.
[02:39:47.272 --> 02:39:51.215]  There's a great story, the crew just pulled up, Facebook app loses a quarter of Americans.
[02:39:51.215 --> 02:39:53.077]  Facebook is actually in big trouble.
[02:39:53.077 --> 02:40:01.103]  And there's this whole thing with the phenomenon of Facebook, and this too-big-to-fail notion, but Facebook is actually in big trouble.
[02:40:01.103 --> 02:40:03.806]  They've got huge fines that they've had to pay in Europe.
[02:40:04.775 --> 02:40:09.997]  They've got huge data breaches where they're breaking contracts in Europe and America and all of this stuff.
[02:40:09.997 --> 02:40:11.158]  Stock is plunging.
[02:40:11.158 --> 02:40:12.078]  You just did the man on the street.
[02:40:12.078 --> 02:40:15.580]  Most people seem like they're uninterested in Facebook.
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:20.342]  Now you have even leftist liberals bragging about how they're deleting their Facebook.
[02:40:20.342 --> 02:40:22.723]  This is kind of a story that doesn't really get covered.
[02:40:22.723 --> 02:40:25.564]  Facebook is actually perhaps in a lot of trouble right now.
[02:40:25.564 --> 02:40:32.307]  In fact, if you go see some of the most recent appearances Mark Zuckerberg has been at, I mean, he's always kind of socially awkward, but he looks like
[02:40:33.167 --> 02:40:34.828]  He looks like scared almost now.
[02:40:34.828 --> 02:40:37.270]  Facebook is the next MySpace.
[02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:38.451]  And what I'm going to say is this.
[02:40:38.451 --> 02:40:44.435]  Look, I have had the privilege of talking with an insider that worked in intelligence for decades.
[02:40:44.435 --> 02:40:58.705]  And months ago, just after Alex Jones was booted off of social media, this person reached out and said, look, the CIA, the intelligence agencies, they're the ones who even allowed Facebook and these social media big tech companies to exist and rise.
[02:40:59.205 --> 02:41:04.409]  They are going to tank the social media networks because they are a fail.
[02:41:04.409 --> 02:41:10.474]  They were originally put in for regime change, like we saw with the Arab Spring, but they lost control of them.
[02:41:10.474 --> 02:41:11.755]  They allowed Brexit to happen.
[02:41:11.755 --> 02:41:13.476]  They allowed Trump to be elected.
[02:41:13.476 --> 02:41:14.817]  So now what are they going to do?
[02:41:14.817 --> 02:41:16.698]  They are going to tank Facebook.
[02:41:16.698 --> 02:41:21.482]  That is why you're seeing all of these mainstream media outlets coming out against Facebook all at once.
[02:41:21.482 --> 02:41:23.904]  There have been so many mainstream media articles.
[02:41:23.904 --> 02:41:26.346]  We saw CNBC, CNN, several of these things.
[02:41:26.866 --> 02:41:28.128]  Delete your Facebook account.
[02:41:28.128 --> 02:41:30.290]  Here's how you can delete your Facebook account.
[02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:33.113]  MSNBC host bragging about it and everything?
[02:41:33.113 --> 02:41:36.617]  Yes, so I'm not saying Facebook is a good guy here or some kind of a victim.
[02:41:36.617 --> 02:41:41.563]  What I'm saying here is that these are all sharks and they're all trying to bid for power plays here.
[02:41:42.143 --> 02:41:48.808]  If you want to look at the history of this social media operation they had going on, you look back into DARPA.
[02:41:48.808 --> 02:41:56.935]  When DARPA first started with a project called LifeLog, LifeLog was essentially going to track everything people did.
[02:41:56.935 --> 02:42:02.279]  I mean, it was going to be this huge database run by the military-industrial complex.
[02:42:02.859 --> 02:42:04.100]  The people found out about it.
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:11.685]  A lot of libertarian organizations and civil liberty organizations came out against it, tried to sue over it.
[02:42:11.685 --> 02:42:16.048]  So, in 2004, they stopped it and they cancelled LifeLog.
[02:42:16.048 --> 02:42:17.229]  Well, guess what else popped up in 2004?
[02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:19.591]  Facebook!
[02:42:19.591 --> 02:42:24.156]  All they did was transfer LifeLog into Facebook, into the private sector.
[02:42:24.156 --> 02:42:26.799]  They allowed Facebook to exist for regime change.
[02:42:26.799 --> 02:42:27.961]  They lost control of it.
[02:42:27.961 --> 02:42:28.681]  Now they're going to take it.
[02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:29.062]  Exactly.
[02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:33.887]  You pivot it to make it like a social media trendy thing, even though it's just a huge data collection base.
[02:42:33.887 --> 02:42:34.948]  And this is all on record.
[02:42:35.789 --> 02:42:39.052]  And people are starting to realize this now.
[02:42:39.052 --> 02:42:41.154]  But it's a basic question.
[02:42:41.154 --> 02:42:42.395]  Follow the money.
[02:42:42.395 --> 02:42:46.058]  How did Facebook and Twitter get all the money to become so powerful?
[02:42:46.058 --> 02:42:49.301]  How did they get all the money for the bandwidth and the storage and everything?
[02:42:49.301 --> 02:42:50.962]  I mean, people don't even think.
[02:42:50.962 --> 02:42:53.605]  Where and how did Facebook and Twitter get so powerful?
[02:42:55.325 --> 02:43:00.827]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:43:00.827 --> 02:43:10.591]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:43:10.591 --> 02:43:18.675]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:43:19.687 --> 02:43:27.613]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:43:27.613 --> 02:43:30.716]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:43:30.716 --> 02:43:32.217]  It really is amazing.
[02:43:32.217 --> 02:43:38.922]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:43:38.922 --> 02:43:41.605]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:43:42.873 --> 02:43:44.435]  Of Infowars.
[02:43:44.435 --> 02:43:45.736]  So please spread the links.
[02:43:45.736 --> 02:43:49.079]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:49.079 --> 02:43:52.403]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:43:52.403 --> 02:43:53.724]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:43:53.724 --> 02:43:54.825]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:44:02.933 --> 02:44:04.474]  That it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.474 --> 02:44:07.355]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.355 --> 02:44:14.079]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.079 --> 02:44:20.322]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.322 --> 02:44:25.925]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.625 --> 02:44:33.650]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:47.721]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.721 --> 02:44:51.984]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.984 --> 02:44:54.666]  X3, now available at mfulmerslife.com.
[02:44:56.294 --> 02:45:01.457]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:45:01.457 --> 02:45:03.398]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:45:03.398 --> 02:45:22.610]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.

[02:45:41.575 --> 02:45:50.258]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[02:45:50.478 --> 02:45:52.460]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:53.241]  I salute you all.

[02:46:58.712 --> 02:47:01.300]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.034 --> 02:47:19.615]  Alright, we're discussing the future of Facebook and social media.
[02:47:19.615 --> 02:47:21.557]  There's all kinds of different angles to cover here.
[02:47:21.557 --> 02:47:29.361]  The censorship angle, the lying under oath angle, the stock market pump and dump angle.
[02:47:29.361 --> 02:47:36.244]  There's all this stuff, but when it comes to the privacy issue, this is some crazy stuff that's going on.
[02:47:36.244 --> 02:47:42.128]  Amazon error allowed Alexa user to eavesdrop on another home.
[02:47:42.128 --> 02:47:42.428]  And see,
[02:47:44.605 --> 02:47:52.971]  A story like this, you have to understand, Millie, if this can happen by mistake, this can happen on purpose.
[02:47:52.971 --> 02:47:58.555]  And people can figure out how to hack into your Amazon, whatever, and listen to your conversations.
[02:47:58.555 --> 02:48:01.618]  Maybe it's your neighbor, maybe it's the government, maybe it's Jeff Bezos.
[02:48:01.618 --> 02:48:07.202]  The point is, these things in your home, they are a recording device.
[02:48:07.202 --> 02:48:07.882]  That is a fact.
[02:48:07.882 --> 02:48:10.044]  In fact, there's already stories about how
[02:48:11.826 --> 02:48:20.683]  Intelligence agencies and bureaucracies are going to these companies like Apple and they're actually pulling, they're going and pulling conversations that were recorded on on certain devices.
[02:48:21.539 --> 02:48:23.280]  That's extremely creepy, Owen.
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:33.308]  At what point in the future, I mean, this might sound a little dystopic, but at what point in the future are you going to be driving along in your smart car, and all of a sudden your car tells you, you can't use those words.
[02:48:33.308 --> 02:48:34.729]  Well, the smart car will be driving for you.
[02:48:34.729 --> 02:48:35.569]  You're not allowed to drive.
[02:48:35.569 --> 02:48:41.334]  Well, you're sitting in your smart car as it's driving you to your destination, and you're having a conversation with your friends.
[02:48:41.334 --> 02:48:44.156]  And then your smart car says, sorry, those words aren't permitted.
[02:48:44.156 --> 02:48:45.717]  We're going to start fining you.
[02:48:45.717 --> 02:48:49.920]  And you're losing the money that you have to feed your children because you keep using words that aren't allowed.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:53.782]  And your social credit score just went down so the car just stopped and now you have to walk.
[02:48:53.782 --> 02:48:55.003]  Exactly, right?
[02:48:55.003 --> 02:48:57.164]  No cars, sorry, you're being booted out.
[02:48:57.164 --> 02:49:03.867]  Because that's what a lot of these leftist trendies here in Austin have been promoting all these car share programs where nobody even owns a car.
[02:49:03.867 --> 02:49:12.051]  You actually just use one up like an Uber and it comes and gets you and takes you to your destination so that we can all be green and environmental.
[02:49:12.051 --> 02:49:16.773]  How about, this is kind of a side issue, but like, how about all of these scooters?
[02:49:16.773 --> 02:49:17.814]  Like, where do they come from?
[02:49:18.925 --> 02:49:19.526]  I saw that.
[02:49:34.125 --> 02:49:37.209]  We're seeing this pop up along blue cities.
[02:49:37.209 --> 02:49:39.051]  It's more of that move towards Agenda 21.
[02:49:39.051 --> 02:49:40.352]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[02:49:40.352 --> 02:49:42.915]  I mean, even in Austin they've banned homes.
[02:49:42.915 --> 02:49:45.137]  You can't build homes now in Austin.
[02:49:45.137 --> 02:49:48.781]  You have to build high-rise apartments and housing.
[02:49:48.781 --> 02:49:49.602]  This is Agenda 21.
[02:49:49.602 --> 02:49:51.424]  It's what the Democrats want.
[02:49:51.904 --> 02:50:08.400]  They want to just bring in all these illegal immigrants from Mexico or wherever and the problem with that is that most of these people don't even have high school educations and right now with technology, automation, we are actually needing more skilled workers that are
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:18.346]  Having education and tech backgrounds especially so like the people from India are coming to Austin and they're able to get high-tech jobs because those jobs are available.
[02:50:18.346 --> 02:50:27.633]  What happens when there's no more really industrial worker jobs yet we have this massive influx of industrial workers coming from third world nations?
[02:50:27.633 --> 02:50:30.114]  We're just going to have a huge burden on our hands.
[02:50:30.114 --> 02:50:38.540]  And this is all written into legislation where they literally say okay we're going to bring in a hundred thousand college graduates from India and to work at these companies.
[02:50:39.561 --> 02:50:43.543]  You know, people talk about how they're trying to turn Texas into California.
[02:50:43.543 --> 02:50:45.665]  Millie, they, I mean, Austin is like...
[02:50:46.584 --> 02:50:50.745]  Honestly, the city of Austin is about one year away from being San Francisco.
[02:50:50.745 --> 02:50:53.485]  And now they have the Apple headquarters coming here.
[02:50:53.485 --> 02:50:58.246]  They're expecting, I think the number was 100,000 jobs in this one Apple campus.
[02:50:58.246 --> 02:50:59.346]  It's going to be downtown.
[02:50:59.346 --> 02:51:00.527]  They're not building any new houses.
[02:51:00.527 --> 02:51:04.487]  They're not expanding the reach of Austin city limits.
[02:51:04.487 --> 02:51:06.808]  They're just compacting everything more into downtown.
[02:51:06.808 --> 02:51:12.949]  So more traffic, like you said, more high-rises, more congestion, more population density, and
[02:51:14.079 --> 02:51:18.420]  And then Austin just slowly turns into San Francisco under the Democrat leadership.
[02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:25.662]  I strategically try to avoid traffic in this town, but I'm telling you, I think Austin, this is so bad.
[02:51:25.662 --> 02:51:30.203]  Well, this is why so many Americans are aware of the fact that we need a wall.
[02:51:30.203 --> 02:51:35.625]  Because Austin is another area that has been affected by illegal immigration and by Democrat policy.
[02:51:35.625 --> 02:51:36.305]  And this is a great city.
[02:51:36.305 --> 02:51:38.566]  This is a great, beautiful city that's not
[02:51:39.366 --> 02:51:42.027]  Torn to shreds with, you know, feces and needles on the streets.
[02:51:42.027 --> 02:51:45.609]  I mean, there's some, you know, homeless issues and poverty issues.
[02:51:45.609 --> 02:51:46.770]  It's pretty much condensed.
[02:51:46.770 --> 02:51:48.911]  And most of the reason of that is, actually, you can look this up.
[02:51:48.911 --> 02:51:50.051]  This is one of the craziest things.
[02:51:50.051 --> 02:51:58.436]  The city of Houston and the city of San Antonio and the city of Dallas literally, three years ago, bust their entire homeless population in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:58.436 --> 02:51:59.056]  It's incredible.
[02:51:59.056 --> 02:52:00.437]  You can look at the homeless numbers.
[02:52:00.437 --> 02:52:03.278]  Three years ago, and all those cities shot right down.
[02:52:03.278 --> 02:52:04.839]  Austin, Texas shot right up.
[02:52:04.839 --> 02:52:05.619]  So that's one issue.
[02:52:05.619 --> 02:52:06.240]  But the point is,
[02:52:08.194 --> 02:52:14.059]  It's only going to get worse, and the more they congest it, the traffic's going to get worse.
[02:52:14.059 --> 02:52:14.859]  It just sucks!
[02:52:14.859 --> 02:52:24.266]  Because this is a great, beautiful city, great infrastructure, new buildings, actually a booming economy, and they're going to turn it into San Francisco, and it's just going to suck!
[02:52:24.266 --> 02:52:26.888]  And you can't even drive across town in this city.
[02:52:26.888 --> 02:52:37.797]  Honestly, if you want to drive across town in this city, let's say 10 miles, it's going to take you 45 minutes, and you're just praying to God that you don't hit a pothole big enough, you know, 500 times that bust your axle.
[02:52:38.263 --> 02:52:53.474]  Yeah, because the cities are taking that funding, the public funding that should be going towards potholes, and they're putting them towards sanctuary cities and all these other Democrat run... Or Planned Parenthood gets a rent for a dollar, like, oh... But somehow we can't get our government to fund the wall.
[02:52:53.474 --> 02:53:00.559]  I mean, I know Trump said that we're going to have Mexico pay for it, but there's ways to have Mexico pay for it on the back end here.
[02:53:01.219 --> 02:53:08.284]  We could pay for it up front with our tax dollars and then have Mexico pay for it through trade tariffs in the long run.
[02:53:08.284 --> 02:53:10.605]  Now, I wanted to say something, Owen.
[02:53:10.605 --> 02:53:16.649]  I am just absolutely stunned with the support with this GoFundTheWall campaign on GoFundMe.
[02:53:16.649 --> 02:53:18.550]  This has been quite miraculous.
[02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:21.572]  I think it's already up to about, what, six million dollars?
[02:53:21.572 --> 02:53:24.414]  And it's still the number one trend on Twitter right now?
[02:53:24.414 --> 02:53:26.055]  Yeah, like three days old, I think, like 72 hours maybe?
[02:53:26.055 --> 02:53:28.437]  But really, today, it just skyrocketed.
[02:53:28.823 --> 02:53:31.446]  Which means tomorrow it's probably going to be even a bigger skyrocket.
[02:53:31.446 --> 02:53:32.567]  I mean, what do you think, Owen?
[02:53:32.567 --> 02:53:35.029]  Do you think that we're going to reach the goal here?
[02:53:35.029 --> 02:53:37.872]  A million dollars is a really big goal to try to reach.
[02:53:37.872 --> 02:53:40.714]  Yeah, well, a billion dollars.
[02:53:40.714 --> 02:53:42.055]  I do not.
[02:53:42.055 --> 02:53:44.017]  I'd be stunned if we could reach a billion dollars.
[02:53:44.017 --> 02:53:48.642]  To me, this is just an exercise in showing the world and President Trump
[02:53:49.773 --> 02:53:52.035]  We're behind the wall, we'll fund the wall.
[02:53:52.035 --> 02:54:06.346]  See, doesn't this, this is the perfect actually paradox, because here you have our elected leaders in government screwing us sideways, not giving the voters anything they want, and we literally have to take matters into our own hands.
[02:54:06.346 --> 02:54:11.831]  I say, shut the government down, shut the whole damn government down, let's just fund everything privately.
[02:54:11.971 --> 02:54:16.195]  Well, because even the $1 billion goal is not enough to build the full wall.
[02:54:16.195 --> 02:54:18.917]  I think we're looking at about $5 billion to fund the wall.
[02:54:18.917 --> 02:54:20.758]  So this would just be a start.
[02:54:20.758 --> 02:54:22.480]  And here's the thing, Owen.
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:29.426]  Actually, they're saying that if every person that voted for Trump gave $80, they could reach this goal here.
[02:54:29.426 --> 02:54:30.667]  So it is a possibility.
[02:54:30.667 --> 02:54:32.828]  And I've been seeing a lot of people dropping about $100 or so on average.
[02:54:34.850 --> 02:54:39.514]  And there is a maximum of about 50,000 to donate.
[02:54:39.514 --> 02:54:47.841]  So if we start seeing big players here, big business owners, wealthy people jumping in, celebrities like Kid Rock, who knows?
[02:54:47.841 --> 02:54:50.063]  They start throwing money in the pot here.
[02:54:50.063 --> 02:54:53.586]  We could see Americans reach this goal and this could actually speak volumes.
[02:54:53.586 --> 02:54:56.389]  You know, and here's my frustration, and I'll just put it all out there.
[02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:58.210]  I'm not going to donate to this fund because
[02:54:59.091 --> 02:55:00.772]  I'm ticked off that I even have to.
[02:55:00.772 --> 02:55:14.180]  I have proposed legislation to give $10 billion taxpayer dollars to Central America, but I have to fund a wall that we need for national security out of my own pocket voluntarily?
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:18.743]  Just as an issue, I can't even do that because it just feels so wrong.
[02:55:18.743 --> 02:55:20.144]  But let me just kind of highlight this.
[02:55:21.465 --> 02:55:26.969]  Well, I'll donate to it, because honestly, I think that the American people need this wall.
[02:55:26.969 --> 02:55:31.091]  I think it's something that's going to benefit us all personally.
[02:55:31.091 --> 02:55:33.913]  If the government shuts down, then maybe I'll contribute.
[02:55:33.913 --> 02:55:34.714]  If the government shuts down.
[02:55:34.714 --> 02:55:43.579]  Well, the good news here is that, I'm pretty sure how GoFundMe works, is if they don't reach the goal, you'll get refunded, you'll get your money back.
[02:55:43.579 --> 02:55:46.641]  So, you know, it's just, are you willing to put up the money?
[02:55:46.641 --> 02:55:47.142]  I'm surprised.
[02:55:47.942 --> 02:55:50.124]  It may still happen.
[02:55:50.124 --> 02:55:53.287]  They could shut this down for being racist and bigoted and xenophobic.
[02:55:53.287 --> 02:55:56.490]  That could be just around the corner, and that's no joke.
[02:55:56.490 --> 02:56:02.475]  But look at this, to kind of go back to the issue of Austin turning into California here, which just breaks my heart.
[02:56:02.475 --> 02:56:04.777]  I'm not from here, but moving here, it's a beautiful city.
[02:56:05.678 --> 02:56:11.421]  California cops frustrated with sanctuary laws stopping them from working with ICE over twice deported criminals.
[02:56:11.421 --> 02:56:17.103]  So again, just, you know, non-citizens here illegally get more government protection than the citizens that pay for everything.
[02:56:17.103 --> 02:56:22.606]  You have Democrats dancing at a DC bar, getting drunk, celebrating how they denied the American people what they need, what they want.
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:26.142]  And by the way, so here's California.
[02:56:26.142 --> 02:56:30.605]  It's the richest state as far as the richest area codes in the United States.
[02:56:30.605 --> 02:56:33.887]  It has 40 of the 50 top richest area codes.
[02:56:33.887 --> 02:56:38.651]  It also has the most poverty, most homelessness, most drug-ridden, feces-ridden streets.
[02:56:38.651 --> 02:56:43.875]  And now it's just come out, it's also the least, dead last when it comes to education.
[02:56:43.875 --> 02:56:45.716]  That's what you get from a California city.
[02:56:45.716 --> 02:56:50.900]  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, the dumb get dumber, and you get nothing.
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:56.965]  And then, this also ties into the California-Texas thing, New York leads nation in population loss.
[02:56:56.965 --> 02:57:11.176]  These are tax exoduses happening because of Democrat states like New York and California that now are finally paying their fair share of taxes for the first time in decades, because we don't have to pay the federal tax.
[02:57:11.176 --> 02:57:17.261]  So now they're all leaving those states that they're destroying, and then they're coming to conservative states like Texas and Utah.
[02:57:17.441 --> 02:57:22.163]  So they're gonna destroy all the wealth and economic prosperity of our state after they destroyed theirs?
[02:57:22.163 --> 02:57:24.744]  Oh yeah, and then they'll come here and they'll vote Democrat.
[02:57:24.744 --> 02:57:31.386]  So the Democrats can come in and put the high taxes and the bad policies in to destroy Texas.
[02:57:31.386 --> 02:57:37.248]  And it just sucks, man, because... I mean, can't we just have one state?
[02:57:37.248 --> 02:57:39.889]  Can't we just have one place that the Democrats don't destroy?
[02:57:39.889 --> 02:57:43.611]  Can't I have one city with beautiful infrastructure that the left doesn't destroy?
[02:57:43.611 --> 02:57:44.111]  Just one?
[02:57:45.293 --> 02:57:50.816]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:57:50.816 --> 02:58:00.562]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:58:00.562 --> 02:58:08.667]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:58:09.653 --> 02:58:17.576]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:58:17.576 --> 02:58:20.677]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:58:20.677 --> 02:58:22.178]  It really is amazing.
[02:58:22.178 --> 02:58:28.881]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:58:28.881 --> 02:58:31.502]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:58:32.859 --> 02:58:34.401]  Of Infowars.
[02:58:34.401 --> 02:58:35.702]  So please spread the links.
[02:58:35.702 --> 02:58:39.045]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:39.045 --> 02:58:42.368]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:58:42.368 --> 02:58:43.690]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:58:43.690 --> 02:58:44.811]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:58:46.559 --> 02:58:50.802]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.802 --> 02:58:54.284]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.284 --> 02:58:56.066]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:56.066 --> 02:58:59.328]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.328 --> 02:59:06.112]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.112 --> 02:59:11.196]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:11.536 --> 02:59:17.640]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.640 --> 02:59:20.622]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.622 --> 02:59:21.702]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.702 --> 02:59:25.544]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.544 --> 02:59:27.566]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.566 --> 02:59:28.866]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.866 --> 02:59:29.927]  I've prayed for that.
[02:59:29.927 --> 02:59:31.568]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.568 --> 02:59:34.510]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:35.831]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.831 --> 02:59:37.852]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.132 --> 02:59:49.662]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at 4Wars4.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.662 --> 02:59:52.305]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.509 --> 03:00:05.671]  Big Brother.
[03:00:05.671 --> 03:00:07.454]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:07.454 --> 03:00:09.356]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.356 --> 03:00:11.059]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:11.059 --> 03:00:12.701]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:17.828]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.828 --> 03:00:20.852]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:22.543 --> 03:00:27.287]  Alright, last segment with Millie Weaver here, and then I'm gonna check out and get ready for the War Room.
[03:00:27.287 --> 03:00:28.708]  Matt Bracken is gonna take over.
[03:00:28.708 --> 03:00:35.854]  Folks, we have just extended the Christmas sales at InfoWarsTore.com to the New Year.

[03:00:49.142 --> 03:00:50.283]  It's all at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:00:50.283 --> 03:00:53.004]  It's how everything we do here is made possible.
[03:00:53.004 --> 03:00:56.025]  Free t-shirt with every order, free shipping store wide.
[03:00:56.025 --> 03:00:59.667]  All right, Millie and I are just going to kind of hit some topics here and just banter back and forth.
[03:01:00.467 --> 03:01:02.808]  This was a story that just came out today.
[03:01:02.808 --> 03:01:07.910]  Survey, one in four adults check phone less than a minute after waking up.
[03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:09.051]  I'd be shocked if it's not more than this.
[03:01:09.051 --> 03:01:10.171]  I know I fall into this category.
[03:01:10.171 --> 03:01:15.514]  In fact, what I decided to do, Millie, to try to make this into a positive thing, because I just can't help it.
[03:01:15.514 --> 03:01:18.855]  It's like, I just want to get info as soon as I wake up.
[03:01:18.855 --> 03:01:20.956]  You know, check, you know how it goes.
[03:01:20.956 --> 03:01:21.837]  You're in the same business.
[03:01:21.837 --> 03:01:22.197]  Exactly.
[03:01:22.977 --> 03:01:29.058]  But what I did to try to kind of mitigate the negative side effect of this is I installed a Bible app on my phone.
[03:01:29.058 --> 03:01:37.840]  So now when I go to my phone, the first thing I do is actually read the Bible instead of like checking my Twitter messages or who's, you know, adding me or go to Drudge Report or something like that.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:44.342]  But I think it does just lend credence to the fact that these apps and more so even your cell phone is addicting.
[03:01:44.342 --> 03:01:45.682]  I mean, it is an addicting thing.
[03:01:46.082 --> 03:02:02.311]  Exactly, and you know there have been several studies that have come out that says that Facebook usage is linked with depression and other mental health issues because what happens is people go on these social media sites and they don't get the likes they were hoping or expecting or the comments they were hoping or expecting.
[03:02:02.311 --> 03:02:08.455]  Or they see their hero that looks amazing which is all fake, fake boobs, fake makeup, fake hair, fake life.
[03:02:08.455 --> 03:02:10.556]  It's like, oh why isn't everybody that happy?
[03:02:10.776 --> 03:02:19.259]  Well, because everyone's just posting, look at me, look how great my life is, and then everyone in reality is depressed because they're using social media.
[03:02:19.259 --> 03:02:30.323]  And I don't know about you, Owen, but I've noticed that I've kind of lost touch with a lot of like my school friends and high school friends in a way because of social media, because everyone can just look at each other's lives.
[03:02:30.323 --> 03:02:32.664]  Nobody really feels the need to pick up a phone and call.
[03:02:32.944 --> 03:02:34.145]  More like visit even.
[03:02:34.145 --> 03:02:35.867]  Or even visit, and the same with family.
[03:02:35.867 --> 03:02:38.069]  It's not good.
[03:02:38.069 --> 03:02:53.566]  One of the things I wanted to touch on here with Facebook though, and Twitter, is that recently Facebook and Twitter just deleted a bunch of accounts that had, they're claiming these accounts were spreading fake news that could influence the Bangladesh elections.
[03:02:53.886 --> 03:02:56.627]  Just 10 days before the Bangladesh elections.
[03:02:56.627 --> 03:03:04.531]  So this just goes to show that Facebook is engaging in election meddling, not just in America, but in other countries as well.
[03:03:04.531 --> 03:03:08.132]  Which you reported on Sheryl Sandberg admitting that in her hearing.
[03:03:08.132 --> 03:03:08.792]  Yeah!
[03:03:08.792 --> 03:03:10.233]  And who knows what the fake news is?
[03:03:10.233 --> 03:03:11.714]  I mean, who decides what's fake news?
[03:03:11.714 --> 03:03:12.594]  They're fake news.
[03:03:12.594 --> 03:03:14.415]  I call her Big Mother.
[03:03:14.415 --> 03:03:17.636]  Because she literally sounded like Big Brother, but a female version.
[03:03:17.636 --> 03:03:19.237]  And didn't she put that vibe off too?
[03:03:19.237 --> 03:03:21.118]  Like, I mean, she had that vibe.
[03:03:21.118 --> 03:03:21.978]  That domineering.
[03:03:22.478 --> 03:03:24.220]  Yes, it was so creepy.
[03:03:24.220 --> 03:03:25.060]  She's Big Mother.
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:30.625]  She sat there and said, we will make sure that we censor and crack down on fake news.
[03:03:30.625 --> 03:03:31.606]  It is Big Mother.
[03:03:31.606 --> 03:03:32.347]  She's Big Mother.
[03:03:32.347 --> 03:03:37.011]  Speaking of Big Mother, a sweatshop firing on all cylinders.
[03:03:37.011 --> 03:03:39.693]  What it's like to work at Amazon during Christmas.
[03:03:39.693 --> 03:03:41.514]  That's from The Guardian.
[03:03:41.514 --> 03:03:42.675]  So that's nice.
[03:03:42.675 --> 03:03:43.116]  By the way,
[03:03:44.622 --> 03:03:49.784]  The Justice Department charges Chinese nationals an extensive global hacking campaign.
[03:03:49.784 --> 03:03:51.985]  So they make this whole thing about Russia, Millie.
[03:03:51.985 --> 03:03:52.906]  It's China!
[03:03:52.906 --> 03:03:55.027]  China's the one with the backdoor into the cellphones.
[03:03:55.027 --> 03:03:56.668]  China's the one buying up Apple.
[03:03:56.668 --> 03:04:00.009]  China's the one stealing intellectual property from the United States by spying on us.
[03:04:00.009 --> 03:04:01.230]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[03:04:01.230 --> 03:04:03.591]  And then they say, oh, Russia's the boogeyman.
[03:04:03.591 --> 03:04:05.812]  Russia's just minding its own business!
[03:04:05.812 --> 03:04:08.193]  China's the one hacking and stealing everything!
[03:04:08.673 --> 03:04:16.319]  These big tech companies are more capable of engaging in election meddling and rigging than the Russians.
[03:04:16.319 --> 03:04:25.227]  My goodness, even Sundar Pichai said it was only, what, $4,700 that these supposed Russian accounts put towards election meddling?
[03:04:25.227 --> 03:04:34.294]  Give me a break, that's nothing when you are a multi-billion dollar corporation that has the ability to spy on every American, including our politicians, and then
[03:04:34.714 --> 03:04:40.299]  Try to sway people to go look at certain articles that say, woohoo, vote for Hillary Clinton!
[03:04:40.299 --> 03:04:51.210]  Well, in case you thought things were crazy, the winner of CNN's Journalist of the Year is a known liar on record, and the Financial Times Man of the Year is George Soros, so that's what we get.
[03:04:54.332 --> 03:04:59.855]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:04:59.855 --> 03:05:09.621]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:05:09.621 --> 03:05:17.726]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:05:18.695 --> 03:05:26.619]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:05:26.619 --> 03:05:29.740]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:05:29.740 --> 03:05:31.241]  It really is amazing.
[03:05:31.241 --> 03:05:37.944]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:05:37.944 --> 03:05:40.566]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:43.462]  Of InfoWars.
[03:05:43.462 --> 03:05:44.763]  So please spread the links.

[03:05:48.107 --> 03:05:51.430]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:05:51.430 --> 03:05:52.752]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:05:52.752 --> 03:05:53.853]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:06:04.329 --> 03:06:11.154]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:11.154 --> 03:06:17.800]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:25.586]  Okay, I've got the rest of the hour, and we will be taking some phone calls in a little while, so the call-in numbers to the studio are 877-789-2539.
[03:06:30.462 --> 03:06:35.285]  Also known as 877-789-ALEX.
[03:06:35.285 --> 03:06:42.789]  But I'm sure that folks already have those numbers on speed dial, so we'll be watching that fill up pretty quick.
[03:06:42.789 --> 03:06:45.111]  I wanted to finish a few thoughts.
[03:06:45.111 --> 03:06:55.457]  I was, you know, watching Owen and Millie, and I was just, one of the final comments was about the, you know, what was the value of the Russian meddling in American social media?
[03:06:56.630 --> 03:07:08.519]  And you think, how do you put a monetary value on Google, YouTube, which is the same company, Facebook and Twitter, slanting their algorithms against conservatives?
[03:07:08.519 --> 03:07:14.243]  You know, when they can literally dial your volume down to 1% so that none of your followers see your tweets.
[03:07:14.243 --> 03:07:17.666]  I mean, what's the monetary value that would be put on that?
[03:07:17.666 --> 03:07:19.427]  I mean, it's incalculable.
[03:07:20.292 --> 03:07:22.474]  And it's just ho-hum, no problem.
[03:07:22.474 --> 03:07:23.955]  It's a private business.
[03:07:23.955 --> 03:07:29.920]  If they want to turn down the volume on the conservatives, that's up to them.
[03:07:29.920 --> 03:07:31.181]  You probably have already heard this.
[03:07:31.181 --> 03:07:34.824]  I was banned six months out of the last year.
[03:07:34.824 --> 03:07:37.646]  Six different 30-day Facebook bans.
[03:07:37.646 --> 03:07:39.368]  So I self-censor there like crazy.
[03:07:40.131 --> 03:07:46.954]  I was kicked off of Twitter completely for an anti-Burka meme that didn't even name a religion.
[03:07:46.954 --> 03:07:56.378]  Now, Twitter is so bad that they get brigaded by Muslims who call somebody an Islamophobe, and the next thing you know, you're off of Twitter.
[03:07:56.378 --> 03:07:59.880]  So, we can see the writing on the wall.
[03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:04.622]  Liberal big social media is going the way of MySpace.
[03:08:04.622 --> 03:08:08.824]  And the thing to do is spread your internet action around.
[03:08:09.525 --> 03:08:19.770]  You know, get on alternative social media like FreeZoxy, Gab, use BitChute, use Vimeo, use Brighteon.
[03:08:19.770 --> 03:08:26.894]  Try not to use the Big Brother networks that are basically a backdoor for the CIA and NSA.
[03:08:26.894 --> 03:08:32.677]  Anybody that didn't think that their private messages were being, you know, tracked all along is crazy.
[03:08:32.677 --> 03:08:37.940]  The only surprise, I guess, is that it was part of their advertising package to the big corporations.
[03:08:38.755 --> 03:08:45.483]  But I mean, let's face it, Facebook, Google, YouTube, they didn't just appear overnight.
[03:08:45.483 --> 03:08:52.732]  Warehouses full of servers, you know, drawing hydroelectric dams worth of power, nuke plants worth of power.
[03:08:53.607 --> 03:08:55.388]  They didn't self-fund.
[03:08:55.388 --> 03:08:58.290]  They didn't spring up organically.
[03:08:58.290 --> 03:09:07.357]  Anybody that's tried to get a big social media project going knows it costs a fortune and it takes a hell of a lot of power.
[03:09:07.357 --> 03:09:13.721]  So anybody that thinks that Facebook just miraculously found the money as it went along is crazy.
[03:09:13.721 --> 03:09:19.425]  These things were paid for and funded by the deep state as an intelligence-gathering tool.
[03:09:21.359 --> 03:09:28.667]  Terms you need to know are data mining, obviously that's been around, but social network analysis is also really key.
[03:09:28.667 --> 03:09:36.495]  Even if you don't use social media much, the computers today can crunch all of your contacts in real time.
[03:09:36.495 --> 03:09:43.782]  Your credit card use, things that you're saying that your cell phone is overhearing, these are all being stored and data crunched.
[03:09:44.386 --> 03:09:48.972]  If Big Brother ever decides to come after us, it's going to be real easy.
[03:09:48.972 --> 03:09:57.223]  They'll be able to make a list from the biggest enemy of the state down to any number you can calculate.
[03:09:57.223 --> 03:10:01.930]  Tools that Stalin, Mao, Hitler, they never had tools like that.
[03:10:02.643 --> 03:10:09.426]  So, you know, we had better stay on top of this because there's a real monster growing in our midst.
[03:10:09.426 --> 03:10:19.209]  And right now it's a friendly monster, or at least it's not chewing our arm off at the present time, you know, like it would be in China with the social credit system.
[03:10:19.209 --> 03:10:22.971]  But when it ever wanted to, if this government ever turned tyrannical,
[03:10:23.698 --> 03:10:33.444]  You can bet that the bad comrades would have their cell phones shut down, their ATM access denied, and it'll all happen in a blink.
[03:10:33.444 --> 03:10:38.207]  All of these tools are already being built, and you just know that it's coming.
[03:10:38.951 --> 03:10:48.335]  So, like I said, try to, as much as possible, I mean, I still post on Facebook, but mainly as a way to steer people towards other social media.
[03:10:48.335 --> 03:10:57.399]  I mean, let's face it, it's the 500-pound gorilla, along with YouTube and, of course, Google.
[03:10:57.399 --> 03:10:59.120]  I use DuckDuckGo.
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:01.701]  In a lot of ways, it's not as good as Google.
[03:11:01.701 --> 03:11:03.182]  It can't compare to Google Maps.
[03:11:04.013 --> 03:11:12.716]  But as soon as you allow Google Maps a presence in any, you know, on your phone or in your computer, it becomes a personal tracking device.
[03:11:12.716 --> 03:11:16.577]  Even when your phone is off, it's tracking where you're going.
[03:11:16.577 --> 03:11:20.119]  It can tell whether you're walking, driving, standing still.
[03:11:20.119 --> 03:11:22.720]  I mean, it knows how long you've been everywhere.
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:30.882]  And just imagine trying to run a guerrilla outfit against a tyrannical government when they've already got these tools in existence.
[03:11:30.882 --> 03:11:32.123]  Then the question will become,
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:36.542]  Who is actually going to carry out the arrests?
[03:11:36.542 --> 03:11:44.546]  It's easy enough for artificial intelligence to make a list of people, but, you know, for now, robots can't go door-to-door picking people up.
[03:11:44.546 --> 03:11:53.210]  Eventually, it's going to have to be federal law enforcement agents that are going to be doing this door-to-door roundup business, and that's when it's going to get pretty ugly.
[03:11:53.806 --> 03:12:07.070]  You know, right now in the state of New Jersey, they just passed a law that it's now illegal to possess a magazine for a rifle or pistol that holds more than 10 rounds.
[03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:12.971]  That means virtually every modern carbine has no means of loading it, of using it.
[03:12:12.971 --> 03:12:19.373]  That means that every modern semi-automatic pistol, almost every except for a few backup pistols,
[03:12:20.174 --> 03:12:23.855]  It has a standard magazine that carries 15 or more rounds.
[03:12:23.855 --> 03:12:25.676]  They're all illegal today.
[03:12:25.676 --> 03:12:27.937]  It's a felony to possess it.
[03:12:27.937 --> 03:12:29.517]  Nobody's turning them in.
[03:12:29.517 --> 03:12:37.660]  So there's now a huge backlog of millions of New Jersey felons that are just wondering what the hell is going to happen next.
[03:12:37.660 --> 03:12:46.583]  And when you combine that with these red flag laws, in Florida they call it an RPO, a risk protection order.
[03:12:47.358 --> 03:13:06.727]  You can imagine it's going to be pretty easy either for an ex-girlfriend or an ex-employee to SWAT you because they know you've been to the range with you, they know you're a shooter, and they're going to say, hey Joe Blow on Elm Street, he's terrorizing the neighborhood, he's aiming his AR-15 out the window.
[03:13:06.727 --> 03:13:09.048]  The next thing you know, there's the SWAT team at the door.
[03:13:09.808 --> 03:13:13.309]  And Joe might have some 30-round mags in his basement.
[03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:25.114]  We're gearing up for some rough times ahead if this happens, so I expect New Jersey to be right on the cutting edge of where any of this blowback might happen.
[03:13:25.114 --> 03:13:30.196]  But realistically, it's going to have to come down to law enforcement.
[03:13:30.936 --> 03:13:37.739]  Are the police going to say, hell no, I'm not going door-to-door, you know, looking for 30-round or 15-round magazines.
[03:13:37.739 --> 03:13:39.279]  I'm just not going to do it.
[03:13:39.279 --> 03:13:44.041]  These things were legal for the last hundred years, and they were legal last month.
[03:13:44.041 --> 03:13:51.624]  Suddenly it's a felony to possess these things, and without them, everybody's carbines and pistols are useless.
[03:13:51.624 --> 03:13:54.065]  So if police officers in New Jersey
[03:13:54.685 --> 03:14:01.167]  You know, really care about the oath they swore to uphold and defend the Constitution, they won't go along with these laws.
[03:14:01.167 --> 03:14:17.732]  But I kind of suspect that, like in most places, Britain, Germany, the police will very willingly become the Stasi, and they will go door-to-door arresting Americans, basically for no reason other than that they don't believe in the Second Amendment in New Jersey.
[03:14:18.490 --> 03:14:25.074]  So these are some of the flashpoints that we're going to expect to see coming ahead in the next few months.
[03:14:25.074 --> 03:14:30.678]  Just imagine once the Democrats get in, then it's going to be, you know, Katie bar the door.
[03:14:32.346 --> 03:14:51.467]  I expect that after any new shooting or even before the next mass shooting, the Democrats are going to move to ban standard capacity magazines, meaning magazines that hold 15 to 30 rounds, whatever the gun that they're designed for is meant to hold, that the Democrats are going to move to outlaw them.
[03:14:52.003 --> 03:14:56.232]  They just did the bump stock ban, which was sort of a test case.
[03:14:56.232 --> 03:15:01.202]  Can we just, by fiat, declare a certain object to be illegal?
[03:15:01.914 --> 03:15:03.334]  Who cares about the bump stock?
[03:15:03.334 --> 03:15:06.295]  It was a perfect trial balloon.
[03:15:06.295 --> 03:15:07.755]  It went right through.
[03:15:07.755 --> 03:15:11.036]  But next it's going to be 30-round magazines.
[03:15:11.036 --> 03:15:20.578]  And what I expect from the Rhino Republicans is they're going to say, oh no, not 30-round magazines, but how about nothing over 30 rounds?
[03:15:20.578 --> 03:15:23.999]  It's all of those 40 or 50-round magazines, they'll go.
[03:15:23.999 --> 03:15:26.039]  So it'll be the salami tactic.
[03:15:26.039 --> 03:15:29.840]  Then after the next shooting, it'll be 20-round magazines and down you go.
[03:15:30.501 --> 03:15:32.782]  That's what I expect to see coming ahead.
[03:15:32.782 --> 03:15:37.545]  All right, maybe after the next section, we'll start to take some calls.
[03:15:37.545 --> 03:15:41.407]  So hang in there, and we'll be back after the ads.
[03:15:41.407 --> 03:15:50.031]  And just remember, get to the InfoWars store, and you'll get a free Gadsden Flag InfoWars t-shirt with your order.
[03:15:50.031 --> 03:15:50.712]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:53.672 --> 03:15:54.872]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.872 --> 03:16:00.254]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.254 --> 03:16:03.155]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.155 --> 03:16:06.737]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.737 --> 03:16:14.299]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[03:16:14.299 --> 03:16:18.901]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[03:16:18.901 --> 03:16:21.322]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[03:16:21.322 --> 03:16:22.502]  Faketv.com
[03:16:23.317 --> 03:16:25.218]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[03:16:25.218 --> 03:16:28.440]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:30.042]  Savory and delicious.
[03:16:30.042 --> 03:16:32.863]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:32.863 --> 03:16:33.544]  Awesome!

[03:16:53.377 --> 03:16:54.617]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.617 --> 03:16:58.518]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.518 --> 03:17:00.059]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:00.059 --> 03:17:03.019]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:03.019 --> 03:17:08.581]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.581 --> 03:17:09.781]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:09.781 --> 03:17:12.722]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.722 --> 03:17:14.942]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:17:23.044 --> 03:17:26.927]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:26.927 --> 03:17:31.911]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:17:31.911 --> 03:17:36.735]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[03:17:36.735 --> 03:17:38.076]  Don't just take my word for it.
[03:17:38.076 --> 03:17:41.859]  Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.

[03:17:43.220 --> 03:17:43.781]  HBExtract.com.
[03:17:43.781 --> 03:17:46.083]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:54.175 --> 03:17:59.936]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[03:17:59.936 --> 03:18:12.159]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[03:18:12.159 --> 03:18:20.761]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:30.918]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[03:18:30.918 --> 03:18:33.580]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:37.403]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:18:37.403 --> 03:18:38.684]  2018 has been insane.
[03:18:38.684 --> 03:18:44.669]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:18:45.563 --> 03:18:49.246]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:18:49.246 --> 03:18:54.450]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:18:54.450 --> 03:18:59.974]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:18:59.974 --> 03:19:08.460]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:19:09.701 --> 03:19:17.808]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:19:18.817 --> 03:19:26.746]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:19:26.746 --> 03:19:29.849]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:19:29.849 --> 03:19:31.351]  It really is amazing.
[03:19:31.351 --> 03:19:38.058]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:19:38.058 --> 03:19:40.681]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.

[03:19:44.867 --> 03:19:48.211]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:19:48.211 --> 03:19:51.535]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:19:51.535 --> 03:19:52.857]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:19:52.857 --> 03:19:57.202]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:19:57.202 --> 03:19:59.826]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.822 --> 03:20:19.163]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.163 --> 03:20:26.605]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:26.605 --> 03:20:35.567]  Okay, I'm back and I'm going to be talking about the wall, but we're going to start in Syria and move on through Syria to the wall.
[03:20:35.567 --> 03:20:41.149]  But first, I want to just mention that the Infowars store is having an end of year clearance.
[03:20:41.149 --> 03:20:45.690]  This is the golden opportunity you're ever going to have to clean out the warehouse.
[03:20:46.599 --> 03:20:53.020]  It's going to go right through the end of the year, and everything is, you know, 55-60% off.
[03:20:53.020 --> 03:20:58.202]  Brain Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Blue Toothpaste, everything.
[03:20:58.202 --> 03:21:09.024]  And best of all, you'll get that really cool I Am Alex Jones Info Wars black and white Gadsden flag t-shirt with every order.
[03:21:09.024 --> 03:21:12.905]  And of course, the bumper stickers and all the other good stuff.
[03:21:12.905 --> 03:21:13.045]  Now,
[03:21:15.552 --> 03:21:21.516]  I want to tie something together that I don't know if probably other people have thought of this.
[03:21:21.516 --> 03:21:31.121]  Trump is not, you know, sometimes it seems like he's firing off the hip, but he just announced yesterday that we're pulling out of Syria.
[03:21:31.121 --> 03:21:38.185]  And this is in the same news cycle that he's getting sandbagged on funding for the border wall.
[03:21:38.185 --> 03:21:42.328]  I think he's been trying to get out of Syria ever since he came into office.
[03:21:43.397 --> 03:21:47.660]  And even within the military, there's a strong deep state element.
[03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:51.503]  It's not just, you know, the intelligence agencies, even the military.
[03:21:51.503 --> 03:21:56.667]  You know, you have to consider that every general is a Senate appointee.
[03:21:56.667 --> 03:22:03.692]  So once you put on stars, you're basically a politician beholden to the Senate.
[03:22:03.692 --> 03:22:09.937]  And the generals, when Trump came in and he started talking about, let's finish off ISIS and get out,
[03:22:10.600 --> 03:22:14.262]  He actually got very strong pushback from the military.
[03:22:14.262 --> 03:22:20.265]  I think that he felt that he was never going to be able to convince them, he just had to give the order.
[03:22:20.265 --> 03:22:25.767]  And coming at the same time as getting no funding for the border wall.
[03:22:25.767 --> 03:22:26.768]  I mean, it's a joke.
[03:22:26.768 --> 03:22:29.669]  It's what, an $8 trillion economy?
[03:22:29.669 --> 03:22:34.852]  And $5 billion for the border wall is what, less than 1%?
[03:22:34.852 --> 03:22:36.833]  It's a tiny percentage.
[03:22:36.833 --> 03:22:37.673]  It's really nothing.
[03:22:39.162 --> 03:22:50.270]  The Obama administration pulled $150 billion out of a hat to send to Iran, you know, without any congressional authority.
[03:22:50.270 --> 03:23:02.098]  They just came up with something like $150 billion, sent it to the Iranians, and yet they look at us with a straight face and say, we just can't find any money for that wall.
[03:23:03.268 --> 03:23:08.692]  And I think that what Trump is trying to do is he's setting up an optic, like a balance.
[03:23:08.692 --> 03:23:15.398]  All right, we just saved $20 billion in Syria, and I want to move that funds to the wall.
[03:23:15.398 --> 03:23:29.469]  And I think that he might even make some kind of announcements to that effect in the coming days as this continuing resolution poker game with the government shutdown looming tomorrow.
[03:23:29.469 --> 03:23:31.450]  I think that he's going to start putting it in these terms.
[03:23:33.775 --> 03:23:49.048]  Now, if you go back to the beginning of Syria, Syria is really a result of Hillary Clinton and Obama blowing up the Middle East by taking the side of the Muslim Brotherhood and pushing the Arab Spring.
[03:23:49.048 --> 03:23:55.113]  It started in Tunisia, it spread to Libya and Egypt and then to Syria.
[03:23:55.794 --> 03:24:03.363]  So Syria was a, you know, it's not a happy country overall, I would say, you know, in the best of times.
[03:24:03.363 --> 03:24:08.088]  But Syria was a more secular country than almost anywhere else in the Middle East.
[03:24:08.088 --> 03:24:11.692]  It had, you know, at least in the western parts of Syria,
[03:24:13.715 --> 03:24:26.381]  It had, you know, Christians and Alawites who formed a coalition that ran the country so that it wasn't just the Sunni fanatics, the Wahhabi Sunni fanatics running the country.
[03:24:26.381 --> 03:24:29.302]  They actually were keeping them in check.
[03:24:29.302 --> 03:24:40.067]  And during the Arab Spring, that's when the whole place blew up, which is, to me, on the... I put that on the ledger for Hillary and Obama.
[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:42.501]  Wrecking the Middle East.
[03:24:42.501 --> 03:24:45.161]  We're still dealing with the consequences of that today.
[03:24:45.161 --> 03:24:50.523]  And in that civil war, we basically, I think, took the wrong side.
[03:24:50.523 --> 03:24:55.145]  Because there are a lot of factors that aren't even really openly discussed here.
[03:24:55.145 --> 03:25:03.267]  You know, that there are things like oil pipelines and military highway routes and big geopolitical factors in play.
[03:25:03.267 --> 03:25:05.548]  And it's not just, you know, the good guys, bad guys.
[03:25:06.329 --> 03:25:21.241]  If anything, we took the side of ISIS, not directly, but we were funding, we were funding Islamist factions that were supposedly moderate, but every time we shipped them weapons, they wound up in ISIS territory.
[03:25:21.241 --> 03:25:22.402]  Every time.
[03:25:22.402 --> 03:25:27.166]  And we continued to do it, you know, year after year, right until Trump came in.
[03:25:27.166 --> 03:25:31.330]  Once Trump was in, he actually had the military drop the hammer on ISIS.
[03:25:32.159 --> 03:25:38.003]  And I think that he wants to show the deep state that, yeah, he is the Commander-in-Chief.
[03:25:38.003 --> 03:25:52.734]  Now, moving to the wall, not just considering the money will save not being in Syria, there's something that, you know, I don't know why Trump hasn't clued in on this, because he could sit down on TV with this on the wall behind him.
[03:25:52.734 --> 03:25:58.779]  Right in the Constitution, it gives the Commander-in-Chief the authority to defend the border any way he needs to.
[03:26:00.038 --> 03:26:05.544]  Before World War I, I think it was Woodrow Wilson, he sent General Pershing right into Mexico.
[03:26:05.544 --> 03:26:11.471]  I mean, on a punitive mission after a border raid by Pancho Villa in Texas.
[03:26:11.471 --> 03:26:13.533]  Or New Mexico, I forget.
[03:26:13.533 --> 03:26:16.457]  Anyway, a little border raid by Pancho Villa, we sent the U.S.
[03:26:16.457 --> 03:26:18.059]  Army right into Texas kicking ass.
[03:26:18.914 --> 03:26:32.482]  The president could send the army tomorrow to the entire border with orders to string, you know, six rows of concertina wire from the Gulf of Mexico to California and do it all within DOD funding.
[03:26:33.075 --> 03:26:47.027]  This is the essence of his mission as the Commander-in-Chief to defend the United States, not to defend Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Mali, Niger, but America.
[03:26:47.027 --> 03:26:51.590]  And it's disgraceful that there are any Republicans that go along with this.
[03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:54.313]  And really what it boils down to is
[03:26:55.362 --> 03:27:04.824]  The globalists, which includes all of the Democrats and way too many Republicans, the globalists want open borders.
[03:27:04.824 --> 03:27:08.745]  It's not that they don't think walls are immoral or anything like that.
[03:27:08.745 --> 03:27:10.945]  The globalists want open borders.
[03:27:10.945 --> 03:27:24.328]  Where it affects Democrats, every uneducated, non-English speaking, preferably sick, ill, lame, you know, with problem children that arrives in America,
[03:27:25.151 --> 03:27:28.834]  is a perpetual funding machine for the Democrat Party.
[03:27:28.834 --> 03:27:43.744]  Not only will that person and their family and offspring eventually all become Democrats, but they're going to require platoons of government workers, social workers, to take care of their needs, to educate them, to medicate them, to incarcerate them.
[03:27:43.744 --> 03:27:45.586]  Those are all government jobs.
[03:27:45.586 --> 03:27:48.107]  So they don't care if the country is ruined.
[03:27:48.107 --> 03:27:51.710]  They don't care if Americans' standard of living crashes.
[03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:52.951]  That means nothing to them.
[03:27:53.757 --> 03:28:05.486]  Basically, the Democrats would rather rule the ruins of a failed socialist country than compete for power in a successful, prosperous republic.
[03:28:05.486 --> 03:28:10.589]  You look at the worst cities in America, they've been run by the Democrats forever.
[03:28:10.589 --> 03:28:14.552]  Baltimore, Detroit, the state of California now.
[03:28:14.552 --> 03:28:16.874]  Well, that doesn't bother the Democrats.
[03:28:16.874 --> 03:28:19.436]  They look at Venezuela, and you know what they think of that?
[03:28:20.518 --> 03:28:24.960]  The socialists sure do know how to stay in power, and they're living great.
[03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:31.362]  So they'd rather rule the ruins in a failed socialist country than compete with Republicans.
[03:28:31.362 --> 03:28:37.524]  And too many Republicans go along with that because they just want cheap labor for their factories and farms.
[03:28:37.524 --> 03:28:41.345]  And we Americans, we get stuck with the bill.
[03:28:41.345 --> 03:28:43.906]  Okay, when we come back, we'll start taking some phone calls.
[03:28:43.906 --> 03:28:45.667]  This is Matt Bracken for InfoWars.
[03:28:53.285 --> 03:28:56.867]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.867 --> 03:29:00.449]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.449 --> 03:29:02.570]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.570 --> 03:29:04.591]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?
[03:29:04.591 --> 03:29:10.354]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads, made by Biomed DB Design, right here in the USA, come in all sizes.

[03:29:54.082 --> 03:29:58.204]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:29:58.204 --> 03:30:05.268]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:30:05.268 --> 03:30:10.091]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:30:10.091 --> 03:30:16.975]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[03:30:17.415 --> 03:30:23.421]  that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:30:23.421 --> 03:30:33.011]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:30:33.011 --> 03:30:40.119]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:30:40.439 --> 03:30:45.923]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:30:45.923 --> 03:30:52.108]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:31:09.448 --> 03:31:17.555]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:31:18.544 --> 03:31:26.469]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:31:26.469 --> 03:31:29.571]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:31:29.571 --> 03:31:31.072]  It really is amazing.
[03:31:31.072 --> 03:31:37.777]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:31:37.777 --> 03:31:40.459]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:43.291]  Of Infowars.
[03:31:43.291 --> 03:31:44.591]  So please, spread the links.
[03:31:44.591 --> 03:31:47.932]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:31:47.932 --> 03:31:51.254]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:31:51.254 --> 03:31:52.594]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:31:52.594 --> 03:31:54.195]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:31:54.195 --> 03:31:58.136]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.136 --> 03:32:01.437]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.437 --> 03:32:03.918]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater.
[03:32:03.918 --> 03:32:07.700]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:10.481]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.201 --> 03:32:15.026]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.026 --> 03:32:21.514]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.514 --> 03:32:26.479]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.222 --> 03:32:31.144]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.144 --> 03:32:38.347]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.347 --> 03:32:43.029]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.029 --> 03:32:49.251]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.251 --> 03:32:53.233]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.242 --> 03:33:00.563]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:00.563 --> 03:33:10.765]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:10.765 --> 03:33:12.505]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:12.505 --> 03:33:15.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.976 --> 03:33:34.078]  Matt Bracken back again for the last half hour.
[03:33:34.078 --> 03:33:36.660]  I had a few more thoughts on the wall.
[03:33:36.660 --> 03:33:46.726]  You know, this GoFundMe account that a veteran has raised a good amount of money, but really just a drop in the bucket in terms of what's required.
[03:33:46.726 --> 03:33:48.727]  This reminds me of back in the early 2000s.
[03:33:48.727 --> 03:33:52.169]  This is even before the Tea Party, I believe.
[03:33:52.169 --> 03:33:54.410]  There was a group called the Minute Men.
[03:33:54.410 --> 03:33:58.293]  This was an internet, you know, grassroots internet effort.
[03:33:58.917 --> 03:34:05.120]  of folks to go down and actually watch the border and then call to the border patrol and they saw incursions.
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:12.323]  These were just, you know, basic good-hearted Americans sitting in lawn chairs with binoculars, you know, sun umbrellas.
[03:34:12.323 --> 03:34:21.148]  And they were portrayed in the media as the worst, you know, racist, Gestapo, Nazi, you know, hateful people.
[03:34:21.148 --> 03:34:24.029]  And all they were trying to do is help to keep an eye on the border.
[03:34:24.781 --> 03:34:34.008]  So this GoFundMe account, no doubt it'll be also portrayed as a bunch of, you know, of anti-immigrant racists, which is really a shame.
[03:34:34.008 --> 03:34:45.055]  But getting back to Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution that basically says the government is responsible to protect the states from invasion, and that's what's going on, is an invasion.
[03:34:45.055 --> 03:34:49.238]  It's actually changing the demography of the country.
[03:34:49.238 --> 03:34:54.242]  People that don't speak English, never heard of the Constitution, don't care about the Constitution,
[03:34:55.023 --> 03:34:56.844]  They're going to vote Democrat.
[03:34:56.844 --> 03:35:02.146]  I've read recently that two-thirds of the illegal aliens are on welfare.
[03:35:02.146 --> 03:35:03.406]  Two-thirds!
[03:35:03.406 --> 03:35:06.607]  Which is far higher than Native Americans.
[03:35:06.607 --> 03:35:22.493]  So not only are we importing future Democrat voters with lots of physical and mental disabilities to be paid for by us, but we're importing folks that for the foreseeable future are going to be a pure drain on us.
[03:35:23.354 --> 03:35:27.837]  And the Democrats don't care, and even a lot of Republicans don't care.
[03:35:27.837 --> 03:35:37.142]  Basically, the elite gated community crowd that runs the country, they don't care if the entire country looks like Caracas in 10 years.
[03:35:37.142 --> 03:35:51.091]  If you go to the worst third world countries, there are all Zona Rosas that look like a Latin American telenovela mansion, you know, like the mansion in Sicario at the end.
[03:35:51.727 --> 03:35:53.448]  That's how these guys live.
[03:35:53.448 --> 03:35:57.551]  They don't care if it's Mad Max right outside of the gate.
[03:35:57.551 --> 03:35:58.151]  They don't care.
[03:35:58.151 --> 03:35:59.952]  They fly in helicopters.
[03:35:59.952 --> 03:36:03.454]  They ride in convoys of armored SUVs.
[03:36:03.454 --> 03:36:05.335]  They own the police.
[03:36:05.335 --> 03:36:11.859]  They can go out and grab anybody off the street like they were Saddam Hussein's kids.
[03:36:11.859 --> 03:36:17.983]  So it's really fantastic to live in a failed third world country if your name is Chavez or Maduro.
[03:36:18.835 --> 03:36:23.457]  And that's what the Democrats and a lot of the Republicans are looking forward to.
[03:36:23.457 --> 03:36:29.659]  So anybody that says they're against building the wall is an open borders globalist.
[03:36:29.659 --> 03:36:30.759]  Period.
[03:36:30.759 --> 03:36:45.144]  Now Trump made a mistake early on by defining it strictly as a wall, when in fact the better solutions have been multiple fence systems like they have in Israel and Hungary and other countries.
[03:36:46.058 --> 03:36:52.160]  You know, if you have a jeep trail along a triple wire fence, nobody's getting through.
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:53.520]  They're just not.
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:37:06.824]  When you have no effective wall, and the Border Patrol is forced to defend, you know, 50, 100 miles in depth, imagine the number of square miles, 2,000 miles of border times 100 miles deep.
[03:37:06.824 --> 03:37:12.926]  That same number of Border Patrol, if they're at an effective barrier, like a double fence,
[03:37:13.638 --> 03:37:19.801]  That same number of Border Patrol spread out over 100 miles times 2,000 miles of square miles.
[03:37:19.801 --> 03:37:24.824]  If they're right along an effective barrier, there's like a Border Patrol guy every 100 feet.
[03:37:24.824 --> 03:37:27.105]  Nobody is sneaking through, ever.
[03:37:27.105 --> 03:37:31.847]  Where they've been tried, like Israel and Hungary, they reduce illegal crossings like 99.9%.
[03:37:34.332 --> 03:37:37.234]  And that's why the Democrats don't want it.
[03:37:37.234 --> 03:37:44.119]  Every illegal alien crossing the border and their children are future Democrat voters.
[03:37:44.119 --> 03:37:46.021]  And they know it's going to ruin the country.
[03:37:46.021 --> 03:37:49.163]  They know the country's going to wind up looking like Venezuela.
[03:37:49.895 --> 03:37:54.662]  And they don't care because they know they'll be in the ruling class.
[03:37:54.662 --> 03:37:57.106]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[03:37:57.106 --> 03:38:00.931]  Democrats don't mind ruling the ruins.
[03:38:00.931 --> 03:38:04.817]  That's why all of these cities like Baltimore, Detroit,
[03:38:05.512 --> 03:38:07.674]  They're run by Democrats forever.
[03:38:07.674 --> 03:38:10.896]  But the Democrats in charge, they live like kings.
[03:38:10.896 --> 03:38:14.499]  And they've got job security for the rest of their lives.
[03:38:14.499 --> 03:38:17.882]  And that's the plan they have for the entire country.
[03:38:17.882 --> 03:38:22.205]  In fact, that's the plan that the globalists have for the entire world.
[03:38:22.205 --> 03:38:25.588]  Last week was Marrakesh, which at the time
[03:38:26.531 --> 03:38:29.432]  Some of the European leaders said, well, it's non-binding.
[03:38:29.432 --> 03:38:31.273]  But it actually is binding.
[03:38:31.273 --> 03:38:41.478]  When the General Assembly affirms the entire thing, the UN is now going to be saying there's a human right to free migration.
[03:38:41.478 --> 03:38:46.560]  There's hundreds of millions of people around the world that would move to America tomorrow.
[03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:55.204]  Then you've got this crazy judge in Washington that just said, everybody who's been deported, we need to give them plane tickets to come back to America.
[03:38:55.911 --> 03:38:57.753]  I mean, these are the globalists.
[03:38:57.753 --> 03:39:00.417]  They absolutely do not give a damn about you.
[03:39:01.081 --> 03:39:07.262]  They just want to wreck the country so that they can rule the ruins from the castle.
[03:39:07.262 --> 03:39:13.184]  It's fantastic to be the king in a feudal society, but we don't want to be peasants.
[03:39:13.184 --> 03:39:15.784]  We want to be free men, freeholders.
[03:39:15.784 --> 03:39:22.086]  We don't want to be, you know, third world peons with a king up in a castle on the hill.
[03:39:22.086 --> 03:39:28.267]  But that's the plan that they've got for us, and they've dressed it up in human rights.
[03:39:28.931 --> 03:39:33.754]  But look, we still have a sovereign country, and we're going to have to fight for it.
[03:39:33.754 --> 03:39:39.298]  Come January, the Democrats are going to be in charge, and I don't see a fence coming then.
[03:39:39.298 --> 03:39:43.301]  Really, the only hope for Trump is to militarize the border as commander-in-chief.
[03:39:44.048 --> 03:39:48.310]  Have the Army Corps of Engineers string concertina wire the whole way.
[03:39:48.310 --> 03:39:53.553]  Then at least the Border Patrol and the military will have something that they can guard.
[03:39:53.553 --> 03:40:01.937]  Instead of, I mean, they show these like San Diego sections that actually have an effective fence, but half of the border looks like a rusty cattle fence.
[03:40:01.937 --> 03:40:03.938]  You know, a few strands of barbed wire.
[03:40:03.938 --> 03:40:05.999]  That's what most of the border looks like.
[03:40:05.999 --> 03:40:07.000]  Not like that.
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.481]  Most of the border is actually just walk-through.
[03:40:10.336 --> 03:40:14.819]  It's just harder to get to, but people do walk through by the hundreds every day.
[03:40:14.819 --> 03:40:21.162]  All right, we still have a couple minutes, so I'm going to take a call now.
[03:40:21.162 --> 03:40:27.425]  The first person in today was a fellow Floridian, or a lady Floridian, Emily in Florida.
[03:40:27.425 --> 03:40:30.267]  Are you still hanging on there?
[03:40:30.267 --> 03:40:31.948]  Says you want to talk about the Constitution.
[03:40:31.948 --> 03:40:34.109]  Oh, yeah, it's actually a book.
[03:40:34.109 --> 03:40:34.429]  Oh, a meal!
[03:40:36.658 --> 03:40:39.299]  Okay, Emil.
[03:40:39.299 --> 03:40:42.781]  Anyway, yeah, I just want to call that out.
[03:40:42.781 --> 03:40:47.743]  I think if we focus more on our representatives, then we could get this wall done.
[03:40:47.743 --> 03:40:51.885]  And we're not going to get it by just go funding me.
[03:40:51.885 --> 03:40:57.707]  What we have to do is do what the founding fathers did with the Declaration of Independence.
[03:40:58.286 --> 03:41:01.807]  And what Newt Gingrich did with the contract with America.
[03:41:01.807 --> 03:41:06.287]  We wrote our grievances on a one-page bill that everybody could understand.
[03:41:06.287 --> 03:41:08.648]  And then we sent it to everybody.
[03:41:08.648 --> 03:41:12.189]  And that's what we should do with a bill called the Constitution Carta.
[03:41:12.189 --> 03:41:19.710]  It's a Tea Party bill that tells Congress to shut down federal departments and the problems will solve themselves.
[03:41:19.710 --> 03:41:21.690]  Until we focus.
[03:41:21.690 --> 03:41:22.530]  Yeah.
[03:41:22.530 --> 03:41:25.391]  And that's... Well, yeah, you know, that's...
[03:41:26.241 --> 03:41:35.770]  It's nice, but I mean, I think it's a fantasy because in January, Nancy Pelosi is going to be in charge of the Congress and nothing is going to happen like that.
[03:41:35.770 --> 03:41:51.205]  The lame duck Republicans who did nothing for the two years that they had all three branches in their control, the lame duck Republicans, all they can do is try to pass a continuing resolution with some border funding hopefully snuck in, which is a joke.
[03:41:51.792 --> 03:41:57.381]  So it's just going to get worse in January because there's going to be no funding coming from Congress.
[03:41:57.381 --> 03:42:03.011]  The only way any kind of border fence or wall or barrier is going to be built is if Trump
[03:42:03.661 --> 03:42:14.072]  Takes it out of the DOD budget, declares it a national emergency, and invokes Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution to defend the states from invasion.
[03:42:14.072 --> 03:42:18.117]  He can do that and completely circumvent Congress.
[03:42:18.117 --> 03:42:19.979]  Thanks, Emil.
[03:42:19.979 --> 03:42:23.002]  Let's see, we don't have time for another call.
[03:42:23.002 --> 03:42:24.384]  We'll get to one after the next break.
[03:42:24.944 --> 03:42:28.106]  But yeah, there's no more funding for a wall.
[03:42:28.106 --> 03:42:36.612]  Even if something is snuck through in the next couple of weeks, the Democrats are going to find some bureaucratic way to hold the funding up.
[03:42:36.612 --> 03:42:39.554]  It's not going to be built with regular government contracts.
[03:42:39.554 --> 03:42:46.439]  It's going to have to be the president as commander-in-chief defending it with the Army Corps of Engineers.
[03:42:46.439 --> 03:42:48.581]  It's the only way it's going to get built.
[03:42:48.581 --> 03:42:50.022]  We'll be back in a couple minutes.
[03:42:53.052 --> 03:42:58.816]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[03:42:58.816 --> 03:43:11.044]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing as being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[03:43:11.044 --> 03:43:21.031]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:43:21.031 --> 03:43:21.632]  Everybody knows
[03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:29.788]  Who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[03:43:29.788 --> 03:43:32.471]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:43:32.471 --> 03:43:36.275]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:43:36.275 --> 03:43:37.116]  2018 has been insane.
[03:43:37.116 --> 03:43:43.563]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:43:44.437 --> 03:43:48.118]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:43:48.118 --> 03:43:52.200]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:44:08.055 --> 03:44:17.197]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:44:17.197 --> 03:44:22.559]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:44:22.559 --> 03:44:24.840]  We have those incredible sell prices back.

[03:44:54.195 --> 03:44:59.719]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:44:59.719 --> 03:45:09.486]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:45:09.486 --> 03:45:17.572]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:45:18.544 --> 03:45:26.488]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:45:26.488 --> 03:45:29.589]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:45:29.589 --> 03:45:31.090]  It really is amazing.
[03:45:31.090 --> 03:45:37.773]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:45:37.773 --> 03:45:40.475]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:45:41.747 --> 03:45:42.267]  I don't think so.
[03:46:03.354 --> 03:46:09.939]  Info Wars Life is proud to bring you a powerhouse bone broth formula to help push you to your limits.

[03:46:57.229 --> 03:47:15.034]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.034 --> 03:47:23.276]  Okay, last segment, and I'm going to just try to get through some phone calls here since people have been patiently holding.
[03:47:24.222 --> 03:47:33.024]  And I'll try not to monopolize the time and give everybody, you know, about a minute or so, minute or two to make your point and I'll respond to it.
[03:47:33.024 --> 03:47:35.564]  So let's see, Julie in Michigan, are you still holding?
[03:47:35.564 --> 03:47:38.825]  I want to talk about the GoFundMe attempt.
[03:47:38.825 --> 03:47:40.725]  Go ahead, Julie.
[03:47:40.725 --> 03:47:43.226]  Hi, Matt.
[03:47:43.226 --> 03:47:52.388]  Yeah, I donated to the GoFundMe account last night and it was like one and a half million and now it's like I think approaching seven million.
[03:47:53.786 --> 03:48:10.354]  Which, even though it is just a drop in the bucket, like you said, I'm super excited about it because it really sends a message that, you know, what the people want, what the majority of the people want, you know, is border security.
[03:48:10.354 --> 03:48:22.860]  And I'm really hoping it just, you know, really makes a big impact in the news and, you know, can be a point that's made to our representatives and everything that people
[03:48:23.667 --> 03:48:28.090]  are genuinely interested in this, enough to fund it themselves, you know?
[03:48:28.090 --> 03:48:31.912]  Go ahead.
[03:48:31.912 --> 03:48:32.753]  Oh, second point.
[03:48:32.753 --> 03:48:35.874]  I'll just throw out my three points and then let you do your thing.
[03:48:35.874 --> 03:48:42.478]  Second point is, I totally do not believe the outcome of the midterm elections.
[03:48:42.478 --> 03:48:51.464]  I think that there was a lot of voter fraud that went on, just sheerly based on the record crowds that came out to Trump's rallies.
[03:48:53.016 --> 03:48:58.920]  I just don't believe it for one second that, you know, the Democrats legally took the House.
[03:48:58.920 --> 03:49:18.616]  And then third of all, my third and last point is, I think that for those who are willing, we could really use InfoWars, the different shows, to have maybe just a minute or two of collective prayer, which would be, I think, very powerful in, you know, helping our cause.
[03:49:20.390 --> 03:49:45.012]  Okay, well, as far as the GoFundMe, I think that it's useful for just a media event, but it won't actually lead to anything because any construction has to come through either a congressional appropriation, which the Democrats are going to choke off no matter what, or President Trump making it a military situation and doing it under Article 4, Section 4.
[03:49:46.968 --> 03:49:48.289]  Prayer is always good.
[03:49:48.289 --> 03:49:49.730]  I don't know about group prayers.
[03:49:49.730 --> 03:49:52.631]  It's really not my thing.
[03:49:52.631 --> 03:49:57.214]  I've got a bunch of calls here, so I'm just going to go through them now.
[03:49:57.214 --> 03:49:58.976]  Thanks, Julie.
[03:49:58.976 --> 03:50:03.619]  Doyle in Indiana is actually hopeful for the coming years.
[03:50:03.619 --> 03:50:05.460]  Go ahead, Doyle.
[03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:07.101]  Matt, you are great.
[03:50:07.101 --> 03:50:08.482]  You are articulate.
[03:50:08.482 --> 03:50:09.883]  You are calm.
[03:50:09.883 --> 03:50:11.324]  You're a perfect balance.
[03:50:12.159 --> 03:50:14.221]  To Alex.
[03:50:14.221 --> 03:50:17.825]  And I wish Alex, if you're listening to this, you've got to promote this guy.
[03:50:17.825 --> 03:50:18.966]  You've got to get this guy.
[03:50:18.966 --> 03:50:27.034]  Because, dude, you can talk, and you can do it in a calm way, in a rational way, and you're spot on.
[03:50:27.034 --> 03:50:36.143]  But my point is... Actually, I've never contacted Doyle before, so there's no kickback or anything going on here, but I appreciate it.
[03:50:36.940 --> 03:50:38.942]  No, it's just a fact, dude.
[03:50:38.942 --> 03:50:40.343]  Don't take my words.
[03:50:40.343 --> 03:50:41.564]  It's reality.
[03:50:41.564 --> 03:50:48.470]  But anyway, I have hope for 2020 because the Rhinos are gone.
[03:50:48.470 --> 03:51:00.120]  And if I may give you an analogy, in 2018, it's like the, oh gosh, what's his name?
[03:51:00.120 --> 03:51:04.604]  Paul Ryan was a quarterback to try to win to keep the house.
[03:51:05.559 --> 03:51:06.940]  And he's a quarterback.
[03:51:06.940 --> 03:51:15.784]  And with one minute to go, the Republicans had the ball on the 30-yard line of the Democrats.
[03:51:15.784 --> 03:51:17.085]  Two points down.
[03:51:17.085 --> 03:51:19.166]  All we need is a field goal.
[03:51:19.166 --> 03:51:20.807]  And what does he do?
[03:51:20.807 --> 03:51:26.089]  Ryan kneels through all four downs.
[03:51:26.089 --> 03:51:31.572]  He kneels just like the NFL players kneel to the flag
[03:51:32.378 --> 03:51:37.625]  He kneels to the Republican Party, to the people that vote him in office.
[03:51:37.625 --> 03:51:43.393]  These rhinos always make promises and then they go in and negotiate everything away.
[03:51:43.393 --> 03:51:44.555]  So I have hope.
[03:51:47.306 --> 03:51:54.092]  At least if you're on defense with a team that's actually trying to win the game, they might make an interception and run it back.
[03:51:54.092 --> 03:51:57.274]  Ryan was a quarterback who intentionally threw interceptions.
[03:51:57.274 --> 03:52:00.297]  Ryan was a quarterback who was working for the other team.
[03:52:00.297 --> 03:52:08.404]  But remember, the Speaker of the House, he's elected by the Republican congressman.
[03:52:09.442 --> 03:52:12.444]  You know, there aren't enough of the great Freedom Caucus guys.
[03:52:12.444 --> 03:52:15.705]  You know, Meadows, Jordan, these guys are heroes.
[03:52:15.705 --> 03:52:22.749]  These guys need to be supported vocally, you know, in every way we can.
[03:52:22.749 --> 03:52:27.251]  Because at least a third of the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats.
[03:52:27.251 --> 03:52:29.612]  And at least I can respect the Democrats.
[03:52:29.612 --> 03:52:32.374]  They're socialists trying to turn the country into Venezuela.
[03:52:32.374 --> 03:52:33.814]  I get it.
[03:52:33.814 --> 03:52:36.796]  But a third of our Republicans are Benedict Arnolds.
[03:52:37.503 --> 03:52:39.244]  And I wish that they would all be gone.
[03:52:39.244 --> 03:52:48.387]  If I was Trump, I would say, if you don't come out powerfully to support defending the border, then I'm going to have, I'm going to support primarying you.
[03:52:48.387 --> 03:52:50.388]  You should be out of Congress.
[03:52:50.388 --> 03:52:52.388]  You don't belong in our party.
[03:52:52.388 --> 03:52:54.109]  I mean, it's time to do that.
[03:52:54.109 --> 03:52:55.950]  Yeah, Matt Getz, they're, they're great.
[03:52:55.950 --> 03:52:59.791]  There are great Freedom Caucus guys, but there just aren't enough of them.
[03:52:59.791 --> 03:53:00.091]  All right.
[03:53:00.091 --> 03:53:01.291]  Thanks to all.
[03:53:01.291 --> 03:53:02.812]  Let's go.
[03:53:02.812 --> 03:53:05.713]  Ben in Massachusetts actually has a sailboat question, I think.
[03:53:06.249 --> 03:53:06.889]  Go ahead, Ben.
[03:53:06.889 --> 03:53:08.870]  You're there.
[03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:09.350]  Awesome.
[03:53:09.350 --> 03:53:10.990]  This is so great to be on the air with you.
[03:53:10.990 --> 03:53:12.691]  Thank you.
[03:53:12.691 --> 03:53:14.351]  I need to second that caller.
[03:53:14.351 --> 03:53:16.072]  You need to be on the show every day.
[03:53:16.072 --> 03:53:18.372]  You need to be regular on the show.
[03:53:18.372 --> 03:53:21.393]  Thanks.
[03:53:21.393 --> 03:53:24.934]  Your demeanor... Basically, you're a major talent.
[03:53:24.934 --> 03:53:28.415]  Like, you're even possibly bigger than InfoWars.
[03:53:28.415 --> 03:53:31.576]  But yes, Alex needs to put you on every day.
[03:53:31.576 --> 03:53:33.837]  Thank you.
[03:53:36.209 --> 03:53:47.112]  You know, and so I was just, um, when I, when I called in, I was misremembering the title of your article.
[03:53:47.112 --> 03:53:52.334]  Um, your essay is called get yourself a 30 footer and go.
[03:53:52.334 --> 03:53:53.554]  Right.
[03:53:53.554 --> 03:53:56.115]  And that's from 2013.
[03:53:56.115 --> 03:54:00.956]  Um, and this is basically not the easiest thing in the world to find.
[03:54:00.956 --> 03:54:02.457]  I don't know if you have a website or what,
[03:54:03.208 --> 03:54:10.911]  There's links, I can Google it, and then it'll take me to a link.
[03:54:10.911 --> 03:54:13.692]  But this is like really so classic.
[03:54:13.692 --> 03:54:16.033]  So classic.
[03:54:16.033 --> 03:54:20.055]  And it's basically, I found it to be true.
[03:54:20.055 --> 03:54:24.917]  I looked at some of these websites, I was looking at, and you're right, a 30 footer is small.
[03:54:24.917 --> 03:54:26.417]  40 footer is much more roomy.
[03:54:29.529 --> 03:54:31.670]  And more expensive to maintain.
[03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:32.691]  And they're cheap!
[03:54:32.691 --> 03:54:34.812]  They're cheap!
[03:54:34.812 --> 03:54:37.153]  Yeah, they're giving 30-footers away.
[03:54:37.153 --> 03:54:38.093]  Fiberglass boats don't go away.
[03:54:38.093 --> 03:54:40.395]  And the fiberglass boats don't rot.
[03:54:40.395 --> 03:54:41.415]  Right.
[03:54:41.415 --> 03:54:43.556]  You're right about that, yeah.
[03:54:43.556 --> 03:54:47.758]  But what I've noticed is that generally the engine is shot.
[03:54:47.758 --> 03:54:48.779]  Right.
[03:54:48.779 --> 03:54:51.180]  You either repair the engine or get a new one.
[03:54:55.243 --> 03:54:57.384]  Some people gut out the whole boat.
[03:54:57.384 --> 03:55:01.206]  Some people will gut out the whole boat and start over, but the hull is sound.
[03:55:01.206 --> 03:55:03.347]  You know, the hull is sound.
[03:55:03.347 --> 03:55:05.548]  Yeah, if there's any wood in there.
[03:55:05.548 --> 03:55:19.856]  Yeah, I wanted to mention, actually, you know, I'm between novels right now, but I'm doing a, I have on Kindle, I have something called the Bracken Anthology, which is a collection of my short stuff, but that ends four or five years ago.
[03:55:20.612 --> 03:55:29.768]  I'm making a printed version of the Bracken Anthology, which will go from 2010 until this year, with all my essays and short fiction short stories.
[03:55:29.768 --> 03:55:33.995]  So that'll be in print and then in Kindle in the spring sometime.
[03:55:34.795 --> 03:55:43.783]  But yeah, anybody that's completely at a loss for what to do with their life, especially young men, I would say look up that essay, Get Yourself a 30-Footer and Go.
[03:55:43.783 --> 03:55:55.632]  I mean, if you feel like you're just in a dead-end job going nowhere and you're at a loss for what to do, consider what I suggest in that article, Get Yourself a 30-Footer and Go.
[03:55:55.632 --> 03:55:57.454]  Hey, thanks, Ben.
[03:55:57.454 --> 03:56:00.056]  And again, I didn't have Ben call in either.
[03:56:02.071 --> 03:56:03.572]  Yeah, Rob in Washington.
[03:56:03.572 --> 03:56:05.473]  We're almost out of time, but go ahead, Rob.
[03:56:05.473 --> 03:56:08.856]  Yeah, hey, Matt.
[03:56:08.856 --> 03:56:09.696]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:56:09.696 --> 03:56:12.038]  It's Bobby Bishop from internetica.com.
[03:56:12.038 --> 03:56:17.782]  I know a lot of people understand that border security is critically important to the national security of the United States.
[03:56:17.782 --> 03:56:20.464]  Some people get it, some people don't get it.
[03:56:20.464 --> 03:56:31.612]  I'm wondering, with Trump doing what the Democrats called was a temper tantrum, I get the wall or I shut the government down, and now he seems to be conceding on that.
[03:56:32.250 --> 03:56:36.011]  But at the same time pulling troops out of Syria and bringing them home.
[03:56:36.011 --> 03:56:42.833]  Do you think that Trump could possibly be bringing those troops home to strengthen our southern border?
[03:56:42.833 --> 03:56:47.315]  And maybe get the military to build the wall without going to the government at all?
[03:56:47.315 --> 03:56:52.877]  And could there quite possibly be a martial law in our future?
[03:56:52.877 --> 03:56:53.977]  No.
[03:56:53.977 --> 03:56:55.057]  No need for martial law.
[03:56:55.057 --> 03:57:00.119]  And it won't be the troops from Syria, which are mostly, you know, spec ops, marine artillery, things like that.
[03:57:00.856 --> 03:57:09.845]  But those troops coming home, it'll be a visible symbol that, look at the money we're saving by not having a perpetual war in Syria.
[03:57:09.845 --> 03:57:12.887]  Don't tell me that we can't afford to defend the border.
[03:57:12.887 --> 03:57:15.570]  It'll be different troops, and it's a much easier job.
[03:57:15.570 --> 03:57:16.411]  Look how close they are.
[03:57:16.411 --> 03:57:19.173]  We have bases all along the south.
[03:57:19.173 --> 03:57:25.940]  So yeah, I definitely think that in his mind, Trump is tying these together as a means to sell border protection.
[03:57:26.733 --> 03:57:27.774]  Well, thanks a lot.
[03:57:27.774 --> 03:57:30.857]  I'm sorry I missed some calls here.
[03:57:30.857 --> 03:57:32.299]  There's always next time.
[03:57:32.299 --> 03:57:34.181]  For now, I'm on every other Thursday.
[03:57:34.181 --> 03:57:39.746]  And then whenever Owen or David Knight, you know, want me to come in, I'm usually here.
[03:57:39.746 --> 03:57:40.767]  I'm home.
[03:57:40.767 --> 03:57:42.729]  And we'll see you next time.
[03:57:42.729 --> 03:57:43.370]  Thanks a lot.
[03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:47.614]  Globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:57:48.755 --> 03:57:58.522]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:57:58.522 --> 03:58:06.588]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:58:07.591 --> 03:58:15.518]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:58:15.518 --> 03:58:18.621]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:58:18.621 --> 03:58:20.122]  It really is amazing.
[03:58:20.122 --> 03:58:26.828]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:58:26.828 --> 03:58:29.511]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:58:30.791 --> 03:58:32.352]  Of Infowars.
[03:58:32.352 --> 03:58:33.653]  So please spread the links.
[03:58:33.653 --> 03:58:36.996]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:36.996 --> 03:58:40.298]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:58:40.298 --> 03:58:41.639]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:58:41.639 --> 03:58:42.740]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:58:44.238 --> 03:58:46.961]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[03:58:46.961 --> 03:58:53.286]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[03:58:53.286 --> 03:58:55.068]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:59:22.592 --> 03:59:24.734]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
