[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.400 --> 00:36.280]  it is friday the 20th day of may 2011 to be live here again for at least the next three
[00:36.280 --> 00:42.640]  hours you'd like to comment on the ongoing budget battles global austerity being forced
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.000]  by the bankers the dominique Strauss con situation you think it's a setup do you think
[00:48.000 --> 00:57.320]  he's getting a fair treatment by the new york police what is your take on all of the big
[00:57.320 --> 01:01.960]  police state announcements coming out i'm gonna go over a bunch of this news and open the
[01:01.960 --> 01:08.480]  phones up for first-time callers in the first hour and a half then dr. Jerome course he
[01:08.480 --> 01:15.080]  joins us he says he's got the proof that obama's latest long-form birth certificate remember
[01:15.080 --> 01:19.320]  the first was the only copy nothing else existed you were crazy if you said something
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.760]  else existed but everybody knew there was a long-form everybody's got a long-form everybody
[01:23.760 --> 01:28.160]  knows there's a real original birth certificate not what they originally gave us two and a
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.480]  half years ago course he says he has the proof that it's a composite of multiple real birth
[01:33.480 --> 01:45.280]  certificates all i know is that there's the kerning where computers basically squanced together typewriter
[01:45.280 --> 01:52.040]  print when it is a fake computerized font meant to look like it was done by a typewriter
[01:52.040 --> 01:59.760]  and i know that i've blown up letters printed by the same typewriter on the form or what's
[01:59.760 --> 02:06.160]  meant to be a typewriter that are identical and that's impossible with a typewriter because
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.440]  every strike is a unique strike depending on how hard you push the key down and how
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.160]  it hits the ribbon that goes on to the paper and how the paper is moving at the time every
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.680]  one of them has little characteristics that are different like a fingerprint and we've
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.920]  blown these different to text up many other photoshop and forgery experts have it doesn't
[02:25.920 --> 02:33.600]  even take an expert to know this every pixel is identical in in these letters and so there's
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.560]  definitely something going on there but it is an overall distraction from a lot of other
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.040]  big issues that's why the White House is coming out with a made in America coffee cup and
[02:43.040 --> 02:49.720]  t-shirt and means to make it part of the campaign that he's made in America and you're discredited
[02:49.720 --> 02:55.080]  because he doesn't want to run on his record and so we're going to be breaking some of
[02:55.080 --> 03:01.040]  that down today I have not talked about this because quite frankly this happens routinely
[03:01.040 --> 03:09.280]  every few years and I had just haven't really paid attention to it but I've done some research
[03:09.280 --> 03:15.760]  a little bit in the last week or so on it and it's just standard operating procedure
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.760]  and I really haven't heard anybody come out and address it from what I believe is the
[03:20.760 --> 03:27.540]  proper angle so I'm going to address this coming up in the next segment this whole
[03:27.540 --> 03:34.640]  doomsday Christian cult saying that the world is going to end tomorrow of course it's already
[03:34.640 --> 03:41.000]  tomorrow in Japan and Australia so they got 12 hours for the world in and of course it's
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.880]  not going to end and it won't matter to these people I will be the devil for not agreeing
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.520]  that the world ended on Monday when the world hasn't ended and there'll be undoubtedly some
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.360]  lunatics that believe they've been raptured ladies and gentlemen the rapture is not in
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.800]  the Bible until after Christ comes back and the dead in Christ are raised I mean I'm sorry
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.960]  I've happened to have read revelations and it no church taught this until about 150 years
[04:07.960 --> 04:13.640]  ago and basically the masons cook this up as a way to discredit Christianity that is
[04:13.640 --> 04:20.720]  an element of the masons and most of Christianity down the world is basically globalist Masonic
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.040]  run and that's if you like being fooled and you like being idiots go ahead knock yourselves
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.680]  out I mean I grew up hearing the world was going to end in 87 in Dallas from the main
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.680]  line evangelicals and billboards were up in town and I heard it again in the 90s and
[04:35.680 --> 04:41.960]  you people never stop your idiocy and most of you are a bunch of torture loving war
[04:41.960 --> 04:47.760]  loving people who go along with tyranny and then never go out and protest abortion because
[04:47.760 --> 04:53.440]  the world's in the next week it's a big shickening shy cop out why don't you get your head screwed
[04:53.440 --> 05:01.600]  on straight well we're gonna talk about when we come back stay with us this is Alex Jones

[08:19.240 --> 08:24.560]  2011 we're going to be live here again for the next three hours I don't always agree
[08:24.560 --> 08:31.200]  with all of his political views but I have found the dr. Jerome course he is accurate
[08:31.200 --> 08:36.320]  in his investigative reporting and doesn't like to go out on a limb and the many times
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.160]  I've interviewed him dealing with the whole birth certificate issue he's never said he
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.440]  was a hundred percent one way or the other he now says he is and also has proof that
[08:46.440 --> 08:51.960]  they basically inserted this fake composite birth certificate into the stacks a month
[08:51.960 --> 08:58.760]  after governor abacromby in hawaii said he couldn't find it in the archives very interesting
[08:58.760 --> 09:04.280]  and that he has proof that it's a composite and he'll be joining us today he was on other
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.200]  radio shows last two days saying that he would restart releasing this information on friday
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.600]  so we'll see if he's ready to do that on this broadcast in one hour and twenty five minutes
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.480]  from now and then our once a week visit with bob Chapman of the international forecaster
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.800]  looking at geopolitical developments and the global and domestic economy system I will
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.600]  open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour for first time callers then when
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.600]  Chapman's on with us it'll be a free for all but people never get a chance to get in and
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.320]  the regulars which are great folks but they sit there waiting by their phone to dial in
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.760]  and generally plug something and it just it just isn't informative radio a lot of times
[09:43.760 --> 09:47.760]  so first time callers that want to talk about the issues that we're going to raise or actual
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.960]  news items if you got a tractor for sale folks we're not going to be able to have you on
[09:51.960 --> 09:56.840]  air we don't screen phone calls but a lot of times that gets taken advantage of okay
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.840]  I'm not giving the number out yet but I do want to hear from everybody a giant smattering
[10:01.840 --> 10:10.840]  of news obviously here what's going on with Obama and his statement about the nineteen
[10:10.840 --> 10:19.640]  sixty seven lines for Israel and Palestine and that's got Netanyahu all upset presidents
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.960]  have done this before this is a political football and they just keep Palestine in this
[10:24.960 --> 10:30.560]  endless process while Israel expands its borders and that is what you're going to see continue
[10:30.560 --> 10:38.040]  on from this point but basically Obama's trying to position himself with PR and fluff just
[10:38.040 --> 10:41.600]  like he told the American people he was going to end the war stop the torture close one
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.920]  down a obey hire no lobbyist take no Wall Street money and it's been one hundred and
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.600]  eighty degree difference it'll be the same thing on this front so Israel getting all
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.800]  freaked out and running around and pulling their hair out that's all a bunch of theater
[10:56.800 --> 11:02.280]  the Israeli lobbies one of the biggest funders of Obama this is all complete one hundred
[11:02.280 --> 11:08.920]  percent theater okay end of story the Palestinians are going to get any land you watch the settlements
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.720]  will expand regardless of where you stand on this issue that's the facts will be going
[11:13.720 --> 11:18.960]  over that a little bit later also a five shot dead and Syrian protests more of that unrest
[11:18.960 --> 11:26.160]  intensifying China is now the biggest buyer of gold in the world followed up by countries
[11:26.160 --> 11:31.160]  like Mexico and of course major universities all over the world are buying gold we're going
[11:31.160 --> 11:38.400]  to be going over that Fox News is hyping that they're going to explain to us why Amaral
[11:38.400 --> 11:45.560]  Alaki at the time on the news wanted for the crimes of nine eleven a known globalist intelligence
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.800]  asset who runs all the major Patsy attacks Amaral Alaki now they have more details of
[11:51.800 --> 11:56.880]  radical imams lunch at the Pentagon notice they say radical they've been calling him
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.000]  number three or number two or number one terrorist now that I've been laden's dead
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.640]  he was number three before bin Laden was reportedly dead the ninth death of bin Laden according
[12:09.640 --> 12:15.480]  to mainstream media but now he's just a radical imam oh yeah he was at these secret meetings
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.320]  at the Pentagon but he was just a radical imam and while they've got a report coming
[12:20.320 --> 12:27.800]  out tonight that is going to debut the secrets of Al Qaeda the secrets of nine eleven and
[12:27.800 --> 12:32.200]  of course that's getting you ready for the the million plus documents in bin Laden's
[12:32.200 --> 12:38.800]  rat hole where of course they're going to have how they carried out the attacks and
[12:38.800 --> 12:44.800]  how it was done we've seen this before and it was done on September 11 nine and a half
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.520]  years ago remember if you go back and pull the news articles up from the time or see
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.640]  my film road to tyranny made about six months after nine eleven you'll see the mainstream
[12:55.640 --> 13:04.880]  news articles in the newscast where they said not one but two magical passports undamaged
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.080]  these hijackers are on board aircraft going 550 miles an hour they go into the plane the
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.640]  planes go into the building and on their person or the passports and their bodies are basically
[13:16.640 --> 13:22.320]  turned into dust they reported nobody parts were found bigger people period in the towers
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.320]  than about an inch long of finger bones and things like that but these passports were
[13:28.320 --> 13:35.540]  made of the same stuff as Thor's hammer the the center of a dying son or a black hole
[13:35.540 --> 13:42.080]  I mean indestructible unstoppable they're now trying to study the passports to put armor
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.280]  on Abrams tanks that is impenetrable to even nuclear missiles this is stuff that Superman's
[13:48.280 --> 13:55.160]  laser vision can't see through or beam through this is stuff that they well I mean undoubtedly
[13:55.160 --> 14:02.360]  it's it's Thor's hammer okay I mean seriously this is believable not one but two passports
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.480]  undamaged go I mean and the government reported this and said they had them on record so it's
[14:08.480 --> 14:15.000]  true government doesn't lie questioning government is a conspiracy theory okay never question
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.400]  anything the government says to be a good American the founding fathers said trust government
[14:19.400 --> 14:24.400]  do what it says trust everything they say give the government total power and have no bill
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.520]  of rights okay and so the government eradicating the bill of rights right now that's good as
[14:29.520 --> 14:39.880]  well but but back to this magical anamentium substance that that is impenetrable nothing
[14:39.880 --> 14:48.880]  can stop it okay these passports from Saudi Arabia are made of a substance that can be
[14:48.880 --> 14:55.000]  on someone's body when it flies at 580 miles an hour into steel girders and the plane evaporates
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.440]  into flame and and goes out the other side in a huge plume of fire and then magically
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.160]  oh it doesn't stop these passports are so magical and so wonderful that like gollum's
[15:07.160 --> 15:13.560]  ring they call to you they call to who they want to find them but not any normal mortal
[15:13.560 --> 15:20.800]  no no no the ring calls out only the FBI agents so so the magical Thor's hammer material passports
[15:20.800 --> 15:25.440]  go out of the building down to the ground and then once they're on the ground in feet
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.960]  of dust and millions of papers everywhere the FBI that day finds not one but two of the
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.000]  shards of Thor's hammer and again it calls out to them psychically and they go to it
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.840]  and they have it but doesn't stop there magically multiple hijackers bags got stuck in the machines
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.840]  and had all the admissions of how they did it in them and and cars and vans with with
[15:50.840 --> 15:56.440]  with airline outfits and wire cutters and and and how they were going to do it it was all
[15:56.440 --> 16:04.240]  there I believe it I believe this Fox News report coming out tonight and and and I believe
[16:04.240 --> 16:12.000]  that they've got all this data from inside bin Laden's rat hole there in Pakistan I'm
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.040]  sorry his palace his palace where the where he had the shootout with his navy seals and
[16:17.040 --> 16:19.800]  then they dumped his body in the ocean but he didn't have a shootout with the navy seals
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.240]  and didn't use the life as a shield and the helicopter blew up and the witnesses all over
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.320]  the neighborhood said that the men got on board and the plane blew up the the helicopter
[16:28.320 --> 16:34.360]  those navy seals won't be talking about how nobody was inside will they but but again
[16:34.360 --> 16:41.120]  Nixon didn't lie to us Bill Clinton George Bush I will not put up with it questioning
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.440]  government anymore okay all over the news and they have articles about how do we stop
[16:47.440 --> 16:51.560]  conspiracy theories there's a big wall street journal article that came out a few days ago
[16:51.560 --> 16:57.440]  where they described myself as a fire breathing libertarian who is very dangerous and it goes
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.160]  on at the end of the article to say how do we stop these people and Bill Clinton has
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.520]  come out with a ministry of truth for government to shut down websites and information they
[17:05.520 --> 17:13.240]  don't agree with and they've also Paul Watson an extremist at prisonplanet.com has written
[17:13.240 --> 17:18.680]  an article government orders YouTube to censor protest videos and lawsuits are being filed
[17:18.680 --> 17:24.200]  dealing with this and now you don't get your your YouTube taken down because of content
[17:24.200 --> 17:28.680]  copyright violation in fact I'll show folks a document cam shot of this this very reasonable
[17:28.680 --> 17:34.440]  government action this content is not available in your country due to government removal
[17:34.440 --> 17:40.800]  request so I think this is really great news that they're that they're cast Sunsteen's
[17:40.800 --> 17:44.640]  announcing they want to shut down people that question government because they're evil
[17:44.640 --> 17:51.840]  and I Bill Clinton's calling for it and media matters is calling for it and I think that's
[17:51.840 --> 18:00.200]  what America is all about okay good good because there are people out there that that question
[18:00.200 --> 18:07.120]  that these passports were forged in the heart of a dying son like Thor's hammer indestructible

[24:22.040 --> 24:27.160]  obviously it's impossible that one or even two passports that's even more ridiculous
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.760]  would survive and then be picked up and they just planted evidence all over the place
[24:32.760 --> 24:39.160]  more evidence of the inside job and then you've got all the people they say amorola locky runs
[24:39.160 --> 24:45.400]  being constantly protected major hassan for two years uh the underwear bomber the the time square
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.280]  the shoe bomber that thought he would light plastic explosives and was described as being
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.920]  drugged i've interviewed the witnesses about mutalib looked completely out of his head
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.560]  and a sharp dressed man gets him on the plane and then he sets off the the firecracker in
[25:01.560 --> 25:07.080]  his underwear so we've got to have the tsa stick their hands at our underwear this is ridiculous
[25:08.520 --> 25:14.840]  this is a sick joke and i'm tired of it and now the government the media are really trying to spin
[25:14.840 --> 25:21.480]  this alaki at the pentagon and al-qaeda being the main leadership of the rebels uh in syria uh
[25:21.480 --> 25:27.800]  and in libya that they're having real trouble spinning this on a lot of mainline conservative
[25:27.800 --> 25:32.040]  hosts that have attacked yours truly over the years are having to say man alec jones has got a point
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.320]  about this al-qaeda they used al-qaeda against the serbs they used al-qaeda against the russians
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.680]  they use al-qaeda against muhmar qaddafi they're using al-qaeda connected groups in um
[25:44.840 --> 25:50.360]  egypt and that doesn't mean that the people don't have a right to get rid of these dictatorships
[25:50.360 --> 25:55.240]  that have been western backed in many cases the point is that the globalist are trying to get
[25:55.240 --> 26:01.800]  the middle east in uproar that evidenced by obama's statements about israel should revert to the
[26:01.800 --> 26:08.600]  borders that had 1967 regardless of what side of that issue you stand on i just look at it from a
[26:08.600 --> 26:14.600]  geopolitical uh perspective i'm an atheist on the subject uh a political atheist not a religious
[26:14.600 --> 26:20.280]  atheist and i just coldly look at it and this is just meant to get turmoil going we've got to ask
[26:20.280 --> 26:26.680]  why and i'll talk about that later in the broadcast now that said if you want to talk about any of
[26:26.680 --> 26:35.400]  these issues i've raised or the mainstream media trying to basically uh discredit uh christians
[26:35.400 --> 26:44.280]  right now by hyping up a few christian organizations that are saying that the rapture will start uh
[26:44.280 --> 26:52.360]  sometime today or tomorrow that's because we're already in tomorrow uh in uh japan and australian
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.040]  areas of the pacific but if this hadn't happened by tomorrow afternoon ladies and gentlemen uh or
[26:58.040 --> 27:04.120]  tomorrow evening um then the media is going to say look all christians are discredited and they
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.520]  say the rapture will happen uh by tomorrow and then six months of earthquakes and total bedlam
[27:10.520 --> 27:20.840]  uh will then unfold now here's the deal and i'm going to try to be uh as direct as i can on this
[27:21.560 --> 27:29.480]  anyone who knows history anyone who's read the bible knows that matthew 24 36 and many other
[27:29.480 --> 27:37.320]  verses in the bible make it very clear and christ told his disciples anybody that tells you
[27:37.320 --> 27:45.000]  you when my second coming is going to happen is basically a deceiver and here's matthew 24 36
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.880]  but of that day and hour this is king james but of that day and hour no with no man no not the
[27:51.880 --> 28:01.320]  angels of heaven but only my father only again matthew 24 36 but of that day and hour no with
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.920]  no man no man now i know a lot of you preachers don't agree with the bible and i know you don't
[28:06.920 --> 28:13.160]  like me reading this i understand no not the angels of heaven but my father only and i can
[28:13.160 --> 28:20.760]  read it to you from uh 20 something other bibles other translations the new international version
[28:20.760 --> 28:26.840]  1984 no one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the
[28:26.840 --> 28:33.400]  father new living translation 2007 however no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen
[28:33.400 --> 28:38.360]  not even the angels in heaven or the son himself only the father knows english standard version
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.640]  2001 but concerning the day and the hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven
[28:43.640 --> 28:49.640]  or the son but the father only new american standard 1995 but of that day and hour no one
[28:49.640 --> 28:56.600]  knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father alone it goes on he will come like
[28:56.600 --> 29:06.840]  a thief in the night you mean to keep reading this here's the weymouth new testament but as to that
[29:06.840 --> 29:14.120]  day in the exact time no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father alone
[29:14.120 --> 29:18.840]  world english bible but no one knows of that day and hour not even the angels of heaven but my
[29:18.840 --> 29:27.320]  father only uh would you like me to continue with uh this the new american standard bible the
[29:27.320 --> 29:34.280]  international standard version would you like me to continue and my point is how do you have all
[29:34.280 --> 29:39.640]  these christian broadcasters and all these other groups and organizations some people who've made
[29:39.640 --> 29:48.040]  these claims a decade ago or more and been wrong why do we listen to these people okay they are there

[33:16.600 --> 33:27.560]  radio network i should do an entire hour or two special on this and go in and pull up the history
[33:27.560 --> 33:33.400]  go over all the names but in the interest of time and other important news and your phone calls that
[33:33.400 --> 33:37.800]  i want to take on on any of the issues i've raised or any issues you'd like to raise doing first
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.520]  time callers right now on this uh live friday edition in the interest of that i'm just going
[33:42.520 --> 33:47.880]  to spend a few more minutes on this whole uh rapture cult situation the toll free number to
[33:47.880 --> 34:02.600]  join us is 1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 now i refuse to get into the quagmire the swamp uh the bayou
[34:04.360 --> 34:10.760]  that is religious infighting and and everybody claims they've got the answer and then it's just
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.760]  a bunch of Pharisees uh poking each other's eyes out i know i got a big stick in my eye
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.640]  and i'm not here trying to you know tell you which in your eye unless you're a globalist openly
[34:21.640 --> 34:27.240]  trying to pass legislation and laws that attack my liberty and freedom then your fair game because
[34:27.240 --> 34:34.120]  you've stated what your uh goals are but i have done deep study on the whole rapture movement
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.080]  and if you believe in the rapture and that you're going to get this pre-tribulation rapture i don't
[34:39.080 --> 34:44.120]  think you're a bad person i just think you need to be aware of the fact that this was never taught
[34:44.840 --> 34:51.320]  not in the greek orthodox or the russian orthodox or the catholic church or by protestants uh and
[34:51.320 --> 34:56.840]  after the reformation no one taught this and i challenge you to show me where they did no one
[34:56.840 --> 35:03.000]  taught it you could pull up the verses in revelation when christ returns and clobbers the devil and the
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.920]  angel bounds up the lz bub and all the rest of it then the dead in christ are raised okay okay and
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.920]  the and then that differs with the whole idea that you just immediately go flapping off to heaven
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.920]  now in the last hundred and fifty years or so different uh teachers in england in the us began
[35:22.920 --> 35:31.320]  and and uh folks that wanted to attack christianity push this that christians would be raptured before
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.480]  the tribulation and since then the christians in russia christians in china christians in north
[35:37.480 --> 35:45.960]  korea christians in nazi germany uh even some people in world war one in this country they
[35:45.960 --> 35:50.440]  always think everybody's the antichrist and that they're going to be raptured out of it
[35:52.280 --> 35:55.560]  well i go back to the old better one saying trust in god but tie up your camel
[35:55.560 --> 36:03.560]  and it's this this giant cop out okay let's say before the world government b system casual
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.520]  society goes in and even if you're an atheist or an agnostic i mean you can't deny that the
[36:08.520 --> 36:14.120]  globalist have set up under the un 10 global regions with 10 subregions per country and they
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.360]  call them 10 kingdoms in the un documents we've covered this with dr michael kaufman the official
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.560]  un documents and they're setting up a global standardized cash society with face scanning
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.520]  and thumb printing to buy and sell and then it gives the system total control over everything
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.880]  you do and where they can starve you out of you don't submit to their system and the no buy list
[36:33.880 --> 36:39.000]  the no fly list the no travel list the no work list this is the global standardized system i have it
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.080]  in the news today as they start to roll it out incrementally so regardless of whether you believe
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.800]  god the devil whatever the new world order psychopaths have taken this art type if you see
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.320]  it in that perspective because regardless of how you slice it this is happening and they are manifesting
[36:55.320 --> 37:02.280]  it they believe in it they're setting it up and they're earth worshipers you get to the deepest
[37:02.280 --> 37:07.800]  levels of the un the rock of fellers all these people they fund the luciferian trust they fund
[37:07.800 --> 37:14.760]  occultic groups uh every major globalist the queen of england tony blair all of them it's always

[37:33.320 --> 37:39.320]  beautiful lucifer the good in fact pull up the mason's saying sweet lucifer i am lucifer uh i
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.080]  want to pull that up because most mason's are porch mason's and don't know this it's how the
[37:43.080 --> 37:48.680]  globalist control good people they don't understand that at the higher levels they teach you no no lucifer
[37:48.680 --> 37:55.000]  is really the good guy and jesus is his bad brother now lower level mason's they teach him
[37:55.720 --> 38:01.560]  the point is and then you can argue that the last 200 years the illuminati took over what
[38:01.560 --> 38:06.520]  masonry was if you get deeper into it that there's a bunch of different branches to it so i'm not
[38:06.520 --> 38:12.280]  here in dieting and saying mason's are bad and evil i mean mainline churchgoers are involved in
[38:12.280 --> 38:18.680]  more of a luciferian initiation than even mason's are the new world order are masters of counterfeits
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.720]  but but again i'm digressing what we're dealing with here
[38:28.120 --> 38:32.680]  in 87 they said this in the mid 90s they said it every time the media comes out
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.120]  and criticizes it and it's even the same people that are doing it now i can't judge them i don't
[38:38.120 --> 38:45.640]  know their heart but uh they may mean well but but all over the news every channel last night
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.640]  every radio tv fox cnn i was scrolling through channels this morning in here in the studio we
[38:51.640 --> 38:58.120]  got multiple channels on we got channels on in the coffee room break room making it look like all
[38:58.120 --> 39:05.240]  christians are cuckoo nuts just like by taking muslim extremists and then saying all muslims are
[39:05.240 --> 39:10.760]  you know want to murder everybody they are taking this and and then when the rapture doesn't happen
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.480]  tomorrow christians will again be seen like the hail bop comet cult thinking a spaceship was behind
[39:17.480 --> 39:23.320]  it and put it on their black nike tennis shoes and taking barbiturates and drinking vodka uh and
[39:23.320 --> 39:29.480]  putting bags over their heads waiting for the aliens to beam them up beam me up aliens this whole
[39:29.480 --> 39:35.640]  thing of being beamed up by scottie up there with captain kirk and you get beamed up to the teleporter
[39:35.640 --> 39:41.000]  room and there's jesus and he comes and hugs you and oh guess what my flock you don't have to go
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.880]  through any tribulation every one of the prophets went through tribulation almost all of them got
[39:45.880 --> 39:52.680]  killed most of the disciples got boiled alive crucified upside down thrown into the arena
[39:52.680 --> 39:59.480]  what happened to jesus whipped till the flesh was falling off his skin crucified spit on crown
[39:59.480 --> 40:06.760]  of thorns crammed on his head but you are not gonna have to do anything and they've got these
[40:06.760 --> 40:13.480]  giant churches with helicopter pads and swimming pools and mainline christians just go there to
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.320]  find people to cheat on their wives and husbands with i mean that's what i grew up in dallas folks
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.800]  believe me i've seen it i mean i lived in a middle class upper middle class neighborhood and up on
[40:21.800 --> 40:25.800]  the hill were the mansions in my neighborhood you know we lived down the middle class area
[40:25.800 --> 40:33.160]  and it was the preacher kids you know just devil worshiping sex partying uh wildness
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.320]  unlimited the old joker you want to find a loose woman you know go after the preacher's daughter
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.520]  she's ready to go right now behind the church now the issue here is you got a bunch of hypocrites
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.520]  and they're telling you that you don't have to face evil you don't have to get involved i i
[40:52.520 --> 40:57.720]  hear these mainline christians oh praise the lord things are getting bad they're coming out with
[40:57.720 --> 41:05.240]  the microchip the implantable chip it's the end of the world my goodness lordy b i'm gonna be
[41:05.240 --> 41:13.640]  teleported out of here by a golden ejection seat right into the arms of jesus that's not history
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.760]  that's not biblical that's not common sense it says the beast will wage war on the saints and
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.880]  overcome them and you guys will try to twist that anyway you want but it jesus comes like a thief
[41:23.880 --> 41:30.840]  in the night and that's the return and and they've got all the big media in hollywood financing this
[41:30.840 --> 41:37.080]  rapture business and hundreds of millions of books sold literally hundreds of millions one title alone
[41:37.080 --> 41:43.800]  i was reading so like 20 million copies of one author movies all of this where people are told
[41:43.800 --> 41:49.320]  and so christians are never going to be able to recognize evil or fight it because and and this
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.280]  is infected everybody it's a general attitude of all the world is just going to end it's all over
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.280]  in fact that's what the whole 2012 thing is i've been meaning to make a film about this but i've
[41:58.280 --> 42:03.240]  been so busy on other fronts i started it two years ago never made it i should just turn one out
[42:03.240 --> 42:08.840]  ahead of 2012 because we're still talking a year and a half away uh i should turn one out and point
[42:08.840 --> 42:15.160]  out that that that they want this cop out they have the religious cop out oh the muslims think
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.320]  it's the end of the world too they're saying the end of the world's coming in the next few years
[42:19.880 --> 42:25.480]  they've got the same manipulation going on the christians many of them think it's the end of the
[42:25.480 --> 42:31.320]  world and then you've got for the secular crowds all the hollywood movies and the hype being pushed
[42:31.320 --> 42:38.120]  about coming up uh in december of 2012 a year and a half from now that the end of the world's coming
[42:38.760 --> 42:43.560]  and and and i've been down to the mayan pyramids i've read the text i've looked into it it doesn't
[42:43.560 --> 42:50.920]  even say that even if you believe a bunch of human sacrificing wild eyed hallucinogen taking uh
[42:50.920 --> 42:58.520]  lunatics the the the the aztec priest class the following the mayan system i've gone it means
[42:58.520 --> 43:04.200]  a new hearth will be lit uh that a new age is beginning it does not mean the end of the world
[43:06.280 --> 43:12.040]  it does not mean the end of the world basically our world is the big god's hallucination
[43:12.040 --> 43:17.880]  and he he basically wakes up and then goes back to sleep on 2012 is one mayan angle the other is
[43:17.880 --> 43:23.480]  a new hearth will be lit and a new system will start i mean look look i've actually gone to the
[43:23.480 --> 43:29.720]  pyramids gone and actually not gotten the general tour but gone and talked to resident mayan and
[43:29.720 --> 43:35.000]  western archaeologist and i've read the books the whole mayan thing isn't even real even if you
[43:35.000 --> 43:42.520]  believe that the mayan prophecies were real that's not the mayan prophecies so for the new age crowd
[43:42.520 --> 43:47.160]  which is really the old age they think it's the end of the world the christians have been taught
[43:47.160 --> 43:50.680]  it's the end of the world catholics a bunch of them think it's the end of the world with all this
[43:50.680 --> 43:56.440]  fat of my stuff i get constantly emailed about okay the end of the world would be an at giant
[43:56.440 --> 44:01.000]  asteroid hitting would be a super plague being released by these bio weapons makers and then
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.400]  you'll all go die thinking it's the end of the world and god doing it when it's the globalist
[44:05.400 --> 44:11.000]  who've got their emergency seed banks at the arctic circle and 14 others uh they've got their uh
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.000]  their their their government bunkers their cog systems they're gearing up and they've got all
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.480]  these history channel discovery channel shows about earth without man and they're pushing
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.280]  it on comedy central how great it's going to be when almost everybody gets killed soon they're
[44:26.280 --> 44:33.000]  creating a subconscious psychological expectation that most of us aren't going to be here soon
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.520]  because the new world order is getting ready to kill most of us and has written countless white
[44:38.520 --> 44:45.080]  papers that we source on how they're going to do it what is the endgame.com if you want to just
[44:45.080 --> 44:51.240]  see the tip of the iceberg so there is a mass full court press against every religious group
[44:51.240 --> 44:56.840]  and secular groups with 2012 mumbo jumbo that it's a foregone conclusion that you're going to die
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.560]  because if they can sell you on there's no hope then you'll just sit there and lay down to them
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.160]  rolling out their global government system which itself is a technotronic police state to lock
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.920]  everyone down to then carry out the orderly extermination okay as for me i'm not buying
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.520]  it i'm not standing down but look at this new york man spends life savings ahead of 2012 doomsday
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.560]  new york man spent 140 000 his life savings advertising his prediction that the world will end
[45:23.560 --> 45:30.520]  tomorrow and it's already today again in the pacific on the other side of the planet now
[45:31.960 --> 45:42.200]  continuing here where did all this come from this is wd bj7 news tv predictor of may 21st
[45:42.200 --> 45:48.440]  doomsday to watch it on tv the u.s evangelical christian broadcaster predicted that judgment day
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.080]  will come on saturday says he expects to stay close to the tv or radio to monitor the unfolding
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.680]  apocalypse herald camping 89 previously made a failed prediction that jesus christ would return
[45:58.680 --> 46:03.560]  to earth in 1994 i remember that the head of the christian radio network family stations
[46:03.560 --> 46:07.800]  and he'll end up getting a getting a bunch of money hypen get them give us the money in the last
[46:07.800 --> 46:14.040]  year so they could put out ads saying into the world then it'll be oh god gave us a reprieve he
[46:14.040 --> 46:20.680]  just watched tomorrow i'll be the bad guy for saying this was baloney and hokum not him i'll be bad
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.880]  for being right watch the head of the christian radio network family station saying says he is
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.200]  sure the earthquake will shake the earth on may 21st well there's earthquakes all the time
[46:30.200 --> 46:35.400]  sweeping true believers to heaven and leaving others behind to be engulfed in world destruction
[46:35.400 --> 46:41.880]  over a few months we know without a shadow of a doubt it's going to happen camping told reuters
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.840]  his family radio has 66 us stations and broadcasts from more than 30 languages
[46:46.840 --> 46:52.120]  through international affiliates and a lot of these folks are good people but and i'm sure this
[46:52.120 --> 46:59.320]  guy means well but he's been wrong again a pastor pastor please have you read the bible you claim
[46:59.320 --> 47:06.120]  to follow christ said look out for people that run around saying this stuff no one knows the time of
[47:06.120 --> 47:13.160]  the second coming and there isn't a pre-wrapshirt before that bubba i've read the bible but it
[47:13.160 --> 47:17.800]  didn't matter you're the one that's always wrong so you're right uh continuing i can't tell you how
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.400]  many times there's groups out there saying the end of the world is coming or space aliens are going
[47:21.400 --> 47:29.080]  to land this is all a sigh up matthew 24 36 but of that day and hour noeth no man no not the angels
[47:29.080 --> 47:44.680]  of heaven not the son but my father only but you know that's jesus who wants to listen to him we can
[47:44.680 --> 47:54.280]  listen we can listen to herald camping herald camping well who needs jesus we have who needs
[47:54.280 --> 48:03.400]  yashua we have herald camping he will tell us everything we need to know and this will further
[48:03.400 --> 48:09.480]  than just discredit christians who believe you reap what you sow doing to others as you have done
[48:09.480 --> 48:16.600]  unto you you know don't support a world numbering system to buy and sell whether you believe jesus
[48:16.600 --> 48:23.560]  is a real entity or not that's some good stuff to follow but no no no herald camping will speak
[48:23.560 --> 48:30.280]  for christ and he will speak the opposite of what christ said uh on this subject and then
[48:30.280 --> 48:38.120]  we'll be discredited uh so there you have it my friends here's msnbc kids hope to attend party
[48:38.120 --> 48:44.600]  but parents say world is going to end yes and how and all these children will lose their faith
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.200]  or may lose their faith after this families divided as some people believe world will

[55:38.280 --> 55:43.880]  nation's money supply if bill still was correct the national debt is the amount of money that we
[55:43.880 --> 55:48.440]  borrowed so the only way to pay it off would be to give every single single dollar bill back
[55:48.440 --> 55:53.000]  and then we know the interest and the solution to all our problems in this new world order would be
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.240]  to eliminate this phony money system and to get back to a governmental currency of some kind because
[55:59.240 --> 56:03.960]  the people's labor is what's valuable and these private factors they live they live like kings
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.560]  that's right under under the constitution the currency is issued and controlled by congress
[56:09.560 --> 56:16.040]  under their order to the treasury and to the mint and then it is only a symbol to agree upon in the
[56:16.040 --> 56:20.760]  exchange of labor and goods but the banksters took over 1913 as they've done in every other major
[56:20.760 --> 56:29.480]  nation and said we will now create debt for you for you to be allowed to make money and so mathematically
[56:29.480 --> 56:36.200]  it's impossible to ever pay them back it is such a giant fraud and we've lived under this now for
[56:36.200 --> 56:44.120]  almost a hundred years and we've seen the wages of it right but the united states is a corporation
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.640]  that did file bankruptcy in 1913 uh there's a great guest i'd like to recommend his name is
[56:49.640 --> 56:55.560]  winston shroud he talks about the bankruptcy and how they use legalese and commercial banking laws
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.360]  against the people that basically make them slaves well for my research the real official
[57:00.360 --> 57:06.600]  bankruptcy was the 1933 action of roosevelt but i appreciate your call but yes the nation has been
[57:06.600 --> 57:12.280]  taken over a long time ago the new order isn't coming it's here and america is the heart that
[57:12.280 --> 57:18.680]  pumps the blood for the new world order the european union british system on top of it is the brain
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.160]  and it's illegitimate it's we've been hijacked great points uh you know i don't want to cut

[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.000]  information act request to the tsa for all records pretending to how many milligrams of
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.360]  radiation exposure that the tsa workers are being exposed to every day from tsa naked body
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:47.960]  scanners also all records that tsa have pretending to how many milligrams of radiation exposure
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.200]  that every passenger is being exposed to every time that person flies by being subject to this
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:59.400]  technology uh your request was received on october 13th 2010 now it's been nine months and i've only
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:07.080]  received one letter back and it says uh we are encountering delays uh cite a bunch of laws and
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:13.640]  then starts going into how they're going to charge me for records uh in accordance with the dhs foi
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.280]  regulations and that they're going to charge the hourly rates and and this and that and
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.400]  basically yeah they're not supposed to do that and what they'll do is they'll try to give you
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.640]  every document they ever printed and send you a million dollar bill and that's been challenged in
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.320]  court the aclu in michigan uh a few weeks ago put in a request to get the documents on police
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.880]  randomly pulling people over grabbing their cell phones plugging them in and stealing the content
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.720]  of their phone and they tried to give the aclu a million dollar bill uh and it just shows how this
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.840]  government is trying to operate in secret they wouldn't tell congress for over a year uh the
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.240]  digital numbers on radiation from the scanners and then when they were forced to they released
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.440]  fake numbers and have now been caught it is a group of lawless criminals who are power grabbing right
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:06.360]  now uh but uh we need to get bob bar's group uh liberty guard back on for a 10 minute update
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.680]  or something i think get bob bar himself on uh because uh they were going to file a lawsuit
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.680]  if they didn't release the stuff so we'll continue to look into that jeff i'm glad you called
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:20.440]  and they're uh all of us seem to be you know looking into this but we already know from the
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.720]  scanners even the new york times two years ago had top scientists 20 to 50 times the level they
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:31.480]  claim of radiation so we already know it's frying people especially the moron tsa davin florida
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.600]  you're on the air go ahead hey alex first on caller long time listener and uh you woke me up
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:48.680]  um i'm also a christian retired air force member um i went to church as a kid i studied
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:55.800]  prophecy and that led me to have an understanding about this new world order and how it's going to
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:02.920]  affect our lives and i've taken a lot of heat because of it and because of you you're waking
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.960]  other people up and they're saying hey dav this makes a lot of sense so what i do is i tie the
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.840]  prophecy from the bible no and you're you know what's happening yeah that's right because i don't
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.200]  push the bible and push push revelations but lay out what's happening that we've confirmed
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.440]  leads a lot of people will wake up to the larger issues that this is a spiritual battle
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:29.000]  and the globalists are are are being basically directed by this prime evil there's no doubt
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.560]  about it and the globalists themselves understand that and say that and they're more internal
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.480]  writings i'm going to hold you over davis and finish up your point and they're they're using this
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.400]  whole pre-tribulation rapture as a way to get everybody to stand down then for secular people
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.600]  they have the 2012 mumbo jumbo folks that wouldn't believe in christianity believe a twisted mayan
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.680]  prophecy and i don't do nothing world's gonna end in 2012 anyways right as the globalists try to
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:03.960]  finish their takeover in 2012 they want us to stand down hundreds of nations have fallen to

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.600]  we're opening the phones up right now and if you just joined us coming up to about 25 minutes
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:26.120]  dr jerome court c is going to be live on air with us the author of where's the birth certificate
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:32.440]  that the white house had to respond to a month ago with obama's press conference they've now had
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:40.280]  hit pieces come out in fsquire saying that world net daily had said the book was a lie and was
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.800]  recalling it for the full retail price of the book which is economic warfare not only is that a lie
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:53.000]  but they sell the book for 50 60 off to the bookstore so that was full retail price it
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.640]  wouldn't just be the cost of the book it would be the full retail designed to bankrupt them and
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.160]  then it also creates the rumor and the idea that oh even the publisher admits it's a fraud and they
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.520]  they're recalling it from the stores then people go back to the stores saying you notice they waited
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:15.960]  till the book was out three days to do this hey i want my money back so then the booksellers freak
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:21.080]  out and say well that's it we're pulling these off the shelves this was serious economic warfare
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.920]  why is the white house so scared using their surrogate of esquire to do this the white house
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:31.560]  also says this can be part of their campaign that obama's made in america with t-shirts and coffee
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:38.920]  cups that's all coming up now separate from that they have a christian radio network and others
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:44.120]  in the last year saying the rapture will happen today on the other side of the planet tomorrow
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.520]  here in north america and western europe and when it doesn't happen it'll just be further
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:57.240]  cannon fodder to discredit christians it is a hundred and fifty year old dogma that there's
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.520]  going to be a pre-tribulation rapture uh in revelations it says when christ returns and
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.000]  whips the devil at the battle of armageddon and the archangel ties up the devil with a big chain
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.400]  and all that that then the dead and christ will be raised up okay clearly a five-year-old could
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:19.640]  read it it says that i read the bible verse earlier uh where it says no man not even the angels
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.800]  not even the son only the father knows when christ will return that's uh matthew 24 36
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.600]  king james virgin every other version says the same thing and these people don't care
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.440]  and they did it in the 87 94 the same people they're doing it again and i'm tired of it
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:42.440]  but you notice all the hollywood movies about the world ending uh in december of next year
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.920]  all the new agers pushing it this is a simple psychological warfare tactic to teach people
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:54.840]  that resisting and being involved is futile that you don't control any of your destiny
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.080]  that you can't do anything just lay down and take it it's over they have all these best-selling books
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.360]  out about the end of history and the end of man and the world without man i'm at the grocery store
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:13.000]  and see in caps with magazines and audiobooks from the secular view that mankind's all about to die
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.400]  and i see no evidence of this anywhere but by the globalist gearing up underground bunkers
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:26.840]  seed vaults and saying themselves once the planetary regime is in place once the planetary
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:32.680]  regime is in place they're going to release airborne super plagues a human version of
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:40.920]  mouse pox that kills 99 of humans and of course they'll have the antidote now that's a real group
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.480]  running the planet setting up world government waging war setting up police state saying that

[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:37.640]  down my pants let the foreign bank steal everything okay it's it's a self-fulfilling
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.720]  prophecy to be losers and it's not in the bible and for all you secular people who don't believe
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.520]  in the bible why do you believe in a mayan prophecy that isn't even what the mayans said
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:56.920]  said see they've tailored this for every audience let's go to jp in maryland jp you're on the air
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.760]  hello alex thanks for taking my call thanks for calling i'm one of the founders of the anapolis
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:09.960]  tea party and i'm friend with joe c hueson and i have a couple questions um how do we get ron paul
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.200]  um supporters out there knocking on doors um that's one big thing i see that really needs
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.560]  to be done to get him elected is that's to be a real grassroots um local knocking on doors
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.240]  getting the information out there the other question i have is how romney raised all his money
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.720]  in that one day now i'm a former mormon and at the mormon church or the ward that you were in
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.160]  the head of the ward would kind of tell you when he got up to the pulpit who you were going to vote
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:47.960]  for and who to donate for and i wonder if there's any um prepaid uh mormon churches or wards that
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:57.720]  that prepaid for his um campaign i don't know all i know is mitt romney wrote the health care plan
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:04.360]  in massachusetts that is now federal law newt genrich is a carbon tax world government lover of
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:11.720]  course republicans than loving uh mitt romney uh is super bad news and just like obama got
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.760]  four times the money that john mccain got it's not that john mccain was good either it's that
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.440]  obama was the man and you see the establishment early on getting behind romney and that's all
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:29.000]  you need to know um a lot of that was big corporate donations uh so i really appreciate your call
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  jp on the issue of ron paul uh ron paul wins either way he's running he's going to educate
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.120]  people about real issues talk about the federal reserve talk about the real ruling class in this
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:48.440]  country talk about crony capitalism versus true free market uh he's getting a lot more attention
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:54.360]  now than he got three years ago and we need to get behind him but as he will tell you he's only
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.200]  one salvo in the fight there's the state rights movement nullification we've got a fight at every
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.720]  level and every strata and so people need to get out there and start knocking on doors i mean you've
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.840]  got rush the big rock band i was driving on the road this morning dialing through and i heard him
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:18.840]  talk a song talking about the new world order and deception and control and uh oh yeah and then i
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.440]  got into the office and checked it sure enough it's like a pro ron paul song i mean i'm telling you
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:31.320]  folks there's a top uh hip-hop star it was an interview i mean top guy hip-hop paul fame just

[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.000]  paul we're told just did an interview with luke radowski we're gonna be getting him on i mean
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.240]  it's just it's massive and it's about an idea ron paul is just a focal point of that uh let's go
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:18:00.040]  ahead and talk to paula in california you're on the air thanks for holding hi how are you um well
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:07.720]  first off it's an honor to be speaking with you um i'm from chile south america where my parents
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:14.200]  lived the dictatorship initiated and provoked by kiss and jerk black mountain project and i just want
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.320]  to say that um from what i've learned and seen it's not much different from the things that are
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:25.080]  happening in this country you know the invasion of privacy it doesn't take much to put the pieces
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.680]  together and people need to wake up well it's like it's like with hitler it took him a good seven
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.440]  years to really get the tyranny rolling and it's the same thing here but now at a certain point
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:43.560]  the pot goes from simmer to boil the water starting to boil well exactly and the signs are there like
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:49.080]  right in front of your face and if you know if you see them you have to do something about it but
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:55.320]  people here in this country are so quiet and they remain distracted and you know i know i'm preaching
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:02.280]  to the choir but it's frustrating because i'm 23 years old and and i talk to people with my age but
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:08.600]  they don't realize what's going on here in california the immigration checkpoints are getting harder
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.400]  every day you know they're opening trunks and hoods and looking into your stuff and by the way
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.120]  they're doing it 50 60 miles into the country they're you know they're leaving the real areas
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:26.200]  wide open but then yes using the immigration uh checkpoint excuse to go after uh people that
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:32.920]  are in this country legally yeah and you know there are like small things uh the past saturday

[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:29.720]  cults probably say it's the rapture happening or something again if you want to know who started
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:35.960]  the whole rapture movement it was masonic preachers and i ought to do a whole show on this uh back in
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:41.800]  the 1850s there were a couple of them let's go ahead and play a mason going into a hospital stopped
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:48.040]  by someone asking if he truly worships lucifer and what he had to say here is the clip lucifer
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:54.520]  what is your problem just that sir okay i'm a christian sir i'm pure and virtuous and wholesome
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.920]  and innocent how can you say anything about me sir you need to be born again i am born again
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:07.080]  did you just say that you're lucifer i am lucifer can you find lucifer for me pure virtuous wholesome
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:13.400]  innocent individual that's out to help people lucifer is yeah lucifer say that again lucifer
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:20.520]  is a pure holy virtuous virtuous now see the lucifer that god created that's the same one oh man this
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.560]  is great i'm going to put this on the internet oh god bless you brother because that's exactly what
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:31.240]  the shriners and masons teach is that lucifer lucifer is like no and you're what about those
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.160]  hospitals they know what sir jesus said many will say to me on that day lord lord did not we
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.720]  do not do these good deeds in your name and you'll stay away from me you workers of iniquity i never
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:51.640]  knew you jesus said in matthew chapter five mercy no that's hard to believe so you're christian and
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.480]  you don't know that actually i really am okay that's enough that's enough the point is he thinks
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.520]  lucifer is basically jesus are two sides of the same coin and i'm just want masons to be honest
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.760]  about it because i've read the albert pike book i've read the morals and dogma i've read the other
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.400]  big ones that they say are their bibles and lucifer's god according to the the high level
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:18.360]  masons so low level masons should know this let's just be honest about it uh let's go to patrick in
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:24.920]  england patrick you're on the air welcome yes hello alex i've been missing to uh for a while um i've
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.920]  made lots of corners so i'll be very brief well you're making your last phone call the world's
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:34.520]  ending tomorrow oh well yes well i can tell you i'm born again i'm baptized filled with the spirit
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:39.720]  speaking in tongues yes by the way i just tell you quickly what they do they they they invented
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:46.840]  that doctrine by twisting daniel's 70 weeks by detaching the 70th week off the 69th and basically
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:52.440]  that the seven years of which three and a half are days of years that's 1260 years already fulfilled
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:58.840]  in prophecy whereas the papacy persecuted the saints basically and um the mark of the beast the
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.480]  mark in the hand that's just symbolic how how the system would enslave members of the intelligentsia
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.640]  you know the mark on the head that the one of the hands would be the manual laborer it's already
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.160]  been fulfilled no one knows that there they are but look i want to quickly tell you i've got an
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:17.320]  interesting book here in front of me roy libssey understanding the new world order world government
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.600]  and world religion uncovering the new world order of george bush it was written in 20 years ago in
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:29.320]  1989 1989 it was written therefore it cannot tell anything that's going to happen after that it can't
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:35.960]  you know basically i just got cast on proof here how the the bilderberg group deliberately sets
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.840]  foreign policy because when the establishment gets challenged enough it starts having to come out and
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.360]  starts having to admit it yeah yeah well yeah you're right there is bilderberg yeah but it's just a
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.960]  it's just a meaning just uh you know a pair group we just discussed problems but back in 1989 they
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:58.680]  met off the coast of spain and i've got to it it features um highlights on the spotlight now you
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:04.520]  probably can't get the spotlight very easy back in 1989 cast down like it says here sources inside
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:09.080]  the secret society of international finances and political leaders said their clandestine meeting
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:14.280]  this year emphasized the need to bring down missus thatcher because of a refusal to you know that's
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.600]  jim and tucker the spotlight is now american free press and uh yes he did predict uh almost a year
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.560]  before she had to step down that they would force her out and the fall of the berlin wall and that
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:32.760]  bush would endorse global warming and everything else because it is a meeting of the super class and
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.360]  the people that really do to a great extent control the world they're just attempting to
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.200]  fully control it uh right now so i i hear what you're saying anything else uh patrick
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.800]  but that's proof that the bilderberg group sets foreign policy because i'm a well i'm well aware
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.240]  here here in london of the article that came out a few months ago and the economist
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:59.000]  when they had to just had to start to admitting it that yes it exists but we but we we're not really
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.880]  in control yeah yeah we just discussed this but obviously there's obviously in a call that actually
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.080]  set to live it for a point they i appreciate your call they had the financial times of london two
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:16.360]  years ago come out with uh one of their main editors their international affairs editor uh and now
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:23.080]  for world government to just type in and now for world government f t financial times and he
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:29.240]  said well yes we are authoritarian it has been secret because you're too stupid to enjoy it and
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.880]  we do need an authoritarian world government and since then they've had all these big environmental
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:39.880]  leaders call for green fascism they call it that and they say we're going to control every
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:45.880]  fast of your life for the earth and that's just their cover story uh so uh absolutely i mean it's
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:51.720]  it's world government is now being openly announced it's already been in place for a long time we're

[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:33.640]  okay dr. Jerome Corsi during the break when i got him online here to be a guest dropped a big
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:44.120]  bombshell on me he has got it narrowed down to even who is needs to be looked at concerning
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:51.800]  this birth certificate this is obviously bombshell stuff we've got bob Chapman coming up a doc could
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.360]  even do an hour with us but i don't want to keep short-shifting bob Chapman but i definitely want
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:03.160]  to get dr. Corsi back up next week as well but for those that just joined us
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.200]  in the last three years i've looked at the birth certificate thing i found it curious that they
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:15.880]  spent over two million dollars now blocking the release of the long form they had chris matthews
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.080]  and others with talking points say there is no long form it doesn't exist that the receipt
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:29.960]  was the long form then responding to dr. Corsi's book a month ago ahead of its publication where
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:36.200]  is the birth certificate that i have here in my hot little hand obama comes out obviously with
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:43.320]  the press conference we have a new video out breaking this down bombshell new birth certificate a
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:50.120]  forgery that's up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and up on the alex jones channel
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:58.120]  and it basically encapsulates the latest developments but now i'm getting even more
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:03.720]  sure that they're running scared and that the research of dr. Corsi and others is spot on now
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.640]  now dr. Corsi's been to kenya he's traveled all over hawaii you name it really trying to get to
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:15.080]  the bottom of this and just a year ago or six months ago he wasn't sure he just said clearly
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.200]  there's evidence of a cover-up so we need to look at it but but but now he's coming out and saying
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:26.280]  that he's sure it's a composite of other real birth certificates that he and now is getting
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:34.120]  hot on the trail of who he believes may know something about where this newest birth certificate
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:39.240]  came from we have the headline from yesterday birth or bombshell corsi to release evidence
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:47.400]  proving obama certificate a fraud composite but then two days ago we see esquire come out
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.360]  and run a headline breaking in their politics section not their humor section to roam corsi's
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:57.080]  birther book pulled from shelves now that's obviously done to create the perception it's
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.560]  discredited by the publisher that that so people have runs on the bookstores and say i want my
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.920]  money back so they get scared and pull the book it is extreme economic espionage then
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:14.520]  five six hours after it's published they come out at the bottom and bury in a paragraph
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:20.200]  this was satire when clearly it was put out to damage them and world net daily books dr.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:27.400]  Jerome Corsi joseph ferrah this shows desperate desperate uh concerned by the white house and
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.560]  their surrogate known surrogate esquire the same day the white house said they're going to run on
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.960]  the birth certificate with coffee cups and t-shirts with a slogan made to maraca with
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.280]  barack obama on it with a copy of the new fake birth certificate now we've looked at it we're
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.440]  going to go over why it's fake how it's a composite you know the total proof uh and more uh and and
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:52.040]  the fact that they blinked dr. Corsi and others smoked them out of their holes and the president
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:57.000]  blinked uh dr. Corsi this this gets crazier and crazier by the minute thank you for joining us
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.720]  well great to be with you alex and i've never in my life seen the white house attack attempt to
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:11.400]  suppress or censor a book as strong as mine i mean these download the democratic national party and
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:17.640]  the um president's reelection committee are sending out this newsletter soliciting funds they
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:24.920]  mentioned me by name in the first sentence the vilify the book they even sent the letter to me
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:31.400]  addressing me to to give them funds of course i sent them some money got a mug i mean it's ridiculous
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:37.960]  this type of attempt to suppress a book is counted as the first amendment and what it shows
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:44.120]  is that the information in this book as soon as from the beginning the white house the obama
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.880]  administration they will not survive if the american people read what's in this book and understand it
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:58.680]  well you're absolutely right uh where do you want to start uh let's start with the a recap of
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.960]  the old birth certificate they claimed was the original and no other long form existed
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:10.280]  then they flip flopped there uh now we've uh the uh proof that this new one is a joke level fraud
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:16.920]  joke level fraud and you know they want to make two points alex first of all if this new long
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:24.600]  form birth certificate existed um why wasn't it released uh three years ago why didn't we have
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:31.320]  this instead of the short form certificate of live birth and alex i got a call about three weeks
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:38.920]  before it was released from one of my sources in hawaii and i was told that the new long form
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:45.320]  birth certificate had been forged it had been flipped into the long book we actually had somebody
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:52.040]  go into the long book and read it to us i knew it said capulani i knew it said dr st. claire
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:57.400]  and i documented all that with joseph barron an email and i i said we better get out front
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:04.520]  and um say that it's likely to be a forgery but we all decided hey this is great if the book smokes
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:12.040]  out obama and you know they blink they feel fear uh they have to respond to try to destroy the book
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:17.880]  now we've got bronco obama personally committed coming to the press room saying this is my birth
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.440]  certificate this is like nixon coming out and lying in the press conference and saying that that he
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:28.600]  wasn't involved in the break in and now the white house is committed to this document they can't
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  say oh no we meant the other birth certificate if this document proves to be falsified the
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.480]  obama administration of the fact that he comes to an end because they tried to preserve the
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.640]  administration with a criminal fraud all right let me stop you for a moment uh you mentioned
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.320]  the fact that why didn't they bring this out three years ago and say that no long form existed
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:53.160]  why did abacromby get into office the new governor of hawaii and say i'm going to go down there and
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.520]  release it and then tell two newspapers as you reported but but mainline papers there in hawaii
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.840]  that i look for it and couldn't find it this is quote going to be a problem in the upcoming
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.880]  election and then magically it does pop up and you've got moles inside of there because you've
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.680]  already been there snooping around that tells you hey guess what uh dr coursey uh it looks like
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.200]  i dream of genie you made it appear in there well and you know i think the the falsification occurred
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.280]  between the time when abacromby could not find any evidence of the long form birth certificate
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:31.640]  and we have that michael evan come out and say so the celebrity reporter from hollywood
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.440]  saying he talked to abacromby and abacromby could not find the long form that's when the
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  forger started to work seriously knowing my book was coming out and by the way down on
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:48.680]  trump i discount i'm completely convinced at this point donald trump was subterfuge that he
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:53.080]  you know i talked he called me two or three times got me to give him a copy of the book in advance
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:59.880]  i'm convinced donald trump was you know through mike cohen it seems to be 5050 working with obama
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:06.920]  uh they were close to schumer so donald trump says let's beat the drums big then you release the
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:14.200]  first certificate i'll say satisfies me the press will go to sleep and i'll get my new 60 million
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:18.920]  contract thank you well i'll tell you the dead ringer i'll yeah he'll get his new 60 million mbc
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:24.680]  contract which is g which is g which which got bailout money and and rachel madow and all of
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:30.280]  them but expanding here's the dead ringer the the two days after he's quote discredited by obama
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:37.320]  he goes into a cussing tirade he's a very shrewd guy meant to further plunge him in the numbers uh
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.960]  and to further discredit and by the way uh i'm going to watch very carefully and see if donald
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:47.960]  trump pops up to build the casinos in chicago now the roman manuals there are another tall building
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.280]  in chicago i'll be there investigating the connections with the white house and what deals
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:59.320]  wink wink went back how far i don't trust it at all you don't you don't trust a guy that owns a bunch
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.880]  of casinos everybody knows those are the good guys look i also want to show you we found i have
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:10.440]  you focused on the the stamp of the alvin onaka stamp i want just a quick simple way to to show
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.720]  people how comical this fraud is you know i i showed that the stamp state registrar stamp has
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:26.040]  a misspelling at it instead of the record is tx e record now nobody uses a stamp with a misspelling
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:32.600]  get it and then if you blow up to about 800 percent and look at the signature alvin t onaka
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:42.520]  in the a there is a smiley face now i assure you i've looked at hundreds of alvin onaka
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.600]  signatures hundred stamps none of them have a misspelling tx e and none of them have a smiley
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:54.600]  face in the a but sir that's my next point is that they took it and put it on this green paper
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.600]  the ap's put out two different versions that don't have the green hash paper uh you've got uh you
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:06.840]  know the situation where it's clearly a computer copying a typewriter but we already knew that and
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:13.320]  said that three weeks ago in our video with 700 000 views on youtube because you can blow up the
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:19.800]  pixelation of the typewriter print and the pixelation of the same letters is identical that's
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:25.160]  impossible the typewriter because every new strike is like a snowflake or a fingerprint because it's
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.280]  how hard you hit the key how it strikes the ribbon the position of the paper there's little
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:37.560]  when it's blown up microscopic uh ink blobs around it you can't have identical same letters
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:43.000]  that is only done by a computer that's designed to have fonts that look like typewriters well and
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.680]  you know the administration will not show the original 1961 there weren't any computers where is
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:57.160]  the original paper birth certificate if it exists submitted to forensic analysis i was in hawaii
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.120]  last week i went to see it no one in the hawaii department of health would talk to me i went
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:07.560]  over to copilani hospital i said okay i've and done them was here i like to see the patient record
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:13.080]  for and done them i've known for years they don't exist and done it was never a patient of that
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.600]  hospital hospital threatened if i didn't vacate the premises they would call the police now if i
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.400]  were administrator of that hospital i'd have a little shrine in the front celebrating that this
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.560]  was the birth hospital the president instead of continuing the cover-up by refusing to answer
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:34.520]  any questions this or providing to the public the corroborating evidence that and done them
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:41.240]  had been in that hospital to give birth to brock obama uh let's look at the computer
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.680]  manipulation of the text you had an article at world net daily about that yes well would you take
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.840]  a look at the text of this thing and you and you blow it up first of all i mean you could even
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:57.320]  start with the number on the upper right the 10641 which by the way is an auto sequence number
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:04.280]  and impossible what you blow it up and look at it the one is clearly a jpeg a photograph dropped
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:10.440]  in there and the pixelation around the one chose the attempt to not repair it very well
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:15.880]  so it's still obvious whoever did that did not understand how to repixelate as clear that the
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:23.320]  one is a jpeg and the rest of the number is not now 10641 is impossible to be bronco mama's
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:29.880]  first certificate number obama was registered on august 8th and that's when he was registered
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:37.960]  on august 8th the number was stamped with an old one of the increment by number counters 10641
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.640]  the the nordic twins were born a day later in the hospital august 5th they were registered three
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:53.160]  days later august 11th and they were given numbers 10637 and 10638 it's impossible because
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:59.320]  that counter it does not reverse and three days earlier registered obama would have had to have
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:07.400]  a lower number maybe by 20 from the nordic twin so the number itself going back to the short form
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:13.720]  was fraudulently with they miscalculated they got the wrong number they were stuck with that number
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:18.360]  so the number is also wrong in the long form birth certificate and then there's not the proper stamp
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:26.200]  that all the others have i mean there's over 50 seal no seal no seal then here's the 64 million
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:33.160]  dollar question why did they put out such a clearly shoddy version not just the layers
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:38.360]  because you do have some layering in these different computer programs like illustrator
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:44.920]  but what the computer then witnesses is if the computer sees the 6789 different layers it sees
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:50.360]  the manipulation and then automatically sorts it the biggest issue here and all and when all the
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:56.120]  photo shot people in my office and outside groups and pointed out is that normally with a scan you
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:03.240]  would have one gradient of pixelation instead it is a cornucopia of different areas with high res
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:09.000]  over low res i mean this i don't believe that they could be this shoddy is what i'm saying well i
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.720]  think you know alex if you're the president you want to forge your birth certificate you can't
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:19.160]  put out a request for proposal and get the best guy in the country to come do the job they were
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:25.720]  stuck with the guys who were close to them and i'm pretty well on the trail of linking the characteristics
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:30.680]  of this document to someone who's going to have a lot of explaining to do and i think the when you
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.400]  see what i'm about to point out next week we're hot in the trail somebody who may have had a hand
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.640]  didn't it now now dr corcy let me just stop you there because you offered during the break you
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:44.920]  said i think i may break who this person is on your show and i was like first tell us some of the
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:50.280]  proof and and take us on the trail close to the person of interest i'm just going to give you
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:56.360]  the hint because i want to i've got to i don't want to give it too far away but there are characteristics
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:01.720]  in the long form birth certificate as it's released and in the work of another person
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:08.280]  where signature items were put into the certificate of live birth to identify the forger
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.440]  and uh the forger is someone who does not work in government he works in the media
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:19.080]  and is close to the administration and would have been within the circle of friends that
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:25.880]  may have been called on to do the forgery or participate in the forgery so i'm going to
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.240]  point out the signature characteristics of the work of this person the signature characteristics
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.960]  in the document itself and we're going to ask the public to draw their own conclusions of the
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:41.240]  person to come forth and explain why those characteristics are there so you've looked
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.280]  at this individual signature and then you've noticed that it appears the way they do their work and
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:52.360]  the way that the signatures are embedded in this document you know every forger it's like you know
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:59.240]  a forger wants their Mona Lisa to hang in the uh in an art gallery on the loo but they want
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.680]  down the road for some experts to notice a flaw or a signature element where you say this is not
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:11.400]  the Mona Lisa uh this is done by stone so the forger wants to be identified by the way that
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.840]  in using that analogy the certificate of live birth uh that the white house release is kind of
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:24.440]  like a Mona Lisa by numbers that's that crude and you also have discovered initials in the
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.440]  signature correct well yes we have a we've we've looked we've got initials we've got the i'm on
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.880]  the track of the person i think that was deeply involved when this was done and i think we're
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:42.600]  going to be able to pin this down not just that it's the forgery but to look at the chain from
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:47.480]  which the forgery came from within the white house and i should be able to have this evidence
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:54.120]  done next week also alex i've been releasing and i will continue to release next week we could we
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.080]  could talk about even releasing at some of it through you uh the documents i've got from
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:06.200]  kenya which shows that the grandmother's been saying obama was born there for years the government
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:11.720]  the intelligence services in kenya have done a search since 2007 for obama's birth records
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:19.640]  and they conclude a government stationary the 1961 birth records in kenya were criminally altered
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:25.960]  with an intent to destroy or otherwise disguise obama birth records in mombasa i've got that
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:31.160]  in government stationary well that's breaking here right now right and i've got the internal reports
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:37.480]  from the government they identified lady grig hospital a division of what was essentially
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.440]  mombasa general hospital where they focused their investigations that believes the baby was born
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.280]  but the government of kenya concluded the intelligence service that the family of obama
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:54.920]  was trying to hide an important birth fact they believed the grandmother that he was born in kenya
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:00.600]  they searched and they identified criminal tampering with the birth record not random
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:08.040]  criminal tampering but tampering so as to hide or destroy obama birth records in kenya
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.360]  and you are going to produce proof from the government proof from kenyan document and i can
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  work together to your producer we're going to be publishing in the world that daily
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:23.400]  wow when is that bombshell going to drop i'll be happy to work with you on that starting monday
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:32.040]  okay uh clearly i mean they've been covering up they've been acting suspicious we got the
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:36.520]  document the day they released it we hoped it was real because quite frankly and i'm sick of this
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:41.880]  i want to go against his record but then alex i want to say you have done such a great job with
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.520]  your videos you've done such you know world that daily has been leading this but i'm going to
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.680]  reach out to the alex jones show and i'm going to share with you some material
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:56.440]  so that in your next videos you've got the primary documents and primary work that we're producing
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.760]  at world that daily i'm going to make a special effort on this one because you're so impressed
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:05.880]  me with the extent to which you've exposed this with your videos and your radio show well thank
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.520]  you i don't i need to give you then my video editors email and then perhaps we can even all
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:15.400]  that offline let's get all that done offline and we'll start getting things together next week
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:21.560]  absolutely now uh the issue i was getting to is that where there's smoke there's fire the evidence
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:27.320]  of the cover-up is uh as criminologists will tell you is generally evidence of the crime
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.200]  the absconding the evasion that's going on to have esquire who i've noticed particularly
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.800]  with obama is their attack dog i agree with that come out with a serious economic warfare
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:44.840]  uh vicious uh espionage i mean that's what it is an attempt to discredit destroy have a recall uh
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.280]  a run to return the book the same day they announced they're going to run on the birth certificate
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.560]  and that we're all a bunch of crazy cooks this shows that they know this issue isn't going away
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:03.320]  and they're scared i mean if they knew this wasn't true they would have just gone forward uh so uh
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:11.480]  blackout look i've got alex in the book i've got 125 exhibits including the mother's passport records
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:17.560]  where she crosses off obama's name to take him off her passport in indonesia indicates his
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:24.120]  indonesian names so it bark off the school records where in indonesia he's very sortoral the
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:31.560]  administration cannot tolerate if people read this book and see these exhibits it destroys this is a
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:37.640]  uh brock obama if he was adopted in indonesia is no longer a natural born citizen he's a dual
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:44.680]  citizen uh all the research and evidence i show that ann dotom left hawaii three weeks after the
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:49.720]  baby was born i've got the college transcript i've got the courses she took the university
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:55.800]  saying these were night courses the apartment where she stayed uh the babysitter to interview
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:02.440]  ann dotom did not return to hawaii until after brock obama left brock obama's senior left
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:07.080]  brock obama's senior was never married ann dotom there was never a married ceremony never married
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:13.720]  bison they never lived together as man and woman ann dotom had been messing around spending time
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:22.920]  in bill letter ur's bar on hotel street in hallowlulu got pregnant decided she wanted brock obama's
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:28.200]  senior to be the father he wasn't real interested except that it might help him with his immigration
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.960]  naturalization status to extend his stay in the united states lend he used lend his name but didn't
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:41.240]  commit the ceremony and ann dotom herself ran off to africa without him in the attempt to
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:48.120]  convince the african family that she deserved to be their princess it didn't work when she got home
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:54.840]  brock obama still did not want to be her husband and so she packed up baby three weeks later went
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:00.840]  off to fielder was at the university of washington in fielder that's what happened and so you're
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:04.120]  what you're saying from your deep research and traveling all over the world you have all the
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:09.080]  proof here in the book that by the way we sell an info wars dot com on the online video bookstore
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.880]  shopping cart uh you're saying that not not only are they trying to cover up the fact that he was
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:19.800]  born in kenya but that he's a bastard yes and that the whole circumstance is told and
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.960]  dreams for my father the fabrication mommy and daddy never lived together in hallowlulu
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:32.840]  abacrame never saw this little family together people the university never visited with the
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:40.280]  you know obama family and baby because mommy and baby three weeks after the baby was born are in
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:46.680]  seattle and don't come back to why until after brock obama is gone brock obama senior is gone
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:53.640]  i've got all the eight or nine articles published in the newspaper this was the first african student
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.680]  coming to the university of hawaii you think the local story would be you know african
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:04.440]  comes to the university of hawaii meets local girl gets married has baby no all i've got all
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:09.880]  the addresses where brock obama senior lived he lived as a bachelor he had made no reference
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:17.000]  in any of the newspapers having any child or wife in hawaii well it's now come out of us uh
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.040]  what what just a few weeks ago uh big mainstream newspapers and magazines
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:26.680]  i'll know you can source them i just read him a few weeks ago that he got kicked out of the
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.080]  big us university he was attending because they said it looks like he has multiple wives
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.000]  women that aren't his wives he's like a playboy at harvard the end the this is in the immigration
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.800]  naturalization file brock obama senior at harvard um there's a kenyan exchange student in boston
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:49.960]  brock obama got her pregnant too and and he had to fly her to london to get an abortion this is in
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:56.120]  the immigration naturalization service file harvard and the in s concluded that his marriage
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:02.280]  to ann donham was a sham marriage just done in order to extend his stay in the united states
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:09.480]  say he had a wife and a child that he never married and never lived with at harvard decided
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.520]  just to cut off his money because they couldn't put a stop to his blandering and by the way this
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:19.240]  is all public i mean this is all public info this comes out of the in s file that's been recently
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:24.360]  released well by the way his dad doesn't even look like him to me well i think what the story
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.480]  i've just told you about bill letterer's bar and ann donham getting pregnant and deciding that
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:35.720]  you know her fairy dream would come true i have brock obama senior would just marry her
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:40.680]  then the child could be born and she could go off with him to wherever for graduate student return
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:46.680]  he'd become president of kenyan she'd become mrs president that's what ann donham had in her mind
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:51.960]  that's what she told maxine bach and that's why obama bary satara has always been obsessed
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:58.120]  with being president because it was mommy's dream to be the mommy's dream with with daddy
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.280]  who didn't participate he looked at this woman and he said look i don't have any money
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:07.080]  i'm you know i'm trying to get through he entered i got the whole record he entered
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:13.560]  university hawaii is a junior i know where he first lived in the ymca building he had no money
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:19.320]  he very he got on the five beta capitalists and the dean's list while he was there three years
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:24.280]  he had a master's degree he didn't want to live with this crazy white woman and put hands on him
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:28.280]  who would determine to tell him you're the father of my child and i'll go to africa to prove
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.080]  your family will accept me sure so she doesn't even know she she didn't even know probably not
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:37.160]  say what stay there this is this is too important and this is why they're so scared

[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:42.280]  the information in here but the exhibits the documentation and knowing this book was finished
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:47.640]  months ago uh so much of what he's now putting the book it's as if they're trying to psychologically

[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:19.640]  lie about me all the time and i don't even respond because it's it's a joke the way they're acting
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:24.840]  his press conference the body language the fakeness of this new birth certificate the fact
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.520]  that they said it never existed uh and that the and that the last one was real the governor saying
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:37.800]  i went to look it's not there uh then it appearing uh and now coursie wouldn't come out and say he's
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:44.280]  hot on the trail and privately you know tell me they even basically know who forged it uh if they
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:51.000]  didn't have uh the meat and potatoes on this dr coursie uh getting back to this esquire i i'm not
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.240]  a litigious person but if i had spent millions of dollars to print up hundreds of thousands of books
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:02.280]  and the and the hundred thousand or so to fly you all over the world and and and and paid you if i
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:07.560]  was joseph ferrah i mean this was for those that don't know how the book publishing business works
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:12.600]  and things are i mean this was clearly designed what esquire did saying it was discredited ferrah
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:19.720]  was recalling it that was meant to cause a run on the book people demanding money back so uh people
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:24.040]  that are selling it in bookstores get scared and pull it off shelves correct that's correct the whole
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:29.960]  idea was trying to destroy the marketing get the book while it's just getting out there and tell people
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:35.320]  you know miss it's misinformation classic misinformation campaign intelligence agents
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:42.360]  do it all the time the book has been always on sale it was never pulled we wanted it to be called
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:48.040]  where's the birth certificate because we were trying to induce barack obama to get so scared
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:53.880]  he'd release the document he released i knew it had to be false i know barack obama was not born
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:59.560]  in hawaii topi alani does not have the records of his mother and they can't i don't think they come
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:04.440]  by the way the the kenyan security force they wouldn't put you on house arrest when you went
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  to kenya right if there wasn't something to hide well i you know and i have the kid the documents
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:15.080]  will begin to print them i'm going to do a lot more next week making it very clear the kenyan
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:21.560]  government and the intelligence services did a deep search a massive amount of searching going for
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:27.240]  obama's birth records they believe they were there the grandmother's been saying for years grandmother
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:32.040]  may have told obama when he first came to africa i was there when you were born why does michelle
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:37.880]  obama in multiple speeches we can play right now for folks uh what three four years ago give speeches
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:43.240]  saying we went back to kenya his his his home country his homeland well i document in the book
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.880]  rock obama before he was running for president was happy to say and have people write and print
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:55.400]  that he was born in kenya and i'm quite confident psychologically subconsciously it comes out for
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:02.200]  michelle because he was born in kenya and the family knows it the kenyan government knows it
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.000]  they can't find the records because the records were criminally destroyed but they found the pattern
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.520]  of destruction of birth record in kenya the documents the barack obama's records were
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:19.480]  intentionally gotten rid of the kenyan government says they say there's 47 instances of specific
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.120]  uh where birth records have been tampered they said this is the pattern to destroy barack obama's
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:29.240]  birth records and to alter the birth record around him so as to disguise the pattern all right we've

[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:37.160]  last hour they believe they know who the forger is the document itself is a manifest
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:42.040]  unprofessional fraud at every level they're just basically knowing if they release it
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:46.840]  once the mainstream dinosaur media commits to it they will then have a stake in not being
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:53.960]  discredited and will then always defend the lie also he's breaking here that are early next week
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:00.680]  at worldnetdaily.com wmd.com they will be releasing documents from the kenyan government
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.560]  that that there's been criminal tampering in the birth records of the hospital where the
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:10.520]  evidence shows barack obama was born dr. coursey would not be going this far if he didn't have
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:14.600]  that information also it's now been confirmed what's in the book written months and months and
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:21.320]  months ago by major newspapers in the u.s. that the state department was asked by harvard
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.680]  to take the visa the education visa away from barack obama senior because he had all these
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.400]  other women pregnant and fake marriages you can just look at obama folks it's not his dad but
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:37.160]  clearly the fact is they weren't probably not married so you've got the bastard news coming
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:42.200]  out not that that's necessarily a bad thing the point is you know life's a good thing period
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:47.880]  it's just that they've got something to cover up here that this is a composite dr. coursey
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:55.800]  uh is this the beginning of uh barry sataro ak barack obama's waterloo because the info you've
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:00.360]  got in here with indonesia and and and getting the dual citizenship you know federal law he
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:05.240]  wouldn't be eligible on that i think that's the smoking gun is this the beginning and and are
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:10.280]  they fleeing forward and and and now that's why they're running on the birth certificate being
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:17.480]  real this whole made in america this fundraising uh after three years of ignoring this is this their
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:23.240]  waterloo yes this is the beginning of the end the obama administration knows if the american
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.600]  people read what's in this book where's the birth certificate then understand that studies the exhibit
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:35.960]  the obama administration cannot survive and the other thing if people don't understand i wanted
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.880]  the title to be where's the birth certificate joseph erin said well they could release the
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.920]  birth certificate i said if they do it'll be fake but that's what we want them to do because then
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:50.760]  obama will be committed obama will have to own that document and the minute we can prove that
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:58.600]  that document is fraudulent the obama administration crashes why would they bet everything on such a
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:05.240]  fraud the cia the state department their masters at putting out near perfect forgeries it was the
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.720]  only thing they could think to do they had to forge it within the group they couldn't go outside the
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:15.720]  group they picked the best it wasn't that good uh they were stuck with it and they used the strategy
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:20.360]  they decided to go with this strategy to try to preempt the book remember they can't stand the
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.080]  publication of this book once the american people read where's the birth certificate they've got
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:30.120]  enough information to know that bronco obama is not eligible to be president he's not even who he
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:36.600]  says he is that's why all these documents are being hidden and the administration can't stand
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:41.880]  that anybody'll read it so they say let's let's rush together let's put the birth certificate out
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.360]  the only thing they had left to save themselves that we can count on the mainstream media they'll
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:51.960]  say the story is dead all the while i'm saying okay look i'm going to take a hit for a while it's
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:57.960]  going to look like i'm not credible but when we prove the birth certificate of fraud when we prove
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:04.040]  there's no patient records for amdana macampulani then the administration crashes and they crash
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:09.000]  criminally i suffer a little bit of a hit for a while whether they make fun of me in the end
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:17.480]  the vindication with the truth is what i'm after the truth is bronco obama was not born in hawaii
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:23.480]  the proof is he's born in kenya the proof is he may not be who he says he is may not even know
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:29.400]  but want to reveal his true birth circumstances and he was a dual citizen which independently
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:35.320]  disqualifies them as birth from his father if that was his father in kenya and in indonesia
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:43.080]  from his stepfather when he became very torturo storybacca and you also dropped the mom shell
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:48.920]  that uh donald trump has contacted you he got an advance copy of the book donald trump called me
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:54.200]  company for information got us to send him an advance copy of the book you know i had no assurance
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:59.560]  that that wasn't going right to the white house michael and calling me talking to me they're talking
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:04.920]  to charlie schumer they look the whole deal was a setup because with char with but with trump
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  immediately obama says look you come and make the issue very big get it done i'll release the birth
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.680]  certificate you'll be a hero you got the first event just drop the issue then the bin laden this
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:23.720]  whole thing you can you can see the scripting and if trump were truly in this and i told trump
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:29.240]  be called me up i said trump you get back into this and say that you want verification of these
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:34.840]  documents you want to see the original best evidence the original paper document not this
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:40.520]  electronic nonsense subjected to forensic test testing get it out of the vault
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.920]  in if we if you're going to show the birth certificate show the original get it forensically
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:51.160]  tested and go to copulonny hospital and say show me and done a patient record trump wouldn't do
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:58.760]  either and then we've got nbc that we know got massive bailout money from g e with g e you know
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.840]  virtually having an office in the white house and uh trump breathing heavily about cathina is
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:09.400]  going to be built in chicago and maybe some tall building i'm just waiting for shit for trump to
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:15.240]  show up with competing for those contracts i'll be there investigating it well i don't i didn't
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:20.680]  like i don't like being played for trump either i gave trump information trusting him expecting
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.480]  him to stay in this battle and not to have me walk out of the plank while he said to the boat
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:30.680]  because i got my 60 billion dollars from g e i don't care about obama's birth records anymore
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:34.360]  well in closing you see the i want to go back to this escort for folks that haven't read it
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:41.000]  it was written clearly uh you know as a news piece to try to to to say that you guys had
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:46.600]  disavowed your own book right which we did not and i and i'm not a litigious person but i think
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:55.880]  farah has an absolute farah's good today's wnd top skyline headline farah says help me to own
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:02.040]  esquire he's doing esquire well you have to because we will this is a new level i mean
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:07.240]  just a month ago we got the internal george soros media matters documents where they said
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:12.120]  we're going to destroy alternative conservative media and you go there i'm attacked almost every

[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:40.680]  going out saying the book had been pulled for the shells when that's completely untrue you know you've
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:47.560]  got um esquire out there on the limb trying to destroy our market we spent the whole day people
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:53.480]  want you know we shouldn't go by the book it's gone all that misinformation classic misinformation
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:59.240]  techniques from intelligence agencies and if that's what esquire wants to do then let them explain in
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:05.560]  court how they had an attention to destroy the book and what damages that causes well it's bottom
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:09.800]  line it's meant to cause people to run back to the store saying i want my money back then all the
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:15.240]  big booksellers barns and nobles panics and and and pulls it off shelves have you ever seen an
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:22.040]  attempt by the administration by someone in the white house to destroy a book in the history of
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:28.040]  book publishing i don't remember any president going after a book like this uh nixon actually went
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.560]  after some authors and people and you saw what happened to him this shows that they are running
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:40.760]  scared in the last leg this they're gasping they're desperate they're using um fraudulent methods
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:48.920]  they're using have you know strong arm tactics and i'm just an author they want to vilify me if
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.680]  that's what they have to do to stay in the white house so be it i'll tolerate that for a while
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:18:00.040]  the final analysis if that document fraudulent then we're vindicated and the white house is
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:04.680]  going to have to explain the criminal court why a criminal document was brought out and
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:09.240]  then and obama will have to explain to the american people all right why he resorted the crime to stay
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:11.800]  in office all right we've only got about a minute and a half left and we're coming back for the

[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:35.720]  comments uh for dr coursey well i love his work and i i am absolutely thrilled that he's done it
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:41.720]  and i think there's a good chance he can take him down with it and so everybody who's listening
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.080]  should be proud of your own coursey well i also i mean i want to endorse bob's newsletter i've been
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:52.600]  reading it for years it's the best most insightful newsletter in the business i rely on it well there's
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:58.440]  no doubt dr coursey you hit the barbed wire with this and you're always a very careful person and
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.040]  i've read the book uh there's definitely a cover-up going on here and that itself in in in law is a
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:10.840]  crime uh covering up a crime if they're desperate something's going on and they put out this
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:17.560]  shoddy fake there's no doubt about that and so uh are they trying to cover up he's a bastard
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:23.480]  now that's what wane madson uh has said uh and i don't think it's necessarily if they care that
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:30.200]  he's a bastard what they're covering up is that the mother desperate to find obama induced him
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:35.880]  to be the father took on her own a trip to africa to try to convince the family she should be the
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:41.000]  prince that's the story yeah because he was in line to get into politics obama senior couldn't
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.880]  care less and the family couldn't care less they took this crazy girl over to the hospital
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.200]  and let her have her baby they sent her home that's her missing six months and she goes to

[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:12.280]  bob shatman's our guest i want to get into the economy a bunch of important police state news
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:21.160]  bob's inside uh scoop is yes so many connections on the dominies uh Strauss con situation but
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:26.120]  finishing up with a birth certificate bob you know i mean out of hundreds of broadcasts i do a year
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:31.320]  here every year i do five six seven shows on the birther issue and say i don't know but looks like
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:37.720]  they're covering something up but now the way they put out this shoddy certificate the way they
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:42.840]  ran dirty tricks against world net daily and and and coursey uh i mean there's no doubt that
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:47.960]  thing's fake there's no doubt they said the last one was the long form and nothing else existed
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.800]  there's no doubt governor abacrom he said he went and looked and couldn't find it and then
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:58.760]  suddenly it's there i mean what on earth is going on well i'm trying to cover up uh
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:04.200]  you know this is brzezinski and soros who put this guy in a position that he's in
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:10.760]  they figured they could bulldoze the american people into believing that he he was what they
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:18.840]  say he is and now jerome has written a book that tells you that is of the case and this is what
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:25.080]  investigative journalism is all about and the quality of telling the truth and it's going to
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:32.280]  be crippling they should have thought of all this and now you get the attack coming forward by
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:44.920]  media matters which is the services uh company or whatever they call it and um and you know i i i
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:51.320]  also and and went to your staff here a couple weeks ago um that media matters was attacking g
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:59.400]  edward griffith too and they gave me the information which i sent on to ed but um anything goes with
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:04.280]  these people and they're gonna they're gonna try to rough this thing all the way through
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:11.240]  and they are going to be unsuccessful well when they get up there and say that it's crazy to question
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:15.880]  government and that we just need to believe what we're told everybody knows government's constantly
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:24.120]  caught lying and then why do you think it's such a bad forgery because i mean the whole thing's a
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:33.560]  joke well you're right and i'm all that over when i was first informed of its quality not being a
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  professional in that area and um either one or two things happened in your own game one of them
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.680]  they had to rush to get this thing done had to be done within their own circle and they picked
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:50.760]  what they thought was the best person to do it and as you pointed out had they gone to the fbi or
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:57.960]  the cia particularly the cia uh they could have made them a wonderful forgery and uh but they
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:06.920]  didn't do that i just think they're dumb for those that don't know the british and us forgery
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:14.760]  departments of the intelligence services keep every known uh typewriter used copies of old paper
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:21.320]  or original reams they have whole warehouses this is admitted they can fake digital cards
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.680]  they can fake identities they do surgeries uh so that people can pass i mean i mean they're
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:33.880]  masters of this they would have out of whole new paper made a perfect fake but instead we get something
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:41.720]  that looks like it was made by mickey mouse it's a good way to put it so what they just had some
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:48.920]  good fellow i guess one of the little you know mafia buds to do it well whoever uh i think the
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:56.360]  point is uh jerome uh is going to infidelity prove that the president of the united states is not
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:04.200]  who he says he is he's not an american citizen and so on and so forth and uh that could take him down
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:12.520]  from office um then we get joe byton if you can believe that but uh that's the way uh the changes
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:21.160]  of power are in the western world uh and have been for some time and i i expect that uh uh there'll
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:26.520]  be you know uh all sorts of things in the media the media of course is printed so they have to
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:34.520]  defend him but in the final analysis uh he's going to be out of office i think well that's
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:39.400]  right once the media unquestioningly two and a half years ago bought the other certificate
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:44.600]  as the total proof and the end all be all uh and then once they committed to this new line
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:50.840]  uh they don't have a choice they're going to continue digging the hole deeper for themselves
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:55.480]  that's right um the old adage i learned when i was a little boy
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:01.480]  you tell a lie you got to tell 20 more to make up for it it's hardly worth it and that's why
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:07.640]  my whole life i've tried to tell the truth each and every time because i don't want that burden
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:12.360]  of having to worry about the lies i got to tell well exactly that's what's so great about doing
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:17.240]  the research telling the truth is that you don't have to remember anything i mean you're just going
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.240]  with what the research is and it's right there you're not having to remember what you said before
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.800]  about this or that that's why so many of these politicians have got to read off teleprompters
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:30.040]  is because they're just complete liars and they've got to have experts that go over it and make sure
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:36.920]  the lies have continuity i want to shift gears now with bob Chapman of the international forecaster
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:41.720]  when we come back and run over a host of news also look at how they're trying to suppress
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:47.720]  golden silver also government orders youtube to censor protest videos this is confirmed

[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:05.880]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:10.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:15.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:20.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:26.520]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:31.640]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:35.800]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:41.160]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:45.640]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.640]  see millions of retired senior citizens re-enter the workforce combined with the millions of

[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:02.040]  tv they've also told us we can post it there okay going back now to bob Chapman bob i've got all
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:08.760]  this economic news china is now the top gold bug financial times is reporting the wall street
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:14.280]  journal is also reporting mexico buying massive amounts meanwhile the system with papers trying
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:22.200]  to suppress it we've got the currency wars accelerating bloomberg's reporting they have a
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:30.040]  hbo special coming out that literally worships henry paulson as our savior headline paulson cast
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:39.880]  a stoic savior and hbo big a wall street saga i mean this is just incredible we've got china
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:45.880]  continuing to dump its purchases of treasury notes what's happening in the economy right now
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.560]  well uh first of all uh people think that by the end of june and this are usually people
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:37:03.000]  who are professionals that um what is called a qe3 a qe2 is going to terminate and the bottom line
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.160]  very simply is they terminate the economy totally collapses so they have to keep it up and they will
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:15.000]  do it under another name they'll dream something up they got people working 24 7 doing just such
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.840]  things and so it's going to continue that is what the stock market's telling you and that's why in
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:29.880]  the downwind move from 10 800 to 12 800 they're discounting and the news ahead of time and the
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:36.520]  market normally does that because the insiders know what's going on who are they jp mogen chase
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:43.320]  goldman sex city group uh dutch bank hsbc and on and on so they know what's going on because they
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:51.640]  create the news they don't get inside information they make inside information and so that's why
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:59.080]  you've seen what you've seen in the market defying reality and i think probably once it becomes known
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:05.400]  that qe3 is in process then the market will probably start to come up because all the good
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:11.000]  news will be out continued spending spending of money and not a collapse in the economy
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:19.320]  gold and silver are going to continue upward based upon number one the goal being the only
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:23.720]  money in the world and that's been proven over the last two and a half years and it's had to
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:30.680]  head fight with the dollar and all of the currencies as well and both silver and gold in the future
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:37.800]  will move higher we just had a big man-made uh correction and that will be overcome
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:44.680]  is this the bottom i don't know but i don't care we just keep on buying because it's the only safe
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.880]  place to be it probably is a bottom and then we had a very good day today in the market
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:57.880]  and it's continuing and uh and so there are a lot of peripheral things going on the book
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:06.200]  by geron coursey explaining uh the birth of uh the person who calls himself president and uh and
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.640]  then there's other things outside that now alex you know i've been talking for the last couple
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:20.600]  of years about the possibility of government doing something to or with a 401k and an ira's
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:27.800]  and i think that's getting closer and closer tip off here recently was we don't have the money to
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:35.320]  carry us up to august the second when supposedly we're going to have an extension of the uh the
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:43.800]  funding of debt um so what government has done instead of putting money into the retirement
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.200]  program like this supposed to they're not going to do that they're going to use it to run the
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:56.040]  government so what they're doing essentially is i would say illegally robbing the pension plans
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:03.960]  of government employees now uh the next step from there is the six trillion dollars which are in
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:10.360]  retirement plans as 401ks and and ira's by the way let me just let me just briefly interrupt you
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:17.720]  because the very same international combine that is robbing Greece now spain portugal trying to rob
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:24.840]  iceland uh ireland they're on record last week saying that the governments are saying now we're
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:30.760]  going to take your private pension funds and selling it like that's welfare your own pension fund
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:36.760]  and we've got mainline republicans pushing taking and cutting the pensions of public workers
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:42.200]  and union people when they've money's already been paid into that it's just been stolen
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:47.000]  out the back door so they're selling this austerity and they're also going to go out
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.720]  for the private pension funds so folks need to get through their heads we need to write off
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:58.920]  the quadrillion and plus and derivatives uh and and and and not go out and uh rob the unions and and
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:04.920]  the government pension funds because here's the other problem they're going to play all of those
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:09.880]  public workers off against everybody else because they're going to be fighting for their financial
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:14.200]  future uh when at the end of the day we should be looking at the bankers first
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:21.000]  well you're right and uh the tactics will be
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:29.240]  formulated in a way that people will think it's good for them we had a report come out and uh
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:38.680]  in february called the annual report on middle class and um in there it it talked about guaranteed
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:43.000]  retirement accounts of course that's by the government and the government would run the
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.480]  money and that means that they would use the money that presently was an IRAs and 401ks to
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:55.080]  fund the government and that would be one of the ways that they would fund the shortfall
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:04.600]  in the purchasing of treasury and agency paper agency is fanny freddy jinny and fha bonds and so
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:10.920]  they're going to try to release some of the pressure on the fed like you know under qe3 they'll
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:16.360]  have to come up with a minimum of 1.7 trillion and if they're going to replace what stimulus is not
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:21.560]  going to make available from the legislature they're going to have to come up with 2.3 to 2.5
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:27.160]  trillion so they're trying to relieve them of that problem in part and remember they're already
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:32.840]  robbing everybody's pension funds public private and savings with the inflation what is the real
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.880]  unemployment at from your research and what is the real inflation at and where is inflation going
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:43.240]  we now see they had a walmart a month ago benvernacchi this week they're now admitting hey inflation
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:51.880]  is going up but it's no big deal well it's around 10 percent and last may i made a prediction
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:59.240]  that we would have qe2 and stimulus on the same order of qe1 and we would have qe3 and i also
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:04.600]  said that inflation by the end of this year now this is going to be a year and a half by the time
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:11.400]  we get there would be 14 percent of higher right now it's around 10 percent the government's talking
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:22.200]  2.6 percent and uh this is only this year but everybody knows that's pure bull bob and milk
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:32.040]  eggs uh meat uh fuel uh power bills phone bills everything skyrocketing and that's true and it's
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:38.360]  going to continue as long as they continue to do what they're doing and next year we'll probably see
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:44.440]  25 to 30 percent inflation and they'll say it's five or 10 percent whatever it is and of course
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:49.880]  that won't be true and then if we have this qe3 which i think we will we'll be looking at maybe 50
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:55.320]  percent by the way bob you've been right about 97 percent of the time that i've been reading you for
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:01.640]  14 15 years and interviewing you for close to that that's very frightening because you predicted
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:07.000]  everything that's happened so far to this point you're saying 25 30 percent next year
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:13.240]  there's a good chance of that if they continue to do what they're doing and then the following year
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  we could get up to 50 percent which is called hyperinflation it's the uh the bottom edge the
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:26.600]  beginning of hyperinflation some hyperinflations go two or three thousand times but you know for
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:34.280]  america uh 50 is god awful well they can't give all three to haircut i mean they can't i mean they
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.040]  can't give all three to haircut they're not going to do that they're not going to ever be able to
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.680]  cut enough government uh and entitlements to ever fix this so it looks like it's a foregone
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.120]  conclusion absolutely and it's part of their plan to bring everything down so that everybody will
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:54.280]  say please save me feed me put me in one of your camps so i'll be safe and i'll accept world government
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:45:03.160]  but you need if you spoke about wall street not accepting that's part of what the uh dominik
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:10.440]  straws uh kind of here is about he said look let's help these nations uh let's not loot them let me
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:15.160]  stop you backwards he used let me stop you because i want to reset here i want you to uh take your
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:21.000]  time on this because that was my next point that you concur with dr paul craig roberts that this
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:27.160]  is a setup i mean it's admitted that his head spin doctor and one of their campaign heads uh for
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:32.760]  sarcosi did release the arrest before it even happened that i mean that's admitted they admit
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:38.520]  that uh and it's admitted uh that he that they're acting like he's already guilty i mean i don't
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:43.560]  like this guy i don't like globalist but he had said that we're getting diminishing returns
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:49.080]  we've ground the third world so bad that we might want to start forgiving some of this fiat
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:55.400]  debt i mean uh what's your intel on what happened with conne well of course that wall street's an
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:01.320]  aftermath to that because they've been looting since 48 actually the uh imf was formed in 44
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:09.160]  but it really didn't function till 48 um and you know craig paul craig roberts is correct
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:17.160]  and it's as simple as that i have a great insight into french politics and the reason why is i've
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:22.600]  followed it very deeply for years they speak french and i went to the university they should know
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:30.760]  and um one of my good friends i haven't talked to him for a long time is your marina penn uh he's
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:36.280]  well he used to be the head of the national front and his daughter marina is now the head of the
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:42.280]  national front and i've known her since she was a teenager because i used to go to their home and
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:54.120]  have dinner and things like that and i noticed today that uh madame legrand uh is being uh
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:47:01.640]  talked about to be the head of the imf now the reason they would do that is she's the natural
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:08.120]  run one to run on the socialist party ticket and she would be the next to the line after
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:15.000]  uh astra's con but they want her out of the way because they want sacozi to win and so
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:20.920]  right now sacozi you're going to get like 35 percent of the vote prior to all this happening
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:28.680]  and marina's got 21 which is very high uh for them because uh when le penn ran for the presidency
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:35.240]  you only got 19 percent he was he was um just a mold if you may uh from a political standpoint
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:42.360]  right anyway uh she's brilliant uh she was trained as an attorney uh a criminal attorney at that
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:48.520]  and she's the sweetest nicest one of the nicest kids i ever met but anyway uh i think she's got
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:54.600]  a shot at him and it's going to be very interesting because if the people in france say we don't want
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:48:01.480]  this guy and we really wanted straws con maybe we should have this lady as our president and by
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:08.280]  the way the vast majority of the french do believe this was a setup with a dominate straws con
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:14.600]  without question in my comment all week has been the same as yours i don't care for him
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:22.760]  uh and uh i never have and i won't go into it but there's no question a man's a billionaire
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:31.080]  a long long line of very influential wealthy famous people and uh he has a three thousand
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:40.600]  dollars this week uh which he paid for as far as i know and um men like that do not pursue the things
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:47.640]  that he's been accused of it's as simple as that and he was set up and they probably they were
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:52.200]  intelligence agencies involved it's well that guy could order up any women he wanted and that's
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:57.320]  what they do but sometimes these globalists do go a while like this my issue is he may have even
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:04.680]  done it they've removed the protection from him now either or and it really doesn't make any difference
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:11.800]  at this point because he's out of the iam out he won't run for the presidency and the goal was to
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:18.760]  get rid of him in that powerful position and he's gotten been gotten rid of well it's admitted in
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:24.840]  the french papers sorry for him because he's in a hardball league and he knew that well con it's
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:31.480]  admitted this her cozy put him as the head of the iam fb to get him out of politics probably
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:39.000]  probably well i'll tell you what's going on in europe right now anything can happen a marina could
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.720]  win all right well looking at what's happening with europe you predicted three years ago that
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.360]  it would start in ireland portugal and spread that the euro would die where are we right now on
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:57.560]  that front well um grief is not cooperating uh samaris who's the head of the other party
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:04.200]  the one that's not in power which is pompadreo's group his father was present before him during
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:14.760]  the 80s terrible crook number one and an ardent communist um it's not going to work uh the other
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:20.840]  party is not going to go along with their let's deal everything in the country program and uh
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:26.840]  they're gonna have to give them a partial default and that'll last about two years and the problem
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:31.800]  will be back again and then they've got to deal with ireland and and the portugal who are in the
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:40.280]  same positions uh france is direct excuse me spain isn't dreadful condition hundreds of thousands
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:47.560]  of homes empty and uh of course you probably have heard that about 50 000 people from europe
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.680]  bought homes in spain and then were told they didn't own them and there's been a big fight
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:57.960]  over this you don't see it in america now there's there's huge protests going on right now uh things

[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:36.440]  for holding you're on the air bob Chapman thank you very much alex i just i i was on hold for
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:43.400]  heck an hour and a half at least um regarding the uh the pre-tribulation issue that you uh
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:46.600]  brought up earlier is that all right if i talk about yeah i know but we won't have time but you
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:51.080]  don't have to preface it yeah uh people saying that the world's gonna uh the rapture is tomorrow
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:57.240]  and that's in these same groups do this over and over again and it and it's uh idiocy uh go ahead
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:04.440]  i i'm i'm the founder of a of a small uh disability ministry father once seen tax exempt
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:10.600]  non-profit and we deal with this all the time and really that's an outgrowth of the prosperity gospel
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:17.720]  and and shortly uh uh defined the prosperity gospel is naming and claiming in other words if i in
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:23.080]  jesus name if i believe i should be driving a Mercedes Benz well i claim it in jesus name
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:29.160]  and if they but you know in regards to suffering which you were getting to earlier uh they believe
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:33.640]  that suffering only happens because one of two reasons and that's because it's either the devil's
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:40.360]  fault or it's in in that person's life now i had a daughter who at two she stopped talking at two and
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:44.920]  a half she stopped walking at two and three quarters the seizure started and she had two disease
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:50.440]  states baton disease and uh william syndrome long story short we actually we're actually
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:57.000]  receiving a patent for our work we extended her life five years she she passed on uh about two
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:04.600]  and a half years ago and this is for god's glory um and her life was for god um because when the
[03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:10.520]  disciples came upon uh the blind man they said hey jesus who sinned this man or his parents and
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:15.160]  jesus said neither sinned this man was born this way for their glory god and then he healed him
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.320]  so that's right nobody can calculate god's plan i stand i'd love to talk more but we're almost out
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:26.760]  of time what do you think about these movements with the 2012 for the uh people that aren't you know
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:32.680]  religious to buy into end of the world christian groups catholic protestant pushing it i mean
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:36.280]  do you agree with me bob that it's a way to just get people to think it's all over so why should
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:42.040]  they be involved in anything and just lay down yes and it's an ultimate distraction there's
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:47.480]  nothing closer to people than their religion and if they're too distorted it's very powerful
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:53.880]  yeah i mean i'm just sick and tired of it i mean i mean let's say the world's gonna end
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:58.360]  next month you're still supposed to stand up against evil and corruption it's the ultimate cop
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:05.240]  out that's right so you gotta keep on doing what you're doing and if it ends it ends that's too bad
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:12.120]  well they've only had this doctor in the last 150 years and i know you've studied history
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:15.400]  how many times have people laid down to tyrants thinking it's the end of the world
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:19.560]  oh it goes back for centuries look at the early christians
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.800]  and who knows before that we don't have you know complete histories of
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:33.480]  of things that happened um perhaps 200 years and further before the birth of christ the great
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:39.960]  library in uh alexandria was wiped out by fire probably had most of world's history in there
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:47.320]  yeah i did uh really it's it's it's a way to give up and i see this and it really is
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:51.720]  i see it in secular people i see it in other religions other than christianity
[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:55.240]  so you say oh the world's over so i'm not going to do anything i mean it's
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.720]  i call it the ultimate loser pill it's just i'm just giving up
