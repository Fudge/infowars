[04:39.680 --> 04:45.120]  subjective out he says was it intentional was it grossly negligent and then when he goes on he says

[07:59.840 --> 08:12.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[08:16.160 --> 08:23.520]  I remember nine years ago having Dr. Jerome Corsi and many other researchers on who had written
[08:23.520 --> 08:31.840]  and compiled books showing the school records of barack obama showing uh different statements
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.800]  and different publications that he'd written for that he was a muslim and that he of course had
[08:38.800 --> 08:45.680]  gone to madrasa religious school in indonesia the first major foreign speech he gave was in
[08:45.680 --> 08:55.440]  Cairo egypt just a few weeks after being in office and if you remember back to 2004 it was all over
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.360]  the foreign news but also our own news that the muslims were blown away that he had better pronunciation
[09:04.560 --> 09:06.960]  better pronouncements
[09:06.960 --> 09:20.400]  of the islamic text than most of their top imams and then he's got his cousins and his half brothers
[09:20.400 --> 09:27.600]  and all these people that are at the forefront in kinnia of the political arm of islam and then
[09:27.600 --> 09:32.560]  of course there's the military arm attacking police stations shooting up shopping malls and
[09:32.560 --> 09:40.720]  parochial schools and even back then nine years ago when he was candidate obama i was just like
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.560]  this is too much okay he's wearing some muslim garb he goes to some muslim weddings maybe he went
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.600]  to a madrasa when he's a kid okay but there's no way the establishment as bad as they are
[09:52.160 --> 09:59.040]  would actually put a radical islamicist in power and that's one of the few things i've
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.880]  said on air that i really made a big miscalculation on a big mistake
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.240]  i knew that they were funding the radicalization of islam i knew that they were manipulating it
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.080]  using the threat to take our liberties but i really didn't think that the elite would actually
[10:16.960 --> 10:24.240]  want to bring in gigantic hordes of unwashed third world muslims and then start catering
[10:24.240 --> 10:30.320]  to them at every level now we've been aware in europe for five years in the us for two years of
[10:30.320 --> 10:39.680]  massive stealth illegal invasion called migratory movements of jihadist most of them are military
[10:39.680 --> 10:49.520]  age men in fact if you go back to even a few months ago even interpol said around 80 percent
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.520]  of military age men most of them aren't syrian they just claim they're syrian and they have fake
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.440]  passports but the germans the swedes the french and others are accepting it
[11:01.600 --> 11:06.880]  then we look at what's happening on our border where thousands a month of other than mexicans
[11:06.880 --> 11:14.320]  is what they're called on the board patrol files come across just at the mcallon sector alone that
[11:14.320 --> 11:19.360]  they catch and they estimate that they're only catching a fraction we've talked to the board
[11:19.360 --> 11:26.160]  patrol union had in that area 20 jacari was just down there a week and a half ago we have those
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.960]  interviews obama has done everything he can to block the news that this is happening and to block
[11:32.960 --> 11:39.440]  the real numbers the good news is he's starting to come out look at drudge report dot com today
[11:39.440 --> 11:43.040]  if you're a tv viewer if you're a radio listener go to drudge report dot com we also have this
[11:43.040 --> 11:50.240]  important information mirrored at info wars dot com and as drudge points out and isn't about who
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.680]  gets credit i'm glad this is all coming out now this is not new news drudge covered it in 2007 2008
[11:59.040 --> 12:05.360]  2004 i don't think drudge remembers he did that but i do he's got a link to himself in 2008
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.560]  and we of course covered it it's not about the credit it's about the good news now that finally
[12:10.560 --> 12:14.720]  this is in major newspapers and fox news is covering it because when they first came out with
[12:14.720 --> 12:21.840]  these in 2004 media said they were fake until in some of his own harvard law journals and things
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.520]  these photos were also discovered now the differences these are color versions of the black
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.640]  and whites that were already available that have been in print publications put out by obama to
[12:32.640 --> 12:41.440]  push his multicultural cred on the street so there's a lot happening here but when i get up here and
[12:41.440 --> 12:47.920]  i say that our crew at on salazar and kit daniels and jacarje action and and and zimmerman and
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.960]  alley and everybody else down the border are breaking international news it's not so we get
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.560]  credit so we can shine attention on our wide open border and the national security crisis
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.760]  and also illustrate how all this police state theater with the tsa and the spy and the nsa is
[13:03.760 --> 13:10.160]  all a joke because the border patrol in their own words is being ordered to quote complete the
[13:10.160 --> 13:18.640]  smuggling process in the last three four years so it's now as if the heavens have opened up
[13:18.640 --> 13:23.200]  and hell on earth is raining down because i'm here to tell you it's not a hundred thousand
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.440]  refugees we've taken in the last few years and now obama wants a hundred thousand more he's saying
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.360]  they use that same manipulation in europe starting five years ago claiming it was ten
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.280]  thousand then a hundred thousand just two years ago they were saying it was a hundred thousand
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.720]  in germany it was two million so when they say a hundred thousand they mean a million
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.560]  and i'm going to tell you something i've lived in austin texas since i was a sophomore in high
[13:48.560 --> 13:56.320]  school a junior in high school my mother's from austin i grew up in dallas i've been all over the
[13:56.320 --> 14:06.560]  country i've been on brown a lot of areas of the world too the only places i've seen this many
[14:06.560 --> 14:14.000]  classically garbed third world style orthodox muslims in the streets is somewhere like london
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.800]  or toronto and i mean folks with with in the nice part of town with rugs on the street not paying
[14:22.800 --> 14:29.040]  taxes not paying fees carrying less burning incense and drinking tea folks i mean it's like
[14:29.680 --> 14:38.400]  it's like bag dad or something and now austin texas is like that so i don't know the numbers
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.560]  but i know again my high school we have the report on fours dot com i'm about to get to the new
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.600]  news here in a moment had seven out of out of out of one thousand four hundred something students
[14:49.600 --> 14:57.600]  you can pull it up 230 plus were new in the last year from syria and iraq quote refugees just the
[14:57.600 --> 15:05.280]  children so here's the new story bill o'reilly has gotten exclusive photos that are not exclusive
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.600]  they were published years ago by drudge and the daily mail and world net daily and info wars and
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.000]  look everybody knows i don't like bill o'reilly because he's too much of an obama supporter or
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.080]  hillary supporter but but i'm at least glad he's going in this direction it's just the fact is
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.840]  that bill o'reilly is not breaking this but he is breaking it to the fox news audience so it shows
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.040]  a major shift the fact that they can't hold this information back and joel gilbert that's made films
[15:29.040 --> 15:35.280]  about this subject is going to be joining us in third hour so the point is the electronic
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.520]  burlin wall covering all this up is breaking and this isn't the only thing breaking today look at
[15:39.520 --> 15:46.080]  this bill o'reilly shares photos of iraq obama in traditional muslim dress he claims are from his
[15:46.080 --> 15:54.000]  half brother malik's wedding saying they prove his deep emotional ties to islam um obama tears up
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.400]  for real when he's speaking to an islamic group and really gets off on it and that's who he is
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.280]  and odinga and and you know all these other people
[16:06.320 --> 16:11.520]  that he's been connected to are involved in all sorts of radicalization operations over there in
[16:11.520 --> 16:18.240]  kenya and the muslims that are a minority in kenya are taking over that's a fact and of course who
[16:18.240 --> 16:24.960]  is the allied with bill o'reilly shares photos of iraq obama in traditional muslim dress he claims
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.040]  are from his half brother malik's wedding saying they prove his deep emotional ties to islam
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.560]  bill o'reilly shared photos the fox news host said it was very difficult to verify the exact
[16:34.560 --> 16:38.880]  location of the photographs a similar set of which were released back in 2004 by malik and
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.920]  previously published on daily mail he claimed they were taken in maryland in the 1990s
[16:47.760 --> 16:50.960]  and it just goes on from there i mean there is obama with
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.880]  other members of his family in islamic dress there's his family holding up the photos i mean
[16:58.880 --> 17:04.400]  this is just a fact and then there's his wife michelle uh you know over there hanging out and
[17:04.400 --> 17:10.320]  then there's members of his family hanging out with qaddafi i mean this is what's going on this is
[17:10.320 --> 17:17.600]  where obama shares his cultural roots whether he's from kenya or not and then when he's in indonesia
[17:17.600 --> 17:28.240]  his family puts him in a mosque as well of course a sunni mosque a saudi backed mosque so i remember
[17:28.240 --> 17:35.440]  when they were on the news saying in 2003 2004 we can play the clips obama truth squads he's going
[17:35.440 --> 17:39.920]  to youtube they're still there obama truth squads in missouri and it was another states too will be
[17:39.920 --> 17:46.240]  out arresting anyone that says he's a muslim and doesn't want to lower taxes he is a christian who
[17:46.240 --> 17:54.560]  will cut your taxes this is district attorneys and police chiefs democrats on tv in vermont and
[17:54.560 --> 18:01.840]  missouri and michigan and other areas with a script saying we're going to arrest you if you say he's
[18:01.840 --> 18:08.400]  a muslim well i could say he's a martian from pluto if i want to or a chinese jet pilot whether
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.760]  it's true or not i have free speech but he does have these islamic ties and then look at all his
[18:13.760 --> 18:19.120]  actions since then so here's the big news this is what drudges linked to we're also compiling
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.280]  an article boiling this down because it's a big deal this is breaking through into the consciousness
[18:23.280 --> 18:29.200]  oh riley reveals unseen photos of obama in muslim dress deep emotional ties to religion
[18:30.400 --> 18:37.040]  that hurt usa then you scroll down here red linked obama joint effort with corporations
[18:37.840 --> 18:44.720]  can resettle refugees quote limitlessly daily caller and under that muslim camps spread in
[18:44.720 --> 18:51.040]  usa and then of course when there's rapes and assaults they cover it up refugee crisis majority
[18:51.040 --> 18:58.240]  unemployed now again you're saying i tell us something we don't know the point is it's now
[18:58.240 --> 19:04.480]  breaking all over the place and the numbers are secret i told you it's big corporations the vatican

[19:34.640 --> 19:38.640]  in minneapolis st paul where i've been there years ago that's where our network space is an

[24:12.320 --> 24:18.640]  i'm gonna start breaking that down start the next segment but first off i've been building up in the
[24:18.640 --> 24:24.400]  last segment to our reporters being arrested yesterday outside mcallin texas beside the
[24:24.400 --> 24:30.080]  Rio Grande river um openly going up and trying to talk to state police trying to talk to the
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.640]  border patrol uh trying to ask where they've been seeing movement where where they've been seeing
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.600]  groups coming across is what the press does uh we've done this in arizona new mexico countless
[24:39.600 --> 24:47.280]  other news crews have done this i mean in arizona there's there's malicious with you know firearms
[24:47.280 --> 24:53.680]  out there aiding the border patrol in apprehending people uh and i guess because we were nice to the
[24:53.680 --> 25:00.560]  state police and the border patrol uh they then um illegally arrested them zimmerman
[25:02.160 --> 25:08.960]  alley and bigs and took their legal firearms and then tried to make them pay hundreds of dollars
[25:08.960 --> 25:14.160]  a piece to quote unimpound them so i don't want to have to do this but i'm gonna have to sue them
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.720]  i just i just have to do it because they hire these young people these border patrol folks that
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.200]  now are just delivery agents for illegal aliens the border patrol union has said that on fox news
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.640]  we quote complete the smuggling process so they make you put your hands up and this is after our crew
[25:29.680 --> 25:34.560]  was driving around trying to interview people because see they're not threatening they they
[25:34.560 --> 25:40.400]  need to then practice pretending uh like their border patrol on them uh and and of course i'm
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.160]  notice it's a very high ratio of female border patrol agents this looks like this is some type
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.400]  of training op you've got an older border patrol guy there and then they've got the ladies out learning
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.520]  who the enemy is and you really come to grips with the fact that the american people really are the
[25:53.520 --> 25:59.760]  enemy now as you talk to the border patrol union they don't like what's happening they understand
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.360]  they're being given orders that are criminal supreme court told obama stop doing what he's
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.080]  doing it's illegal he just said i'm gonna keep doing even said i'm gonna keep doing it uh so
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.160]  they just uh basically were able to upload some of this footage last night morris coming up
[26:14.160 --> 26:19.680]  joe begs will join us with others uh with the others that went through this but i looked at the laws
[26:19.680 --> 26:26.160]  i looked at quote the signs they have that just say state land don't no trespass don't you know
[26:26.160 --> 26:34.800]  you know secure area not offense just right there by a major town and just says state land so
[26:36.080 --> 26:38.960]  they then talk to them about what they're doing they go oh we're down here with some cameras to
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.200]  catch the illegals coming across hidden cameras oh come show us where they are and then you go show
[26:43.200 --> 26:49.200]  them and they arrest you and it is an arrest when they take your firearms and put handcuffs on you
[26:49.200 --> 26:53.440]  and you put your arms up and uh hold you for two hours and then and then and then take your firearms
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.320]  because god forbid a slave have a gun you know only these government bureaucrats out there acting
[26:58.320 --> 27:05.200]  tough and their snake leggings can have them and i'll tell you why they're upset the footage that
[27:05.200 --> 27:12.720]  begs and others shot of drugs being brought across the Rio Grande nearby this area and talking to
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.320]  the head of the emergency management mr pagan who said don't we're the bore patrol brings them to us
[27:18.320 --> 27:23.040]  the illegals get here we load them on buses give them vouchers they're not tested for disease
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.480]  and then we ship them into the united states we have the border patrol the head of emergency
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.320]  management from mcallin all of it on tape and our news is ends up being on abc news fox news
[27:32.320 --> 27:40.800]  drudge report everywhere and it's congress is now talking about it repeatedly on the campaign
[27:40.800 --> 27:47.680]  trail on national tv donald trump plugs info wars and talks about our footage while he was
[27:47.680 --> 27:54.960]  in el paso the day he was there he came in the afternoon that morning we got the footage
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.560]  of the giant bales of drugs being brought in and for that they now
[28:02.480 --> 28:09.520]  like highwaymen robbed my reporters other firearms let's let's let's start playing the clip for me
[28:09.520 --> 28:15.360]  from from the past with with trump and then right through to today here it is happened so while
[28:15.360 --> 28:21.280]  with it you probably read it it was in drudge who's great by the way drudge is amazing but the story
[28:21.280 --> 28:28.400]  in drudge and big story it's all over the place now guys swimming across and big bags of stuff
[28:28.400 --> 28:36.480]  strikes swimming across the river right swimming right across and they put the drugs and actually
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.680]  the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.160]  because they're showing this on camera the guys carrying bags of stuff it was drugs
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.120]  so what happened to today in particular is that the border patrol dropped off some they
[28:55.120 --> 29:00.800]  couldn't detainees but obviously they're not detained after they dropped them off and normally
[29:00.800 --> 29:06.320]  they have tickets for a range transportation to go somewhere in the interior well today you know hit
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.640]  stop right there because there's more of this some of them didn't have had transit i'm gonna come back
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.680]  after breaking just play the whole thing again see they don't want us catching the drugs coming
[29:15.680 --> 29:20.960]  across and they don't want us catching the illegals coming across let me tell the militia and the
[29:20.960 --> 29:26.480]  patriots and the citizen reporters stuff going out and apprehending illegals to give them to the
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.800]  board patrol who most of the time are ordered to turn them loose he's doing nothing information

[33:19.520 --> 33:28.560]  okay i'm trying not to get mad because i know that it is the criminal federal government
[33:29.120 --> 33:33.440]  openly run by foreign mega banks i'm about to list here in a moment that are getting rid of our
[33:33.440 --> 33:38.960]  borders bringing us into globalism and using departmentalization do it but we have fought
[33:38.960 --> 33:48.160]  harder than anybody and no one but drudge report dot com and world net daily have picked up the
[33:48.160 --> 33:55.040]  videos you've gotten scores of them of the border patrol loading the illegals men women and children
[33:55.040 --> 34:02.560]  in many cases with drug resistant diseases like tuberculosis on the buses they're flying in
[34:03.600 --> 34:06.320]  refugees from the middle east that are really suny
[34:06.320 --> 34:22.400]  suny pilgrims suny homesteaders suny radical jihad wagon trains it's literally beyond a science
[34:22.400 --> 34:28.640]  fiction movie that it's so massive and they've been covering it up and then thank god it's finally
[34:28.640 --> 34:37.680]  in some news stories today and then our reporters are down at the border super polite super nice friendly
[34:37.680 --> 34:42.240]  body language they know full well who we are already talked to my reporters the day before
[34:42.240 --> 34:52.560]  and then they got the orders to have them put their hands up and then take their firearms off
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.120]  their sides and then steal them and i looked at the law we call the lawyers already knew this
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.200]  for that before i called lawyers you can't sit there and just take people's firearms and make
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.480]  them pay you know 200 and something bucks a piece to get them back i mean this is just such a joke
[35:07.040 --> 35:12.000]  but you know what i'm glad you followed your illegal orders i'm glad you did this dirt bags
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.640]  because let me tell you something you're showing america who you work for now it's one thing if
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.400]  the head of the union comes out and says we're ordered to complete the smuggling process it's
[35:22.400 --> 35:27.520]  illegal congress needs to stop it that person isn't guilty the head of the border patrol union
[35:27.520 --> 35:32.320]  in that sector wanted to talk to us and expose the diseases and how it was illegal
[35:36.880 --> 35:45.520]  but i'm telling you when you follow illegal orders and you confiscate people's camera
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.080]  equipment and go through it and treat us like criminals when you knew all three of those people
[35:50.080 --> 35:53.680]  don't have criminal records and joe biggs is honorably discharged from the u.s army
[35:56.160 --> 36:01.840]  decorated combat vet and that's why he's the enemy you hate us because we're good people exposing
[36:01.840 --> 36:07.600]  the crime against the country and by the way i'm not numb to all this okay i mean it looks like a
[36:07.600 --> 36:16.640]  bad dad bazaar at the at the domain in north austin outdoor mall many nights at the barton
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.320]  creek mall it looks like that the numbers are gotta be over a million folks i mean just austin
[36:22.320 --> 36:28.240]  is crawling now but people just walking down the street full islamic guard women's face is covered up
[36:29.280 --> 36:33.760]  some molly's running around black shooting guns out windows and driving through yards and screaming
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.400]  a la art bar screaming we can rape your women under sharia and people being raped all over and
[36:38.400 --> 36:44.000]  islamic brainwashing camps opening up in high school to quote teach you to accept the islamification
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  and then the women come in and teach islam and they're not covering their faces but at home
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.880]  they're all basically covering their faces up i mean as they come here all this freedom is and
[36:52.880 --> 37:00.160]  then tell us we've got to conform to them and then the state police along with the border patrol
[37:00.160 --> 37:03.920]  and because i've watched a bunch of the videos they're up on info wars.com there's so much of it
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.400]  i we got to go through it all maybe some of the news crew can just dig through it and get me some
[37:08.400 --> 37:11.680]  of the clips for later when joe biggs and crew joins us in about an hour or less
[37:11.680 --> 37:17.280]  but it's all upon info wars.com it's all from the youtube channel we're writing articles about it right
[37:17.280 --> 37:26.880]  now and it really is the war on the press because we're effective just last week we've got the border
[37:26.880 --> 37:34.080]  patrol union head going yes we release 80 under orders we release people that have drug resistant
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.520]  tv skbs all these other diseases it's horrible it's unbelievable and we believe the president should
[37:39.520 --> 37:45.040]  follow the supreme court's ruling and follow the law just a year ago they would arrest border patrol
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.040]  for talking like that but that guy's putting his life on the line his name on the line to tell the
[37:49.040 --> 37:56.080]  truth and by the way our article got almost no coverage drugs linked to it infectious tuberculosis
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.560]  is spreading across the country 22 percent of the islamics being brought in habit according to
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.240]  the associated press and oh but don't worry interpreters needed for schools around the
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.400]  country to take the refugees and they're not even testing them just to see what the government can
[38:12.400 --> 38:19.520]  get away with i want to believe in the state police i want to believe in the border patrol i
[38:19.520 --> 38:23.600]  don't want to go along with the soros line and have some stupid civil war i'm not out to get
[38:23.600 --> 38:30.240]  anybody but i'm going to tell you something when law enforcement follows illegal orders is involved
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.800]  the dereliction of duty just following orders doesn't cut it and when they sit there with this
[38:34.800 --> 38:42.160]  is self assured imperious attitude abusing the press and the first amendment in this country it
[38:42.160 --> 38:51.360]  makes me sick it absolutely just infuriates me but i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna do
[38:55.040 --> 38:56.560]  i'm just going to call on everybody
[38:59.680 --> 39:02.160]  because this is meant to be seen and scared by away from the border
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.040]  and i'm going to call for everybody to go down in press groups organized with your church whatever
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.880]  and just go down there with cameras and show what's going on because they just think we're
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.200]  all going to sit here like cowards and let them cover up what's going on while the board patrol
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.640]  delivers the illegals once they come across the border to three hops and a cot and then they're
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.560]  put on buses in scent wherever they want private buses and they don't like donald trump retweeting
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.920]  our stories retweeting our articles our videos they don't like that they don't like the fact
[39:31.920 --> 39:39.680]  he's exposing it in this election year we're only a few months out july august september october
[39:39.680 --> 39:46.880]  we are like three four months out three and a half months out and they don't want you to see this
[39:46.880 --> 39:51.920]  and so that's one thing of criminal hillary crooked hillary and crooked jihadist obama
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.040]  want to block us i know they're the enemy i know why they're doing it but
[39:55.040 --> 40:04.000]  but when i sit there and i see the state police bugging their eyes out at americans and reporters
[40:04.000 --> 40:12.320]  who've got courage to defend this country and i see your enjoyment at lapdog into the enemies of
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.760]  this country shame on you and shame on your family name you have disgraced your family
[40:17.760 --> 40:27.520]  you are disgraceful disgraceful people you are ashamed to texas and ashamed to the united
[40:27.520 --> 40:31.760]  states of america i know you don't care you think it's funny don't you
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.720]  this country is getting ready to lose everything it's got and everything it ever has
[40:40.320 --> 40:43.760]  and it's traders like you cowards and yes men and women
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.040]  that are the reason this country's going to hell
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.960]  i guess there have been more patrol agents that did their jobs and exposed the guns being shipped
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.240]  down to be shipped al-qaeda that's now confirmed i guess they get killed so i guess you kill a few
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.960]  of them you kill a few of the men and i guess you put in nothing but a bunch of women and look
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.720]  it's on average it's not that women can't have courage it's not it's just known that
[41:08.720 --> 41:17.840]  tyrannies tend to put in women as their enforcers and the most imperious arrogant aggressive people
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.120]  i've ever dealt with in quote law enforcement have almost always been women with chips on their
[41:23.120 --> 41:29.600]  shoulders who thinks they're married to the state like some janet reno
[41:29.600 --> 41:38.960]  got daddy issues but when they violate the first amendment
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.360]  they violate everybody's rights the articles are up on them full wars dot com
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.360]  it's the border patrol sworn job to try to keep the diseases out to try to check and make sure
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.200]  drug dealers and terrorists aren't coming in and they've been ordered three years ago to stand down
[41:59.200 --> 42:01.120]  they blew the whistle so i said great they're doing their job
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.400]  and then we start exposing it in the election cycle and they now want to shut that down
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.560]  there needs to be an investigation congress needs to look into what's happening and the good news is
[42:18.560 --> 42:21.040]  they tried to three years ago but now this was even happening
[42:21.040 --> 42:29.520]  well guess what now it's all being exposed just last week jacari got the key interview that's up
[42:29.520 --> 42:32.880]  on him full wars dot com i'm gonna retweet it this is what they don't want you to know this is
[42:32.880 --> 42:38.480]  what our reporters have been arrested for border agent that's head border agent head of the union
[42:38.480 --> 42:44.560]  in that sector vast majority of illegals released in the country disease or no disease and you know
[42:44.560 --> 42:50.080]  that's a fine headline but the real headline is border patrol we are ordered to release illegals
[42:50.080 --> 42:58.880]  with diseases boom and and hillary's already above the law
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.600]  obama's above the law and allowed to just erase the borders outside of even violating law
[43:06.320 --> 43:13.280]  and then now the board patrol violates because they put up signs saying state property outside
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.960]  mcallin if you're there cane pull fishing they don't come and arrest you that stuff doesn't stand up
[43:18.960 --> 43:22.800]  hundred mile zones into the country that they call constitution free zones where they claim
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.280]  they can search citizens cars but the illegals just get given a flying carpet bus ticket out
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.840]  that's why i'm not even so much for a wall because they'll just use the wall to keep us
[43:35.840 --> 43:42.880]  in and they'll just be an entrance for everybody else to come in but let's play the clip
[43:42.880 --> 43:50.320]  but from just last week and last year of what they don't want you to see and why
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.800]  they're persecuting our reporters this administration has persecuted more reporters
[43:55.680 --> 44:01.680]  than anybody in us history that's even liberal publications admit that and that's what they're
[44:01.680 --> 44:08.000]  doing and there's nothing more oppressive and nothing that doesn't spell doom for a nation's
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.360]  future like people in paramilitary uniforms harassing the press while they aid and abed
[44:15.360 --> 44:23.040]  the crimes of the president in front of everyone i want to open the phones up to former board of
[44:23.040 --> 44:28.240]  patrol or current people or ice or customs agents am i wrong hey i don't screen your calls just
[44:28.240 --> 44:35.200]  just be legitimate call in am i wrong should i not be upset about this and i'm telling you
[44:35.200 --> 44:39.520]  everybody needs to go down to the borders i mean they got areas 50 miles in arizona where
[44:39.520 --> 44:43.200]  they got signs saying don't go under these areas the cartels control it how did that happen
[44:46.880 --> 44:54.080]  i want to hear from you the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599-231
[44:55.920 --> 44:59.840]  but our country is collapsing and it's by design if we don't have borders we don't have a nation
[45:00.800 --> 45:03.760]  and i'm going to get joe begs and the rest of the crew i'm going to call savage this is the
[45:03.760 --> 45:07.120]  type of thing savage only call him every six months say hey you might want to have somebody on about
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.960]  this and he generally goes absolutely that's big news i think michael savage with his giant audience
[45:10.960 --> 45:17.200]  they need to know that they're now arresting reporters and and taking their firearms because
[45:17.200 --> 45:24.720]  they're putting out information like this it was joe begs and our crew i want to give credit to
[45:24.720 --> 45:27.920]  so many videos i don't know who was down there with him last year when he got all this that that
[45:27.920 --> 45:32.080]  was a don salazar and zimmerman or was it matt who's old now i'm not sure you know shooting this
[45:32.080 --> 45:38.240]  this is on a major highway right on the border and then we've got all this other footage this week
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.640]  of people coming across and the board patrol taking them to the bus station shipping them out
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.440]  they don't want those felonies on tape well guess what it was josh with the bags of drugs it was it
[45:47.440 --> 45:50.960]  was it was josh owens got that footage and my crew is great they're on about credit i just want
[45:50.960 --> 45:58.800]  to give it words too our feds arrest reporters articles now red linked on drudge so we'll put
[45:58.800 --> 46:02.960]  that up see drudge do you know i keep plugging drudge because drudge is one of the only places
[46:02.960 --> 46:09.040]  that helps us break through stuff that affects everyone in this country top left corner feds
[46:09.040 --> 46:17.760]  arrest press reporting on open border agent government completing smuggling cycle free
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.000]  legals see drudge totally gets it i went to my reporters this morning and i said i want you to
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.440]  pull up all the old articles how they're completing the smuggling process uh how he's got a program
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.360]  with major corporations obama does to ship the illegals and i went on one article drudge just
[46:31.360 --> 46:38.560]  did it right there separately without ever even talking to him drudge gets it feds arrest press
[46:38.560 --> 46:43.840]  for reporting on open border that's our article under an agent government completing smuggling
[46:43.840 --> 46:51.040]  cycle free legals that was fox news like let's cue that up let's get that clip again muslim camps
[46:51.040 --> 46:57.200]  spread in us not just the physical camps teaching kids how to be muslims in public schools you cannot
[46:57.200 --> 47:08.320]  make it up more tb spreading refugee crisis but most of them are jobless oh my god i i just i just
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.880]  cannot believe it so here's the deal congress needs to have criminal investigations of obama
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.040]  violate the supreme court and ordering the border patrol to complete the smuggling process
[47:19.040 --> 47:23.040]  all the heads of ice and the border patrol the head people are open globalist need to be brought in
[47:23.040 --> 47:28.160]  and grilled about how they're ordered by obama and all those emails need to be released and we
[47:28.160 --> 47:34.240]  need to literally use this to defeat crooked hillary oh that's why and i want to just tell
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.280]  the border patrol something most of you are really good people and you stuck your neck out
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.000]  to give us the information two years ago that obama had ordered a total stand down once we
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.240]  did that drudge picked it up it forced fox news and then even the new york times you admit it okay
[47:48.240 --> 47:55.600]  so i'm not saying you're all horrible people and i support you in your constitutional duty
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.400]  you've been under attack but my god when you see a benedict arnold it's kind of like this i
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.680]  loved our continental army that battled the british but if i attack benedict arnold it
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.640]  doesn't mean i'm saying george washington's bad benedict arnold was a traitor and these people
[48:10.640 --> 48:18.480]  are harassing our reporters and stealing their equipment illegally
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.800]  i just i just i don't i'm not even mad at you i am disgusted with you
[48:28.480 --> 48:33.440]  and i know you think it's funny i know it's all funny to you people it's not funny what's going on
[48:33.440 --> 48:43.680]  the country is being dismantled in front of everyone most countries have already collapsed
[48:43.680 --> 48:49.200]  into depressions we're in a depression you think this government's going to take care of your grandma
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.320]  your daddy or whatever in the nursing home when everything collapses no it's not the only thing
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.480]  we're going to do is save this country that's the only shot we've got is to stabilize the nation
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.760]  the globalists are trying to implode it they're trying to cause a civil war they're trying to cause
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.880]  absolute insurrection the streets they are financing movements to shoot police
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.040]  in cold-blooded murder taking the sad examples of where cops are the wrong thing and magnifying it
[49:15.040 --> 49:20.640]  and the cops are doing the wrong thing and being bullied by the political correct system to run around
[49:20.640 --> 49:25.520]  and harass liberty lovers worldwide and cleveland's we had to sue them twice trying to block us having
[49:25.520 --> 49:32.800]  permanent demonstrations in cleveland i mean it's just disgusting to watch the red carpet rolled out
[49:32.800 --> 49:45.600]  for tyranny i'ma skip this network break right here please support our local sponsors and the
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.680]  network sponsors too or their um hear me plug something that's talk about something that's

[49:52.560 --> 49:58.480]  and that's how we find the finances operation um i'm going to tell you now and people always have
[49:58.480 --> 50:05.520]  been coming through it if you buy enough hillary for prison shirts i'll uh put aircraft over dc

[50:41.920 --> 50:48.960]  answer to this and uh we're gonna start following the state police and we're gonna start following
[50:48.960 --> 50:54.640]  the uh board patrol because we know you've been ordered at least the board patrol to engage in
[50:54.640 --> 50:59.040]  these crimes um they've been supportive of the governor sending more state police down there
[50:59.040 --> 51:06.320]  but all they seem to want to do is harass citizens uh and so okay fine um we're i mean i i'm i'm
[51:06.320 --> 51:09.840]  i'm just we've already we're already down there every month but we're going to be all over the
[51:09.840 --> 51:17.600]  border and um i'll i'll probably just hire video stringers from the local tv stations in fact that's
[51:17.600 --> 51:22.400]  the move i'm gonna hire tv stringers in mcallin they know all the rows and everybody i'm gonna hire
[51:22.400 --> 51:30.400]  them in um they'll pass though and other i'm doing it i'm doing it and so just just buy the products
[51:30.400 --> 51:35.200]  everybody you need them they're the best price and i want to fight tyranny and uh we're gonna send
[51:35.200 --> 51:38.400]  our reporters down there and i'm gonna go down there after the rnc i've got that come up we can
[51:38.400 --> 51:45.600]  have two weeks hard to believe that's already here uh and i will go to the border and i'm gonna go to
[51:45.600 --> 51:48.800]  the board patrol i'm gonna go to the state police headquarters and i'm just gonna and they're gonna
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.480]  probably act like i'm a devil or something that i dare oh we got an evil american here the things
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.640]  he's got a free speech you know they're probably taser me or something fine i'm set up i'm tired
[51:56.640 --> 52:07.200]  of it what is your problem what is your problem snap out of it snap out of it info wars couple with
[52:07.200 --> 52:14.000]  drudge report dot com is the number one source exposing the treason and we've the supreme court
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.240]  is ruled it's illegal we have the law on our side all we're doing is defending our country treat us
[52:20.240 --> 52:30.320]  with respect get off our backs i expect bad stuff out of hillary and george soros and the rest of
[52:30.320 --> 52:37.600]  them not out of you stop it i'll tell you really disgrace is all the board patrol agents they've
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.840]  killed for exposing this and the board patrol people that have gotten reprimanded in trouble
[52:41.840 --> 52:46.240]  and you know what they're doing they're going more on tv and more on the show and and and see
[52:46.240 --> 52:51.120]  and and and you know what i look at those men compared to the other little goons and you are
[52:51.120 --> 52:56.080]  pathetic i guarantee you those people that reach out to us wouldn't be arresting our reporters
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.680]  they'd be telling them where to go where to expose the crime how to stop it
[53:01.680 --> 53:08.400]  i'm man i'm angry i am sick of this i am i'm beyond that
[53:11.280 --> 53:16.160]  but i'll tell you why this country is in big trouble people have lost the instinct to get
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.120]  angry at being violated they've lost the instinct to stand up for themselves they've lost basic
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.600]  self-preservation instincts but it doesn't take a majority to change things and i don't tell the
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.480]  story because i'm some hero because believe me i'm not perfect but i grew up in a family where
[53:32.480 --> 53:36.720]  we help people change tires and when our neighbor's house on fire you know we help take a man and
[53:36.720 --> 53:42.480]  stuff for basic stuff because we want to be treated like that too and i'll never forget the lady choking
[53:43.600 --> 53:46.640]  at the le matalan restaurant with my wife when we had one child at a time
[53:48.640 --> 53:51.840]  and i come out of the bathroom and this woman is turning purple hunts over the table and they're
[53:51.840 --> 53:59.040]  like 20 30 people saying call 911 call 911 like parents either of the cops got there in three
[53:59.040 --> 54:05.600]  four minutes she'd be dead it takes four minutes to fix you and i said do the heimlich who knows
[54:05.600 --> 54:11.520]  the heimlich and this man goes wait for the police and of course i was on swim team and stuff in
[54:11.520 --> 54:16.000]  junior high and high school so i i'd taken all that with the fire department and i said i'm gonna
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.360]  give her the heimlich and i got in there and gave her the heimlich the big piece of bread came out
[54:19.360 --> 54:25.600]  she went from purple to you know red and then they started saying oh you're a hero you're a hero
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.720]  and then i heard one person say is she okay did he hurt you see that's that's how these people are
[54:30.720 --> 54:36.800]  don't just not help her but then did i hurt her i mean she was like a 200 pound woman i picked her
[54:36.800 --> 54:40.640]  up because the first couple pulls didn't get it out of her and i said let's get out of her before
[54:40.640 --> 54:45.920]  we get sued and you know that's what's happening to our society and that's what's going on and

[56:10.880 --> 56:15.760]  they are and and poot's like we need to stop this this is we need to have a serious discussion about
[56:15.760 --> 56:25.760]  this so things are escalating and everybody needs to really get shaken out of their stupor and out
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.800]  of their mind numb robot status that's all i'm saying now before i go any further and we're
[56:30.800 --> 56:33.760]  going to beef that article up because it was just the first thing we put out in their first video

[57:05.280 --> 57:11.760]  that's not all it's available at infowarstore.com but the x2 is the good halogen our bodies are
[57:11.760 --> 57:17.360]  full of the chlorine the bromine the bromide the fluoride and the good halogen will fill up your
[57:17.360 --> 57:23.920]  glands like your thyroid that way your glands don't absorb the bad stuff and you just pass it out
[57:23.920 --> 57:30.080]  that's basically a way to boil it down unscientifically you know see the science read the
[57:30.080 --> 57:36.720]  articles see the informational videos at infowarstore.com and if you have it tried x2 and haven't
[57:36.720 --> 57:43.680]  detoxed with it just just just search engine iqs went up 15 points from government added iodine
[57:43.680 --> 57:50.320]  to salt then they took it back out 15 point increases i mean i mean that's just one thing my
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.960]  skin changed i lost weight i had more energy i did get more aggressive so your physician before
[57:54.960 --> 57:59.040]  you take it this is there's no other real iodine like this than i found this is the true nascent
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.840]  iodine the other stuff is just garbage poison in my view uh that's why they say don't ingest the
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.600]  stuff you get at the grocery store you put it on topically is this effective it's excellent
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.960]  but no this is totally different read about it why it's proprietary infowarslife.com or call toll

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:18.320]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of the information
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:28.240]  or it's alex jones
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.680]  you know my job is a lot smaller 10 years ago 15 years ago we could open the phones up specifically
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:43.040]  for marines army current activity border patrol homeland security we could open the phones up at
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.120]  a university where something was happening we'd have callers and people shooting video for us
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.840]  but now because the show is much larger and folks know about the nsa and there's this culture of
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.840]  fears you see all just that kook alex says they're tracking everybody uh and you know
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.640]  they're in the da's doing parallel construction setting people up oh yeah now that it's all out
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.200]  confirmed in zuckerberg says cover up your webcam and then you know the smart teens are watching you
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.000]  it's like oh alex i run into cops all the time listen we can't call in what am i getting trouble
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.040]  you're going to lose everything if you get in this national security attitude where your free speech
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.520]  doesn't exist because you're a secret agent and can't talk about how obama ordered you to
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.640]  have the border open we've not had one board patrol agent call in or eyes or customs person
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.960]  and a regular day we got board patrol calling in um deep former dea people you name it but see notice
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:37.360]  today because they know i mean obama's up there threatening everybody not to talk about his crimes
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.480]  and i and i guess at a certain point you know we just roll over and that's the end of the country
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.200]  and then follow the orders to go out and persecute the press because they're not cowards because
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.440]  they're willing to come down and cover what's going on our reporters are coming on
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:00.880]  at the bottom of the hour to break all this down stories up on drudgereport.com feds arrest
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:07.200]  press reporting on open border info or journal is disarmed and held by federal agents and we
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.880]  probably add the headline for two hours and we're told they were under arrest there's a lot of the
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.200]  video and there's the video the day before the state police run up behind them almost hit them
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.720]  then they pull over and talk to them nicely it's like what what are you doing we're just here
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.920]  yeah we got hidden cameras down here and we're you know the motion cameras and we're getting people
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.800]  coming across we're getting drugs coming across and that's what again they're scared of i'm gonna go
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.760]  out to break with what they're scared of this is the this is our crew exposing drugs exposing
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.000]  illegals and the board patrol completing the smuggling process here it is happened so while
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.520]  with it you probably read it it was in drudge who's great by the way drudge is amazing but the
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:54.320]  story in drudge and big story it's all over the place now guys swimming across and big bags of
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:02.640]  stuff drugs swimming across the river right swimming right across and they put the drugs
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.840]  and actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.800]  be killed because they're showing this on camera the guys carrying bags of stuff it was drugs
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.520]  what happened to today in particular is that the board of patrol dropped off some
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.960]  they call them detainees but obviously they're not detained after they dropped them off and
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.240]  normally they have tickets or arrange transportation to go somewhere in the interior well today
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.680]  apparently for some logistical reasons some of them didn't hadn't had transportation arranged
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.960]  or their transportation is tomorrow right and so we're having to find places to shelter
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.200]  for tonight so we've accessed some resources that we have we're going to shelter here so
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.040]  why is the board of patrol bringing them here they're not bringing them here they're bringing
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.680]  them to our bus terminal because that's where the board of patrol understands that they have
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.800]  transportation to go to the interior right so they're dropping them off it's our understanding
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.880]  what they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets um turns out some of them
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.160]  didn't tonight didn't have their ticket or didn't have their voucher or like i said their buses until
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.840]  tomorrow so they got nowhere to stay our bus terminal buyers i mean the city of mcowland
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.280]  bus terminal is not a 24-7 operation right so we've got to put them up somewhere else so for
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.640]  tonight we're doing the best we can with this resource which thankfully one of our neighboring
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.880]  cities right available to us and we're going to put them up here tonight tomorrow we'll have a
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.040]  little chat with the board of patrol all right there's more when we come back this is our new
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.280]  footage from last week as people pour in the board patrol gets them and then takes them takes them
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.480]  to get food takes them whatever doesn't do a medical exam throws them on private buses pays for it bye
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.880]  bye and the board of patrol is desperate at least the board patrol following obama's orders are
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.840]  desperate to cover up the crime the rest of the board of patrol is blowing the whistle on it so it's
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:06.720]  wow we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.160]  by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.600]  of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.800]  powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.280]  these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and institute new government
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:36.720]  independence isn't a day it's a mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent i will
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.960]  not be your slave dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:49.680]  infringements when you trade your liberty for safety to that extent you become their slave slaves
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.800]  are never safe you won't get rich by being a slave guard your liberty regard with suspicion anyone
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.920]  who tries to take it for ever wars dot com i'm david night last week we pointed out the globalists
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:10.160]  have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide when the british left the euro
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.560]  the globalists decided to go into high gear they've now announced that hillary won't be indicted no
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.120]  matter how many crimes she commits it's time for us to take our matters into our own hands the globalist
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.400]  warfare model is siege it wants to make us dependent it wants to cut off our economies it wants to be
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:29.360]  able to set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages that are already happening
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.200]  in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to our knees and where we could pitch
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.320]  like their demands that's why we're extending the july 4th sale right through next week because
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.680]  it's all about declaring your independence from the globalist you don't just declare independence
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.640]  when you buy high quality storeable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at infowarstore.com
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.440]  you declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.200]  illegal orders to complete the smuggling process and by the way they're finding the clip from fox
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.480]  news where one of the board patrol senior agents said that a few years ago just weeks after our
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:01.360]  reporters were tipped off jacari jackson and don salazar kit daniels to go down to the border
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.760]  and actually show the illegals being loaded on buses and shipped into the us now i want to go over

[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:08.320]  trip advisor western union the call initiative is not only to help refugees united states but all
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.880]  over the world this is the un organizing them that's why the former founder
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:23.520]  of the eu peter southerland took the junior job of being over migrants refugees and resettlement
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:31.440]  because that's the globalist weapon system now and jihadis make perfect little time bombs
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:42.160]  so continuing in europe for example mastercard worked with mercy corpse to distribute prepaid
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.920]  debit cards the eligible refugees traveling through syria to get to western europe approximately
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.320]  75 000 was distributed to nearly 400 families individuals this is just some little minor thing
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.600]  they mentioned the three main facets of the private partnership program are education that means
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.240]  organizing them into socialist brigades employment you're taking your job driving on wages and
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  enablement getting them into government getting them in power and then it goes through education
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.600]  means facilitating refugee children and young adults educating and ensuring that refugee
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.840]  students can access schools at all levels like here in austin my alma mater 230 plus
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.520]  at the high school the employment facet includes increasing employment opportunities for refugees
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.520]  i remember an ap article like 10 years ago that i hammered and it was the national banking
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:36.000]  association saying we're going to give illegals bank loans that citizens don't get just just
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.320]  because they're special we're going to do it just basically fake loans again to incentivize bringing
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.360]  people in to drive down wages and when and when they don't pay up the government then comes in and
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:55.200]  bells that out they're just using the illegals as kind of a cut out to run government funds through
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.600]  but most of it goes to these select corporations and private groups managing it i mean you know
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.520]  how much money the catholic church is getting to house the illegals all over the united states
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.440]  they're getting government money under the faith base initiative billions look it up
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.640]  but pope frances has big walls and won't anybody into where he lives
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.120]  by the way joe bigs i was listening all the stuff our reporters have done
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.720]  because nobody else will do their job
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:32.080]  and i was thinking about bigs and our crew driving in to an area over the border from el
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.160]  paso that is said to be the most dangerous place in mexico maybe the world the whole movies
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.040]  that just came out with josh brolin that's so incredibly accurate according to my sources
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:50.320]  uh sacaria which i guess means hitman if i'm pronouncing it right he is based right over the
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.080]  border there they went in there was the mosque sure enough it's now been confirmed the fbi was
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.960]  waiting at the airport saying thank you so much for what you did we need to debrief you we we're
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.560]  not even allowed to go over there it's so dangerous you have any idea how dangerous that was our crew
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:11.120]  is doing things that is a serious service to this country and i by the way they're putting their
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.760]  lives on the line and you need your support and prayers and i tell them not to stick their neck
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.520]  out too far but bigs you know has been a lot of combat and stuff and wants to do it so he's
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.600]  been over the border and i mean in the most dangerous areas and a year later it was confirmed
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.200]  yes there is isis in that area they're coming across isis said they do that and then after we
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.440]  broke that the head of south com came out and said we know thousands of isis are coming through
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.680]  the caribbean and then through mexico and then through texas for south com
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.600]  in full wars with that story the judicial watch and others picked up the drudge picked up
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.600]  forced that out south com came out the fbi then came out and said yes this is credible
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.800]  and then of course it gets shut down politically
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.880]  so our reporters that we just joined us were arrested yesterday and treated like criminals
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:14.800]  for more than two hours for doing their job outside mcallin texas and the state police
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.280]  with the feds are claiming quote they were trespassing but oh we're not going to charge you
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.440]  because down the road there's a sign saying state property no fences no nothing by the
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.320]  real grand river yeah we live here too it's like it's some state preserve you know where you've
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.680]  walled it off and then you leave you have to give the public access but you can make them pay five
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:37.040]  dollars you're just declaring it's yours kind of obama declares the borders open and declares
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.880]  he'll continue you know shipping people in even in the supreme court says this is illegal
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.760]  so kind of like chicago in places say we don't care what the supreme court says about guns we're
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.440]  still banning them and it just goes on and on and on look at zimmerman
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.120]  with these ridiculous border patrol agents and state police
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.840]  what a joke hey well guess what you failed and your boss failed obama failed and hillary
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:15.280]  failed the info is getting out and i hope trump picks up on this too and we're going to add a video
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.680]  that that do put together of why they don't want us there this is why they don't want us there the
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.280]  fbi is getting the information we're forcing the fact that isis is there we're forcing the fact
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.960]  that the border patrols been ordered to complete the smuggling process and causing a national debate
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.520]  we're exposing the just huge floods of Hondurans nicaraguans folks from china you name it are just
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.640]  pouring across and you know what the war patrol knows i guarantee that saying god forbid upwards of
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:46.480]  10 percent are from china and the middle east oh my god and some of them are even criminal europeans
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.520]  what is going to happen when 80 percent are getting through and these reporters that have
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.640]  a line to drudge and a line to world net daily or else and a line to you tens of millions of
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:05.680]  listeners get alex jones's crew out of there well listen i promise you we're going to have reporters
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.360]  and we're going to have crew we're going to have clandestine stringers that just means local news
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:17.680]  people that we pay on the side to get us footage i mean you're not going to stop anything and i
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.320]  think i'm going to have a first amendment rally down at the border coming up i mean it's my country
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:29.600]  right i can go down there and show the trees and right what do you as citizens what do you as
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.040]  listeners think about this situation we're what do you think we should do about it because here's
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:38.400]  the deal we're having a big effect this is great news but but how do we go further to take action
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.280]  open phones but i'd like to hear from people that have worked in the state the board patrol state
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:50.000]  police i mean how i'm not wrong saying this is outrageous there it is top general says mexico
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.280]  border security now existential threat to us looking to congress for urgent help the top
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.040]  the united states general in charge of protecting the southern border says he's been able to combat
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.280]  the steady flow of illegal drugs weapons and people from central america and is looking for
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.640]  congress yeah that's not it that's it's not marine court general it's it's it's it's the head of south
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.960]  com you just type in head of south com says ice is coming into the caribbean getting into us it
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.640]  was two years ago it's okay i'll find it in the break that's why we always pull up for some reason
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.560]  that that's that's another one this is particularly ices but we did find the clip this is from fox
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.480]  news in case you don't believe cbs and the board patrol this is hanity two years ago after we forced
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.720]  all this out with drudge it's not about credit it's understanding if other press would go down and
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.280]  cover this it'd be a national issue we could turn this around and fix it they have to keep it in the
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.920]  dark they have to keep it secret so here's the board patrol agent talking about how they complete
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.320]  the smuggling process um sounds like that they're supposed to be protecting this border you mean
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.400]  aiding and abetting what do you mean specifically actually what's happening is that the federal
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.840]  government is actually completing the smuggling cycle by having a power and sending their their
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:08.160]  child to the u.s. border have them having them smuggled that is only part of the smuggling cycle
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.320]  then it comes to the federal government steps in we apprehend them we process these illegal
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.320]  agents and then we release them to their to their family members in the u.s. we just completed that
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.120]  smuggling cycle now why would anybody want to hire a smuggler when the u.s. government is actually
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.040]  doing it for free so in other words when when your agents put their lives on the line and they're
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:33.360]  sometimes a violent incidents and they do their job all right that's that's after they still end
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.720]  up staying does that what does what does that do to the the psyche that's Hector Garcia
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.640]  bucking the crime syndicate they've murdered board patrol agents to talk about this
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.840]  they fired them they've done administrative hatchet jobs on them that's a real man right there
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:56.800]  that's a patriot that's the opposite of the thug like people that our reporters were accosted
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:03.520]  and illegally detained and legally arrested that's official oppression if you ever wanted a great

[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.000]  the fact that there is an admitted plan to persecute the board patrol ice agents and others
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.160]  that try to expose the fact they've been ordered to illegally open the board it took us years to
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.640]  get people to even know this was going on now the supreme court ruled obama is just flaunting it
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:26.480]  and now they've gone further to harass the press and arrest my reporters because they're so effective
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.600]  and they're all over national news well guess what you're going to get the opposite response to what
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:38.400]  you did legal action unfortunately which i don't want to mess with i'm not out to get you but when
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.200]  you're out to get the first amendment we're going to stand up don't tread on me and we're going to
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.120]  now i guarantee it double or triple the amount of reporters on the board i mean because this is
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.240]  ongoing the globalist will probably when a republican gets in if it didn't trump or or or
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.680]  you know if trump doesn't know what's going on they'll probably leave the board open i mean
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:03.520]  it's just crazy it's just crazy and i'm not giving up right when people are ready to wake
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:10.800]  up and take action mark denis dan rob jim uh mark wants to comment uh on the situation from arizona
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:19.440]  go ahead alex i think i'm just about as pissed off as you are out here in arizona there's a law in
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:27.360]  the books and i'm sure there's something similar in texas that any law enforcement officer prosecutor
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:34.960]  judge or anybody in between is committing a major felony by the suppression of any information
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:42.640]  evidence etc leading to a prosecution in a criminal case now i think that
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.640]  biggs and your other reporters are probably being leaned on to get that's right because it's not just
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.280]  official oppression when they're trying to block people exposing a crime there's all sorts of
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:01.680]  statutes dealing on that it's on the tip of my tongue it's uh yeah i know it's going to pop in
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:05.920]  there in a minute but but obviously it's a big deal when you've got real reporters that are
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.720]  national reporters that are the real deal being very nice and you're arresting them
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:16.960]  and you're in their face you are really involved in some bad activity when i uh get into town so
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.000]  i get on the internet i'll try and look it up in texas law and i'll uh send it to your tips line
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.080]  but people need to understand that there's a whole series of laws for the average citizen
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:35.280]  to protect themselves and it's called citizens arrest and uh here it's pretty extensive in
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.400]  arizona i'm not sure how it is i mean there's a right to resist there's a there's a castle deal
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.800]  and and they try to make people forget this is happening or going on but this is everybody's
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.840]  right i mean the police as well as a citizen uh that's how citizens are able to arrest people
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.240]  or stop people or bring people in or citizens can bring any legals they file on their property
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.840]  that's your right and and there it's in every state if a cop is mentally ill or a dog catcher
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.640]  and is attacking you or or or going crazy of course you have a right to defend yourself
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.360]  i mean that's there it's it's codified in law and they have articles all the time demonizing
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:16.240]  uh you know folks that talk about that but but it's a reality here's my issue it's illegal
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.280]  what obama's doing it's been ruled by the supreme court we've documented it we're the people that
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:28.160]  documented okay again it's not about the credit we're being persecuted because we're willing to go
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.480]  do it and put our names on it when nobody else does you look at the other reporters for other
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.120]  great sites like breitbart uh and some of the others they will not most of them put their names
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.840]  on it because it's dangerous and i understand why um they've got a few people that that do it with
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.920]  breitbart texas is we've got a lot of you know so what you want about them but you know they have
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.880]  some courage to be down there and it's the same thing for for daily caller so it's not about the
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.400]  credit it's about the fact that we have a giant audience on radio tv and internet drudge is the
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.440]  biggest thing out there and links to our key stories so we're being persecuted and suppressed
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.680]  and it's a big deal great points mark denison texas says he's a retired federal contractor
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:12.000]  with info on the border what's your view on this uh alex i think you guys have been doing a great
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.920]  job down there you've uh shown the spotlight on uh what the situation is here you're you're you're not
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:27.520]  really um reporters or journalists you're actually activists um i think that's the the reason no you're
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.840]  right we're desperate americans that didn't run the white flag up to the world government you're right
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.600]  exactly and that's why they're so afraid of you because you're not playing by the rules
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.840]  okay but you need help i think that because the united states is being attacked the reason they're
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:50.800]  being attacked right now and overrun by moslems is because we're we're a christian nation that
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.720]  promotes capitalism that's been very very successful they can't compete with us exactly
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.160]  they got to bring us down because world government and collectivism can't compete with americana
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:10.400]  and they have to destroy it and the two ways to destroy it is to is to cow the cow the christians
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:17.680]  and and destroy the fundamentals of capitalism by over regulating everything and overrun us with
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.560]  with with muslims and then make every school teach muslim awareness kiss their butt day
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:29.360]  in some new political correctness crud i don't think that these people i i lived and worked in
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:36.960]  in the middle east for 18 years i'm going to tell you americans you don't know what's coming

[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.400]  but we've seen unlimited persecution at record levels of the press by obama
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.800]  persecution of whistleblowers that expose corruption we've even seen leftist publications come out
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.480]  and admit that obama is many times worse than bush or any other president in history at this
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:08.320]  and now we've seen our incredible reporters people like joe biggs and and and but on salazar
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.840]  and car jackson and just the kit daniels the whole great crew that goes down there
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:19.360]  to the texas arizona new mexico and california border and we interview the border patrol we
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.960]  interview them with their faces blurred out we interview the ice ages we interview the heads
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.760]  of the unions these are good americans some of the best people out there saying we've been ordered
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.680]  to do illegal things we don't like it i played the clip earlier cbs news fox news border patrol
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.080]  saying we're ordered to complete the smuggling process congress please stop it supreme court
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:44.000]  stop it well they've said stop it it's been ruled illegal it was already illegal obama
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  continues it so now our reporters start going down there every week to mcallin and el paso and
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.640]  other areas and man suddenly the state police and the border patrol are after them they arrested them
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.160]  and put their hands up for two hours took their guns made them pay to get them back we look that's
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:10.960]  outside of law my reporters were basically bushwhack they're robbed just because you got a badge and a
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.040]  gun doesn't mean you're god and they claim oh well we just say this whole border area state property
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.120]  it doesn't say no trespassing and i looked it up this is total power grab but why not obama's
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:28.480]  already outside the law doing this obama's already ignoring congress why not so that's why i'm so
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:34.720]  upset about this but the good news is dredgerport.com top red link with all the links under it cbs news
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:40.640]  you name it in fact let's take that handy clip out of fox and put it on youtube and just add the
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.120]  clip itself for the border patrol agency and we complete the smuggling process and and add that
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.960]  to the end of the clip where jacari's talking to the emergency manager and he says the border
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.840]  patrol ships them in puts them on buses gives them vouchers and lets them go with diseases
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.320]  and then the border patrol union had last week telling us the same thing and and donald trump
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.040]  showing josh owens and bigs getting the drugs being shipped across and the big national news
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:10.400]  and and say this is why they're arresting our reporters because they don't want you to know
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.800]  they need to haul obama's butt in front of congress and haul his attorney general that's
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.560]  running all this before congress and the head eyes and say it's illegal stop it and now you just
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:29.760]  won't stop the illegals you let the diseases in but you're arresting reporters so i'm going to
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:34.160]  go to begs and to your calls and i want to get zimmerman's take and ellie's take you know we're
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.920]  a little bit shoveled us here she's a lady she speaks great Spanish she wanted to go down there
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.080]  she went down there that's why i don't like sending ladies down there but i guess we're being you know
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.000]  modern so you put the women in the in the combat situation uh but i don't want to say her last name
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.080]  and expose her because the cartels aren't very nice people they've now started chopping women's
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:57.920]  heads off down there but again they just don't want you to know this is going on it's insane
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:03.600]  but it's a national news story now so they failed to get this out just recap what happened what
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:09.200]  unfolded for people uh joe begs encapsulate this because from watching your videos and seeing it
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.040]  well you guys film a lot of this literally took your cameras
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.960]  like you were talking to them you said what you were going to do they came and sit there while
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.280]  you're doing and acting like you're doing something wrong and then they grab you and your cameras
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.320]  and then made you pay the money later to supposedly try to get your firearms or have you gotten
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.840]  the firearms yet there's a lot we don't know uh joe begs info wars dot com reporter uh you're now

[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.800]  uh the border patrol so break this down joe begs joe begs here with info wars dot com now we're at

[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.400]  that's plain and clear what you see police do in mexico okay okay okay start over start over i
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.120]  didn't realize it was this bad oh my god so you're like by mcallon at the border where there's people
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.880]  everywhere folks fishing you name it and they're saying press can't be there and they've actually
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.120]  charged you i didn't know that start over walk through what happened joe so this is what happened
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.760]  yesterday we went out to the border early in the morning we went and took the sd cards out of the
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.240]  tree cams where we had set up cameras you can go buy cabela's you know for hunters set those up so
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.880]  we could kind of monitor the the traffic throughout the night because we got there late the other night
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.320]  come back in the morning pull the cards we're heading out to leave and a state police officer
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.120]  stops us and goes you can't be here and that's the video that we have up on twitter where the cops
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.720]  go and hey you can't be here this is trespassing so we were just like all right whatever we're
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:08.080]  leaving so we took off the vehicle turned around and chased us out of there sped up got right on
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.040]  our bumper after we were 100 yards away from him he sped up behind us and then chased us off to
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.360]  there stayed on the road and we pulled off and went on to the main road the paved road well
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.920]  we're sitting here going well we have cameras down there we need to go get them so we called the local
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.880]  dps department we actually went to the location here the department of public safety and got a
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:33.520]  number for a police officer we contacted that police officer the state police and he drove us he met us
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:38.000]  at the area where we left our outside where we left our cameras and he followed us in all the way
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.400]  out there he then gets out of his vehicle and goes this is public property you can be here
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.280]  they were wrong telling you that we're trespassing we have this on camera a border patrol vehicle
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.480]  pulls up alex he gets out and he goes yeah you're fine man if you need anything let me know if you
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.800]  see any families coming across the border let us know and he said just make sure that you're
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.600]  careful this is a bad area bad people do come over it's not just families that there's you know
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:07.680]  older men there's drugs things like that so just be safe when you're out here we said okay thank you
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.640]  for your time the sheriff for the uh texasay police officer drove off the border patrol guy went back
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.640]  and we went on to go check on the other camera real quick to make sure it hadn't been messed with
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.520]  at this point we've been told that we can now stay we don't we're not trespassing anymore
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.160]  and let's be clear the border patrol has wide open borders under obama's order but now they're the
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:32.000]  border patrol telling citizens they're trespassing on on public land by a major town i mean this is
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.240]  just totally ridiculous it's like saying you can't walk by the river in baton rouge it's a public
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.080]  ride away i mean this is so crazy so please continue so we get down to the next camera
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.520]  zimmerman and i step out of the vehicle and uh we start filming a stand-up talking about how
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:53.920]  you know we were told we couldn't be here earlier but now we have police show up and border patrol
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.520]  saying in fact that we could be there within a matter of minutes two vehicles from both directions
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.320]  sped up on us as i was getting back in the vehicle we just finished filming the stand-up
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  and i see the first police vehicle speed at me and slams on brakes and i jump out of the vehicle
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.040]  i was like what's going on uh guys and he goes put your hands up put your hands up and we're like
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.840]  what the hell is going on and next thing you know the other vehicle slams on brakes two other
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.920]  officers get out we're surrounded by four people with their hands at their gun kind of like that
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.720]  and they're telling us to stand back to we don't they're like we don't know if you have firearms
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:31.280]  who are you you're trespassing and i'm sitting there going no we're not trespassing now is this
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.840]  any of the same people from earlier no these are different people now is the state police
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:41.280]  are border patrol no this was the game wardens over game wardens of course there's four different
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:47.840]  entities that watch over this piece of land so they tell us hey does anybody have a firearm
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.320]  Zimmerman's guy went on his side and god game wardens are the absolute worst the female game
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:58.160]  warden comes over and takes and starts yanking on Zimmerman's uh side on his holster she doesn't
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.000]  even know how to pull a gun out of a holster there's already one in the now i understand
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.240]  because the earlier okay so now i'm getting one of these these those women look so so
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.920]  just like ignoramuses they don't look like any type of police i've seen i get it so now i understand
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.720]  one of the ladies never dare go near a cartel or an actual criminal they just see a good american to
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.440]  push around to now make sense so they're yanking on Zimmerman's uh belt trying to get his gun out of
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.200]  his holster she then leaves the magazine inside the gun which shows you she has zero experience
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.680]  with firearms racks it back ejects around by then actually putting another round into the chamber
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:38.800]  and then walking around with it so they have zero experience with firearms yet they can handle them
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:43.920]  and they said you know you can't be out here this is a dangerous area and and michael Zimmerman's
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:49.920]  like well yeah that's why we have guns with us you know meanwhile we can hear kids coming across
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.760]  the river and they walk over look like oh they're just swimming they're playing in the river this is
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.480]  not an area where people play this isn't a middle of nowhere so you see illegals coming across in
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.960]  front of these buffoons and we're being and we're being harassed so what happened we as reporters
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:08.000]  were being harassed and extorted so we're sitting here and the guy takes our ids and he goes all
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.320]  right i'm running you guys through the system so they start running our names through the system
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:19.440]  come back and said that oh well Zimmerman uh uh you were here last week we told you or uh
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.560]  the federal fish and wildlife told you you could not be here they never gave him any paperwork
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.440]  they never gave any paperwork to a don salad made up it's made up it's all outside of law
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.600]  yes it's like they're telling black people they can't be at a restaurant or something you know
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.000]  because they're black they have zero they have zero proof that they can show on paper any kind of
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.240]  report that was done to show that you totally have them with the board patrol that actually had the
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.480]  jurisdiction uh that's the board that's what the feds have the jurisdiction and exactly saying that
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:52.720]  but they but apparently they had to hold us in so when they called in our names then this federal
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.400]  fish and wildlife game guy hears the names and immediately tells us we have to be held oh that's
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.040]  who Ted Nugent says Ted knows all the feds and says they're all overall pretty great people he says
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.640]  but the but the fish and wildlife are literal communist demons oh this was out of control
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:13.200]  so at this point we're told to keep our hands up and for an hour we're sitting here with our hands
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.520]  on top of our hands in the sun it's a hundred degrees and they're sitting here like there's
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.640]  illegal crossing right behind you oh yeah and it's happening at the exact same time here's the thing
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.720]  we were given criminal trespassing charges but the night before we saw two groups of families come
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.360]  over they weren't charged with anything no what happened was was a bus came down picked them up
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.920]  takes them to the mccallum bus stop they get a free bus wow you have footage of whatever they want
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.360]  so you have the completion because because you have the footage of them coming across on the bus
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.640]  and taken yeah they came in and they have the board of patrol well i can't wait to see this i mean
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.840]  look at that it's crazy and then you are arrested and charged wow yeah but they're released and they
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.760]  go well they have a court date it'll be five years out but they probably won't make it but they don't
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:01.840]  get charged with anything i got charged as a us reporter a citizen i was disarmed there's your
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:10.960]  headline law abiding veteran journalist charged for filming on border i mean it just it shows you
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.800]  these people are out to get us and the federal official wildlife guy shows up and he keeps he
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.480]  keeps going i'm sorry you know you're a veteran thank you for your service but i need to take
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.320]  your guns from you i'm sorry but i'm gonna have to write you the citation you can't have your
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.040]  guns back sorry veteran i'm so sorry veteran pay pay this two hundred thirty dollars per person
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:35.120]  to get your firearms back like this is ridiculous how can i me as a u.s citizen as a journalist
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.080]  not be able to walk around and here's the argument that the local game boards the texas game board
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.800]  is made they go well if you just pull up google earth the area you're standing at it's green which
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.040]  says it's a wildlife refuge well we actually went and did the research and took screenshots
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:53.760]  where were we at when you pull back it's not green i know plus i know the federal and state laws
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:00.720]  they have to have fences and signs you don't just you don't just you don't just show up and say
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.600]  we want to cover up this area so we're calling it a wildlife refuge there's zero there's zero
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:10.960]  signs they can be seen that say do not go here that is trespassing we saw one sign that was under
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.000]  the andalusia bridge the international bridge to go into mexico we saw the sign that says no trespassing
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.880]  and guess what we did we made a u-turn and didn't go that way because we followed the sign but once
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.400]  we were down there that's part of the federal facility that that's part of the checkpoint it's
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.920]  not the freaking side of the river sorry go ahead but but down by the river there's no signs but the
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.800]  game warden goes well we haven't really kept up the land but they're hidden behind other trees now
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:39.440]  but they're there but you just couldn't see but they still charge you they still charge you yeah we
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.160]  had to pay a fine to get our guns back they were taken from us we were extorted this is the same
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.160]  stuff you see in mexico when families are trying to travel around and the police pull them over
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.400]  and take all their possessions and say you have to pay this to get it back okay well listen listen
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:56.800]  listen there was a fog of war and it said feds and then we knew locals were involved and then we
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.840]  kind of put the article border patrol and uh now they were involved in a certain extent at the state
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.240]  police but i have to apologize now this happens in fast reporting news i know i'm sure adan got it
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:10.000]  right and i'm sure um ikele fell around the article but we'll just make sure that it's the federal
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.480]  fishing wildlife just commandeered things now it makes perfect sense to you know keep reporters
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.600]  out of the area because because the border patrol is exposing what's going on and so then then
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.400]  then obama controls the fishing wildlife people a lot more border patrol guy watches our videos
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.120]  okay well i gotta okay well i don't make mistakes on purpose but i i that's why i blew up so bad
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.960]  i'm like you're asking us to come down here you're whistle blowing to us and then you're doing this
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.040]  to our people but that's how i got the report last night i guess early on the reports where it was
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.680]  border patrol yeah well originally we were out there the border patrol had no issue the first
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.680]  night we got there we were behind them as they were talking to these people from on there okay well
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.240]  then they were fine they said walk past us they didn't show me a favor then get with mckayland them
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.160]  and just read over the article and then just make sure i got it all right and put a correction at
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:57.840]  the bottom so i feel a lot better now i was really blowing up earlier because i'm just like you know
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.680]  you like whistle blow to us until it's come down here and then you're arresting us who are these
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:06.720]  traders that were doing this and now i understand that they had they were feds in federal uniforms
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.920]  that looks like border patrol but now i understand what's going on well the agencies are down there
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:17.520]  joe four different entities govern that small piece of land you have the texas state police
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.400]  you have the border patrol you have the local game wardens and then you have the federal wildlife
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.560]  and fish people well also got confused because you didn't have a state police almost run you over
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:33.280]  yesterday and go crazy yes i mean it is ridiculous the amount of money we are spending to harass
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.960]  reporters but allow illegals to come through and drugs into our country why do you think donald
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:43.920]  trump's so passionate about closing the border down there's no problem with legal immigration
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.320]  but there's a hell of a lot of illegals coming over here to get treated better than i do i freaking
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.720]  serve my country i shouldn't be treated like this i shouldn't have my firearms taken away i shouldn't
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.600]  be told i can't be there that's my land my tax dollars pay for that state land that's ridiculous
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.080]  well i want to play this trump clip where he talked about the video that you and josh
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:07.520]  owens got last year uh just to illustrate this is why they don't want reporters down there
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:13.920]  documenting things it's not just you other press has been harassed and they tried to
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.160]  harass the border patrol not to talk the press obviously so this is what they don't want to
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.200]  see donald trump playing our videos here it is happened so while with it you probably read it
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:29.920]  it was a drudge who's great by the way drudge is amazing but the story in drudge and big store
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:36.720]  it's all over the place now guys swimming across and big bags of stuff shrugs swimming across
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:44.160]  the river right swimming right across and they put the drugs and actually the camera crew
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.200]  or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed because
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.720]  they're showing this on camera the guys carrying bags of stuff it was drugs
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:00.400]  what happened and then we got the emergency manager saying that they bring him from the
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.600]  border and put him on buses and ship him wherever they want to go i'm going to come back to bigs
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.680]  and your calls after the break and also talk to some of the other reporters and get their take

[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.560]  way that that is a fact russia is not perfect and i'm not ever been to russia and i don't have some
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:47.360]  stake in just saying this but it's the truth the west is starting all of this with russia

[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:43.920]  and the border patrol admitting the borders open and the emergency manager admitting it's open in
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.960]  their order to let them in and the illegals pouring across as well as the border patrols saying
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:54.880]  we're ordered to complete the smuggling process the video should be called this video convicts
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.600]  obama for treason or this is why obama's arresting the press for reporting on the open border
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.920]  because just like all these communists and people beating up trump supporters makes trump go up in
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:11.120]  the polls if i have other people would just go down to the border it is crazy town down there
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.360]  and you see the illegals come across the border patrol puts them on a bus takes them to another
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:20.560]  bus at a restaurant to get some food and just bye-bye here's some money bye-bye we're not
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:29.920]  checking in for diseases bye-bye if that comes out it's over for them so now it makes sense when
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.600]  they said the feds arrested them we're we're up there in the article we actually had it last
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.480]  night it was in there it was fishing wildlife signing to the border patrol it's it's just crazy
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:42.480]  and the state police almost ran the guys over and they were involved too but we're nicer the next
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:47.600]  day all just please let us try to fix the country just please let us expose what's going on please
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.960]  please just leave us alone we're already risking our lives down there i'm gonna go back to joe

[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:31.280]  what you're doing you wanted to go to the border again you guys are maniacs so great job again
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:36.000]  exposing this resistance victory other points as we go to break well we were charged with a
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.040]  misdemeanor and we were told that if we come back on federal property like that again without
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.760]  written permission without written consent by the government that we would then be charged with a
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.400]  felony and have our firearms removed and they're just claiming just anywhere on the border period
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.440]  you just can't be there i mean i i guess i mean because their own thing they said was if you pull
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.240]  back on google and it's green you can't be there but when we did that on our phones it wasn't green
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.440]  so apparently they own all the land but that's not even true they can't let illegals come across
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.840]  and commit felonies against the republic and dereliction of duty and then like a spider
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:15.680]  claim that there's some sign back in the bushes so we're going to give you a felon and boy well i
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:20.800]  end over and squeal at the piggy sorry well i said i didn't see the sign i didn't see the sign
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.800]  hillard clinton said she didn't send the classified emails but she was let go and i was given a
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:29.040]  misdemeanor she's not even getting a misdemeanor that's where the problem is well it's a load
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.720]  of horse crap we have to fight this now i understand they made you do a you know take
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.720]  your firearms back but we got to sue them now doesn't matter anymore it goes we just have to

[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:29.200]  your calls are coming up in the next segment Dennis and Dan and Matt and Jim and Cindy
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:32.240]  i'm going to get to all the other guests coming on but we're talking to Ali we're going to say
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:38.480]  our last name one of our crew members one of our camera people um is obviously dangerous down
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:43.120]  there at the border i'll tell you what's really dangerous is trying to engage in the first amendment
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:47.520]  ali what was this like i mean this is we go down to the border pretty much every week with some of
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:52.240]  our crew i guess your first time down there uh and then all this important news you were gathering
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:55.680]  and you were operating as an interpreter with a lot of the folks and the board patrols meeting
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:59.840]  with you giving you info and then here comes obama's fishing wildlife people to grab you
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:06.320]  and kidnap you guys what was this like well alex it was uh very new to me for sure i usually come
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.960]  down to mcallin and do some shopping with my family or something super simple i've never been in the
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:16.000]  front line so this was a great experience for me personally being mexican and looking at everything
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.960]  that's happening in the border so when we first got here to mcallin and we first talked to those
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:27.600]  uh um people were crossing the border the hunter and uh people and uh they told us that they just
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:33.200]  crossed and they seemed uh scared and something really happened bad happened and stuff so when
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:37.920]  i was talking to them spanish they didn't seem like worried that we were there or anything so that
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.640]  really surprised me first because when they talk about crossing the border it's always like super
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:48.160]  dangerous and stuff like that but i can imagine what they went through before but coming into
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:53.360]  them and then just walking in and being picked up by the border patrol it just seemed like they
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:01.200]  had it easy and me i work hard to get to where i am i'm legally here and everything and i don't know
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.600]  it's just very surprising and then the next day obviously we want to get more information and
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:12.480]  take more b-roll and talk to more people uh and we get surprised by this attack that joe biggs was
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:19.520]  talking about and i at first i i feel safe when i'm around with michael zimmerman and joe biggs
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.080]  they know what they're doing they've been out on the field they love what they do and i felt 100
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:29.280]  percent safe with them so i had no worries that when these people came in and started telling us
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:34.480]  to put our hands up in the air i was not afraid i would have kept calm relaxed because the worst
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.560]  thing you can do is obviously confront them and well sure you're not in the wrong they're the
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.080]  ones that are getting in trouble now and it's a great point you are a college student in rtf
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:47.760]  you're you're from mexico we just hire folks that are smart and hard working we love you
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:52.560]  been here you know a while a couple years and you know she shows you're a great asset to info wars
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.000]  they make it so hard for you because we want to jump through some hoops to have people legally
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.160]  that are good hard-working smart people here but then if you just want to wander in from china or
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:05.760]  on duras or or if you know is llama bot or wherever you just come on in and we load you on a bus
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.400]  and you're into the country they want to just it's just crazy why do you think they're doing that
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.720]  um i do mean the people who are i mean obama the globalist what is the point of making it
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:22.080]  hard to come here legal but then just open it up for people that are illegal it's crazy i feel like
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:28.160]  when uh when you're smart or where when you do the things when you do it right and you go through
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.400]  the protocols to have a visa and stay here in the country you are under watch and when people come in
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:40.400]  illegally they i feel like they overflow people and uh they don't know what to do with them and
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:47.040]  and mexicans or hondurans or illegal aliens come in and they know that they have it good they don't
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.840]  have to worry about being looked at for five years or they don't have their names on a list
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.440]  being watched and that's what i feel like is going on right now it's like eyes are on me i that's
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.520]  right because you're here legally and i'm in our crew are citizens here legally you're being treated
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.880]  like crap because you comply exactly and it's not fair because i'm gonna get repercussions like
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.200]  being deported and not being allowed back in the states for 10 years if i do something wrong
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.800]  yet these people are getting the treatment like well ali you know if they throw you out of the
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.320]  country now i said i'll just hire you come in illegally i'm actually kind of getting to that
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:25.840]  point i may go to mexico come back in illegally so i can be left alone i'm serious i'm serious i'm
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.160]  getting sick of being a citizen at some certain point i already asked a couple of people if they
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:36.000]  remember me to get me the green card well i mean it being a citizen means you have no rights i mean
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.280]  you know hell i'm gonna problem in mexico won't let me come down there and be a citizen i guess
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.200]  all right ali well we're great job be safe i want to get you back up here and out of the line of
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.920]  fire but you're an awesome member of the crib and they just have so much great work behind the scenes

[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:36.160]  being about the law and picking and choosing what it wants to do but that's that's thematic of
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.080]  everything we're facing with hillary and and all the rest of it jill gilbert's coming on we're
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:44.640]  going to look at all these islamic connections and him going to mosques and being in islamic
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:50.960]  schools it's finally breaking uh in the news today dealing with obama and the lomification
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.960]  of the west but there's a new story about kit daniels up on infowars.com hillary faces perjury
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:05.360]  criminal probe hillary faces criminal perjury probe for lying about emails to congress
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:09.920]  and that's a big deal we'll be talking some about that i want to go to some of your phone
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:14.080]  calls from folks that have been holding about our reporters getting arrested charged with trespassing
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:19.280]  for just being by the border showing your legals coming across the feds have some random signs
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.120]  that we're saying federal land so just no citizens can't be there only illegals and then we looked
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:30.080]  into the area it's all just made up it's it's all just just just ridiculous it's all part of this
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:36.560]  imperious uh system that we're dealing with but separate from all this in the economy and so many
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.280]  other areas the whole world is just shaking right now uh putin saying they're on the edge of war
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:46.640]  with the west and warning the press to wake up i mean it's it's just getting crazier and crazier
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.840]  uh michael zemmerman i'm gonna let you get out here we're gonna take some phone calls here you
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:55.920]  can ride shotgun with us but uh overall what was this experience like for you uh recapping things
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.920]  with all these bizarre keystone cops uh coming and you know arresting you because you were i mean i
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:06.960]  know you some of this is on video you're like we're the press leave us alone i mean and they
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:12.000]  just seem to think that means you're the worst people on earth right so i was here last week
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.720]  with jakarta jackson and adon salazar and we ran into similar issues then and we're basically
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.600]  chased off by these these game wardens that came up in in boats and uh we've got footage of that so
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.080]  they came up in boats and you know walked up on the land to where we were and they're asking you
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:29.440]  know what are you doing here and we said well we're journalists and you know border patrol
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:36.240]  suggested this is an area for us to come to our story and and to cover so these guys detained us
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.480]  last week for about only 10 15 minutes until they could confirm that uh we were allowed to be in this
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.440]  area they said oh this is a refuge and you know you can't be here but uh like you were saying
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.600]  you look at google maps you look at you know any of these other they just cook it up they gotta have
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.280]  fences and signs the one website after about 20 30 minutes of looking online if you go deep into
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:01.680]  the us fish and wildlife website and you know turn on the right little filter on the map you can
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.880]  see that they've defined this area as a wildlife refuge but there's no signs there there's there's
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:13.760]  nothing and obama has defined obama has defined uh that he can just open the borders up because he's
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:19.200]  god right well the uh the people illegally crossing the border aren't fine 230 dollars a piece for
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:26.240]  trespassing they're given bus vouchers so it it definitely seems uh unfair for press to be fine
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:32.080]  for being there so they ran all of our ids and my name came up because they ran our ids last week
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:37.280]  and they said mr zimmerman you were here a week ago you were told that this is a an area you can't
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:42.880]  go to and that's why we spoke to state police yesterday to confirm they said you can be there
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.120]  absolutely yeah we've got that on tape that'll be in our report that they said this is public land
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.200]  you can be here so you've got too many cooks here you have four different government agencies to
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:55.440]  state to federal yeah but it's always online if that's the real hands you know they've been
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.320]  under the orders keep the press out that's a conduit where the illegals are told to go
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:04.880]  they're covering for it and uh we need to they do not want people to see what's going on there
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:09.280]  they don't want journalists to be able to get in there uh you know if this actually was like i
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.320]  know women can be trained to integrate with firearms and all the rest of them i don't know why
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:18.240]  there's the the ark type or the or the or the cliche or the stereotype of the weird janet rino
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.720]  style woman that doesn't know how to use a gun i mean those women look like absolute morons
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.360]  yeah this was a simple retention holster like police themselves carry you know it has a little
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.520]  button on the side that you press in order to draw the firearm so someone can't walk it behind you
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.760]  and you know jerk the gun out of your belt which is basically what the she tried to end up doing
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:39.760]  she got two hands on it she's pulling on the gun i was like you need to press the button there to
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.400]  be able to do that so yeah these these people just have no clue they are morons it'll follow
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.520]  rules well the board patrol overall are doing a great job and they've been giving us great tips
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.280]  and i know that you got messed with by some of them and by some state police that got all mixed
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.400]  together with this but this was the fish and wildlife idiots so i apologize it's so i freak out
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:03.440]  all the first hour but i now it's directed at these people so well i'll tell you time is on our
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.120]  sides everman i don't see how they're gonna get away with all this i mean this is crazy yeah they
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.840]  can't people are waking up to this you know top red link on dredge right now this story is getting
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:17.120]  out there and them acting like this is only gonna make it worse uh so let me give them a little
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.040]  newsflash you're in violation of the first amendment i don't care if you and obama claim
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.320]  you own everything and you're god you can bring the illegals in and give them everything free
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:30.640]  you are not god and you're gonna learn that you're under the law as well uh yesterday they
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:34.240]  suppressed our first and second amendment rights freedom of the press and you know they took our
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.960]  firearms and demanded money in order to give it back and he he made it sound like oh i'm i'm doing
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.720]  your favor i'll make it convenient for you we can drive up the road to where you get cell signal
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.120]  signal again you can pay your 690 dollars in fines and i'll give you your guns back right now
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.720]  otherwise they're going to be going to federal armory and getting locked up there until you pay
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.520]  your fine then you can go claim it so it was in order to get us to not fight this in court and
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.880]  drag this out months and have our fire they want to agree that you were trespassing you can't do
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.440]  that you got to appeal it you didn't understand it we got to sue them and by the way we should we
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:12.720]  should with doing wanting in uh like that was in cleave one last time so whatever i mean i don't
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:16.480]  want to have to do it but we've got to stand up for you guys so let's do the research let's get
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.720]  the lawyers and let's follow lawsuits with these with these with these goons that's what they want
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.680]  it's what they get we're not looking for trouble but they they're looking for they came to the right
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:28.720]  place uh michael let's take some calls denison texas you held over real quick you were getting into
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:34.080]  what it was like working for decades under sharia law in the middle east and uh what we see here
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:40.320]  with the llama with the islamification well i've got a quick headline for you fed use
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:46.320]  feds to use color of law to muzzle press yeah feds feds arrest
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.480]  feds arrest press i mean it's what it's a headline drudge has you know feds arrest
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.200]  press to stop them reporting on open border yep they're using the color of law against
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:02.560]  them this is the fourth estate this is this is what is supposed to ensure that we have
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:09.840]  a response of government a government that is for for the people that uh actually uh enhances our
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:16.080]  freedoms a government that cannot work in the shadows these people want to work in the shadows
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:23.200]  you guys have done a great job highlighting what's going on down in the border but you
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  you actually need help and in this you're doing the tactical things but there needs to be a strategic
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:36.800]  thing done unfortunately most people in the united states do not understand that muslims are not
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:43.360]  there there are only two types of muslims there are um radical muslims and there are
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:51.520]  more radical muslims okay there are no moderate muslims um you you can what what you what we
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:59.360]  should do is get a a conference of churches and muslim leaders together and hold a big prayer
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:05.600]  meeting to pray for peace and pray pray against terrorism you will find that the muslims will
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:11.440]  not pray with a christian it isn't going to happen well i know this the muslims that aren't
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:16.320]  radical are the heretics they're the ones that are off the reservation and they're most in the
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:20.240]  more radical ones bully all the others into submission and i just find it very offensive
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:25.920]  to have muslim teaching in the public schools to accept islam that's in the news today muslim camps
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.800]  at the schools and they have a woman come in with earrings and her face out telling us how great
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:37.520]  islam is to sell it to the dumb leftist i mean it is total trojan horse bs and i'm sick of it thank
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:42.880]  you denise for your points um let's go ahead and i'll tell you seven of them go back to calls
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:49.920]  a reporter on the border they don't want you catching the islamics coming across because
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:54.400]  we've got their reports and i'm at the border patrol i'm talking about obama they don't want you
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.200]  down there because they know you're gonna end up catching some islamics and then it's really
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.160]  gonna be a huge right well and this whole thing about moderate islam is a myth you know they say
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.840]  only five percent of muslims are are radical but if you look at you know the surveys and you know
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:11.920]  research out there they ask questions to these people like you know do you think gays should be
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.000]  thrown off buildings or do you think sharia law 25 percent say they should kill everybody i mean
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:22.080]  this is huge it's huge it's like 60 70 percent 25 percent when we went to paris you know 25 percent
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.680]  of muslims in paris support and all areas they would run you out they just wouldn't give you
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:35.200]  service you just get out of here yeah there there aren't moderates well incredible simmerman let's
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:40.080]  go ahead and take some more calls here uh let's talk to cindy and pa than matt and dan and jim
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.000]  we're gonna skip this number break i can't help it i just have to do it i'm a free species under
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.800]  attack but with sacrifice here cindy go ahead yeah hi alex this really is turning into helder's
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:58.560]  helder here um people may not understand muslims so i think more attention needs to be drawn on the
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:05.920]  contagious disease factor if trump would talk more about the contagious diseases they're spreading
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:11.200]  to all of us and how endangered we are by the way this is a big deal all these weird diseases that
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:16.160]  are in the third world are suddenly here tbs exploding it's killing people much of its drug
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:22.160]  resistant and they're just like it doesn't matter uh yay you know oh take your vaccines be safe but
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:30.160]  then there's nothing for tb that's a great point what do you think's behind that uh the calls
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:36.000]  they are killing us i think they want us to die but i you know it might be a thought for you to
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.600]  put out some surgical masks with info wars written on it we could wear them oh yeah tell your kids to
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.600]  wear it as a as a statement i i appreciate your call look all i know is they haven't taken one
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.240]  refugee in saudi arabia and saudi arabia is the one starting the civil war and he's stabilizing
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:57.360]  everything and i don't think they want us all just to die immediately but the globalists do want
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:03.360]  societal collapse because they organize it and then they get funding out of it by being the managers
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:07.200]  why do you think they're doing this michaels emerman well it's the slow kill and push through
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.160]  the depopulation they don't care if people at tb and scabies are coming into the us they don't care
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:16.720]  if people here get sick you know chris cabrera the border patrol union vice president down here
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:22.320]  that we spoke to last week was telling us that the quarantine areas and these uh refugee centers
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:27.200]  or i forget exactly what they call it down here the quarantine area is just a little piece of yellow
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.240]  tape so the people who are sick go over here the well people go over here there's no there's no
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.160]  isolation or separation so people could be going to these places before they get sent on buses
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.360]  across the country and they're all getting tbs babies well there are a lot of people getting
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:46.480]  getting down public schools directly from the migrants not the legals and it's time for lawsuits
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:50.480]  to draw attention to this you know what stopped the secret blood draws going into a un database
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:55.200]  was a nurse blew the whistle to myself like in 1997 people heard about it looked into it found
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:59.920]  it was true lawsuits were filed in texas in minnesota and and and and now they have to disclose okay
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.480]  it's a dna database uh so it is this stuff must be exposed michael's everman thank you so much we
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:12.080]  really appreciate you and uh i guess you guys are coming back today uh i mean i guess uh
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:18.160]  you know specifically uh you might want to go file a report just from the edge of where they claim
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:21.760]  that there's no free speech and of course they'll just move it further the goalpost
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:26.640]  truly truly a nightmare scenario for the first amendment but whatever you do just follow those
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:31.920]  reports and get back to austin safe we'll do thank you alex that's a great crew i i sent
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.800]  jakari and them down there a few weeks ago i didn't send the crew down there this time

[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.320]  of stuff that happened that you reported on like the people and all that i'm having trouble
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:08.000]  understanding you are you on a speakerphone i'm on a headset i just try to get a little bit closer
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.880]  to the mic because i'm really having trouble all right is that better yeah that's that's night and

[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:42.080]  politics going going to play well listen i wish that i was exaggerating i mean i can't believe
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:46.720]  how crazy stuff is i i can't believe they brought five million jihadis into europe and
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:49.840]  it's got to be a million or something here they're covering it up i mean i don't want to
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:56.640]  believe this i appreciate your call matt uh it's it's just it's it's bizarro uh let's go ahead and
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:01.920]  talk to jim in north carolina you're on the air worldwide go ahead jim hey this has been exciting
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:11.440]  news week ain't it it's a lot going on um never boring obama is organizing top mega banks to finance
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:18.880]  and bring in unlimited muslim immigrants giving them work visas i mean you can't make that up
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:24.640]  i originally didn't call in to talk about the banks in mexico but since you asked it nobody
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:30.400]  answered it i think i'll go ahead and tell you um obama gets to print money off these uh
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.160]  illegals coming in and as far as now that's true they get to throw them into the social
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:40.960]  security system and leverage them with the imf and world bank each one of us is is is is a
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:45.520]  commodity so so yes they're using these poor people as well they're playing us off against each other
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:53.040]  once he gets more the proof we have of that is tony blare coming out and admitting the whole weapons
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:59.840]  of mass destruction was his mess up fiasco and as soon as he did that the pound hit a historic low
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.560]  but yet their markets pretty much stayed the same so there's the proof in that but what i really
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:13.920]  called in about was this emergency hearing they had with so uh james coney and he basically come out
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:21.200]  and said that federal federal officials are not held to the same standards meaning the letter of
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:27.920]  the law in order for them people to be convicted there has to be irrefutable proof and that's right
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:33.920]  he's setting a new precedent for a new uh imperial royalty that is the federal government and uh but
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:38.720]  the little people you've got to follow these laws but nobody else does great point jim i'll get to

[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.120]  minutes i kind of you know kind of go back and forth and then i got to my emails reading some
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:33.520]  stuff and i went back to drudge and i saw boom this big image of obama and his islamic guard
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.040]  now we first saw that in 2003 the media said it was fake they had true squads that said we'll arrest
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:44.400]  you uh in places like missouri if you say that he is an a christian i mean i can play those newscast
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:50.320]  i'm not kidding but maybe we should pull those up well it turns out he went to madrasa schools he
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:58.080]  was a muslim he speaks better arabic than top imams joel gilbert has made the definitive film
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:03.280]  dreams my real father on this subject and he's really investigated obama like nobody else so
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:08.080]  there are major islamic connections to kind of his fake family in kenya and the rest of it
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:15.280]  but i wanted to ask him what he really thinks obama's in game is but but then separately
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:18.800]  we're going to break in a moment i'll cut you know i wanted to just give us a preview
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:24.560]  does he think it's really good news though that finally bill o'reilly is talking about this and
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:30.240]  giving us old news and making it new i mean is that a positive thing what does he think that bodes
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:36.800]  so is he really just a globalist socialist ally with islam or is he double dipping is he really
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:42.880]  a islamicist joel gilbert documentary filmmaker researcher from your deep research on obama and
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:52.160]  all these new photos emerging who is he really hi alex uh look uh barack obama at his core
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:28:00.480]  is a radical communist you have to understand the connection between islamist and marxists
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:08.080]  they both view western free market systems free speech and open government as an obstacle to
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:15.280]  taking power therefore islamists and marxists are natural allies and they see western societies
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:20.720]  the number one target on the path to salvation salvation for marxists is utopia paradise on
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:27.840]  earth like in my in my new film salvation for islamist is in the next world but together they
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:34.240]  view western society as their number one target and you can see obama again and again always very
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:41.280]  comfortable around islam any anti-american ideology anti-american extremists reverend
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:47.760]  right bill ares you can see him wearing the islamic garb he is extremely comfortable and happy
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:56.240]  in any anti-american setting or with any anti-american like raul castrow chavez anyone who hates
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:01.200]  america he's very comfortable because this is his background his real father frank marshall
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:07.520]  davis was a soviet agent and a communist party usa propagandist and this is the man who raised him
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:13.840]  and became his ideological father as i've chronicled in my film dreams for my real father uh so
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:20.720]  uh this is who obama is he and he's uh part of this world of little known world of anti-american
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:28.080]  radical marxists and the islamists are their natural allies obama is uncomfortable when you see him
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:34.080]  placing the american flag on the tomb of the unknown soldier at a any ceremony that has to do
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:40.800]  with uh memorializing the founding fathers he's always uncomfortable so this is the big lie
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:45.440]  that obama hoisted on us and the democrats and i want to ask you where you think he's going in
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:49.920]  his last months in office through next january where you think the election is going with hillary
[02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:57.360]  and a lot more joe gilbert we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:30:06.960]  network california governor jerry brown signed a new vaccine mandate last friday that enacts

[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:44.240]  the authoritarians pushing no vaccine no school are the same crowd that call abortion pro-choice

[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:15.040]  decided to go into high gear they've now announced that hillary won't be indicted no matter how many
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:19.440]  crimes she commits it's time for us to take our matters into our own hands the globalist warfare
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:24.400]  model is siege it wants to make us dependent it wants to cut off our economies it wants to be able
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:29.280]  to set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages that are already happening in

[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:14.160]  this is actually from Obama
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:36.000]  even though it has cost south carolina thousands of jobs and worst of all it was hillary clinton
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  who voted for george bush's war in iraq that's an obama ad hillary clinton she'll say anything
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:50.240]  and change nothing it's time to turn the page paid for by obama for america i'm barack obama
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:56.720]  candidate for president and i approved this message i have run my last campaign this is him
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:00.480]  now this week i couldn't be prouder of the things we've done together but i'm ready to pass the baton
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.000]  and i know that hillary clinton is going to take it and of course trump has been exposing this
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:16.240]  hypocrisy to race to create good jobs and better schools and safer streets and a safer world and
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:21.600]  that's why i'm fired up and that's why i'm ready to go and that's why i'm with her and that's why
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:28.960]  i need you to work just as hard to make sure that hillary ronald clinton is the next president
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:38.000]  of the united states of america they want to keep her in there to cover for all his crimes he's
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.120]  committed to continue the agenda and now we've got donald frump as the nominee whether you love
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:47.440]  him or hate him i think the guy's got a lot of courage and is a great patriot i know he's a listener
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:52.560]  of the show i know he's getting more hardcore all the time they're trying this anti-semitism bs
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:59.680]  when our government under hillary and obama's been funding al-qaeda and isis talk about anti-semitic
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:05.360]  and then now they could show disney you know ads and stuff with the same little star meaning a
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.640]  discount and they're saying oh it's it's anti-semitic because he bashed hillary with it and i like
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:14.080]  trump coming out we're gonna play this later saying we shouldn't have retracted that my
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:20.160]  crew shouldn't have done that uh i mean i just love how they use calls of racism all day when
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:26.000]  these are the people pushing racial division and all of this control so joel gilbert documentary
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.960]  filmmaker very intelligent political activist the guy that dug up incredible dirt on obama
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:37.280]  i want to talk with you about this election where you see it going how it ties in with hillary
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:41.280]  because you're a guy that has you know some gravitas i mean i really actually want to know
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:48.000]  your opinion about i know the audience does too just wargaming this myself every day
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.280]  what does your gut tell you where do you think hillary will take us what is obama gonna do in
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.440]  his last months the arrogance where the supreme court says yeah it's illegal for you to violate the
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:03.840]  law and let he legals it he just says i'm an in preset even bigger and then and then the fbi
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:08.560]  coming out not going after hillary um admitting all the horrible things she's done but then saying
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:12.960]  we can't go after what do you really think's happening i mean how do we decipher and decode
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:19.200]  all this joel gilbert okay alex well uh first of all i don't think people except for maybe you and
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:23.680]  your listeners understand the seriousness of the times we're living in we're literally i believe
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:30.000]  in the last days of the republic yes before liberal fascism takes a permanent hold if hillary wins
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:34.640]  we're one justice away and the supreme court should probably have three or four
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:40.800]  that will negate several of our freedoms and amendments the fec you remember that the fec
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:47.840]  tried to uh go after me investigate me uh find me possibly a jail sentence for making a movie about
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.360]  obama's past and it was tied three to three should have been six to nothing but it was three to three
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.360]  so they just need one more uh liberal official democratic party platform in philadelphia will
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.760]  be to arrest climate change deniers correct so the the liberal fascism that uh might be in our
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:12.880]  future uh is extremely serious we have uh barack obama uh he's gonna act as an agitator he is a
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:18.720]  professional agitator he trained as an agitator in chicago with the midwest academy with the radical
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:24.800]  marxist he was a trainer for acorn and he never was really interested in politics as much as he was
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:30.720]  in using politics in the office of the presidency to agitate meaning to divide the country to spread
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:37.440]  disinformation uh the top one percent of the people are preventing you from uh from from being
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:42.960]  successful all they're licking their lips are making their big move all these marxist lies so you
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:48.400]  saw obama in the speech with hillary uh he also talked about that unemployment is only four percent
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:53.920]  we have tremendous job growth uh we're now safer because of his policy so we have record crime rate
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.800]  global destabilization never foreseen all top analysts admit we're really in a depression
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:04.400]  but just like the soviet union in 1989 was still claiming it was doing great correct everything
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.320]  is a lie it's soviet era disinformation disinformation and this is what obama will be doing over the
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:16.960]  next several months with the democrats and the media to simply echo these uh these lies and if
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:24.080]  you look at venezuela as a new modern example of how the lies of the economy doing great and
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:29.440]  security and safety all come crashing down all of a sudden people realize there's no job there's no
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:35.040]  food there's no health care and the entire society uh is is being torn apart so this idea of this you
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:40.560]  know utopian ideal has been proven to be a disaster again and again but it gives them total power
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:46.080]  and controls they like it correct don't they know it's a fraud though i mean they've got to be
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:49.680]  intellectual enough i know a lot of the top globalist or billionaires that are using this to
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.520]  consolidate power and then they're exempt from an offshore and then it destroys their competition
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.600]  getting rid of a free market as john d rockevillers said competition is a sin but but used to i
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:03.440]  disagreed with you at a certain extent and dr corcy and others but it was real communist ideology
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:07.520]  i thought they were just using it but now that i've dug deeper and gotten to know people that
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:12.560]  know them and actually been around some of it they don't get the oxymoron that they're on a jumbo
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:16.240]  jet with a red carpet and he's worth a hundred million dollars or whatever hillary's were 200
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.480]  million or 300 million and that then they're criticizing free market that gave us all these
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:26.080]  choices and all this freedom and this and this huge so they really are communist it's it's bizarre
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:32.160]  look their goal is to eliminate the middle class and create one big lower class and then these
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:37.120]  bureaucrats become the upper class the bourgeois they take control of all the assets of the state
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.480]  so are they consciously blood drinking parasites or do they really believe they're on bs uh
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:49.360]  i think they're consciously uh drug you know drug sniffing parasites uh there's no question
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:55.120]  that they they know this entire thing is bunk but they they're they're people that are being used
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:00.480]  by others it's a very sad story obama's real father frank marshall davis was one of the original
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:05.840]  black bolsheviks in chicago white communists used him and convinced him that if he would join their
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:11.520]  party gets all these perks and try to convince other black people to join the socialist movement
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.080]  fast forward by the way for new listeners yeah my mom heard you like five years ago
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:19.600]  whatever when your film first came out she's like this is crazy she saw it totally convinced
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.200]  it's it's total open and shut we saw the film there's my real father you have it at your website
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:28.080]  if you haven't seen the folks you're insane if you have it it is so mind-blowing that's why
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:33.200]  they always said in harvard review that he did for years you know i was born in kenya i'm kenyan
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:40.480]  it's why she said in speeches i'm from kenya it's why uh they would put out you know a birth
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:45.920]  certificate in six layers it's a fake on purpose that a ten-year-old could figure out to bait us
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.960]  to think it was that's why he doesn't look like his supposed relatives it's all a cut out and it
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.320]  is frank marshall davis who he had mits in his book was his grandfather's best friend
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.960]  who he lived with in summers who's probably the most famous black communist ever and who
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:08.960]  and then he's porno's with his mother it's it's all documented i it's some of the greatest
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.760]  journalism ever seen i don't mean to digress but but that snapshot a few minutes for new
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:17.680]  people's we have new audiences all the time that don't know who obama's real dad is because it's
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.240]  open and shut i mean this is his daddy this is his daddy yeah obama's real dad was a black
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:29.120]  bolshevik in chicago he was ordered to hawaii by the kremlin to act as a soviet agent in 1948
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:34.960]  after being a member of the communist party for 14 years to help organize the hawaiian dock workers
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:40.320]  to strike and take over the hawaiian government this is before the state to expel us naval
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:45.360]  forces from hawaii because the russians felt the us naval forces were an obstacle to soviet
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.800]  expansion in asia frank marshall davis went to hawaii organized the strikes for six months it
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:56.720]  ultimately failed and davis stayed in hawaii tried to recruit the n double acp there to join the
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:03.600]  communist party uh and was investigated by the fbi the 600 page fbi file and was on the security
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.000]  index a meaning he'd be arrested immediately if there was a conflict with the soviet union
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.080]  he became a writer and propagandist for the communist party newspapers for many years
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:17.280]  so this is the guy that i think i have a mountain of evidence was the real biological father
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:24.160]  who more importantly became obama's ideological mentor and radicalized him into this anti-white
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:30.400]  anti-american ideology uh but regardless it's who his dad sent him to stay summers with
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:36.400]  oh not summers he would spend grandfathers three hours a day and by the way within a couple days
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:42.400]  i'm going to be dropping a new article with uh jerry course with wnd i became very close to one
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:47.440]  of obama's high school friends who is prominently featured in dreams for my father we're going to
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:52.160]  have a whole new group of revelations about frank marshall davis and the paternity coming up within
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.600]  a day or two and i'll be happy to come back on wow please do so that's going to come out but i just
[02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:01.680]  thought of you because all the you know all the photos and stuff that you and others hope get
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:05.760]  on the islamic end of him all dressed up remember them nine years ago saying those were fake now
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:11.200]  they just admit they're real right they they had look uh unfortunately o'reilly and his gang and
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:15.680]  mainstream media even the conservatives have really let us down except for you alex because we had
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:20.880]  all this information years ago and they're suddenly realizing well maybe this guy is a radical
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:26.400]  communist with islamic sympathies something we've been saying for years uh anyway frank marshall
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:33.760]  davis the radical anti-american anti-white extremists died in 1985 lo and behold barack
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:39.200]  obama latches on to reverend right who's kind of the same person he calls him an uncle but that
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:45.440]  was his new father figure and obama is comfortable with anti-american extremists and uncomfortable
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.880]  with anything american and this was the big lie he ran as a mainstream candidate pretending
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:56.160]  to love america when really he threw his voters under the bus in pursuit of radical i'm anti-american
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:44:00.400]  till i study every other country and it's the best i mean it's real easy to be an anti-american
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:06.960]  if you're some snot-nosed college student never done anything in your life right well uh this is
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:13.600]  this is the very sad uh episode that america was uh duped into by the media and by obama
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.360]  and we're suffering the consequences i think obama is going to try in the last month of his
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:24.160]  of his presidency to continue the radical transformation by flooding us with illegals
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:30.240]  by uh not even caring that these uh illegals have not been screened for security or medical
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:34.800]  background reasons well that's what gets me that that's why i've gone from thinking total open
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:41.040]  martial law persecution was a possibility to a probability to a near certainty is i've never
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:49.120]  seen in history such brazen corruption such foaming at the mouth evil such such uh sabotaging
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:54.640]  the economy just they run it they've taken us over that's not enough they really want to mount
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:00.080]  our head on the wall just they really want to blow the engine of free market even though
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:04.960]  they've captured it it is the most it'd be like if you took over a mansion you go well i don't
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:10.480]  like you lived here before i'm gonna burn it down it's yours i don't understand why they're
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:16.560]  against prosperity i don't get i don't understand it like george soros a nazi collaborator
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:21.360]  60 something years running around trying to blow up three countries still financing groups that
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:27.600]  openly are trying to train to kill police for no reason it's like if you're 89 years old why do you
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:34.080]  want to finance groups to kill cops i just i don't understand these people these people have a
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:40.240]  destructive passion it's no different from the islamist jihadists who have a passion to destroy
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:46.880]  the radical leftist and marxists have a destructive passion they cannot take it and it makes them
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:52.400]  miserable when they see people using free speech uh second amendment they can't take our real liberal
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:57.440]  freedom that everybody can do whatever they want the money all the choices that they hate it exactly
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:02.800]  they can't compete with freedom right there their ideology is that only a government control of
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:09.600]  everything and everyone is the utopian ideal the utopian society so when you prove to them that
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:15.840]  people can be free and productive and go to church and have a job and and be happy without their
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:21.840]  marxist nonsense it infuriates them and they have to destroy it uh that's why they have so much in
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:26.720]  common with the islamists who want to destroy the i agree another place where i was wrong and i've
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.240]  been wrong a lot of big stuff in history but i hear from you and others 10 years ago that it's
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:35.120]  an islamic takeover plan they're going to flood europe it's syria law the caliphate i knew they
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.480]  were thinking that but i thought good luck they'll let a few of you attack and then use as excuse to
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:45.280]  take our rights but you know kill you no it really seems like they're actually putting them in charge
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:52.800]  everywhere making us conform and really trying to override us with islam that is that is freakazoid
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:59.200]  i mean i don't how was that because look they use uh poor people to put them at the forefront
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:05.760]  to to demand that we uh change the welfare system and give free health care they use uh is
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:12.320]  muslims they use uh el salvadorans and mexicans they'll put anybody up front to use them as a
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:18.400]  battering ram to to knock down traditional free market society and i made the analogy
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:23.200]  early about frank marshall davis he was used by white communists in chicago to become part of
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:30.720]  the communist movement fast forward 1985 bill ares and his uh marxist terrorist gang uh using his
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:34.960]  father tomas historically you couldn't get any black people to join a communist movement
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:39.920]  they were the most anti-communist group anybody the marxists in chicago were dying to get the
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:43.840]  black church groups involved in their causes because they were so well organized they didn't
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.120]  want any part of it because communism was atheist they brought in a front man with a black face
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:54.560]  barack obama out of new york to come into chicago to join the developing communities project to get
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:00.080]  in and infiltrate uh the black churches and you can see that obama has done nothing for black people
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:04.800]  in in all of his presidency and since they went from being christians the black americans folks
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:11.520]  had lower crime rates on average and lower illegitimacy rates than whites okay and now look as soon
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:16.720]  as their ideology became leftist garbage culture annihilated same for everybody else i mean it's
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:24.480]  just pure proof as soon as they had the communes run them over right so it's the ideology is to
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:31.200]  use people to use black people to use poor people to stir their discontent rub salt in their wounds
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:36.720]  and i'm quoting and then use their discontent to take power they don't say we want to take power
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:41.600]  to help people they want to use them to take power then they discard them in my film there's no place
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:46.960]  like utopia i go to south side chicago detroit we talked to all these african americans who've
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:53.200]  been screwed by these uh 50 60 years of of uh leftist control of these cities they have drug
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:59.840]  cultures high crime rates single mothers poor education flooded by immigrants and they're like
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:05.040]  when you talk to them they're like people that came out of russia in the 1950s all of us engineered
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.640]  they are so ready for freedom well that's what i was told about big holy producer last week he said
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.960]  he said you know like the black producers and people are the most awake folks in hollywood now
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:18.720]  for free market but he and in freedom but they go the hollywood won't let that out and then and this
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:22.720]  is a big white producer is produced like i mean major tv shows and movies and he was saying he's
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.480]  not working with a lot of these libertarian black folks he was he was mentioning major names but
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:31.840]  he was saying the media will never let them get that information out correct and let me circle
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:38.800]  and let me circle back on the uh the photos and obama's yes yes it's long because in my research uh
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:45.520]  i have developed a case that obama was not at uh columbia university for two years as he claimed
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:50.000]  he claimed to be their junior and senior years i've got the proof that he was in pakistan for
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.960]  his junior year abroad he was an international studies major and they all went on junior year
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:50:00.640]  abroad his mother was in pakistan at the time and i believe obama lived as an adult in a muslim
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:06.160]  country and that's where he got his affinity for all things islam and that he then went to
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:11.360]  columbia on a ford foundation scholarship by the way which would have been illegal because his mother
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:16.800]  worked for the ford foundation and that was nepotism and that's why obama kept such a low
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:22.480]  profile at columbia nobody saw him met him he didn't join any organizations because of the
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:27.440]  ford foundation connection which uh so is he really a communist is he a radical muslim or is
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:32.960]  it all a cia cutout because you know we know his whole family cia i believe obama is a radical
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:38.800]  communist he was raised and radicalized by radical communist and this was in and later in life he
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:44.720]  discovered the connection and support that the islamist would give for that cause uh it's not
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:49.920]  uncommon in europe and other uh countries like uh the labor party in england no no islam's always
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:55.520]  been for 80 years with the communists they also ally with the fascists as well anything to talitarian

[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:09.920]  probably before the extended july 4th independence week sale ends monday we'll have to pull x2

[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:42.080]  extended and expanded with more items so these are things you need and it supports the typical spear
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:50.720]  promoting really an emergency warning about what's happening historically uh but even
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:55.360]  mainline analysts now admit the world is in the most conflict it's pretty much ever seen
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:59.920]  that things are melting down things are deteriorating the elites are digging in and getting armored
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:06.080]  redoubts silicon valley folks are evacuating to armored fortresses uh they're really gearing up
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.560]  for something big and i think it's time for everybody to get prepared because it's gone from
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:16.640]  the realm of possibility the realm of virtual certainty but uh this collapse will not be evenly
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:22.000]  distributed uh so some areas won't be as affected as others but we need to be prepared everything
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.040]  the globalists do is about everything the collectives do the communists do is about making us independent
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:34.080]  no more they want to make us dependent on them they want to make us
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.720]  basically domesticated slaves sheep i'm going to host someone to the next hour with rob do and take
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.800]  your phone calls for chris and ben and james and terry and kenny will get to all of you and
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:47.200]  i have some big news on putin saying the world's gearing up for war and more but let me turn back
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:52.160]  to joel gilbert in the few minutes we have in closing three minutes obviously elites all over
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:57.280]  the world are digging in for something big is it economic collapse is it larger wars is it
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:02.160]  islamic terror cells activating everywhere joel gilbert why do you think they're digging in and
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:11.440]  gearing up well uh first uh obama and the leftists want a permanent state of agitation if everything
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:17.440]  is peaceful and quiet and people are prosperous they go away they can't make waves they can't get
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:26.720]  elected so by definition they have to create chaos problems tension anxiety uh bringing diseases
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:31.360]  into the country people that might commit acts of terrorism that have committed acts of terrorism
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:36.480]  releasing criminals dumbing everybody down pausing racial strife this is what they do
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:44.000]  they agitate and divide in order to use that uh division and insecurity to take power and say
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.560]  look it's the one percent who are doing this it's the rich people there's an evil bogeyman
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:53.360]  who's causing all this give us the power but there is a bogeyman it's the george soros and
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:57.760]  rockefellers and people funding the leftist revolution it actually is the robber barons
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:03.520]  doing it correct absolutely correct but they simply lie through their teeth everything they
[02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:12.080]  say is a lie and they they blame this uh so-called unknown system or uh you know conservatives or
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:19.040]  whatever it might be uh to continue this narrative that's right wing conspiracy right so it's really
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:23.760]  a vast left-wing conspiracy as i show in my film so people like uh donald trump is is getting all
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.720]  the support because he's the first person to really stand up and call them out as complete
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:34.560]  frauds everything from the media to the democrat party to these globalists and this is what's

[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:24.960]  it's a long way to the top if you want to stop the globalist
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:32.000]  well you can have corruption and capitalism but it's something that can be contained and dealt
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.800]  with and innovation will run away so crazily that the only problem with free market is you just get
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:46.960]  spoiled because you're so rich but communism creates living hell and i get to hear all these
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:52.480]  idiot young people and old people too going oh the utopia of socialism i'm like where does that
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:58.560]  work dummies and they just don't care they they just they drive up in their sports cars they have
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:06.000]  their smartphones it seems like so many rich white people are socialists and communists and i just
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:11.360]  are they guilty they have money i don't understand it why don't they just build a company and hire
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:15.280]  people and build something you know help everybody by building a better civilization
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:20.960]  dole gilbert in closing i appreciate your time just in a minute or two how how would you say this
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:25.520]  war is tyranny's going this war against collectivism they seem to be on the offense a lot of folks
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:32.640]  are waking up though but should we be optimistic or pessimistic i would say that uh in 2008 when
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:39.760]  obama was elected uh we had essentially lost his election was not a sudden political phenomenon it
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:45.360]  was the result of an american socialist movement that had penetrated the media entertainment and
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:52.320]  universities for decades uh his years in office he's simply been reinforcing all of this and the
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:58.240]  question is not whether they're winning the question is whether we can somehow mount a comeback
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:05.600]  for the forces of of good and constitutionalism and free markets and and and individual rights
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:12.560]  against this onslaught that's been going on for many many years uh in england they they made a
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:18.320]  a stand and they won only by a couple percentage points to get rid of the eu uh it remains to be
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:24.880]  seen if americans who are essentially the character of america is uh the character of rebels people
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:29.920]  that went against the uh the british crown who wanted to be free people with individual rights
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:36.560]  the declaration of independence uh all of our documents talk about a free people so it remains
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:43.280]  to be seen i think this election will either sew us up as uh living under this uh liberal fascism of
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:49.920]  the radical left which hillary clinton will put it put a uh you know permanent stamp on or if we
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:55.360]  can recover and clean out all these no i agree with you we are this is the crossroads and i
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:01.760]  actually grieve inside now because i mean the stakes are so high joe these people are so horrible
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:09.040]  it's a very very very serious times uh uh obama is in case it's going to be close don't forget these
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:14.000]  guys uh don't americans know what they call right wing libertarianism stuff is freedom where you're
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:20.320]  left alone and you have to process and you can you it's just there's no comparison historically joe
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:26.240]  don't they have any idea how stupid this is they spent 50 years eroding the education system i mean
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:30.880]  i was in new york city in a coffee house a couple weeks back sitting next to these two college kids
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:36.000]  and they were talking about how they can't possibly understand black people because they're white
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:41.600]  they had kind of bought into all this this narrative that uh the racist narrative that uh
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:50.640]  black people don't value freedom and and so racist i know it's so condescending i uh so you
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:58.480]  know we are we are in very very serious times and uh we certainly hope that uh uh the forces and
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:03.040]  voices of freedom can express themselves and overcome this leftist onslaught because these
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:08.880]  are experts in voter fraud obama's election to to the state senate in illinois was all done with
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:14.880]  voter fraud they're experts in bs too man experts and they're flooding us with with uh illegals and
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:19.680]  they'll do anything and everything they view the ends as justifying the means so they will do anything
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:24.480]  and everything to keep a permanent hold on power yeah they're religious evil people you're right
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:30.080]  they have they have destructive energy criminal energy the destructive passion and we've seen
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:34.800]  them use the tools of state they suppress the conservative movement with you look at how they
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:38.800]  take out allies in the stabilized middle eastern countries and give them people relative freedom
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:46.560]  and then put literal scum in throwing homosexuals off buildings well uh chaos and insecurity they
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:51.360]  feed on they feed off of they know if we have prosperity and security that nobody will listen
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:54.800]  to them yeah they're just evil they're just devil worshipers all right joel gilbert joel

[03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:11.600]  endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:16.800]  pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving
[03:05:16.800 --> 03:05:22.000]  their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:28.720]  destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and institute new
[03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:36.320]  government independence isn't a day it's a mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent

[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:48.320]  infringements when you trade your liberty for safety to that extent you become their slave

[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:56.000]  grid wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:08.480]  go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:20.160]  another time in the age of one they can't even build heavy-boost rockets in 2016 like they built
[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:31.520]  in 1965 brains we had back then a vision of microchips 50 years you are receiving this
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:40.480]  transmission for they were the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:46.800]  johns instead our top scientists come up with better ways to linguistically dumb everyone down
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:56.560]  so that weirdos like merkel and hillary and holand can prance around and feel powerful
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:03.520]  but i'm telling you i believe we're going to innovate our way out of these tyrants
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:09.920]  they've tried to gear all the major innovations towards enslaving us but there's always
[03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:17.280]  these things that don't go the way the establishment thinks and that's certainly happening today
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:24.000]  now rob do is going to be taking over i got to say he robbed do uh it looks really great today
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:31.360]  you found your style a hawaiian shirt with a navy blue blazer yeah uh with a dude sir
[03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:37.760]  duderino or just dude for brevity you know mr white rush in and got a beverage uh the big
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:44.080]  lobosky hey man i'm not mr lobosky i'm the dude the duderino uh walter was going to do with vietnam
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:50.800]  you know i didn't lose friends face down in the mud so this trumpet this whore i'm sorry uh
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:57.200]  what do you cover today coming up well um i want to play a few videos that we've produced over the
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:01.600]  last couple days one talking to the people out in the street with about hillary clinton how she
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:06.720]  got off pretty much scott free i was watching a little bit of the fbi director getting grilled by
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:10.880]  well kind of getting grilled seems like they were playing good cop bad cop with them because they'd
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:15.600]  have a couple democrats asking questions they'd be like you've done such a good job and all your
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:20.560]  service and being bipartisan and it turns out they didn't even put hillary clinton under oath
[03:10:20.560 --> 03:10:24.240]  in this whole fiasco let's go they have to endow her if she got caught lying she started caught
[03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:28.960]  lying like let me not exaggerate like 50 times when she was just lying constantly exactly and
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:33.120]  that's the same thing they never had a separate email or email addresses right she didn't have
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:38.400]  servers do oh no never classified material never existed and you know as you were talking about
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:42.880]  the scientists are trying to figure out ways to uh uh you know dumb us down with language well
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:47.120]  they're also looking for ways to control us now they want to have this pain ray that works by
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:51.360]  blasting people with microwaves that's the newest thing we saw the microwave guns we saw the sound
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:56.720]  cannons back in the g20 in pittsburgh so this is nothing new they're worried that people are finally
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:01.040]  getting the message of what's really going on and they're definitely pissed as hell of what the
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:04.640]  the information we're putting out at the border right now uh jones i can tell you that for sure
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:09.360]  i didn't mean to go off on a jag for like two hours of the show just so angry but you know
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:13.840]  you got the border patrol you got the fishing wall a lot of other really the bad guys the state police
[03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:21.120]  doing bad stuff the first day so then i got the report and we we augmented it i'm not so much
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:24.960]  corrected it but at first i was like why is the board patrol a bunch of good people they're
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:29.040]  warning us they get us down there and then they arrest us but that was lost in translation it
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:34.160]  really wasn't my mistake but but we updated it where it was fishing wildlife just just just claiming
[03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:37.520]  they're in charge you can't be anywhere near the border in fact they told them just don't go anywhere
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:42.400]  on the river period just don't don't show the illegals for us that's only loading them on buses
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:46.560]  that's what they have yeah they put them on buses to take them to the buses to release them rob
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:52.000]  no it's totally ridiculous and that and we're considered the criminals that's how the press
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:56.480]  by going down a lot of these fishing wildlife idiots it's all about this woman's power trip
[03:11:56.480 --> 03:12:00.160]  yeah for two hours haven't put their hands on their hands she doesn't even know how to handle a
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:04.480]  firearm that's the that's the scary thing this is a federal officer who's supposed to know how
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:09.120]  to handle a firearm doesn't know how to even handle it it's it's totally amazing but she
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:13.520]  knows how to put a tv dinner in the microwave oh yeah yeah you know that you know that she's
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:17.600]  probably surprised one of those giant big gulps that are like this big she's probably like a
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:23.200]  10-up poster at janet rena on a bikini on her wall i mean it's truly disgusting what we have to deal
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:28.160]  with as press and this is the same thing i've seen you just treat fellow americans who you know
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:32.080]  who we are they've admitted the database oh we know who you are we know your press yeah oh we're
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:36.720]  gonna arrest you like no because they've got orders to treat us bad because we're good people well
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:40.560]  because we're uncovering the program we're uncovering the fact that they're completing the smuggling
[03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:45.440]  process and they're letting the drugs in i mean that's it there's that's the only reason you would
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:49.920]  have an open borders if you have deals to keep these drugs flooding exactly and they're mad that
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:53.680]  we keep showing the drugs coming across and then and then trump talks about it they're pissed and
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:57.680]  even the border patrol i put in that video the border patrol talking about the tons of marijuana
[03:12:57.680 --> 03:13:02.240]  and cocaine and methamphetamine that they're finding every every month by the way that's only
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:07.520]  20% they stop exactly according to the now now there's a video you put together showing i forget
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:12.800]  the headline but why obama once reporters arrested reporting on border uh is that video in the
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:17.600]  article the drudges like it is it's at the bottom and it's called uh let's see this video can convict
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:23.120]  obama of treason and it starts off with trump basically it's kind of i'm gonna play it later
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:27.520]  in the show um it's starting off with trump and then i cut the border patrol guy saying yeah we
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:32.880]  get a lot of drugs and then i show him um uh completing well that's a great video but but if
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:38.080]  you say something like this trump convicts obama of treason new video it'll get like five million
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:43.040]  if we don't we'll get like a five hundred thousand got it or we could doppelgang it and say read at
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:48.480]  the bottom to see why obama doesn't want press on the border he wants to continue the illegal
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:52.800]  operation but i mean we've confirmed that right we have not bragging it shows how pathetic it is
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:59.360]  to beat the globalist we've been down there it's mainly info wars and stuff's happening it's us
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:04.240]  doing it with drudge posting it drudges the other part of the equation yeah drudgereport.com
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:09.120]  just a few patriotic sites and and we're hurting their whole agenda right so of course they want
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:14.160]  to arrest us no drudge gets it drudge gets it while what the problem is bright bar gets it
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:18.560]  they've got reporters down there too people get the people that are really concerned about this
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:22.720]  country don't want to destroy it get it why we have to have a closed border why you have to have a
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:30.080]  secure border there's and jones we've been down there and over near uh big bin they the the mexicans
[03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:34.000]  come back and forth and and illegals are going back and forth and they're giving tickets to people
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:37.120]  drinking beer exactly that's what they're more concerned about they're always more concerned
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:40.240]  about the americans and what they're doing the milk cows because they know that's why they had
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:44.480]  the border patrol check points 90 miles in let's admit it they know we're chops yeah we're dinner
[03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:50.720]  yeah and then that's exactly how they treat us well let's and to be fair the border patrol did
[03:14:50.720 --> 03:14:56.080]  do some harassment yesterday or another day before air stay on wednesday i know it was tuesday
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:01.680]  and then the state police almost ran us over and they just did a lot of that stuff and so we came
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:06.160]  out and said that and then they got lost in translation that it was the fishing wildlife
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:10.240]  that acts like total moron goons yeah so they're the ones that are going to have the issues now
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:14.240]  we're going to state and federal fishing wildlife and we need to shine a light on these people they
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:18.880]  can act like absolute all over the country they're always trying to arrest ted new jen yeah ted
[03:15:18.880 --> 03:15:24.800]  new jen anywhere he goes federal fishing wildlife under orders try to arrest him and they have
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:30.640]  there's no fourth amendment with the fishing wildlife they can go anywhere they want they
[03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:36.000]  could put you down on the ground stick your face in the mud it's disgusting that these federal
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.720]  agencies have more power than the constitution but the meanwhile the constitutional agency like
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:44.960]  the border patrol has been tasked to bring the illegals in and complete the smuggling process
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:49.440]  yeah by the way they obviously don't like doing it they don't want to do it because they're speaking
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:53.520]  out jones they're speaking out about they're like please we need to we need to shine a light on this
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:15:58.160]  did you add the clip with the war patrol agent says they complete the smuggling process of course
[03:15:58.160 --> 03:16:03.280]  of course the hanity clip yes well good because people forget all this and i know no this is a
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:10.320]  good compilation this is one of our best and of just showing the blatant disregard for our basic
[03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:15.040]  laws hey guess what i have to pay my taxes or they take me away from my family that's the
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:18.640]  argument they use how are we going to split up families you break the law i'm sorry but the
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:23.520]  illegals just walk across exactly they say oh this is some magic wildlife preserve we're going to
[03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:28.400]  arrest you with the illegals walking behind our people while they're with their families we're
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:34.240]  going to reunite them they have family over here in in new york i got a guy just send me a photo
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:40.320]  of a store in hartlem it says refugees welcome a sticker so that's the new thing it's trendy to
[03:16:40.320 --> 03:16:46.560]  just be friend illegals what about when the irs started taking my grandparents little three bedroom
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:51.200]  humble home which they didn't even know the money it turned out and then made my grandfather have
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:55.440]  a heart attack and stuff right you know where was the love for us you know we're not refugees but
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:17:00.080]  we didn't have any money yeah no you're you're an american citizen you're a milk cow that's
[03:17:00.080 --> 03:17:05.760]  how they see i'm a mark as a dumbass i'm marked as it is as food that's what they want it's it's
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:09.360]  totally disgusting and then you got hillary clinton who breaks the law and they admit it
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:12.720]  in the damn press conference and they go well we don't we don't think we should file charges no
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:17.520]  prosecutor would do this i don't think i've been arrested all over the country peacefully demonstrating
[03:17:18.240 --> 03:17:22.160]  because of my white privilege and then all these so-called leftist groups run around attacking
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:25.760]  people they don't get in trouble right i mean i'm i'm really looking for this white privilege to do
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:31.440]  i'm i want to discover it as soon as i can it has to be mined in the minds of moria i think
[03:17:31.440 --> 03:17:35.520]  oh i mean i'm sure it goes on at some levels you know i'm the countryside or something but
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:42.800]  you know all i know is massive change is coming oh yeah and and and people say well you ought to
[03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:46.480]  be glad hillary's probably gonna get in you know you'll get more listeners i i could care less i
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:53.280]  would love to for things to get so good in this world that we were obsolete i would shut this down
[03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:58.800]  and i would go run a nursery or something i love plants you know i'd be snowboarding
[03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:02.800]  well i've been hanging money though i mean i would i would run a nursery or something i'm
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:07.040]  serious i i mean that people ask what i like to do i mean if i had my brothers i'd be gardening
[03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:11.760]  and i know i see you spraying that plant you dawdle on that plant at your house all the time
[03:18:11.760 --> 03:18:16.720]  i have a bunch of points that's the one the living room yeah well pat riley gave it to me it was
[03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:22.240]  like this gigantic jade plant that's like eight feet tall so i'm trying to keep it alive because
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:25.360]  i can't put it outside so there's only light coming in from the living room and i gotta like
[03:18:25.360 --> 03:18:30.160]  put another light on the other side you know and i'm sitting there spraying it so the plant's doing
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:36.480]  well actually this is very important broadcast right now i think i think this is releasing
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:43.600]  of tension john this is the really all everything else and fire lilies too like i want a big koi pond
[03:18:45.360 --> 03:18:52.160]  and see we could have it all if if we keep hillary out of office it'll boggle my mind if after this
[03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:58.320]  that she's still at it 93 percent of the people in an abc poll think she's guilty 93 percent 93
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:04.000]  percent that's an overwhelming majority that's the good news is even leftist are kind of going
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:08.080]  let me find a good idea to have somebody by the law dude i'm going to hand this baton over to you
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:11.600]  and the callers and and everything else in the clip you're going to play the articles up on

[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:21.280]  percent of us 20 to 40 percent off on the high quality swarable foods you need them folks plus
[03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:25.200]  it supports the broadcast it's a no-brainer everybody should be self-sufficient they want to
[03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:30.560]  make us dependent we need to be independent so all the major survival goods for shortwave radios
[03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:35.600]  and on gmo seeds to survival shield x2 they're 20 to 40 percent off that will extend till next

[03:24:56.720 --> 03:25:00.880]  because i'm scrolling up and down anyway putin's taking the kid goes off he's trying to warn these
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:05.520]  journalists that they're being lied to and that there's going to be a world war he was in a meeting
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:11.280]  with foreign journalists at the uh st petersburg international economic forum and he said uh
[03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:21.040]  we're not heading down a course which could lead to nuclear war which takes us to this story over
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:30.080]  here let's see silicon valley elites buying huge amounts of land for secret compounds
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:35.680]  and i guarantee these compounds are going to go down deep below they're buying missile silos
[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:40.400]  they're setting them up for people to hide in because they know something's coming they've
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:46.320]  been reading the metrics there they have the uh predictive programming systems in place according
[03:25:46.320 --> 03:25:49.520]  to silicon valley insider the new vorice are buying up huge amounts of land so they can build
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:54.640]  private compounds to seclude themselves from the general public you know like mark zirkeberg says
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:59.680]  we don't need a fence around the country yet he builds a fence around his home in san francisco
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:05.120]  then he goes to hawaii and builds a fence around this large swath of land there but we don't need
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:09.840]  a wall around the country because we need to destroy this country they're all part of a plan
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:17.840]  i'm gonna go to uh james in south carolina he wants to talk about the hillary fbi scandal james
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:27.040]  what's on your mind hey robert uh just my thought is that the whole judicial judicial system needs
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:34.080]  to be changed and overwritten uh if hillary's gonna get off of what she's done then all the
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:41.840]  criminals in the prison or jail system that is nonviolent needs to be let go
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:49.760]  yeah and we just need to rewrite the whole judicial system wall i mean it's like some laws
[03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:55.200]  are are uh you know voluntary i guess you know like illegals can just come over and we give them
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:59.040]  bus tickets into the center of the the country that's okay you know because we don't want to
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:02.880]  split up families but you know you don't pay your taxes they're going to put you in jail you sell
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:07.360]  drugs that they bring in illegally that you know like marijuana you get put in jail you get separated
[03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:13.360]  from your family those laws we have to follow because there's a milk cow money in in those you
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:18.000]  know we got to be treated like we're little milk cows but illegals come in man you know let's give
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:21.200]  them a free bus ticket where they want to go let's give them a driver's license let's let them vote
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:28.080]  you're absolutely right james just need to rewrite the whole judicial system law and uh
[03:27:28.640 --> 03:27:35.520]  let those people that sell drugs uh that get put in jail uh that done far less i mean martha
[03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:42.000]  stewart done far less and got 10 years correct right yeah she lied they said she lied it wasn't
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:47.120]  even that she broke the law it was it was one they were talking to her she she lied is what they're
[03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:55.760]  saying then didn't hillary just lie yeah to the FBI that we got the story from kid daniels hillary
[03:27:55.760 --> 03:28:02.480]  faces perjury criminal probe for lying about emails to congress that just went up from kid daniels
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:08.560]  so apparently she's not out of the woods yet i like this the fact that this keeps getting
[03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:11.840]  brought out but you know people are still going to vote for hillary because she's a woman it doesn't
[03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:17.680]  matter if she's a criminal yeah there was a guy that was about to testify and and in some weird
[03:28:17.680 --> 03:28:22.240]  scheme they had where they were bringing money from china he was a u-in official a barbell fell
[03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:27.760]  on his neck and the person who gave the cause of death didn't even look at the body i mean we'll go
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:34.160]  there's stuff called proper procedure it's like when when uh the supreme court justice died scalia
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:38.560]  down in texas they're just like oh bring the body to a Paso let's not examine it let's just get him
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:43.760]  out of here you know there's no investigation when it comes to these high-profile people
[03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:48.720]  it's just shut up and listen to what we say not watch what we do james thanks for calling

[03:29:39.360 --> 03:29:42.720]  ID and they shot him i mean we don't know all the particulars because we'll probably never see the
[03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:47.600]  body camera but you know we're fought the people that follow the laws are the ones that get picked
[03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:51.600]  on and sick and sicked on by the government we'll be back with morris is rob do with the alex jones

[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:24.320]  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of
[03:30:24.320 --> 03:30:32.880]  the people to alter or to abolish it and institute new government independence isn't a day it's a
[03:30:32.880 --> 03:30:38.800]  mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent i will not be your slave dependence and

[03:34:09.280 --> 03:34:14.480]  we're making such purchases like airstrips and redoubts everywhere because they think they need
[03:34:14.480 --> 03:34:20.080]  to get away from the first install riots that were erupt as a result of the widening widening
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:25.120]  wealth inequality which is that it's worse and virtually all developed countries since the 1980s
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:31.120]  this is uh something they've caused and there you can read more about it in this article silicon

[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:37.120]  is the video what happened so while with it you probably read it it was in drudge who's great
[03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:43.120]  by the way drudge is amazing but the story in drudge and big story it's all over the place now
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:52.720]  guys swimming across and big bags of stuff drugs swimming across the river right swimming right
[03:36:52.720 --> 03:36:59.200]  across and they put the drugs and actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:03.200]  because they thought they were going to be killed because they're showing this on camera the guys
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:08.080]  carrying bags of stuff it was drugs on that topic of the drugs it's not just people coming over but
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:13.680]  bringing drugs on a general let's say a month what type of drugs do you encounter and what
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:20.800]  quantities uh the the most common is marijuana we see thousands upon thousands of pounds weekly
[03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:25.360]  we do see a lot of cocaine we said we're starting to see heroin and meth a lot more
[03:37:25.360 --> 03:37:29.440]  usually those were reserved for the ports of entry but now they started running those across the
[03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:35.280]  river as well what happened to today in particular is that the board of patrol dropped off some they
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:40.960]  call them detainees but obviously they're not detained after they dropped them off and normally
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:46.960]  they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior well today apparently
[03:37:46.960 --> 03:37:51.680]  for some logistical reasons some of them didn't hadn't had transportation arranged or their
[03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:58.000]  transportation is tomorrow right and so we're having to find places to shelter for tonight
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:02.800]  so we've accessed some resources that we have we're going to shelter them here tonight so
[03:38:02.800 --> 03:38:06.560]  why is the board of patrol bringing them here they're not bringing them here they're bringing
[03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:11.200]  them to our bus terminal because that's where the board of patrol understands that they have
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:16.400]  transportation to go to the interior right so the dropping them off is our understanding
[03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:22.400]  that they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets um turns out some of them
[03:38:22.400 --> 03:38:27.440]  didn't tonight didn't have their ticket or didn't have their voucher or like i said their buses
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:33.280]  until tomorrow so they got nowhere to stay our bus terminal buyers i mean the city of mcallin
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:38.560]  bus terminal is not a 24 seven operation right so we've got to put them up somewhere else so
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:44.160]  for tonight we're doing the best we can with this resource which thankfully one of our neighboring
[03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:48.160]  cities right made available to us and we're going to put them up through their mind tomorrow we'll
[03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:51.920]  have a little chat with the board of patrol and see what's going on they're supposed to be protecting
[03:38:51.920 --> 03:38:56.720]  this border you mean aiding and abetting what do you mean specifically actually what's happening
[03:38:56.720 --> 03:39:01.840]  is that the federal government is actually completing the smuggling cycle uh by having a
[03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:07.520]  parent sending their their child to the u.s border have them having them smuggled uh that is only
[03:39:07.520 --> 03:39:17.440]  part of the smuggling cycle okay how long was your journey to get here we took us two months
[03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:24.240]  we were working and working on the way up until we got here where we're at we just want to complete
[03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:36.000]  the journey we're already tired and thirsty hungry we'll get where we want to go but it's getting
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:45.200]  impossible as far as the people coming over are your agents encountering in type of infectious
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:49.680]  diseases people with illnesses as they cross the border oh most definitely we see a tuberculosis
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:57.760]  pretty regularly scabies more often than not we have large amounts of infectious diseases as far
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:04.560]  as scabies go and the interesting part with that is it's it's not actually seen on the body during
[03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:08.800]  the infectious period and so these people clear through our system and then they go into the
[03:40:08.800 --> 03:40:15.440]  rest of the country with that disease we see a lot of measles a lot of chickenpox a lot of
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:20.640]  unidentified illnesses that that you know a lot of uh lung infections that we have no idea what they
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:35.760]  are so the state police have just started following us we get hassled for being out here we're just
[03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:42.160]  talking to what was your Alma down there oh my god is there anything where are you headed south
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:48.240]  oh okay so we can't go anywhere in here at all
[03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:59.200]  okay all right well we'll sit out there thanks news or journalists i already told them yes and they
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:10.480]  were from on us how long have you been traveling how long have you been traveling they've been
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:16.080]  traveling per month now when are they get into the u.s when they get on to the United States
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:25.760]  well you know one in five people that we catch has uh has some type of criminal history here in the
[03:41:25.760 --> 03:41:30.560]  united states on top of that we only catch 40 percent of what's coming across this actual
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:36.880]  in this area so that's 20 percent of what we catch are known bad guys you can only imagine what the
[03:41:36.880 --> 03:41:41.200]  other 60 percent of people that are coming across who they are or what their plans are we have no idea
[03:41:41.920 --> 03:41:46.240]  the interesting part is they're not staying here in the Rio Grande Valley a lot of these folks are
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:51.680]  using it as a waypoint to move forward whether it's the people themselves or drugs it's all going
[03:41:51.680 --> 03:41:56.400]  through the area and it's going into larger communities like uh the San Antonio's the
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:01.680]  austin's the dallas all the way up to virginia maryland uh dc chicago they're all headed that way
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:09.840]  last night and before we know it two uh state wildlife and look who's treated like criminals
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:16.320]  reporters are treated like criminals and then we had to sit up and wait on another federal agent
[03:42:16.320 --> 03:42:22.080]  to come in who is a federal even though we get the border patrol saying the 20 percent that they catch
[03:42:22.720 --> 03:42:26.480]  have criminal records in this country that doesn't mean they could there could be another
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:32.400]  percentage that's criminals in their country that's why they're fleeing to the united states and
[03:42:32.400 --> 03:42:37.120]  donald trump is a racist for saying criminals come across the border and you got a border patrol
[03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:41.280]  saying it agent he's saying it right there that's 20 percent of what they catch and they say the
[03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:48.640]  only catch 40 percent of what's coming across so let those numbers spin in your head as we talk to
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:58.080]  ben in illinois go ahead ben oh hello hi thanks for holding can you hear me okay sure can go ahead
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:05.040]  okay i just uh earlier i was going to comment on the fact that uh they're apparently going to be
[03:43:05.040 --> 03:43:11.520]  forcing people to put transgendered back to our unisex bathrooms and churches and i'm just i
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:17.200]  obviously don't see how that's going to work in a muslim religion you know yeah or or you'll lose
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:24.640]  your vaunted 501c3 status which basically just makes you a ward of the state anyway and um yeah
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:30.800]  they're they're going to try to push this on everybody and if you don't have it if you have
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:33.600]  men and women's bathrooms you're going to have to put it in another bathroom how much is that going
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:39.680]  to cost on an existing place you're adding new plumbing it's ridiculous yeah totally agree you
[03:43:39.680 --> 03:43:46.560]  got anything else to add yeah uh we're they're talking about her being a Hillary being Jezebel
[03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:53.280]  and stuff like that and if i was to ever give her an allegorical uh name it would definitely be uh
[03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:58.320]  the the horrible Babylon i mean she's uh especially in the fact that she's riding the
[03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:03.040]  feats that she's created through isis and everything it's like it's like perfectly
[03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:06.960]  aligned up with the bible and she's drunk with the blood of the saints for sure but even though
[03:44:06.960 --> 03:44:13.360]  that more likely means uh the roman church and yada yada yada and obama certainly filling the
[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:18.720]  role of anti christ i'm not saying he is but boy when he's walking around in his pocket all the
[03:44:18.720 --> 03:44:23.840]  he's doing his best religion you know yeah he's doing his best to destroy this country he hates
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:30.320]  this country he hates everything it stands for and uh he would like to see it go away and become
[03:44:30.320 --> 03:44:36.640]  you know a muslim multicultural nation that lets anything and everything come by except if you have
[03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:41.120]  if you have christian values well those are wrong but throwing gays off buildings that's okay
[03:44:41.120 --> 03:44:46.560]  okay thanks for calling ben let's go to denet in new york denet what's on your mind
[03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:55.360]  hi yes i have two concerns uh the first one is while we're focusing on hillary uh congress
[03:44:55.360 --> 03:45:01.760]  is focusing on gun laws i was watching c span yesterday and they're in the process and i'm
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:06.560]  very concerned so i don't know if your show can keep a watch on and keep us up to date because
[03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:10.960]  i'm concerned that they're going to be taking out guns or find a way where the un can come
[03:45:10.960 --> 03:45:15.840]  the back way and take our guns away and with all these people coming in our country and we don't
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:20.400]  know who's here we really need to keep you know protect our second amendment do you know that
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:25.600]  they're now while we're you know watching hillary they're doing all that gun laws right now oh i know
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:29.920]  it's what they all that's their favorite scheme is to throw something out there to keep people
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:34.080]  talking about it and then they come in with oh we're going to pass massive immigration laws or
[03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:39.520]  gun laws yeah we actually sent uh jacari jackson went to interview michael cargill who's a local gun
[03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:45.280]  gun shop owner here and firearms instructor to talk about what's going on in california and
[03:45:45.280 --> 03:45:48.160]  all those new gun laws that they are pushing through so yeah that'll be on the nightly news
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:52.720]  tonight if you're not a member of prison planet tv you can become a member very easily go to
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:58.800]  prisonplanet.tv and you can get a membership and watch the nightly news live at 7 p.m when it goes

[03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:08.000]  we are always keeping an eye on our second amendment because that is the amendment that protects all
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  the rest and if you don't believe it just go to other countries and see how they're treated
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:16.560]  hey guys let's go to that hillary clinton video that darin mcbreen put together
[03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:23.360]  this is the one i think it's in her own words is what it's called get that ready let's go to this
[03:46:24.080 --> 03:46:30.080]  call from tony in idaho tony how's it going i know you guys in idaho have a lot of immigrants
[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:35.120]  that they bring up there there's actually a big uh well to do going on in twin falls with this rape
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:42.640]  of a young girl and how that's being covered up yeah absolutely uh uh yeah it's it's pretty bad
[03:46:42.640 --> 03:46:48.320]  there's one talk show host here running a big campaign against it but i don't know what good
[03:46:48.320 --> 03:46:54.480]  he's doing uh i wanted to talk to you about uh this deal whether arrested go big defense and
[03:46:55.120 --> 03:47:02.720]  basically sold his money we get right down to it oh yeah uh i think we should start taking pictures
[03:47:02.720 --> 03:47:08.560]  names and and badge numbers of these people you know uh these people have said they're going to
[03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:13.760]  destroy the population of the earth basically well god is not going to allow them to do that there's
[03:47:13.760 --> 03:47:19.440]  going to be an end to what they're doing here when there's an end there should be uh nuremberg
[03:47:19.440 --> 03:47:24.880]  style trials and there's not going to be any uh operation paperclip for these people they need
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:30.320]  to know that they are going to be put on trial that we know who they are and they need to know
[03:47:30.320 --> 03:47:34.800]  that if they lose this that's what they're going to be looking forward to right there well they're
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:39.680]  meant their men is the fodder because they're the ones doing the orders they're doing the bidding
[03:47:39.680 --> 03:47:43.920]  of the people up above who are uh telling them that oh we're going to let the illegals and we're
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:48.480]  going to let the drugs in reporters come around treat them like they're criminals treat them like
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:54.800]  they're bad because that's how that's how we destroy a country by having a servant class
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:47:59.600]  doing the bidding of the evil ones up above and that is basically what you have yeah those people
[03:47:59.600 --> 03:48:04.240]  need to go on trial they took an oath to defend the constitution at least they used to whenever you
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:08.880]  become a federal officer and i don't know if they do that anymore hey guys let's roll that clip let's
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:14.560]  hear hillary in her own words convict herself in the court of public opinion ladies and gentlemen
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:21.440]  the fix is in hillary clinton the establishment puppet candidate for president has been cleared
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:30.160]  of all charges by the fbi this just days after bill clinton met secretly with attorney general
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:37.680]  loretta lynch on a private plane look this woman is a criminal she destroyed subpoenaed
[03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:45.840]  evidence i mean this has already been established and doing so is a felony crime the fbi knows it
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:53.600]  the media knows it and the public knows it so it's not a matter of if hillary clinton is guilty
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:49:01.120]  it's a matter of why she isn't being tried and convicted this investigation began as a referral
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:06.960]  from the intelligence community inspector general in connection with secretary clinton's use of a
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:13.360]  personal email server during her time as secretary of state the referral focused on whether classified
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:19.520]  information was transmitted on that personal system our investigation looked at whether there is
[03:49:19.520 --> 03:49:25.760]  evidence that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system
[03:49:26.400 --> 03:49:31.760]  in violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified information
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:38.480]  either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way i did not email any
[03:49:38.480 --> 03:49:46.480]  um classified material to anyone on my email there is no classified material from the group
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:56.640]  of 30 000 emails returned to the state department in 2014 110 emails in 52 email chains have been
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:03.840]  determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:08.400]  the facts are pretty clear i did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:14.480]  eight of those chains hillary is using common core math secret at she says nothing they were sent

[03:54:32.880 --> 03:54:39.600]  but here's donald trump doubling down on that right now which is fine i i said you shouldn't
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:44.160]  have taken it down you know they took the star down i said too bad you should have left it up
[03:54:44.720 --> 03:54:49.280]  i would have rather defended it just leave it up and say no that's not a star that's just a star
[03:54:49.280 --> 03:54:54.960]  i talked about corrupt hillary corrupt hillary but she sent it out she said oh this is sorry
[03:54:54.960 --> 03:54:59.760]  she's the one that started the dialogue you know why because she wanted to get off the fbi
[03:55:00.880 --> 03:55:06.960]  and you know who got hurt worse by the fbi than anybody birdie sanders because he was waiting
[03:55:07.760 --> 03:55:14.480]  for the fbi to make him the nominee fbi primary all right there's trump and notice he's behind
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:18.080]  a bunch of stars that aren't anti-semitic but let's talk about the hypocrisy a little more
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:22.800]  and then i'm gonna try to finish up with your calls obama's civilian drone death count up
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:29.920]  500 higher than us mass shootings so when he goes on tv and does his fake crocodile tears and cries
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:36.240]  about the shootings that are happening in this country there it is he kills more than 500 more
[03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:40.320]  with his little drones that he signs off on and they kill not and that's just the civilians he's
[03:55:40.320 --> 03:55:48.320]  killing okay like the young boy who who is uh dad was anwar alalaki he got killed in a dream 16-year-old
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:53.280]  boy hey who cares you know kill a wedding party and who cares i'm the president i'm allowed it's
[03:55:53.280 --> 03:55:58.720]  hypocritical okay we need to hold these people's feet to the fire let's go to tim in wyoming liberals
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:04.320]  at the borders what's going on tim yes hi rob thanks for taking my call i appreciate it now i
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:09.440]  wanted to mention really quick now there's a libertarian show that i like to talk on i like
[03:56:09.440 --> 03:56:14.640]  to call into and the host of the show actually had the view and i'm not sure if this is a libertarian
[03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:20.240]  view specifically but they seem to think that the united states of america the government of the us of
[03:56:20.240 --> 03:56:26.320]  a is an experiment that's failed and the borders should be open and we should be allowed allowing
[03:56:26.320 --> 03:56:30.640]  everybody from everywhere and i try to make the point to them that if we don't have borders we
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:34.960]  don't have a country that's the whole that's the whole point i try to get across to them but
[03:56:34.960 --> 03:56:39.520]  they're very they're very reluctant to understand that for some reason i'm not sure if that's a
[03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:44.880]  if that's a literal libertarian perspective that have well you know jesse ventura i think
[03:56:44.880 --> 03:56:50.080]  has the same perspective that we shouldn't have borders but um you know we have all these rules
[03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:54.160]  in place and i wouldn't mind if people came into this country but i don't think they should get
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:56:59.440]  anything free if you go to a country you're supposed to help build it up not help drag it down and i
[03:56:59.440 --> 03:57:04.480]  think bringing a bunch of people into act as anchors are to our economy is not the way to go
[03:57:04.480 --> 03:57:11.040]  thanks for calling let's go to josh in wisconsin go ahead josh are you there yeah go ahead hey of
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:17.520]  course um well first of all of course like a um uh ventura and um agree with that um they're big
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:22.800]  strong men but if you take like a a 90 pound woman that can't defend themselves like them
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:28.320]  they might not feel the same way i agree um that's why everybody needs to be armed yeah and what i
[03:57:28.320 --> 03:57:33.760]  want to talk about was um i want to try to uh like maybe start to people thinking about like a posse
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:39.120]  comatotus movement through the sheriff's department and i'd like the sheriff's department to maybe
[03:57:39.120 --> 03:57:47.360]  consider making the citizens aware of their own power through the posse comatotus act okay that's
[03:57:47.360 --> 03:57:53.280]  what i was trying to get across um and i think that um maybe it's also possible that the um our
[03:57:53.280 --> 03:57:59.680]  sheriff department were to deputize specific um like a shooting club martial arts association
[03:57:59.680 --> 03:58:03.920]  stuff like that yeah there was a sheriff i think he was in Idaho who said hey i'll deputize all the
[03:58:03.920 --> 03:58:08.800]  citizens here if you feds don't stop messing with us and that's what we need sheriffs to do we
[03:58:08.800 --> 03:58:13.200]  need real sheriffs in this country greg sorry i'm not going to get to you thanks for calling though
[03:58:13.200 --> 03:58:19.840]  um in pa and incidentally there is a hillary uh protest going on in scranton tomorrow morning

[03:58:24.640 --> 03:58:29.200]  protesting crooked hillary this i think is the first protest and she got off scott free from the
[03:58:29.200 --> 03:58:33.680]  fbi for you know handling classified information in her home server it's okay when she does it but
