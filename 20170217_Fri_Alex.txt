[00:00.000 --> 00:10.920]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show I hear people
[00:10.920 --> 00:17.120]  talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country
[00:17.120 --> 00:26.400]  harping on wars be fighting griping by the way things are big and I don't mind
[00:26.400 --> 00:32.920]  you switching sides and standing up things they believe in when they're
[00:32.920 --> 00:40.240]  running down my country man they're walking on the fight inside of me yeah
[00:40.240 --> 00:48.640]  walking on the fight inside of me running down to where life I'm fighting
[00:48.640 --> 00:59.160]  if you don't love it leave you to let this song I'm singing your warning the
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.520]  United States of America is now open for business now about sovereignty it's
[01:04.520 --> 01:09.680]  now about dealing in good faith being honorable again in the world
[01:09.680 --> 01:19.400]  inspecting us and it's time for us to win though we're set to win but we have
[01:19.400 --> 01:25.280]  to decide that we are not gonna live under the deception of a term that I
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.320]  thought of this morning and and I'm sure because it's such an obvious term that
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.880]  other people thought of it as well but it just hit me and I tweeted it out maybe
[01:34.880 --> 01:40.960]  we can pull that tweet up that the official name of MSM shouldn't just be
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.840]  fake news because they can throw that back and forth on new independent media
[01:45.840 --> 01:49.920]  journalists investigative journalists just somebody that videotaped something
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.480]  that the government doesn't want seen they could just throw fake news back on
[01:54.480 --> 01:57.840]  that you can throw it on them you got to have something that ties them the
[01:57.840 --> 02:03.800]  globalist the big corporate collaborator media to the fact that
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.080]  the mainstream media and that known term and so it's the fake stream media
[02:09.080 --> 02:15.160]  that's it that's the name I've been searching and searching and searching
[02:15.160 --> 02:23.680]  and searching the Soros Inc. controlled corporate media is in full panic from
[02:23.680 --> 02:30.320]  Donald Trump he should call them fake stream media very simple statement very
[02:30.320 --> 02:41.240]  powerful and again if you go back just a month to go on my Twitter all the
[02:41.240 --> 02:46.760]  comments like 97% were positive you go to YouTube it'll get like a 96 97% on
[02:46.760 --> 02:52.760]  average some of those 99% up vote and they're having trouble gaining that
[02:52.760 --> 02:55.760]  because that's just a solid vote but when it comes to Twitter just like you see
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.800]  with Trump Paul wrote about it yesterday the first few hundred are negative they just stack it with
[03:00.800 --> 03:05.320]  it on the rhythm to say you're an idiot to shout you down like you're under peer
[03:05.320 --> 03:09.080]  pressure like oh my gosh I'm not getting good feedback now because Zuckerberg's
[03:09.080 --> 03:13.080]  been talking about this and one of his manifestos is out he thinks we're so
[03:13.080 --> 03:16.440]  stupid we won't read it he admits I'm gonna track your private communications
[03:16.440 --> 03:20.600]  I'm gonna rip you off I'm gonna hurt you so these people are predators or
[03:20.600 --> 03:27.080]  super predators so they can't ever hide just their disdain you go watch a movie
[03:27.080 --> 03:30.560]  you know a comic book movie and it shows the villain going I will destroy the
[03:30.560 --> 03:37.600]  now yes that's actually what it's like we're dealing with megalomaniacs so you
[03:37.600 --> 03:40.680]  grow up as a kid thinking all that's just cartoons but real villains actually
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.840]  go screw everyone over I'll destroy everyone everyone will be poor with me
[03:44.840 --> 03:48.320]  I'll run everything I mean that's who these people are and we'll have suicide
[03:48.320 --> 03:51.080]  nets around the Apple factories and drug everyone and then just shoot them in
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.200]  the back of the head and throw them in a gutter when we're done sell everybody's
[03:54.200 --> 04:04.080]  organs it's all coming out I got stacks of it here today just where they're
[04:04.080 --> 04:13.840]  just throwing it in your face it's amazing but when we come back I'm gonna
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.240]  hit it all the press conference to end all press conferences but watch the next
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.080]  will be even better he just smoothly walked down and absolutely butchered
[04:23.080 --> 04:29.240]  them and just made a big joke out of the MSM or the fake stream medium but just
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.960]  look at that now now everywhere it's to make us feel bad because they don't want
[04:33.960 --> 04:37.440]  us to be verified and realize that we're the majority of the world's waking up
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.400]  and nationalism is taking place so they admit that they're quote rolling out
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.480]  massive censorship against nationalists against populist and against
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.680]  patriots I mean this is a true information war we'll be right back I'm
[04:50.680 --> 04:53.280]  Alex Jones
[04:58.160 --> 05:02.160]  in a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy a day without
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.080]  immigrants has been declared nationwide today February 16th 2017 will go down in
[05:07.080 --> 05:11.280]  history as a day without immigrants look around you is that person an immigrant
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.320]  imagine if they were just gone but wait a second this ideal or illustration
[05:15.320 --> 05:18.680]  doesn't make sense president Trump is not deporting immigrants in fact I'm yet
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.160]  to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants so our
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.400]  citizens of the US that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest
[05:26.400 --> 05:30.000]  for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.320]  immigrant an interesting notion or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.760]  white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.720]  to virtue signal against Trump or will non-citizens show up and proudly
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.080]  announced that they work here illegally the goal of this protest is to display
[05:44.080 --> 05:47.560]  how imperative immigrants are to society guess we will find that out real
[05:47.560 --> 05:51.400]  quick or we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a
[05:51.400 --> 05:55.280]  better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they

[08:48.680 --> 08:52.560]  the 20-year-old liners when I talk about coming to you from deep behind enemy
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.560]  lines we have already restored much of Texas beginning to restore the federal
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.080]  government this constitutional role and I am brown broadcasting though from the
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.840]  model United Nations City in the world for how they want to rip off and control

[09:28.680 --> 09:39.520]  for joining us today Trump continues to amaze and he's doing it all he hasn't
[09:39.520 --> 09:42.180]  even gotten his cabinet in yet and he's already done more to restore this
[09:42.180 --> 09:46.320]  Republic in just a month than I've ever seen by any other modern president it
[09:46.320 --> 09:52.440]  is truly remarkable and his press conference was just absolutely over
[09:52.440 --> 10:00.720]  the top and you're gonna see more of this and thank God he came out and said
[10:00.720 --> 10:06.520]  what I have been begging the people to contact the president and you just
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.920]  did a mass wave and say look the Communist Chinese admittedly funded
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.320]  Hillary they bragged about it and told America you better not elect Trump and
[10:14.320 --> 10:17.640]  we're in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times and PC World and
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.960]  everywhere saying we're helping Zuckerberg and others develop plans to
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.080]  censor America and our media is like yes China knows how to deal with people
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.680]  yeah they kill them after they silence them and boy they're gonna help us shut
[10:30.680 --> 10:39.280]  down the alt-right it's like whoa you guys are true criminals you just are
[10:39.280 --> 10:46.240]  absolutely bottomless pits of anti-American anti-freedom anti-liberal
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.200]  garbage calling yourselves liberal support in China that kills political
[10:50.200 --> 10:53.040]  dissidents because they're Buddhist and sells their organs and that wants to
[10:53.040 --> 10:56.640]  censor America and is buying up Hollywood is not liberal you know what
[10:56.640 --> 11:02.400]  it's a bullying cult I agreed to let the New York Times come here for a piece
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.880]  because some of my sources say that this business writer is somewhat fair so I
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.720]  said okay I'll do an occasional piece we get requests every day obviously from
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.440]  the New York Times you name it almost every day from the New York Times hundreds
[11:14.440 --> 11:20.200]  of writers and the lady comes she's a local officer photographer and she does
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.680]  it for the New York Times and she's real nice here about 45 minutes and then
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.600]  she's leaving and I said hey give me your car to your info and you know
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.680]  sometimes maybe take photos for us he said oh for money right she's been real
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.960]  nice until that point I said well of course yeah we pay people and I was like
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.320]  oh are you oh because we're Trump supporters you probably could she was
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.320]  yeah I can't be politically involved in something like that and I said even when
[11:41.320 --> 11:44.240]  I put your name on it I said I'm not begging you to come take photos for us
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.560]  but you know is that you is that you're being bullied you you might lose your
[11:49.560 --> 11:52.200]  liberal contracts and she was just basically without saying yes kind of
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.440]  nodded her head I just looked at her and it just was a bad feeling that we're in
[11:56.440 --> 12:02.360]  a cult the leftist here with Robert Rodriguez and the in the films community
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.480]  that's here in Austin people walk in here and they go Alex Jones oh I can't do
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.640]  any lighting or work or set work or setting up your for your repair anything
[12:11.640 --> 12:15.880]  I'm talking about electricians they go or Robert Rodriguez will you have me
[12:15.880 --> 12:22.520]  blackballed this is a mafia in my view and it just shows how disgusting they
[12:22.520 --> 12:27.240]  are I mean that's why I looked at her and I said you know Trump's a great man I
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.960]  said hundreds of other countries have dirty coal systems that supply them
[12:32.960 --> 12:36.800]  cheap energy like China we have clean burning coal where nothing comes out
[12:36.800 --> 12:43.360]  the carbon dioxide and ox and water vapor and I said our power prices on
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.160]  average have doubled the last eight years close to a thousand plants have been
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.480]  shut down what he did is going to really help poor people and businesses
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.560]  everybody else give the competition comes back in and those plants get fired
[12:54.560 --> 12:58.840]  back up there'll be competition your prices will plunge and then that means
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.000]  again more jobs come back as you can do business here duh if China has three
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.160]  times cheaper electricity what happens to America just like I moved to an area
[13:09.160 --> 13:15.040]  with you know the warehouse district of Austin because it has some of the cheapest
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.520]  real estate and it's an industrial area it's zoned I even get cheaper
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.200]  electricity most people don't even know how that stuff works the point is is that
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.440]  America is gonna get zoned now to be competitive there's global zoning that's
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.680]  what agenda 21 is and Trump's like this is BS man everything's against us that's
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.480]  the plan they've written books on it they admit it that's what you're seeing
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.480]  being blown up right now and Trump goes out in his press conference the second
[13:42.480 --> 13:45.040]  one and just goes look got the coal miners here we're gonna do this in the
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.080]  media all spends it Trump signs bill undoing Obama coal mining rule and then
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.440]  the media spends it to allow them to dump toxic waste in rivers that's
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.040]  completely illegal they have big contained slurry pools that they put it
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.160]  into and then every once in a while one of them breaks that's what happens with
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.840]  industry and life on this planet but they're trying to say any water runoff
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.560]  period is illegal making it impossible remember like six years ago Obama wanted
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.560]  to ban dust and farming any dust was like what three thousand dollar fines and
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.800]  the next one was twenty thousand just went up and then they they said we're
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.800]  banning child labor you can't take the trash out if you work on a farm you can't
[14:24.800 --> 14:30.560]  you know have somebody under the age of 16 go take eggs from the chickens trying
[14:30.560 --> 14:34.840]  to further kill that and so the media's like oh Trump signed a thing where they
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.520]  could dump toxic waste in the water oh like the EPA didn't get in trouble
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.080]  cyanide runoff from a big goldmine they basically ordered you know changes to
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.280]  then it broke the dam just like the deep water horizon BP just said stop
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.480]  putting concrete in the executives believe waters needed they go sir in 150
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.840]  years of oil exploration nobody's ever done that and the equation show it will
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.480]  blow up they said shut up you Texans and Louisiana's you don't know nothing you
[15:00.480 --> 15:03.880]  go see that movie it's absolutely word-for-word what was in the federal
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.440]  transcripts in the federal trial it's amazingly accurate great movie Kurt
[15:08.440 --> 15:17.320]  Russell and they're like sir it will blow up this is 379 billion dollar
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.640]  company and our British owners told us until it's gonna be fine we're gonna get
[15:21.640 --> 15:28.120]  billions more it's gonna blow up no it's not hey McCain you keep trying to have a
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.840]  war with Russia you can end the planet don't matter I'm gonna do whatever I
[15:31.840 --> 15:39.760]  want it's like this weird spirit of just craziness and that's what we're dealing
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.920]  with so it's just how do I cover today I've got like let's not exaggerate 300
[15:44.920 --> 15:50.880]  articles or more and another stack on my desk of a couple hundred I mean it's
[15:50.880 --> 15:58.180]  just I can just talk for hours about this you can build a cold power plant or
[15:58.180 --> 16:00.800]  try to run one but we will bankrupt you that was eight years ago eight years
[16:00.800 --> 16:04.240]  ago in a couple months he was about to get it he was president elect he's just
[16:04.240 --> 16:07.720]  arrogantly sitting there at San Francisco Chronicle on camera going we're
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.640]  gonna shut everything down how's that sound and we'll move your job to shine
[16:12.640 --> 16:18.840]  how's that sound we own the factories over there I mean you think about how
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.440]  wicked the left is because they've got all the deals with China and it's okay
[16:23.440 --> 16:26.720]  because again they'll have a beard or different colored socks or you know
[16:26.720 --> 16:30.280]  virtue signal and talk about how they fund black lives matter to go around
[16:30.280 --> 16:35.360]  copkilling or whatever and then they're like the most heartable greedy people
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.160]  trying to steal land from Hawaiian tribes just because they wanted or you
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.280]  know running suicide factories I mean you cannot make it up how sickeningly
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.680]  horrible they are and then you read their own white papers I've got articles
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.840]  today about Zuckerberg again the guy that says his users are dumb efforts how
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.680]  he's gonna censor everybody and get your private data and use it and just it's
[16:57.680 --> 17:05.200]  just it's Legion of Doom arrogant crazy power mad maniacs
[17:05.200 --> 17:16.080]  but Trump just absolutely devastated devastated yesterday and they just
[17:16.080 --> 17:19.760]  don't know what to do the confidence and then just the fact that he's up there
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.320]  he says nobody's getting hurt America is just gonna he makes about coal miners
[17:24.320 --> 17:28.800]  jobs and a way of life sure it's about making the people that work hard be in
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.600]  the superheroes not just somebody that dribbles a basketball or you know sings
[17:32.600 --> 17:37.680]  music it's about people and an economy based on people and a world based for
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.280]  people not the post-industrial technocracy where I have a inch thick
[17:42.280 --> 17:46.400]  stack probably 30 articles today or more where they're all saying the end of
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.080]  humans is here you will submit you will merge with machines it's all over we're
[17:50.080 --> 17:54.280]  already spying on everything you do we totally control you it's all over we're
[17:54.280 --> 17:57.720]  gonna censor you remember just a few years ago I was crazy saying all this
[17:57.720 --> 18:00.760]  is gonna happen and now it's everything's happening exactly like I said
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.640]  because drumroll I was reading their white papers
[18:09.640 --> 18:13.360]  Zuckerberg secret plan to use artificial intelligence to censor and spy on
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.400]  you oh it's mainstream news now he's already censoring and spying they're
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.080]  now just going into the normalizing phase the president of the United States is
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.960]  being filtered and blocked on Twitter with the comments and the feedback they
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.440]  don't want the American people being able to send a tweet and it pops up where
[18:31.440 --> 18:35.760]  he's in live time Donald Trump sits there let me get by the big secret you know
[18:35.760 --> 18:42.000]  what I'm not gonna give the secret I'm not because well the media already knows
[18:42.000 --> 18:49.840]  this so I might as well tell people just to tell you how wild this guy is and
[18:49.840 --> 18:55.000]  how real he is he likes to talk to average people so much he sits at the
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.360]  switchboard until two in the morning while he's reading things and randomly
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.800]  sits there and picks up the phone and talks to people he's like an idiot
[19:04.800 --> 19:15.320]  savant workhorse magic code let's get this break and I'm gonna just stop right
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.080]  there and he also sits there and knows phone numbers and basically can like
[19:20.080 --> 19:22.960]  memorize a bunch of numbers he just sits there and sees numbers he knows on the
[19:22.960 --> 19:32.280]  switchboard and then picks it up I mean just that is so cool and the New York
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.600]  Times people are like oh you know about that well don't tell people we won't be
[19:36.600 --> 19:50.160]  able to call the hell with you this is incredible so there you go he's turning
[19:50.160 --> 19:53.400]  the lights back on in America that's the bumper sticker Trump not out to get you
[19:53.400 --> 19:59.320]  Trump turning the lights back on Trump actually carrying Trump not a devil
[19:59.320 --> 20:05.400]  worshipper there's not just evil in the world folks that's what I keep telling
[20:05.400 --> 20:08.240]  people we could take America and the world back and we're starting to do it
[20:08.240 --> 20:13.480]  and he's up there he goes what's wrong with us being able to have coal mines and
[20:13.480 --> 20:17.840]  coal power we developed with the Germans the clean burning coal systems
[20:17.840 --> 20:21.920]  I get the Germans credit they're even better than the US of coal and they
[20:21.920 --> 20:28.840]  don't ever had oil and why shouldn't we have it it's our main energy source
[20:28.840 --> 20:37.040]  2,000 years at our current rates with coal 2,000 years of discovered coal in
[20:37.040 --> 20:46.480]  the United States of America let me tell you how globalism works in 1996 Bill
[20:46.480 --> 20:52.920]  Clinton took close to a million acres of land off the books part of it public
[20:52.920 --> 20:56.800]  part of it private and said you can't dig on it because it had clean burning
[20:56.800 --> 21:01.240]  coal totally clean so you have to put as many scrubbers on it so it's almost like
[21:01.240 --> 21:07.800]  sweet crude comes out closer to gasoline on as much refinery than crude oil
[21:07.800 --> 21:13.200]  it's the same thing with oil with a coal and so it she was just like silver
[21:13.200 --> 21:25.320]  coal just like just you know absolutely pure and overnight the Chinese company
[21:25.320 --> 21:31.040]  that had the only other clean coal like that discovered on earth in China their
[21:31.040 --> 21:35.480]  stock just absolutely quadrupled and more and billions and billions and
[21:35.480 --> 21:41.600]  billions were made that day because our coals off limits China's goes up see
[21:41.600 --> 21:44.400]  that's the type of business the globalist center on and go we create
[21:44.400 --> 21:48.440]  monopolies and shut everything down and prices go up and then we get richer and
[21:48.440 --> 21:52.280]  we're gonna live forever and all of you are gonna die and we're gonna sit up here
[21:52.280 --> 21:58.240]  with all the power and how's that sound oh no need for a manned space program
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.640]  you're all gonna be dead soon we're gonna be gods rake her as well Elon Musk
[22:02.640 --> 22:06.440]  you don't have to merge with machines but you won't exist you won't you won't
[22:06.440 --> 22:11.240]  even be involved we might step on you like a bug I mean we don't want to hurt
[22:11.240 --> 22:16.000]  you but you know we step on bugs just like Apple we step on those poor Chinese
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.720]  and those slave camps slave camps suicide they drug them so they don't commit
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.240]  suicide daily jump off the building kill yourself as their active defiance like
[22:25.240 --> 22:30.120]  self-immolation so maybe you know some people who set themselves on fire so
[22:30.120 --> 22:32.520]  maybe just have a robot firing extinguishers and you know their answer
[22:32.520 --> 22:35.920]  was just box calm we're just getting rid of the humans completely bringing
[22:35.920 --> 22:45.320]  robots in and that's all been failing they want to try to suppress a species
[22:45.320 --> 22:51.760]  of seven and a half billion people and already people are pulling away from the
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.640]  TVs they're pulling away from all the garbage either people are getting deeper
[22:54.640 --> 22:57.400]  into it the mind control or they're pulling away from it and so I should
[22:57.400 --> 23:01.360]  just tell the globalist right now you need to surrender because I got something
[23:01.360 --> 23:09.280]  really important I'm about to tell you the military and the real intelligence
[23:09.280 --> 23:13.480]  operas the people that actually do the jobs to defend this country they know
[23:13.480 --> 23:17.440]  that a bunch of little weak chicken-necked not even a feminine because
[23:17.440 --> 23:23.960]  that's mean to women but but just pedophile model type men who want to
[23:23.960 --> 23:26.800]  dominate everybody and just absolutely hate real men as you can't stand being
[23:26.800 --> 23:31.320]  around them they all admit they're gonna get rid of the military and humans
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.680]  in combat completely very soon that's their admitted goal so they can fully
[23:35.680 --> 23:40.320]  control them and just get rid of men all together that's their ultimate form of
[23:40.320 --> 23:44.520]  domination what are the little control freak nerds do is they just want to get
[23:44.520 --> 23:51.880]  rid of men that I guess made them feel bad their whole lives because they grew
[23:51.880 --> 23:57.560]  up in this whole satanic system and they were hit with the very chemicals
[23:57.560 --> 24:01.520]  everybody else was it just had a bigger effect on them and so now their slaves
[24:01.520 --> 24:04.960]  their own system continuing and increasing it to make everybody else even
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.680]  weaker so they can try to rule over them and so now everybody knows this is the
[24:09.680 --> 24:13.280]  end of humanity all our ancestors everything they did the future all of
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.880]  it if we do this this act of of killing the species and that transmission has
[24:19.880 --> 24:27.240]  now gone out and from Le Pen to Farage to Trump to everybody you're going to
[24:27.240 --> 24:31.960]  now start hearing it oh look at this cancer cure oh look at this technology
[24:31.960 --> 24:34.560]  oh look at this rolled out look at this oh look what we're going to have
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.560]  companies bid on this this system that DARPA developed for communications or
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.600]  medicine or you name it Trump's like we're not going to sit here and balance
[24:43.600 --> 24:47.280]  the power with everybody and only roll out our 20 year old 30 year old
[24:47.280 --> 24:51.840]  equipment 40 year old stuff we're going to roll out the secret weapons we're
[24:51.840 --> 24:54.960]  letting everybody know we're completely absolutely dominant there's a breakaway
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.760]  civilization the Russians know it in horror and they're smart they've got a
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.080]  lot of advanced stuff but they know the magic sparks in this country ladies and
[25:04.080 --> 25:12.800]  gentlemen the Promethean fire fell here and that's the truth so they want I mean
[25:12.800 --> 25:15.400]  that's why the elites are on such power trips because they're just trying to
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.920]  organize control and dominate and and instead of just letting humanities fly
[25:19.920 --> 25:28.560]  it's hellish they're creating a prison planet and you've got a bunch of bullied
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.800]  liberals into a cult into an orthodoxy that they have to be anti-family
[25:32.800 --> 25:37.320]  anti-man and repeat whatever Rachel Maddow says and look like Rachel Maddow
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.000]  and not be a woman not be powerful in your office as a woman not be powerful
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.200]  in your office as a man not be powerful in your office as a worker a striver a
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.080]  builder they don't want you to ever have a human office so then you're gonna be
[25:54.080 --> 25:57.920]  fulfilled they want to keep you unfulfilled so they can destroy you
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.920]  and make sure you fail because if you spread your wings it's over for
[26:01.920 --> 26:09.680]  everything they stand for and Trump wants to destroy them and in their own CIA
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.880]  publications that are public but not for mass distribution like public affairs
[26:13.880 --> 26:21.720]  and foreign affairs and others they openly say oh my god it's all real he's
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.680]  gonna defeat all of us in power humanity create incredible wealth what are we
[26:25.680 --> 26:29.240]  gonna do our whole system is gonna come down and then they just told Russia and
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.840]  China everybody else you better fight as hard as you can because he's about to
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.680]  start moving to distribute the advanced technology the public and if you want to
[26:36.680 --> 26:44.080]  know the big secret about Trump that's it that's the big super secret thing okay
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.560]  and Trump's even more pissed now that it that what he'd already been told and knew
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.920]  about is completely true and more and it's just all the horrible things they've
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.640]  done they're like sure your family will be able to live and not die of cancer
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.000]  what we've done in these laboratories he's like it's horrible it's an
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.520]  abomination it's selfish we'll never end up transcending if we do this and have
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.400]  these huge underground workshops of humanoids and all the rest of this
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.240]  crap what the hell are you doing
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.640]  that's why Trump now doesn't even care it's beyond confidence he doesn't care
[27:20.640 --> 27:24.600]  what they do what they say he realizes they're a bunch of bullied slaves and he's
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.120]  just out there to show them they're bullied slaves and to show everybody else
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.600]  that it's okay to stand up it's okay to speak out it's okay to be informed it's
[27:31.600 --> 27:37.320]  okay to be who you are I said this photographer she said well I've got like
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.520]  jobs and I just I can't decide you'd lose all your big liberal contracts if

[28:25.760 --> 28:30.680]  that's why they hate real men they cannot get the real men to act like
[28:30.680 --> 28:35.000]  backstabbing pieces of crap jerks and that's their ancient problem is they

[32:58.760 --> 33:06.680]  well I was thumbing from Montgomery I had my guitar on my back when a stranger
[33:06.680 --> 33:13.840]  stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac he was dressed like 1950 half
[33:13.840 --> 33:19.640]  drunk and hollow-eyed you said it's a long walk to Nashville would you like to
[33:19.640 --> 33:26.920]  ride waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[33:26.920 --> 33:33.880]  front lines of the info war in the front seat turned on the radio and them
[33:33.880 --> 33:39.640]  sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid contrago then I
[33:39.640 --> 33:45.160]  noticed the stranger was ghost white pill when he asked me for a light and I
[33:45.160 --> 33:49.760]  knew there was something strange about this ride
[33:49.760 --> 33:57.280]  he said drifter can you make folks cry when you play sign have you paid your
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.960]  dues can you moan the blues can you bend down guitar strings you said boy can
[34:02.960 --> 34:06.960]  you make folks feel what you feel inside you know as you get older you get a
[34:06.960 --> 34:13.000]  little more sophisticated and I noticed how the right wing would do some
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.280]  cultural bullying but the left wing is the is the king operating system of
[34:18.280 --> 34:25.960]  really reducing language communication family and you name it and they are
[34:25.960 --> 34:29.520]  really as everybody sees stepping up the bullying beating up women everywhere
[34:29.520 --> 34:33.160]  targeting them on purpose just saying you don't have free speech you can't go
[34:33.160 --> 34:38.480]  to events you can't hear somebody speak I mean there's just monsters and we have
[34:38.480 --> 34:43.960]  to call them out on that and I just remember always online getting bullied
[34:43.960 --> 34:50.120]  bullied bullied bullied bullied bullied bullied bullied bullied bullied to attack
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.120]  Israel and hate Israel with people then saying I worked for Israel or I was you
[34:55.120 --> 34:59.600]  know covering up for Israel and I realized that was a lot of arabist
[34:59.600 --> 35:05.080]  Saudi Arabian globalist but also leftist dialectic and that the whole
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.520]  thing was fake and that while Hollywood was pushing an Israel first agenda it
[35:10.520 --> 35:14.600]  was also pushing the whole Islamic agenda and it was all just a clash of
[35:14.600 --> 35:22.520]  civilizations program and that you know if Israel did anything it was the worst
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.280]  thing on earth but then if the Muslims said they want to blow up America and
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.920]  kill everybody a large contingent of them that's all cute and funny and nice you
[35:30.920 --> 35:34.000]  know when they jump ass to the women's faces or cut their genitals off by the
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.760]  hundreds of thousands a year you know kill hundreds of thousands of Christians
[35:36.760 --> 35:43.560]  oh they just don't count but I kind of halfway got bullied in political
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.360]  correctness that well I'm sure the truth's in between you know Israel does
[35:47.360 --> 35:50.680]  some bad stuff but the Muslims do some bad stuff and I never really tried to
[35:50.680 --> 35:53.600]  prove myself to one side or the other it's not what I do with virtue signaling
[35:53.600 --> 35:56.920]  but it was just always you know you know you get a bunch of emails it's like
[35:56.920 --> 36:00.360]  you're gonna expose the Vatican or I'm gonna expose you as one of their agents
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.000]  and I'm just like I'm like not even Catholic but I don't want to in fight
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.720]  with people and then you know you work for the Catholics you work for this or
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.280]  that but all I want is to have justice and freedom and I'm totally open I mean
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.360]  now I can talk to pretty much anybody I want to and I do talk to you name it I
[36:17.360 --> 36:20.800]  mean they wanted to send foreign intelligence agencies not the Russians
[36:20.800 --> 36:24.600]  here to talk to me and sniff around decided they wanted to try something and
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.720]  I just said come talk to me and then most people out there go watch movies about
[36:28.720 --> 36:31.960]  all this stuff that's not really how most of it works it's just that they've
[36:31.960 --> 36:35.600]  known for a long time we're having a big effect now we're in the center of the
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.320]  zeitgeist and what I'm getting at is everybody should just be able to talk
[36:41.320 --> 36:43.840]  to everybody it's like that New York Times photographer she doesn't work for
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.480]  them a freelance scared to death when I said hey let me see your portfolio and
[36:47.480 --> 36:50.280]  do some work for us I can't do that I'm getting you know yeah you get black
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.000]  bald huh that's not freedom I only brought it up so I could talk to her
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.960]  about it because she's a human being I spent a few minutes trying to reach
[36:57.960 --> 37:05.080]  through to her and show her how that's a cult that's the same thing if I had to
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.840]  cry a suicide bombing in Israel it's like you Zionist scum like like that's
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.000]  the highest thing to say on the internet to somebody because you're a big man
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.160]  you're a good person you know you're moral I'm not and so you just say I'm you
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.720]  know a bad person or whatever and I need to submit to you but I because the reason
[37:21.720 --> 37:25.960]  I raise this is we've got David Horowitz coming on my nose been critical me in
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.720]  the past and that's fine and and I and I think he goes too far on in some cases
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.640]  and everything but as I've gotten older and studied things really looked at it
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.280]  because I read everything I didn't you know I read some Horowitz's books like
[37:36.280 --> 37:39.760]  15 years ago and I just thought this is the biggest bunch of propaganda crap I
[37:39.760 --> 37:46.480]  ever heard and then it all came true so I'm just the type of person that says
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.520]  well I'm gonna have this person I'm gonna talk about it and then I understand
[37:49.520 --> 37:53.440]  they always act like if I'm doing something pro-Israel they caught me like
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.000]  I say something on there and they go ooh we caught you on air supporting Israel
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.480]  yeah I'm on air it's this mental illness thing like three-year-olds I caught
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.360]  you booboo it's like weird mental illnesses I don't quite understand it
[38:06.360 --> 38:12.800]  you know if I talk to somebody an MI5 or MI6 or you know if the Masaid wants to
[38:12.800 --> 38:24.320]  visit and just talk to me CIA you name it I'll talk to them that's what I do I
[38:24.320 --> 38:29.240]  just sit there and say we just want to have power plants we just want to have
[38:29.240 --> 38:35.480]  control of our kids we just won't be able to worship God I'm not your enemy you
[38:35.480 --> 38:39.600]  should look at what you're doing how dare Israel push an anti-gun agenda here
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.360]  in America to kind of have us as a client state they control once the other
[38:42.360 --> 38:48.680]  way around and then you issue your citizens guns which is great and then
[38:48.680 --> 38:53.120]  what our guns I'll support Israel because I understand what's going on in the
[38:53.120 --> 38:56.880]  Middle East but don't then sit there and turn around like I don't exist and try
[38:56.880 --> 39:04.200]  to make me a slave you understand that the Jews did have a place in the Middle
[39:04.200 --> 39:10.120]  East it's a tiny little piece all these other Arab countries won't take any of
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.720]  the people in they want to bitch all day well they have giant tent cities that
[39:14.720 --> 39:17.640]  house hundreds of thousands of people in Saudi Arabia and won't take one of
[39:17.640 --> 39:20.800]  these refugees but we're supposed to take them and Israel's supposed to take
[39:20.800 --> 39:24.320]  them and we're the fount of all bad and I'm just not gonna be part of this
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.920]  anymore doesn't mean I'm naive about Benjamin yet yahoo and all the stuff
[39:29.920 --> 39:33.480]  he's up to and the rest of it it's just it's just it's just not reality-based
[39:33.480 --> 39:36.720]  it's like I have scales here and I'm looking at who's really good who's
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.280]  really bad and I'm not gonna just sit there and be bullied into any of these
[39:40.280 --> 39:46.440]  one-level one-dimensional moron level paradigms I'm here to change paradigms
[39:46.440 --> 39:50.460]  I'm here to try to create a worldwide view of prosperity and goodness and
[39:50.460 --> 39:59.280]  women and men and the species and what we are and good competition there's no
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.800]  side motives and everybody knows that that's why the system attacks my
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.160]  genuineness just like they attack Trump's genuineness is because can't you
[40:08.160 --> 40:13.600]  understand I could be Machiavelli all day long I could be more Machiavelli than
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.560]  anybody I know quite frankly maybe except for Trump and I'm not bragging I
[40:17.560 --> 40:21.840]  mean it's a fact folks I can think 50 levels up okay if I wanted to start doing
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.080]  that I just will not do it I will just be honest and tell it like it is and
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.160]  just move forward and they go oh look you're weak you won't use dirty tricks
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.400]  you won't you know you won't do all this you're absolutely right I won't because
[40:33.400 --> 40:40.240]  then I'll lose the connection that's why Odin's only got one eye because the
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.280]  other one is in the spirit world he didn't really lose it
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.360]  but see the average person would even get that parable I'm not literally saying
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.720]  that in analogous to what I'm doing at the point is this is that it's the
[40:52.720 --> 40:56.680]  father's tales the wives tales that's what that is like you get the bigger
[40:56.680 --> 41:00.400]  understanding you you lose some vision here because it really doesn't matter
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.160]  that much anymore and all of us need to get up into that level everything the
[41:06.160 --> 41:10.680]  globalist do is to keep us down and Trump is trying talking to us like babies
[41:10.680 --> 41:14.720]  because a lot of us are babies talking to us like babies it's okay if everybody
[41:14.720 --> 41:21.200]  else has coal and we have the best and cleanest that we have some too he's
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.520]  everything he does that's why I'm obsessed on coal is because that's the
[41:25.520 --> 41:31.320]  great equation of our main energy source not oil and they cut it off that's what
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.560]  Japan went to war with the United States and World War two because we were
[41:34.560 --> 41:37.960]  cutting off their routes to get oil
[41:38.120 --> 41:46.160]  energies everything you die without it energy plants the crops energy picks the
[41:46.160 --> 41:53.360]  crops energy processes the crops energy delivers the crops and energy is water
[41:53.360 --> 42:01.240]  the sun carbon dioxide and oxygen and they're taxing carbon dioxide it's a
[42:01.240 --> 42:09.320]  life tax it's a tax to breathe it's a tax to live and everything Trump does is
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.720]  to remove those he's just removing the chains removing the chains and there's
[42:13.720 --> 42:19.400]  all these entitled horrible people saying we hijacked all this and it's ours
[42:19.400 --> 42:22.960]  and you're not gonna do that you're not gonna give workers self-respect and
[42:22.960 --> 42:27.080]  you're not gonna get Obamacare off their backs and you stop it or will kill you
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.680]  and like babies the former CIA director and all these people go on TV and say
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.000]  watch your mouth president and you're at danger and in the media is like yeah
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  we're gonna kill you and all this crap let me tell you something I don't say
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.960]  this everybody knows it from a position of just puffing up you idiot start a
[42:43.960 --> 42:49.160]  physical fight the people taking control of this country do not want to kill you
[42:49.160 --> 42:59.000]  okay but if you start a fight you are dead in hours just know that in hours but
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.600]  you can't help it can you you got to keep pushing you got to keep pushing you
[43:03.600 --> 43:06.440]  got to keep pushing you think you're messing with people that are scared to
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.560]  die you think you are because I'm not and I'm not the one that's gonna do
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.840]  anything physical I'm warning you right now and a lot of the really evil top
[43:17.840 --> 43:23.840]  vampires aren't gonna listen they're too far gone but you you people out there
[43:23.840 --> 43:26.840]  serving this that are bullied by this and though along with this and don't know
[43:26.840 --> 43:32.320]  what to think or what side you're on you better two sides right now it's that
[43:32.320 --> 43:39.720]  simple and I cannot believe how obvious the choice should be for everybody our
[43:39.720 --> 43:47.320]  enemies are manifestly horribly depraved wicked twisted demented people
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.640]  that want to paint on the walls in our children's blood and I got news for them
[43:51.640 --> 43:57.520]  the cries of the children have been heard by God and we're being given a
[43:57.520 --> 44:01.040]  reprieve to try to fix things and organize things there's gonna be great
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.600]  trials and tribulations to come but if but but we're choosing like pick your
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.720]  novel in an end that's a lot easier crash landing you get a couple hundred
[44:11.720 --> 44:20.280]  million killed or you get five billion killed you let all the cloning and all
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.440]  the genocides all that out and the it's not gonna be electronic sex bots it's
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.240]  gonna be replicants folks gonna be real humanoid people that don't have rights
[44:29.240 --> 44:36.440]  it's all it's all coming out and we have to say we're not by increment
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.040]  want to accept this no and we've got to shut down all these secret laboratories
[44:41.040 --> 44:46.360]  and we've got to go to war with people that do illegal technology if there's
[44:46.360 --> 44:51.360]  something worth fighting for we have to globally have compacts and agreements on
[44:51.360 --> 44:55.520]  technology and the globalist soul globalism originally to the best mind
[44:55.520 --> 44:58.400]  saying we gotta have global government or we'll blow ourselves up like Atlantis
[44:58.400 --> 45:01.760]  and they got the best minds to believe in this and then meanwhile we find out a
[45:01.760 --> 45:04.560]  bunch of psychopaths run it all and actually want to blow everything up I
[45:04.560 --> 45:07.880]  mean you read the literature of these top globalist like an after we leave
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.680]  earth will blow it up for fun it's like we have let the worst low-level demons
[45:12.680 --> 45:18.480]  in the control things and it's bad okay so you want the big deep truth you're
[45:18.480 --> 45:23.040]  getting it right now now I need to midair refuel here and quite frankly I'm

[54:18.560 --> 54:22.600]  the next hour I'm gonna play the most important key Trump clips I just thank
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.600]  God the president came out and said Hillary and her people took a bunch of
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.200]  money they gave 20 it was actually 30% but he said 20% of our uranium he's
[54:32.200 --> 54:38.280]  being very conservative that's just his philosophy and I see what he's doing and
[54:38.280 --> 54:42.080]  stop saying I'm with Russia I've done nothing with Russia and Flynn was allowed
[54:42.080 --> 54:47.880]  to make a phone call the big thing is Flynn pissed off the trifecta and it
[54:47.880 --> 54:52.520]  just shows how my sources the day it happened and in the days before knew
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.800]  that it was actually made mad as mad and the vice president mad some of the
[54:55.800 --> 55:02.560]  other people in the National Security Council Matt so it was Flynn not getting
[55:02.560 --> 55:09.760]  along with them that when that came by Flynn's like I'm just sick of this and
[55:09.760 --> 55:12.640]  they're like okay go ahead and resign and from what I've heard it was just kind
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.600]  of mutual I mean Flynn turned down a huge job at Jones Group before just to
[55:16.600 --> 55:22.120]  take the job nobody even knows that General Jones like runs the show pretty
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.400]  much former head of the National Security Council for a long time well the
[55:27.400 --> 55:34.440]  president's the head but the head of the body under the president so that's what's
[55:34.440 --> 55:40.960]  going on here and it's all just a big joke the president his National Security
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.520]  buzzer can't talk to the Russians they can talk to anybody they want to it's
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.480]  called being the president oh my gosh when he was president elect they were
[55:48.480 --> 55:54.320]  lining up talks with the Russians good God I mean even the New York Times admits
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.440]  that cash flow to Clinton Foundation and Russian uranium deal and the media is
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.880]  like it's not true it's not true it's a hundred percent true and it goes on and
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.240]  on so here's the deal and I've told the president this I've talked to president
[56:07.240 --> 56:10.280]  before and I'm gonna stop talking about that the point is people the media
[56:10.280 --> 56:13.280]  always wants to know and I think you know I'm gonna tell anybody but it's just
[56:13.280 --> 56:16.640]  please go after Hillary she's not gonna stop the Soros group isn't gonna stop I
[56:16.640 --> 56:19.520]  don't want to just be vindictive mr. president or president elect that
[56:19.520 --> 56:24.600]  conversation you need to just not gonna stop they're never gonna stop you know
[56:24.600 --> 56:30.360]  that I'm gonna say what Trump said but I mean it's just ridiculous they know they
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.160]  were spying on him at that time through the Justice Department illegally the
[56:34.160 --> 56:52.040]  president being spied on by Obama so anyways I'll tell folks this though the
[56:52.040 --> 56:56.200]  Trump you see on TV is like the Trump talking to the five-year-olds and the
[56:56.200 --> 57:02.480]  Trump behind the scenes is like can he could Trump can finish your sentences
[57:02.480 --> 57:08.720]  like he's like you know big egghead in the future you know communicate
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.920]  telepathically and I'm not literally saying that but he's that smart folks
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.120]  and that's why they are reeking out now why do I have nuclear weapons going off
[57:17.120 --> 57:21.720]  behind me if you're a TV viewer that's because that's where the globalists
[57:21.720 --> 57:24.040]  would like to take us and that's in the news we'll get more into this the next
[57:24.040 --> 57:29.920]  hour but now we have a top level this is a International Business Times info

[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:19.760]  fact let's I should have I was good at Twitter let's create the fake news
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:27.760]  stream but notice now on Twitter they only let people come on and be you know
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:33.080]  comical and attack us to make me feel demoralized and make other people that
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:37.840]  are now reading Twitter feel like oh Alex isn't supported that's why on YouTube
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.640]  we get 97 98 99% ratings based on every video thousands of videos the average is
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:48.280]  97% billions of views just on a couple of our channels 5 billion views total on
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:52.920]  YouTube oh we're so unpopular oh we're nobody the illusion that we're not
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:57.000]  dominant that you're not dominant and now Trump's fit Twitter it's not his it's
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.680]  Twitter's isn't it they just nothing but hundreds and hundreds of negatives
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.760]  that's all they leave at the top and this is this happened this switch
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:07.600]  happened about three weeks ago and it's there it's happening you can have a
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:11.440]  trending one that's been upvoted they won't let it go to the top unless you
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:15.880]  do it sarcastically like you're against Trump or myself they're doing it to drudge
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:18.680]  they're doing everybody else folks and this is that you know they think you're
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:21.480]  stupid we need to have news articles about this like Paul Watson wrote
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.280]  yesterday we need to expose it not that it's even hurting us but so people
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:29.960]  understand it's like Tokyo rose as Japan was already defeated the day they
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:35.200]  dropped a bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki they were announcing we've
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:38.240]  defeated you we're defeating the mainland we'll soon invade the United
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.840]  States it's over you failed GI the Hitler and his bunker with the Russians
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:47.880]  two miles away the body would win I mean it's just completely insane but that's
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:53.960]  what they're doing and so again listen Twitter we only use you as a channel we
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.400]  know its control understand that but we're still defeating you aren't we
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:03.840]  president Donald Trump stepped up his attack on the fake news network CNN
[1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:08.400]  during a press conference yesterday telling reporter Jim Acosta that he
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:13.760]  had downgraded their title from fake news to very fake news just because the

[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:32.760]  that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of

[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:53.280]  I coined it I was looking around itself commenters using the term but it just hit
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:57.280]  me it's fake stream it's mainstream it's fake stream that way they don't just
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:00.240]  throw fake on us and we throw it back when they you know get caught doing fake
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:04.200]  stuff just don't you are the fake stream media I want to put a hashtag out on my
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:07.560]  real Alex Jones on Twitter while it's still there because they've already been
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.800]  censoring us putting negative comments up blocking our tweets suspending us you
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:15.160]  name it and now they're saying Zuckerberg and others over at Facebook
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:20.280]  have announced as well huge censorship plans so that's coming up at the bottom
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:24.440]  of the hour tech billionaire issues stark warnings saying artificial
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.840]  intelligence could destroy human race is already part cyborg because of its
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:31.320]  dependence on smartphones that was their whole plan I told you this 20 years
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:37.680]  ago now it's admitted I talked to NSA whistleblowers Jeff Bezos the Amazon
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.520]  Obama worshipper is doing huge business with the CIA while keeping his
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:46.120]  Washington Post readers in the dark well of course he is alternate Mark
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:49.360]  Zuckerberg says they have a secret plan to use artificial intelligence to
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.040]  censor and spy on what he calls his dumb effort users but it's okay there he is
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:58.120]  with the family and his child and he's using a good Apple computer from the
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:03.480]  Foxcom slave laboratories because he's liberal though it's all okay now half of
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:07.160]  families text each other in the same house experts say tech craze have a
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:11.320]  catastrophic effect on family life yeah that's why the late Steve Jobs wouldn't
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:15.720]  even let his kids have iPhones and iPads let's just stop right there though
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:20.400]  because we have him via Skype and look I'm somebody that when I admit I'm
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:24.520]  wrong I'll say it and we're all wrong often but not about you know the big
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:28.800]  issues but I remember I don't remember the name of the books but I mean I used
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:32.880]  to have the time to read books every week and I'd stay up late doing now I
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:36.280]  just renews I'm just too busy and try to manage stuff here it's like two in the
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:39.320]  morning sometimes and I just remember read nothing feels when it was it was
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:43.040]  just all about the lefts ally with Islam and the socialists and they're gonna
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.840]  take over Europe the US and a caliphate and it's just and I knew there was some
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:51.280]  quacks saying that on the left but I just thought that'll never happen leftists
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:55.160]  would never put on the gems and support cutting women's genitals off and
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:59.760]  throwing gays off buildings they never do this to the West and now Paris has been
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:04.040]  on fire six cities over there on fire the police video we can roll it are
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:10.880]  evacuating and running the Islamists to say blow up and kill Israel and kill
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:14.520]  everyone and then I've got all these people bullying me constantly saying
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:18.360]  I'm an Israeli agent when I have absolutely never been to Israel or I
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:21.080]  guess I'm a Russian agent now too because I don't have war with Russia I mean
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:26.080]  it just gets crazy the bullying by the left and the bots and the internet and
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:29.840]  I mean I've got to be honest I believe their bots I was never really liberal
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.640]  or conservative just kind of a patriot but they talk about David Horowitz the
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.120]  ultimate demon the horrible person I know he's attacked me before and I think
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.380]  rightfully so on some issues and plus the media would misrepresent what I've
[1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:45.880]  said and then he responded what that was but I got to tell you reading his
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:51.320]  writings his columns couple of his books years ago and thinking this is a bunch
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:56.440]  of fear porn and now it was basically exactly like he said so I really want to
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:11:59.240]  talk to him about what's coming in the future I'm really excited about his
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.640]  best-selling book which I've already read the synopsis of online I've got one
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:06.760]  coming to me big agenda President Trump's plan to save America and I've read
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:11.360]  the 20 points they really make sense but regardless globalist are picking and
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.000]  winning the losers they're picking and choosing the winners they are selling us
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.120]  out just turning our coal back on is gonna just make industry come back it's
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:24.200]  incredible Trump literally is just a common-sense guy and so I want to go to
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:29.200]  David Horowitz now because I want to just say proudly I agree with a 95% of
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.400]  what he's saying and that I just am proud for all the anti-Semites and
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:37.160]  Islamists and everybody else who've been trying to bully me and tell me what to do
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:41.680]  and make up crap all these years you what you said I am is now coming true
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:46.120]  because I support Israel's right to exist and and Israel what it does
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:48.920]  something has a crooked toenails the biggest thing in the world everybody
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.440]  else is okay and the Muslims killing millions of people and women being sold
[1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:57.280]  as slaves on you know in slave auctions in in Sudan and and all these other
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.200]  countries like Somalia that's all okay but but Israel's the devil and he's be
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:04.880]  blown off the map so just I'm just gonna officially say that I don't want to
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:08.080]  blow Israel up there so now you can all say you heard a secret report that I
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:11.040]  was with Israel the truth is folks I'm just for justice I don't want war with
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:15.000]  Russia either for no reason they're not doing any stuff to us either so David
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.520]  Horowitz I appreciate you joining us and so there's my little I don't know
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:24.240]  analysis of the whole process and I mean I guess growing up a little bit so
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:28.560]  thank you for joining us well thank you Alex so you got the floor to the bottom
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:34.360]  the hour where should we start 95% of the issues you I've never been like you
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:40.120]  I've never been to Israel and I think you were referring to a book I wrote in
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:46.480]  2004 called unholy alliance that was it about the alliance between the left and
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:52.480]  the terrorists the two the top organizers actually the chairwoman of the
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:59.560]  women's March against Trump Linda Sarsour is from a Hamas family and a
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:06.160]  supporter of Sharia law so she's anti-female anti-west pro-terrorist
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:12.040]  she's the chairwoman they chose for the March and Rosvia Odette is one of the
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:18.320]  organizers of that March she is a convicted terrorist she blew up a
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:23.640]  supermarket and killed two students way back when I guess she served her time
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:28.880]  and now she's in the United States but the left is just full-throated it
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:33.280]  depends but we have a terrorist front on our campuses which I've conducted a
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.400]  lonely crusade against the Muslim Students Association and the students
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.680]  were justice in Palestine our two Muslim Brotherhood Fronts their pro-terrorist
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:49.880]  and they have the entire political left on the campus lined up for their
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:55.200]  agendas which is a destruction of Israel and the Jews in the first instance but
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:59.360]  as we know the Chris actually more Christians have been slaughtered by
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:11.840]  these maniacs than Jews this book I've just done big agenda it's gonna be
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:16.800]  number 600 times bestseller list on Sunday which pleases me not you know
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:21.080]  I've written a lot of books I've had bestsellers before this particularly
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:26.920]  pleases me because we are in a civil war as I'm sure you understand and I've
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.680]  been telling your listeners this is civil war time it's interesting the the
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:37.560]  Democrats call it resistance and I actually saw a Democratic strategist
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:43.200]  whatever operative on Fox say there's a difference between resistance and
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:50.160]  obstruction because of course only the bad Republicans obstruct things but
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:55.560]  there is a difference obstruction is you want to stop a policy or a piece of
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:03.520]  legislation resistance is what to the Nazis resistance is an existential
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:11.520]  threat it's war and you know presidents incoming presidents normally get seven
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.560]  according to Gallup seven months honeymoon which is what our American
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:20.920]  political framework is about peaceful transition of power you'll let the other
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:26.720]  guy get in we're all part of one community what we saw in the
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:32.040]  confirmation process was a witch hunt sure let me just add this in because I
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:33.680]  mean I didn't really prepare for the interview but I remember reading the
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:37.080]  book I guess ten years ago I said twelve years ago how time flies that was it
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:40.080]  was unholy alliance I knew a lot of it was true because I done research but I
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:43.240]  just it was so unbelievable that the left would combine with this and it seems
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:47.360]  like they've gone completely mentally ill Nancy Pelosi thinks Bush is still in
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:52.080]  office in the same press conference of Maxine you know Waters thinks that Russia
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:56.800]  invaded Korea it does seem like they've gone insane so you're the first guy
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:59.400]  that laid all this out how did I mean just a few minutes we're getting your
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:04.200]  book how did you know how did you know that they were really having this
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:10.080]  alliance and planning this insane takeover because I was partial if I was
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:15.720]  brought up by American communists who were were part of a vast international
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:23.160]  conspiracy to help the Russians and Soviets win the Cold War so I I know
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.880]  these people in my bones they're anti-Americans there never was an anti
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:32.200]  war movement in this country it's always an anti-American movement that's where
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:39.720]  I got off got out of the left when when America was forced by the left which is
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:45.360]  now in control of the Democratic Party forced to withdraw from Vietnam the
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:50.680]  communists proceeded to slaughter two and a half million peasants in Indochina
[1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:58.600]  and it wasn't one not one protest of that and that showed me well that I was
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:04.760]  among evil people and and you know Barack Obama comes from the same
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:08.800]  political background I do is raised by communists the difference is he never
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:14.600]  left the communists left yeah and you know we're lucky that we survived those
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.520]  eight years and we're even luckier to have somebody like Trump there's always
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:24.840]  been fighters out there you're a fighter the Rush Limbaugh's a fighter but
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:30.560]  they're no no Republican fighters and we've never had a president who would
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:34.360]  be a watchdog over the media and who was so smart and would take him to task I
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:39.520]  mean we he's destroying what's left of their power before I don't really have
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:43.560]  time to see that that press conference yesterday but it was just stunning how
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:48.160]  they are absolutely in a full panic and just don't know what to do that someone
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:53.440]  already now has a platform bigger than them to counter these arrogant bullies
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:58.280]  exactly I mean they're in an alternate reality I watched the Chris Matthews
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:05.240]  take on it and they had a big headline the Trump rant and then they showed clip
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:13.120]  after clip of this genial fellow talking very rationally having a good time and
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:21.280]  you know pointing out what devious dishonest people they are and they think
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:26.040]  that people watching it can't see that this is not a rant this is a perfectly
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:31.480]  rational presentation but that was true during during the whole campaign I mean
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:37.920]  they the attacks on Trump were so lunatic so what are they gonna do I mean you
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:40.760]  you're a guy that saw the future way back I mean I'm it's true you're one of
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:46.400]  the most focused cogent you know over the horizon thinkers out there what's
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:50.000]  positive what's negative what do you see happening let's get into your book I mean
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.200]  a lot of what you're talking about Trump is doing you know how do we save this
[1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:57.280]  country because that's how we obviously defeat the globalist the leftist is with
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:02.560]  prosperity and really having a big table a big 10 bringing people together you
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:06.120]  know they're the ones trying to divide so I mean this book is absolutely you know
[1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:09.760]  needed medicine for a very very sick country I mean we talked about how he's
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:22.360]  inherited this this disaster we are in a civil war and the left is not gonna let
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:27.680]  up and as anybody knows who's trying to persuade them of anything you can't
[1:20:27.680 --> 1:20:32.440]  persuade it's a cult it's a cult this is a what I'm gonna say it's a religious
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:38.260]  movement it's it's it's based on the Christian model like the world is a
[1:20:38.260 --> 1:20:42.880]  fallen place so everybody's oppressed it's white people who are there I just
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:46.400]  started realizing that recently it is it's like they've taken like super
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:50.840]  oppressive forms of Christianity I'm a Christian and then oppressed everyone
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:54.120]  that they're bad than only the high priest are good and then you've got to go
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:59.160]  bow down to them and then it's it's it's a cult they are a hellfire and damn
[1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:02.440]  nation preachers I mean that's why they're so effective politically it's
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:07.480]  always a moral indictment we are the army of the saints we're gonna save the
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:12.760]  world you are the party of the devil and that's the way they act that's the
[1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:17.920]  way they think that's the way they're such horrific people and they're very
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:23.480]  seductive because they're always putting forward this pie in the sky future
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:29.080]  social justice communism socialism of course the communism got discredited
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:32.360]  social they never look at what's happening in Venezuela or Cuba or anywhere
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:36.160]  they just they just keep saying it's wonderful it's not about this world
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:41.160]  it's about the next only the next is a world that they think they can create
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:49.600]  thinking that your parents communist ever wake up never no my father died a
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:59.400]  fan of freshness good lord I said wow yeah I mean I lost every friend that I
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:04.800]  am that I thought of Toronto Reagan and that's what I have to say that's what
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:09.760]  so we're talking about Trump he doesn't back down and and and the Trumpers
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:15.840]  everybody who supported Trump are not intimidated by this you know left this
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:21.720]  moral indictment and here's the thing why do they sympathize why are they so soft
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  on the Islamic terrorists the answer is because they're people of color though
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.640]  you ever think about that phrase I mean I've written about this in the book big
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:38.160]  agenda but the phrase people of color it's not English we don't say crayons of
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:44.000]  color it's a French construction it's completely ideological but when you
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.640]  think about it for a moment this is this is what its function is if you look at
[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:54.400]  Mexico it's composed of two ethnic groups the main ethnic groups one the
[1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:59.240]  descendants of the conquistadors who slaughtered the indigenous Indians and
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:03.880]  the other the descendants of the indigenous Indians but when they cross
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:09.000]  the border into America they're both people of color so they deserving of
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:15.520]  special sensitivities special privileges sure they're Western openness and
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:19.840]  hospitality is being manipulated they're taking our Christian guilt and then
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:26.200]  transmuting it into this brainwashing but it's racist the way it went after I
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:30.000]  have a whole chapter in my book called the Achilles heel of the Democratic
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.360]  Party which is their control of the inner cities the Democratic Party is the
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:37.360]  party
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:41.480]  David Horowitz your skype is breaking up just for a second
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:44.440]  sure your skype is breaking up to start over and I want to be back for a full
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:48.800]  hour soon we'll kind of maybe this I'd be calling on phone but BVS skype is
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:52.480]  having a few problems here but it's it's great people to see you there and the
[1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:55.840]  time we have left let's talk about how we defeat them what you think they're
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.120]  doing your biggest concerns more about the book and and what Trump needs to do
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:04.160]  because I mean I'm really concerned I've never seen if I went on air and said
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.480]  somebody needs to kill Trump I would get arrested because that's organizing a
[1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:11.800]  criminal operation they're all there's so many comedians and movie stars and
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:16.240]  producers and and newspaper saying kill him kill him that it's just organized
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:19.720]  crime I'm not looking for a fight but you know if they're getting to a physical
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.480]  altercation I don't know I mean we got five minutes left where do you see all
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:29.840]  this going I I think we're headed for four years of war I think our greatest
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:37.480]  strength is that middle America people have waked up the media has no
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:42.560]  credibility which is tremendous advantage Trump has shown the way to
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:46.280]  blow up political correctness that's a term political correctness that was
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:51.200]  invented by mouncy tongue the greatest mass murderer in human history it's to
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:59.520]  keep people in line which is what it does and republicans have generally been
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:06.160]  intimidated what gives me home is that now we have a generation of republicans
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:10.880]  of conservatives who are not intimidated they're not intimidated by this
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:20.440]  media and by all the culture you know the universities this k-twelfth of
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:25.960]  liberation and my one fear is is that they will kill Trump because there's no
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:30.040]  republican who can replace him at the moment what do you think of Trump I mean
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.120]  I've got to say I've never gushed over somebody like this two years ago I
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:36.080]  supported him because or over is the elites were attacking that was clear
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:39.920]  it was real attacks he had an American first agenda I liked all that but now
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:43.680]  he's just I've never seen anything like it and I've studied history this I mean
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:47.480]  just the stamina of the will the way he laughs it all off the attacks on his
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.840]  family I mean this guy if they're dumb enough to kill him they are going to
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:57.320]  create the super martyr of all time I agree my I was went over to Trump and
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:02.880]  it's because I'm very sensitive to this issue of the party that it's really a
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:07.880]  communist party line political correctness I see how intimidated people
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.320]  are there's no other Republican you could think of one national TV in front
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:16.560]  of 50 million people would look Hillary Clinton in the eye and say you're a
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:22.680]  liar and a crook which he is and that's a protective shield so they you know it's
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:28.280]  the vulnerable woman that protects her from any kind of serious criticism and
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:32.600]  then of course she comes out you know I'm the strong woman I'm gonna be anyway
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  anybody doubts I can be president as a sexist I I don't see I mean there are
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:43.960]  two people who are friends of mine around Trump Steve Bannon and Steve
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:49.120]  Miller who also come from they come from a liberal Democratic background so they
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:53.200]  have the passion for politics that people on the left had they're gonna
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:56.960]  they're fearless but there's no
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.280]  that I can see in the Democratic Party some are rising like Tim Cotton I was
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:09.480]  about to say they have no leadership the Democrats have no leadership well
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:16.040]  these aging communists and globally nationalism and a rediscovery of just
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:20.520]  normal human activity I didn't call conservatism there's just a revolt against
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:26.080]  this suffocating mafia of control freaks that's that's why I say it's the
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.080]  grassroots when I came into the right I said where is the grassroots army where
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:36.720]  the move on Doc Ford's the Occupy Wall Street solar where I mean I don't want
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:41.240]  conservatives to be burning things in the streets sure but action writing books
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:45.700]  taking action going to advance and now they're out there it's the it's the
[1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:50.360]  Trumpers they're out there and if you ask I mean people have to be geared up
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:56.720]  for a war now we have an American president who's a patriot finally we
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.600]  need to defend him and advance his policies but one of the things I wrote
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.960]  about in that book on holy alliance was the sanctuary cities how they they were
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:10.640]  created to attack the Patriot Act and to make it easier for terrorists to get
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:16.440]  into this country by two communist organizations the ACLU and the set of
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:21.680]  her constitutional rights and now it's all come to fruition but the American
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:25.320]  people are against sanctuary cities well I mean nobody else in the world
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:28.920]  except Europe would do something like that it's globalist occupation using
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:31.960]  third-world populations they've oppressed to bring them in brainwash them
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.440]  uses use them against us but this whole prosperity message and what Trump's
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:38.080]  trying to deliver is so key I'm just worried they're gonna implode the
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:41.960]  economy like the Federal Reserve trying to do before he gets his people in so
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.880]  that they can try to you know repudiate nationalism just like the EU's trying
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:50.000]  with the Brexit but I I don't think that's gonna work and I think if they
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.520]  they're successful I think they're gonna be held accountable for the
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:59.120]  recession or depression not Trump yeah that's exactly right I'm there losing
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:04.800]  every public battle that's very clear I mean there's nobody in the history of
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:10.640]  this country probably the world who has had such crap it's thrown at him and he
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:15.920]  done his head as Donald Trump and he survived it and he survived it because
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:20.160]  there are there's the people out there who can see and his poll numbers are
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:23.920]  going up which panics some David Horowitz thank you so much for joining us

[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:26.120]  said billions of times no doubt that those that don't know history are doomed
[1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:35.560]  to repeat it and so I didn't know that when I got a taste a hankering for
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:42.800]  history books when I was about six years old and I read 200 300 on World War two
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:48.280]  alone just thousands of books thousands that I was like doing university level
[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:53.560]  studies by the time I was 14 not bragging about it it's just that now I
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:34:04.120]  have this big store of knowledge reading scholar level you know 800 page books
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:10.840]  that got into my new show that you know even academics were just acting like
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:18.120]  they were reading and that's why now I understand the roots of the different
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:22.400]  control systems when I see them and I know what's being built and I could say
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:25.520]  what's being built before they even come out later and admit they're building
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:29.360]  and I'm not bragging it's just that those that don't know history are doomed
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:35.520]  to repeat it I only wish that I had time it's been years since I read a history
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:40.400]  book it's been years since I read a science fiction book which is just the
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:45.720]  dreams of humans it's been years since I even sat down and read magazines about
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:51.240]  entertainers or watch a football game and it's because I have to constantly watch
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:57.240]  what the enemy's doing there's so many interesting things I want to tell you
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:02.520]  about so many fun things but I just can't do it because we have to protect
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:07.640]  all those good things by exposing these people we're not a negative broadcast
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:13.000]  we're a winning positive broadcast but we have to admit how bad the globalist
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:18.360]  are if we're gonna save this civilization the society I mean take the
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:22.240]  culture in the left of Israel hating Israel does bad things Israel has
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:26.480]  corruption it's people just like us but the religion of saying one group of
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:31.280]  people is fundamentally evil Jews is now on to white people are fundamentally
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:35.720]  evil well I thought the Nazis were saying people that weren't Aryan or
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:41.600]  Nordic or Germanic everybody was evil it's just more tribalist crap and they
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:45.520]  sell the idea that tribalism has only been done by Europeans which is just
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:50.160]  utterly ridiculous everybody knows some of the most barbarous hateful tribes in
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:36:00.280]  the world or everywhere in fact civilization is saying let's not kill
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:04.440]  each other let's build something but there was never enough resources now
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:08.920]  there is we can do anything and the people running things are on such
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:12.120]  power trips they've decided to steal the future and then have us all in fight
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:15.960]  with each other like we're morons and if we fail the test and they really are
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:24.360]  better than us and we deserve what happens to us but what you see happening
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:32.960]  now is the other side of the equation I want to get to a bunch of clips Trump
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.560]  is at the Boeing factory right now we probably put this up on screen and we'll
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:40.400]  play excerpts that a little bit the next hour he's talking about the economy
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:46.080]  and building things and getting Boeing to move its jobs back from China and
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:48.440]  it's happening he looks so presidential there I think I've ever seen
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:52.400]  look more presidential I mean he just gets he's just stepping into it and
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:37:00.160]  again it's a spiritual evolution this is a big deal see this country was taken
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:06.840]  to the very edge of death and demoralization a lot of people are dead
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:11.840]  before they're physically dead they just shuffle around programmed unhappy not
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:15.280]  having any vision not having any connection to the spiritual of the
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:23.680]  universe and that is now coming back into the world self-respect belief
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:29.200]  means they're promoting the American plane rolling out and saying Boeing you
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:35.680]  come back here so their stock will go up instead of it going down when they were
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:41.360]  gonna move to China nothing against China but it's time for America to have
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:44.640]  something and China when you do better trade deals when you actually decide to
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.160]  pay your people something instead of being greedy then you'll build a
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:51.680]  civilization they'll actually buy our products and then we can go to the
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:56.200]  stars together but we're not going to be run over by a bunch of Zuckerbergs and
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:03.600]  Schmitz in an alliance with China and some pipe dream that whole system is
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:10.080]  getting rolled up right now we're teaching you how the cow ate the cabbage
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:14.880]  and we're analyzing Fox's feed of that coverage right there Mark Dice is coming
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:17.800]  off at 30 minutes at the start of the next hour I'll continue and we're gonna
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:20.800]  take some calls if your dice leaves us open the phones about what you thought
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.920]  of the press conference yesterday and more they've been on us fourth hour but
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:31.000]  before I go any further and I start getting these clips there are a lot of
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.160]  really important articles on info wars.com and I mentioned here I cover a
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:37.200]  little bit but it's important to go read those and to send those out to
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:40.800]  everybody you know even if you're already informed and listening get them to
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:44.640]  people that don't know I I cannot harp on this enough that you are the info
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:48.040]  war you are the future you are the resistance how many times did I tell
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:51.800]  you the globalists want to control revolutions of the universities they
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:57.640]  own and control the big corporate donors and the corporate grants they want all
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:01.960]  human rebellion to be socialists or communists so that you build a centralized
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:05.880]  system they control and you get demoralized and you're so dumb down you
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:08.760]  don't even know that communism is designed to centralize power and doesn't
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:12.760]  work except for the elites you're being given a worthless college degree you pay
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:16.080]  for so we would have you so psychologically wrecked when you figure
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:20.680]  it out that you never figure it out they're just a bitter screwed up loser
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:26.120]  they don't ever want you to win and learn competency I don't want to give
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  stories about my childhood and things but the things that were horrible at the
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:35.160]  time and that were just absolutely really scary was kind of the end of
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:40.960]  America a lot of people go see movies with like gangs and people meet in a
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:45.400]  parking lot with chains and knives and people get killed and you think oh that's
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:48.880]  just in movies no that's what America if you're really a young person used to be
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:52.840]  like and it was like you were men and people said you know come meet all three
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.440]  of us after school in this in the woods or by the railroad track you went there
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:04.680]  because you were a man I mean I would go meet people knowing there'd be multiple
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:07.440]  people there they were all intended to hurt me and I would still go even though
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:14.040]  something got my leg broken concussions hospital you name it I still went where
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:18.280]  is that today that that's a fighting spirit and didn't mean I won every time
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:23.520]  either of the time I got a little bigger always did pretty much sometimes a switch
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:30.760]  had to get flipped and then people got hurt really bad every time sometimes you
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.680]  run to other men that can flip that switch and then learn not to flip that
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:36.640]  switch and that's what the global see to understand you don't even have that
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:39.760]  switch or you wouldn't want to go where you're trying to take us because you
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.200]  haven't been there as adults you didn't go through a ride some passage you're
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:48.160]  still trying to be men Zuckerberg you could be a man and help humanity and not
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:54.400]  be part of this control freak cult so could Schmidt and all of you but you
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:41:00.040]  just come from trash and so I guess trash begets trash see for him to be a
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:04.120]  man he's got to have you hooked into his false universe and his AI being dehumanized
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:08.040]  and having your psyche destroyed so he can walk by feeling like he's the biggest
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:11.400]  you know guy on the block
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:18.160]  these people are garbage and it's time to call them out for who they are it's
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:25.920]  not being afraid of and I'm calling all of them out and so is Trump and if they
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.760]  fight us we win if they kill us we win if we defeat them we win we win we win we
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:33.880]  win it's true you're gonna get so tired of winning that's what humanity's supposed
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:37.600]  to do not be a bunch of losers we've gotten to the point where anything's
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:43.000]  possible now anything we get past these people we're gonna look into the future
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.720]  and they're gonna look back and just say unbelievable this is gonna be the big
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:49.960]  game time this is gonna be celebrated this is gonna be studied there's gonna
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:53.800]  be statues there's gonna be spaceships named after what's happening there's
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:59.280]  gonna be colonies for it's gonna be unbelievable if we learn to celebrate
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:02.920]  our humanity and God and learn to celebrate the rights of passage and who
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:10.560]  we are I gotta get to the clips just briefly we've come out with I mean we
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:13.960]  always shut out to have the very best products and I just said look everybody
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:17.720]  you know everybody talks about how bone broth is so good chicken bones beef bones
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:21.640]  you name it you know boiling it all that for being sick or being healthy or for
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.560]  NFL people or weight lifters or everything else and for just super
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:28.840]  nutrients and feeling good I want to go out research the very best stuff out
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:34.440]  there and come out with our own and we've done it caveman true paleo formula
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:37.800]  info wars life calm and your purchase helps from the operation made with
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:42.280]  cartilage bone broth paleo ingredients the next generation of advanced paleo
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.960]  nutrition and it's the bones that actually have with the marrow and all the
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:53.160]  rest of it the real sustenance and that's what this has got and a lot more
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:43:00.920]  it's also that chongo mushroom alfalfa herb powder be pollen tumeric root is key
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:05.280]  and so many other ingredients chicken broth powder protein everybody knows
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:07.960]  like chicken noodle soup that's just a tiny bit of the essence of the chicken
[1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:11.920]  bones it's not if there's not chicken bones folks in your chicken noodle soup
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:14.080]  you're cooking you're not getting what grandma knew you needed when you were
[1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:18.040]  sick this is like literally hundreds of times what you get in an original chicken
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:22.160]  noodle soup each serving I mean this is like the concentrate of the chicken is
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:27.120]  the cleanest bone marrow and bone stock that's why we didn't go with beef
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  beef's powerful so you should probably just go to the butcher and say slice
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:34.720]  those thigh bones down the middle and sell me those and then just roast them
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:38.480]  with some garlic oh my god I'm getting hungry right now excuse me
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:43.520]  little bit of pepper and stuff on those and eat the marrow but then see this
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:48.640]  hasn't been cooked though so it's even better and it's got all the it's got all
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:51.680]  those you'll stem cells in it basically they're they're desiccated but you still
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:54.560]  get the essence of them so that's what it's all about the ancients were in the
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:59.800]  bones folks you know fee five four thumb I smell the blood of an Englishman be
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:04.840]  he live or be he dead oh grind his bones to make my bread he's supposed to grind
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:09.520]  the bones and put in your bread that's where all the real strength is a wolf
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:17.200]  will go for the guts and the bones first then the fat then the red meat red
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:24.160]  meat tastes great but the essence the cofactors the strength is in the bones
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:30.960]  that really kind of makes sense doesn't it they're the bones so they call silver
[1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:35.480]  silver bullet because it's good for your babies to eat off silver plates and if
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.720]  you're rich and don't want your family to die it's what you do it's all we have
[1:44:37.720 --> 1:44:41.720]  coiled silver so all the ancients already had it all figured out in four
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:45.260]  wars wife.com you go to these Olympic training camps for 20 30 years bone

[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:05.000]  shipping this out three days ago I love how the trolls have already gone in with
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  fake votes look at that everything else has a 4.8 vote but you go to the top
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:14.520]  there's been no real ones yet so a few people went in and gave it a 3.3 trying
[1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:19.600]  to hurt us because it is on a big third-party site so yeah good luck once
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.400]  people actually get the product it'll be 4.8 like brain force right next to it
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:27.840]  but there's thousands of reviews per product look at brain force 2000 plus

[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:00.240]  against you but whatever I mean they even know it's people haven't bought it
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:05.080]  they just go and say that that's how pathetic they are it's like trying to
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.240]  game Twitter and block us and all the rest of it it's just it's just it's a
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:11.320]  joke because we're kicking their ass you know we'll just get stronger you're

[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:55.240]  that way I'm genuine something you'll never have move get out the way these
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:58.680]  people have searched for power and all they founds their own destruction they
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:02.760]  were only the stimuli to strengthen us and prod us to the next level they were
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:08.280]  only the flies the gnats and the swamp biting us so we get out of the swamp then
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:14.240]  they fly back confidently to their swamp and you know nest upon piles of crap
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.760]  skip this break I just have to don't skip them all I don't care anymore let's go
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:22.560]  ahead and go to the president here it is unfortunately much of the media in
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:28.360]  Washington DC along with New York Los Angeles in particular speaks not for the
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:34.920]  people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very very
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:43.080]  obviously broken system the press has become so dishonest that if we don't
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:48.760]  talk about it we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:52.640]  tremendous disservice we have to talk about it to find out what's going on
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:56.160]  because the press honestly is out of control the level of dishonesty is out
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:01.440]  of control I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:07.000]  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:13.600]  communities well I am talking and and really talking on this very entrenched
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:19.280]  power structure and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:25.960]  we're talking about its entrenchment as a result the media is going through what
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:30.720]  they have to go through too oftentimes distort not all the time and some of the
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:35.240]  media is fantastic I have to say they're honest and fantastic but much of it is
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:39.520]  not they the distortion and we'll talk about it you'll be able to ask me
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:43.960]  questions about it but we're not going to let it happen because I'm here again
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:49.000]  to take my message straight to the people as you know our administration
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.880]  inherited many problems across government and across the economy to be
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:08.520]  honest I inherited a mess it's a mess at home and abroad a mess jobs are pouring
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:13.160]  out of the country you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:20.400]  country going to Mexico and other places low-pay low wages mass instability
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.680]  overseas no matter where you look the Middle East a disaster North Korea we'll
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.960]  take care of it folks we're going to take care of it all I just want to let
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:34.920]  you know I inherited a mess beginning on day one our administration went to work
[1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:42.160]  to tackle these challenges on foreign affairs we've already begun enormously
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:46.520]  productive talks with many foreign leaders much of it you've covered to
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:52.080]  move forward towards stability security and peace in the most troubled regions
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:57.480]  of the world which there are many we've had great conversations with the United
[1:51:57.480 --> 1:52:04.400]  Kingdom and meetings Israel Mexico Japan China and Canada really really
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:10.680]  productive conversations I would say far more I love how he's reading his own
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:15.000]  notes like he's he wrote those notes they're his words here let's keep going
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:22.960]  or productive than you would understand we've even developed a new council with
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:27.560]  Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs very important
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:32.800]  to me very important to my daughter Ivanka I have directed our defense
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:40.080]  community headed by our great general now secretary Mattis he's over there now
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:46.720]  working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS a group that
[1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:52.600]  celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:58.040]  world used to be a small group now it's in large sections of the world they've
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:53:05.440]  spread like cancer ISIS has spread like cancer and the globalist mother mess
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:10.560]  that's right now let's go to the key here bringing up just the beginning okay
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:14.920]  you keep saying I'm with Russia with no proof but I'm involved zero Hillary has
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:18.120]  ended up to her eyeballs and way worse than the uranium which even the New York
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:22.040]  Times has to admit she made the deals took the money did it one of her aides
[1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:26.840]  got 30 plus million dollars and then they made millions to her foundation I
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:30.680]  mean this was a giant criminal op with foreign governments with her meeting
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:36.480]  secretly with Putin for Russia's interests that's what governments are
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:40.520]  supposed to do and into a country's wide open to be bought off that's what they
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:46.400]  do it's Machiavelli that should stop it's dishonorable but we've been
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:50.640]  dishonorable for a long time that's the position we've got in people don't
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.520]  respect that we've had a bunch of scum hijack our power and use it to take over
[1:53:55.520 --> 1:54:00.080]  the planet for a bunch of corporations so a handful of billionaires can live
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:04.880]  like kings and and dream of being gods never gonna happen for Elon Musk or
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:10.320]  Zuckerberg or any of these people or or John O Brennan a communist in college and
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:16.480]  then converted to Islam at the CIA saying the president should watch his mouth
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:26.000]  they disrespect the real American president they're the domestic enemies
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:34.400]  by their own words here's Hillary there's where he brings up Hillary I've been
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:40.960]  begging for this he's warning him to stop they're not gonna stop and I know
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:43.120]  that he's not telling the Attorney General what to do with the Attorney
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.560]  General needs to take action and Hillary needs to be indicted and Hillary
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:51.920]  needs to be arrested as a president I know they told her election night and
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:55.520]  she collapsed and flipped out and all the behind-the-scenes stuff happened and
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:58.920]  but that's how to go up make her statement that they said okay yeah we'll
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:02.400]  capitulate we know you want and then and then and then a deal was made they're
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:06.000]  never gonna go back and actually follow the deal they're never going to stop
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.760]  destabilizing the country you have a responsibility to try to turn the economy
[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:12.880]  back on you're trying to turn the life support back on they're blocking you
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:16.400]  they're criminals take the gloves off the American people are gonna back you
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:20.320]  we're ready we're ready we want it we want to go after these people we want
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:24.560]  it they're already going after us and I know full well declaring blowing you
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:29.280]  have a horn here you know cry havoc let loose the dogs of war or you know
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.000]  chanting on the ridghtop is about to charge in on our horses screaming death
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:39.600]  death but I mean it's what these people want it's what they keep asking for they
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:43.280]  want to threaten everybody and run around like you know nobody's ever gonna
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:48.720]  stand up to them time to square up politically these are a pack of
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:53.080]  arrogant criminals and you know I know normally because it'd be too embarrassing
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:59.960]  for the country people would be dealt with another ways and I'm just tired of
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:02.840]  it so that's all I'm saying these people have done a lot of bad stuff allied
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:06.800]  with ISIS and all kind and selling our country out all things they've done and
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:09.680]  just wanted to move out of the way just want to get out of the way and they
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:11.480]  don't have a sense get out of the way we're just gonna have to get them out of
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:20.320]  the way all of David Brock all of these are just a bunch of wimps who've taken
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:28.440]  our kindness for weakness far too long and they're not gonna stop attacking us
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:33.800]  because they are betas who do you think is into all the stuff and Hillary
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:37.840]  speciality of representing child molesters it's who they are I mean they're
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:44.720]  just a pack of crap they're twisted demons they're not gonna go away they
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:50.040]  want to hurt this country in humanity they want to mount our head on the wall
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:57.320]  I trust the president I see we're moving in good directions here but they've
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:00.240]  really just uncloked themselves for destruction I think that's really what's
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:03.880]  happening we're just let them have the rope let them have the rope let them have
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:11.040]  the rope here it is Trump blast media we're gonna get to bunch of these little
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:15.920]  here's Hillary comment I didn't do anything for Russia I've done nothing
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:20.960]  for Russia Hillary Clinton gave him 20% of our uranium Hillary Clinton did a
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:24.680]  reset remember with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.040]  bunch of jerks here take a look he looked at her like what the hell is she
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:35.280]  doing with that cheap plastic button there's a longer clip and then we can
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:43.320]  find that it's powerful it's all just like stupid crap
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:47.440]  they like the Russians would think that she brought a button and we're gonna
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.280]  push it together that the Russians are like what's just just deal straight
[1:57:52.280 --> 1:57:55.760]  because the Russians will be Machiavelli if you want to be but just the world
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:59.440]  just wants straight dealing we're all tired of it let the age of chivalry
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:05.040]  return let let the age of we're gonna be totally clean about this until you get
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:08.480]  dirty and when you get dirty we're gonna be more dirty you never imagine we
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:12.400]  don't just run around being dirty because it's fun to be dirty and you know

[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:30.840]  joke I mean that's the thing it's like it'd be one thing if they were evil and
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:34.040]  like big and powerful or something they're not they're like they're just

[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:09.920]  video report trump toys with the media president trump was toying with the
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:13.960]  fake news that works again today causing several of the clowns to almost cry
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:18.560]  afterwards and complain about the way that he's treating them here's what
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.320]  happened when the counterfeit news networks white house correspondent Jim
[2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:26.120]  Acosta asked his question the same clown who trump called fake news at a
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:32.600]  previous press conference the tone if you look the hatred the I mean
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:37.160]  sometimes sometimes somebody gets well you look at your show that goes on at
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:42.400]  10 o'clock in the evening you just take a look at that show that is a constant
[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:47.480]  hit the panel is almost always exclusive anti-trump the good news is he
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:52.880]  doesn't have good ratings but the panel is almost exclusive anti-trump and the
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:58.920]  hatred in venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:07.880]  your network now I will say this I watch it I see it I'm amazed by it and I just
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:11.200]  think you'd be a lot better if I honestly do the public gets it you know
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:14.360]  look when I go to rallies they turn around they start screaming at CNN they
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:19.800]  want to throw their placards at CNN you know I I think you would do much better
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:24.080]  by being different but you just take a look take a look at some of your shows
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:28.680]  in the morning in the evening if a guest comes out and says something positive
[2:01:28.680 --> 2:01:33.800]  about me it's it's brutal now they'll take this news conference I'm actually
[2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:37.120]  having a very good time okay but they'll take this news conference don't forget
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:40.200]  that's the way I want remember I used to give you a news conference every time I
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:44.640]  made a speech which was like every day okay no that's how I won I won with news
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:48.080]  conference and probably speeches I certainly didn't win by people listening
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:51.920]  to you people that's the show but I'm having a good time tomorrow they will
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:56.840]  say Donald Trump rants and raves at the press I'm not ranting and raving I'm
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:01.240]  just telling you getting it just honest people but I'm not ranting and raving I
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:04.880]  love this I'm having a good time doing it but tomorrow the headlines are going
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:11.360]  to be Donald Trump rants and I'm not ranting and go ahead one more one more
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:14.640]  fall should I let him have a little bit more what do you think Peter this Peter
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:19.040]  should I have let him have a little sit down sit down just because of the just
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:22.800]  because the attack of fake news and attacking our network I just want to
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:26.840]  ask you sir I'm changing it from fake news though doesn't that under very fake
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:33.440]  I know but aren't you go ahead real news
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:38.040]  Chuck Todd the host of meet the press over on NBC nothing but clowns tweeted
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:41.240]  out this is not a laughing matter I'm sorry
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:46.120]  delegitimizing the press is un-American what about constantly comparing Donald
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:50.520]  Trump to Adolf Hitler you idiots like Jake Tapper who tweeted this out after
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:55.080]  the press conference Trump tells Jewish magazine reporter to sit down but
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:03:00.120]  blames anti-semitism on the other side yes apparently it's anti-semitic to
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.360]  tell a reporter to sit down when it's not their turn here's Shepherd Smith the
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:09.360]  future MSNBC host who for some reason still over at Fox News almost crying
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:14.720]  about the way Trump treated the press today you call us fake news and put us
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:18.040]  down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:22.720]  people is inconsequential people deserve that answer no shepherd you
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:26.160]  deserve to be fired and he probably would have a long time ago except Fox
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:29.000]  News is probably afraid that he would sue them for discrimination because he's
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.120]  gay let's check in with Jake Tapper over at the clown news network to see how he
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:38.960]  is responding to this hilarious press conference it was a wild press conference
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:45.320]  and I think that first of all purportedly the purpose of it was to
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:50.000]  introduce his new secretary of labor nominee Alexander Acosta he spent the
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.600]  first part of his remarks talking about accomplishments that he thought the
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:58.360]  media the fake media whatever he wants to cause we're not paying enough
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:03.320]  attention to but then instead of focusing on extreme media and offering an
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:09.600]  optimistic positive view of what he's doing for this country it was an airing
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:14.240]  of grievances it was Festivus it was someone complains being able to stand
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:18.960]  up to us when we just want to chain you down and beat you up it was wild and I
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:22.920]  can't believe that there are Republicans and he was fighting back against
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:27.640]  doesn't not letting us run things and that might play well with the 44% of the
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:32.280]  population that voted for the president no it's now 55 and cook pause it's like
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:36.280]  65 in reality Dumbo that guy is not focused on me I don't even know what
[2:04:36.280 --> 2:04:40.480]  he's focused on the Americans are watching this and thinking finally we
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:44.200]  have a president who speaks his mind and is calling out these scumbag mainstream
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:48.520]  media for the clowns that they are a mark dice thanks for watching subscribe to

[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:10.800]  she preached I'm not going anywhere sanctuary cities are racist all the
[2:05:10.800 --> 2:05:16.680]  jobs are going to illegals that is wrong you're not going to be allowed to get
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:22.320]  away with it the black community has been destroyed by racist illegal

[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:38.160]  just goes to show that the African-Americans know that Trump's
[2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:43.520]  immigration policies are going to benefit the inner cities maybe if the
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:48.160]  left would stop virtue signaling for a moment they'd realize that their
[2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:52.880]  misguided efforts to interfere with Trump's policies are counterproductive

[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:48.120]  praise the Lord I saw the light
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:56.080]  We had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that in all
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:09:00.640]  fairness to President Obama long before President Obama we have had a very
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:04.840]  divided I didn't come along and divide this country this country was seriously
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:09.080]  divided before I got here we're gonna work on it very hard one of the questions
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:11.680]  I was asked I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities I
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:15.520]  mean that's part of it but we're gonna work on education we're gonna work on
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:18.400]  lack you know we're gonna stop we're gonna try and stop the crime we have
[2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:22.040]  great law enforcement officials we're gonna try and stop crime we're not gonna
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:27.040]  try and so we're gonna stop crime but it's very important to me but this is in
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:31.480]  Donald Trump that divided a nation we went eight years with President Obama
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:39.080]  and we went many years before President Obama we lived in a divided nation and I
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:46.320]  am gonna try I will do everything within my power to fix that Mark Dice is our
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:51.400]  guess you know I remember Mark Dice I guess something showed like 10 12 years
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:56.040]  ago whatever doing his work media analyst degrees in that salesman as well
[2:09:56.040 --> 2:10:00.880]  author I remember just telling him man not being patronizing I'm just saying
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:04.080]  this is an example where I was right I said stop trying to have shows on
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:07.480]  national TV they're always gonna censor you and he's had some shows on national
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.400]  TV and hosts and things and I remember getting really depressed like four or
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:15.240]  five years ago about it and you get mad at me about things or whatever and I
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:18.720]  remember calling him I said you're one of those talented people I know if you'll
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:23.680]  just start doing stuff every day and just forget about trying to be a success
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:26.200]  because I've been like this to everybody has somebody trying to help
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:29.800]  somebody who's a little bit older than them out that I have all the answers and
[2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:33.600]  I said if you'll just do it you I know you care you'll be super successful
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:39.000]  because you're so smart and do a great job but don't get mad at me for the fact
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.800]  that you know in some of our dealings you don't as much success as you'd like
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:44.600]  I don't mean to bring up personal stuff here on the air it's just that I'm so
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:48.440]  proud of the fact that he's almost got a million subscribers on YouTube and he's
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:52.120]  brought all these books back into print and has bestsellers and you know it's
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:57.040]  done so much because look at Paul Watson Paul Watson I mean I can tell you
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:02.000]  almost reaches as many people as I do now okay and I hope Paul gets way
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:06.040]  better than I do I see here's the deal I'm not in competition with other men
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:10.800]  that I'd be better than them at everything I want to defeat people that
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:15.880]  are out to get us all I'm in a total war against the New World Order and I know
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:19.760]  we can beat him and so I just wanted to take some time out and talk about Mark
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:23.200]  because you know Mark just you know he's branched out and he's doing these
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:27.040]  commentaries and these analysis that are just the best things out there I mean
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:32.200]  it's so when you see something so good so on spot way better than what's on you
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:35.880]  know any mainstream media and I don't just mean content wise but just wit wise
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:39.520]  and everything it's a good thing and that's why I want to encourage other
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:42.280]  people no matter what color you are where you came from you know if you're an
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:45.680]  old man you get your nephew or you know you're a grandson to put you on
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:50.760]  YouTube just sit out by the pond and talk about the world the normal people
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:54.200]  speaking out in this whole internet village system is what will beat them
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:57.160]  because they're bringing the censorship now they're admitting it they're
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:01.360]  announcing it it's getting bad and that's why whether it's drudge or you
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:04.040]  know whether it's daily caller or world that daily or bright Bart I'm not in
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:07.880]  competition with Steven Bannon I'm not gonna talk about little discussions
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:11.040]  we've had I think what I mean I hope right markets ten times bigger than in
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:14.400]  fours effect I don't want to be the biggest thing out there and after drudge
[2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:17.680]  you know we're when it comes to multimedia we're the biggest thing
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:22.320]  there is 40 50 million people a week conservatively and folks that's
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:28.000]  conservative some weeks 90 plus million now okay so you look at that
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:31.240]  responsibility that's a big responsibility we've got when you think
[2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:36.720]  about how evil these people are it makes you better because then you think I
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:41.200]  don't want to be like them I want to be strong and true I want to be a knight
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:44.720]  in shining armor I really want to take these people on because they mean to
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:49.360]  break this country in this world once and for all and Mark of course is all the
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:53.720]  famous videos the hundreds of millions of years is showing dumb down lefties I
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:57.320]  mean that is bullied dumb down people told they have no responsibility from
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:00.480]  birth do whatever you want just wander around they're almost soulless and we
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:05.480]  don't make fun of them for pleasure we do it because they're so fallen we're
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:09.000]  scared but they only care about what peers think because they're bullied they
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:12.840]  never get past age five and peer pressure so you have to laugh at them
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:15.440]  because that's what they don't like you ever have let this come over to you in
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:20.120]  DC or wherever I'm at like 20 of them laugh at me and I'm like you think I'm
[2:13:20.120 --> 2:13:25.000]  in junior high like we're where people are laughing at me and I care dude by the
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  time I was like 14 I wouldn't date high school girls no more I wanted out of
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.520]  high school when I was in middle school I wanted in high school I don't care what
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:36.640]  you think about me when you're in a loser cult that has nothing that means
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:41.560]  nothing that is nothing and you want to make me a loser too and you've been
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:44.440]  given a psychological virus by the globalist I want to go to Mark we just
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:47.920]  played his powerful new clip you know analyzing this this press conference
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:52.520]  yesterday that was bullies coming face-to-face with somebody just calling
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:58.080]  them out and they are in total and complete panic right now so Mark you
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:03.280]  know just amazing to see where things are going again your new video you know
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:07.400]  reporters are absolutely panicking Trump toys reporters at press conference
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:12.480]  today they're at mark dice calm we've linked it up on info wars calm I want
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:15.600]  just a brief time we have talk about where you see the world today but also
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:19.880]  how they're gonna counter strike back and how do we mobilize and fight the
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:24.240]  billion Soros is putting in and Obama's organizing to really go next level and
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:29.040]  and try to bully us physically into submission in the streets at the
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.520]  colleges and the schools but on cyberspace I mean I think we should really
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:37.400]  raise the alarm and really fight harder than we did even during the election
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:42.160]  because that was a battle the wars here yeah we've sort of stormed the city
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:45.840]  we're inside the gates but the real battle has begun and with the mainstream
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:49.760]  media being so desperate we're seeing them I mean really almost their their
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:53.200]  last breaths and they're gonna do everything they can to try to regain
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:56.840]  the foothold that they've had which is why Facebook is rolling out their new
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:01.880]  censorship tools Twitter has been doing it more and more incrementally announced
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:05.640]  some new tools now they're trying to prevent people's tweets from showing up
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:09.960]  to those who don't follow them so that it doesn't spread across platforms that
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.400]  you can't have your message seen by someone who's not in the same someone
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:18.920]  who's outside of the same bubble as you and Trump is right to be mocking the
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:21.880]  the mainstream media and he wasn't yelling at them he wasn't screaming he
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:25.640]  wasn't unhinged they call these ponies because that's their tool that's the key
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:29.960]  their tool is mocking at a junior high level it doesn't get to us or him but
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:34.560]  it gets to them and they should be mocked CNN did a report it was an
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:38.880]  investigation about whether Adele won the Grammy for best album this year over
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:44.600]  Beyonce because of the possible racist Grammy voters that was a real headline on
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:49.280]  CNN when I saw the tweet I thought maybe this has to be like a parody Twitter
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:54.160]  account but no that that's a real CNN story is that they think that the
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:59.160]  Beyonce beloved Beyonce lost the Grammy because of white supremacists or the
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:04.440]  white privilege of Adele and they're so crazy when we see the same thing with
[2:16:04.440 --> 2:16:08.400]  the NFL I mean they said that was white supremacy because there was a few white
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.760]  players yeah they're upset about the supposed lack of diversity on the
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:17.280]  Patriots team and that the Patriots win was symbolic of the white you know
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:22.480]  hegemony hegemony in this country and they deserve to be mocked and they're
[2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:26.280]  failing and that's why my YouTube channel has almost a million subscribers
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:30.280]  it's amazing just sitting in my kitchen I reach more people in most
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:34.480]  CNN show has a hundred thousand viewers you reach millions every day just and
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:38.520]  that's that's extended over their entire half hour or hour show so if you
[2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:42.360]  break down their segments into you know three or four five-minute segments I
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:48.360]  mean we're paralleling my channel is paralleling CNN and MSNBC Jake Tapper
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:52.800]  and I got into a Twitter beef months ago and I just did a video about it and
[2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:56.920]  almost a million people watched the video more people watched my YouTube
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:17:02.400]  video analyzing Jake Tapper and I's beef on Twitter then actually watch that's
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:05.600]  right and of course they know they're nothing now that's why they're really so
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:09.400]  pissed so so so where do they go from here it's not about oh my channel's big
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:12.240]  your channel's big we're not bragging we're telling listeners their whole
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:16.680]  illusion is that you know we don't get press passes we're not real news when
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:19.520]  they're the fake stream news I you probably already heard that term I just
[2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:22.160]  came up with myself but found people are already using it yeah any good ideas
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:25.800]  already already out there usually don't territorialize it but fake stream news
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.920]  isn't that the name because they're fake but they're the mainstream then we
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:33.920]  associate the term fake with fake stream I think that's the word I can't wait for
[2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:37.560]  president Trump to call CNN the counterfeit news network or the clown
[2:17:37.560 --> 2:17:41.480]  news network and we just have to keep sticking it to them that CNN got so
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:45.240]  upset with people calling them fake news that they conducted a study to try to
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:51.280]  see if the term fake news was damaging their brand and of course that's why
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:55.400]  if people say fake news on there even Bernie Sanders is a joke they cut his
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:18:00.440]  feet it's an order that if somebody says that you cut their feet the mainstream
[2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:05.640]  even destroyed their brand is already filled don't they get that no they don't
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:11.320]  we have a youtuber PewDiePie who is the most popular youtuber ever 53 maybe 54
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:15.600]  million subscribers seeing fake news brought him down yeah yeah a coordinated
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:18.560]  attack between the Wall Street Journal and other major media outlets trying to
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:22.880]  smear him as a white supremacist we have tech magazines like Wired which have
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:26.160]  been going political in the last year and a half trying to bring down Trump with
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:30.680]  stories that have nothing to do with politics or tech or with tech whatsoever
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:36.520]  they're just literally tech magazines sports magazines ESPN deadspin all these
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:40.720]  non-political outlets are becoming political in stories that really have
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:44.360]  nothing to do with what their core readership is and so the mainstream
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:49.240]  trying to smear PewDiePie as a hero of white supremacists that was a real
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:55.120]  headline on a wire to set the precedent to ban somebody who was number one to
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:58.640]  test can we ban someone completely innocent who I think puts out a bunch
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:03.280]  of crap dribble but it's certainly not even any more near racist I mean can we
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:07.640]  can we shoot down somebody who has tens of millions of kids watching every day
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:10.800]  we don't want that we want to teach him how to be trannies and give blowjobs
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:14.600]  and commit suicide and hate themselves we don't want them watching this guy
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:17.240]  they were just jealous of him because he wasn't teaching him how to commit
[2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:20.400]  suicide and so they said how do we get the kids back with us learning how to
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:25.080]  commit suicide so they bandied yeah I mean you'll never see Buzzfeed have any
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:29.440]  of their videos censored or have the ads stripped and for well over a year even
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:34.440]  a year before it became common knowledge that YouTube was censoring ads you
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:37.640]  know us youtubers in the alternative news community knew that this was
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:42.480]  happening but it wasn't until a bigger youtuber decided to talk about it or
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:45.440]  became aware of it that it started training on social media so we were a
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:50.400]  year ahead of the curve seeing the censorship trying to strip ads from
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:54.200]  our channels because they don't want us to be able to be funded in order to do
[2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:58.040]  this and that's one way at them trying to censor that's why they're telling you
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:01.400]  and even doing this for years you know yourself got books are great but people
[2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:04.400]  don't buy a lot of books you know put out a film do whatever have a coffee mug
[2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:07.160]  whatever people understand they're trying to strangle us you just say hey I
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:10.480]  got a couple products here you can maybe give a coffee mug to somebody they'll
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:13.880]  tune into the show you know ten bucks I make five bucks I need your support of
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:16.760]  I'm gonna do this people get that they want to support you so I've just been
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:21.200]  saying for years get some swag you know because a market people want to support
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:25.480]  you I want to see the whole operation I want to see you you know rivaling in
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:30.040]  fours you know it's been really amazing and it just goes to show that with
[2:20:30.040 --> 2:20:36.200]  dedication and hard work and with a mission you can become an incredible
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:39.400]  success and there was a time where I thought oh you know nobody's watching
[2:20:39.400 --> 2:20:42.760]  my videos I remember talking to you like four years ago and I'm not trying to
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:47.800]  brag about this but was my pep talk not right yeah it was it was great man and
[2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:50.520]  you know you've had a great inspiration for me and you've paved the path it's
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:53.960]  been amazing to watch your career expand and I don't want to talk about you
[2:20:53.960 --> 2:20:56.280]  because you're the product you know kind of a prodigal son for a little while
[2:20:56.280 --> 2:21:00.320]  and I'm just saying you know it's good to set an example of not being you know a
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:03.360]  kind of a chicken you know what on my end if you know let turn on the other
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:07.080]  cheek and that's all the Bible there's times to do it times and not but I'm
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:10.040]  not bragging about what I did I just really value you in the fight against
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:13.200]  the globalist we need you and I'm just glad you got out of that for other
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:17.000]  people to get into in fighting and that virus they try to push on trolling on
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:20.080]  the web against ourselves we've got to get through that because people think
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:24.200]  that's the path of success when you don't have immediate you know success to
[2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:26.840]  take care of yourself which you do this because you love the truth but you need
[2:21:26.840 --> 2:21:29.560]  to be able to take care of yourself you know and so I get it but I was just
[2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:34.520]  saying truly be yourself to quit trying to have a show on national TV you will
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:38.560]  be huge you did it and you went from huge to gigantic funny saying your
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:43.240]  testimony to other people out there about the path to real success fighting
[2:21:43.240 --> 2:21:47.960]  tearing you know what I had meetings with I literally had a meeting with
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:50.920]  so they called you and said we want you to pledge to say not I've been there
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:54.520]  when I was 14 I know they so they tell me call you and they say we want you to
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:57.040]  worship Satan to be part of the group don't I get it to tell folks about that
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:22:01.640]  well a couple years ago I had meetings with most of the major networks about
[2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:05.040]  you know hosting a show and investigative you know kind of conspiracy
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:09.840]  type of a show and one of the one of the heads of one of the major studios I
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:16.040]  mean we got into a spiritual discussion and he did overtly indicate that that
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:19.560]  he he liked Satan he thought Satan was the savior and I'm sitting there the
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:23.600]  social real the Hollywood sign is literally right out the window in his
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:28.640]  office just you can see it off in the back it was so bizarre and I had a
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:33.160]  meeting with CNN and later on the studios started telling me of course I
[2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:36.440]  never would have went to work with them I even told the studio which is for
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:39.800]  those who don't know studios are independent companies that produce
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:43.880]  shows for networks and then sell them to network so CNN didn't really know what
[2:22:43.880 --> 2:22:47.400]  they were getting into it was just a meeting with another studio pitching a
[2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:52.320]  show to their network so I went there and it was so bizarre it only went
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:55.120]  because I wanted to to be able to laugh at it and I took pictures in the
[2:22:55.120 --> 2:22:59.560]  boardroom with CNN etched into the walls into the windows and this is in
[2:22:59.560 --> 2:23:03.560]  Hollywood now for those people you would expect seeing this was after you woke up
[2:23:03.560 --> 2:23:06.840]  the fact that you before you weren't like wanting to be part of it you were
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:09.960]  just investigating it and it was kind of a bummer but because I remember this was
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:12.680]  after you'd already totally didn't want to be with them you just went because it
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:15.800]  was interesting again Fox News does this they have thousands of people on
[2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:18.960]  retainer to be analysts but only to control them and not have them on air
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:23.080]  it's the same thing Hollywood has these constant meetings just to keep artists
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:27.400]  in Hollywood not competing with them and they call it a tithe they go let's go
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:30.960]  to this tithe meeting with these people to steal your ideas and then never give
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:35.320]  you anything and then never make you successful but so you stay there and
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:40.040]  don't create your own art elsewhere see it's all a very warred-out plan go ahead
[2:23:40.040 --> 2:23:44.960]  and how interesting is it for those who don't know that CNN has probably a 12
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:49.080]  story building in Hollywood I'm talking about two blocks away from Hollywood
[2:23:49.080 --> 2:23:53.520]  Boulevard so you'd expect CNN to be in New York or in Atlanta Washington DC they
[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:58.600]  have a I would estimate a huge 12 well it's really a branch of the CIA that's
[2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:01.480]  been declassified so they're there to write scripts for Hollywood that's
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:05.680]  really what's going on in most those rooms but go ahead and the old old media
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:09.320]  the mainstream media I mean they're really at a loss because the technology
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:13.800]  that we have is so inexpensive and so powerful that someone like me or someone
[2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:17.800]  like PewDiePie who produces you know idiotic mindless entertainment for
[2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:24.680]  for kids and you know teenagers are able to with a very small budget virtually
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:29.640]  nothing produce content that is seen by millions and hundreds of millions of
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:33.560]  people they don't know what to do and so you know even the producer that was
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:37.800]  working with he's trying to get into the YouTube space now because he doesn't
[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:41.960]  want to waste his time putting together a show that might get seen by a half a
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:45.840]  million or a million people on a major network when you can just sit in your
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:49.040]  kitchen and produce content and that's why they're trying to bring down PewDiePie
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.600]  they're trying to bring down me you know the New York Times just did a hit piece
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:57.200]  an entire article almost entirely dedicated to me about fake news and
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:25:02.400]  seemed a London Guardian I mean what you do is commentary like like oh I was all
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:05.600]  over the news last week Alan Jones said the performance was satanic what was
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:10.340]  clearly authoritarian satanic she wears Hitler outfits you know at other events
[2:25:10.340 --> 2:25:13.640]  most of Super Bowls are satanic they're like oh they're crazy it's not
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:17.720]  satanic thinking their audience is idiotic everybody knows the Grammys
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:22.920]  and you know the Emmys and just all it's all it's all satanic I mean it's
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:27.400]  quite clear that that's the core of liberalism is is godlessness or you
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:31.760]  say this I mean quite literally they openly Hillary's pen pal and her
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:35.560]  mentor she met with you know pledged his book to Lucifer and his love of
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:40.640]  Luciferianism you know Saul Owensky they just look look I've been there I've
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:43.920]  been at the Mansions I've been there and they go yes we worship Lucifer it's the
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:47.080]  real God John as you can have all these women all the power and people don't
[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:50.760]  know until you get successful well they saw me before that one of me but when
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:55.480]  you get successful they come and people just don't understand this go ahead and
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:59.280]  that's why Kanye West had his you know supposed mental breakdown where he
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:03.080]  started ranting and raving at one of the Illuminati and devil worshiped him the
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:07.160]  news he said the news is all censored Google is censored I mean it they're
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:11.680]  now because of the election loss of Hillary they're rolling out all of the
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:15.400]  stuff that they've been testing they're getting ready to implement it so that if
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:18.560]  you just simply Google things they're shaking they're shaking and they're
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:22.280]  gonna bring the censorship in when they kill Trump so they're lining up like
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:25.280]  like like you know about to start World War two the armies are lining up right
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.840]  now folks we gotta have maximum alert but then the time we have I mean are are
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:33.600]  you not overall though optimistic and positive that nationalism the awakening
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:38.480]  is huge and I mean you know so the more they use AI and manipulation on us which
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:41.480]  they admit they're doing the more it just accelerates those of us that are
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:45.480]  awake those that fall the programming is very sad but you know they were the
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:49.200]  weak ones we try to help them we don't abuse the weak ones it's just sad we
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:53.320]  can't get too obsessed and triage you know when people fall to this when people
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:57.160]  die before they physically die we mourn their death but they're no longer alive
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:01.440]  they're just zombies we're seeing a massive resurgence of conservatism
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:05.400]  because you have a lot of the generation Z kids who have been growing up
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:09.840]  watching this in the same censorship of people telling them that they can't wear
[2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:13.040]  certain Halloween costumes they can't say certain things they can't like a
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:16.840]  certain political candidate that half of the country likes and that they're
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:21.360]  starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together and so we're seeing a huge
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:26.760]  resurgence of conservatism amongst the younger generations and a lot of them
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:30.280]  are taking to YouTube a lot of them are going to be the future you know
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:36.000]  conservative YouTube stars and it is very exciting and the battles really
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:39.120]  just getting started but the left is getting so desperate that we have to
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.920]  just continue to mock them because I think we have a tendency to not
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:46.560]  be victims does not complain we're all being censored block Trump doesn't get
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:49.880]  positive comments in his Twitter so the public can't even communicate with him
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:53.640]  if like poses an enemy you know almost code words even get up there to talk to
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:57.080]  him so so I mean people sometimes Trump just calls folks off Twitter folks he's
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:00.920]  amazing he loves the average people he grew up with his dad they like barbecue
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:03.760]  and stuff with the workers every day and they hung out with the guys he's got
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:06.120]  street smarts when he's like the blue-collar billionaire and that's why
[2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:08.840]  they hate him he really likes people and the globalists have nothing but the
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:12.080]  stain because they haven't been in the streets like Trump has but I just want
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:16.080]  to I've invited you before you're so busy I'll fly you out here you close for a
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:19.080]  couple days I'm not ready to fill in for me I got plenty of hosts but I'd love
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.680]  for you to come out here mark and we're gonna watch more stuff soon I love for
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:24.240]  you to have your own daily show here if you wanted to do it I'll just say that
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:27.000]  on air we got a lot of things we're planning that we're not here you know
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:30.400]  being interrupted by me every 10 seconds so let's just get this done because you
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:33.320]  were talking about some ideas I heard you know with Nico we'll just just come
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:36.960]  here come on here we'll fly out here and you know get you involved somehow what
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:40.200]  we're doing is we really appreciate your work and where this is going but I got
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:44.760]  to tell you I'm really glad we all bet on Trump because you can really see he's
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:49.800]  the real deal as well as down yet and it's gonna be a really exciting ride
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:54.800]  every day he's continuing to keep his promises and it's hilarious to see the
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:58.680]  left completely fall apart and collapse they have no argument which is why
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:02.360]  they're getting crazy and they're getting violent and you know what I gotta hold
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:05.760]  you over can you do five more minutes I just forgot something you started
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:08.880]  calling yourself the resistance move I'd called it that too but you branded it as
[2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:11.400]  that kind of a Terminator deal if you're listening this should the resist
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:13.920]  though that's good I'll say that too I've been sitting there for like you know
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:18.920]  15 years whatever 10 years I forget but they're now saying we're the resistance
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:22.400]  where the resistance the big corporate media the Saudi Arabians the Chinese the
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:25.880]  EU the mega banks you know they're all the whole media attacking Trump and us
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:29.200]  and they're the resistance so you're the guy that first really started using that
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:33.920]  I want to ask you when we come back mark dies mark dies calm and people say
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:36.560]  well I just his website we go to his youtuber face but he doesn't control it
[2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:39.240]  they could take it away at any time go to his website get on his email list us
[2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:42.840]  to just again it's I'm gonna talk about that too when we come back because how
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:46.840]  do we really get folks to truly come together so they can't censor us I've
[2:29:46.840 --> 2:29:52.600]  got a plan I want to mark thanks on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:30:02.080]  and the GCN radio network an African-American Trump supporter passionately
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:07.040]  slammed a town hall meeting regarding sanctuary cities she preached I'm not
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:12.440]  going anywhere sanctuary cities are racist all the jobs are going to
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:17.840]  illegals that is wrong you're not going to be allowed to get away with it the
[2:30:17.840 --> 2:30:24.080]  black community has been destroyed by racist illegal immigration and we're
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:29.840]  not gonna have it she roared thank God for Trump thank God for sessions and
[2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:35.760]  you should be ashamed of yourselves how dare you this just goes to show that the
[2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:40.720]  African-Americans know that Trump's immigration policies are going to
[2:30:40.720 --> 2:30:46.240]  benefit the inner cities maybe if the left would stop virtue signaling for a
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:50.440]  moment they'd realize that their misguided efforts to interfere with
[2:30:50.440 --> 2:30:55.160]  Trump's policies are counterproductive this is Millie Weaver signing off for

[2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:15.440]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:43.440]  what's the go-in price she told me to go to hell
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:49.400]  why do I play that on purpose because the big church folks will say oh my gosh
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:52.480]  that's so devilish we didn't play that song because I like how it sounds I
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:57.680]  admit I'm worldly I love God I go protest abortions clinics I stand up
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:03.600]  against evil I risk my life but then I'm you know I'm not perfect and the point
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:06.680]  is it's there's something honest about people singing and saying what they're
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:10.440]  really thinking instead of all these fakes to tell you how good they are all
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:14.600]  day and they're the ones that are molesting kids behind the scenes I'm
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:17.800]  here to tell you it's like I love that Trump played rock and roll your show
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:20.960]  when he came out of the press conference the media was like what on earth is this
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:26.560]  it's like I don't care I feel like doing this it'll freak you out he's all
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:30.840]  about the confidence he has and the fact that he's not out to get anybody but
[2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:34.200]  you're not gonna run him over and he looks at what they've done to America and
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:38.600]  always the least he's like this is really bad to not build an economy where
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:43.120]  the people have success or the people have any you know type of honor but I
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:46.720]  wanted to act ask mark dies here before he leaves us I think I even forget the
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:49.120]  question but I'm sure he remembers it was it was basically how do we defeat
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:52.760]  their attempts at censorship how do we make a big deal about Trump's you know
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:56.280]  Twitter even being censored and some other questions I was asking him but
[2:34:56.280 --> 2:34:58.720]  you know I'm teleprompter free I didn't write notes but what the question was I'm
[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:04.440]  sure again he'll remember but I don't make a big deal out of the fact that if
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.520]  you don't go to sign up at info wars.com forward slash newsletter when they
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:11.880]  start shut the stuff more down I never I wish I'd have set up the last 20 years
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.360]  email so I could send you videos articles and bypass them I never wanted to do
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:18.960]  it never dealt with it's like a few years ago and we've only got like a
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:22.600]  million emails that sounds like a lot we reached billions and billions and
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:26.260]  billions and billions and billions and billions of people I mean we've reached
[2:35:26.260 --> 2:35:29.600]  like probably three billion people total probably six seven billion views on
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:32.980]  YouTube now it's like five billion a few years ago total YouTube told us they
[2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:36.600]  said we want to monetize all this they sent us stuff we had to do nondisclosures
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:39.680]  all that kind of stuff but they think they got the real analytics and they're
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:42.560]  like we want to monetize this you got over five billion views I said I don't
[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:45.560]  want to shut all those channels down and do all that I said they could have it so
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:48.840]  I'm just not gonna do it but we can monetize a few of ours you know but
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:53.480]  again I knew they could take it away at any time so it funds a fraction of what
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:58.600]  we do but if we don't have your email we can't send you 50% off on a product or
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:02.840]  a key video or a breaking alert same thing with with dice I see him all of
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:06.480]  the news he never even says mark dice calm drudge is right when he came here
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:11.440]  only interviews done like four years and he said you gotta get out of these
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:14.360]  internet ghettos and have your own thing because then the web becomes about
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:18.640]  websites again not just Facebook Twitter and Google who can control you and
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:22.360]  Apple systems that we don't block Joe Rogan's podcast for a few days and then
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:27.160]  won't list it as the all-time podcast of all time but I'm gonna call Joe he wants
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:30.040]  me to come back on maybe mark I should come on for four hours that would be a
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:33.000]  great interview because I just want to promote other cool people in the fight
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.880]  because there's also safety in that and I'm not a coward but the thing is again I
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:40.880]  want to stress this I'm not in competition with other patriots I'm in
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:45.080]  competition with globalists that want to destroy competition I'm in competition
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:48.440]  against monopolies and so I just keep saying that because the people I respect
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:53.560]  most are like people like Matt drudge who literally has given Promethean fire to
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:56.840]  hundreds of websites and groups and organizations because I know the behind
[2:36:56.840 --> 2:37:00.840]  the scenes traffic info most these places wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Matt
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:03.440]  drudge so people say why do you go back to make drugs too much because the guy
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:08.800]  is a is it is an unbelievable angel I mean he's just like that prime mover like
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:14.400]  drunk drudge is right up there in the compendium Trump's done more in two years
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:18.080]  than drudge has done the last five but but if you go back 20 years with drudge
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:25.600]  and his evolution it's like drudge is the key to so much I mean Breitbart was
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:29.520]  created all of it he was all spawned out of him I was on air right at the same
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:32.960]  time as him was on another track but it influenced me but it's like that wave we
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:35.960]  kind of came at the same time him a little bit before me and it's just
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:40.880]  there's that kinship of being in that same you know waves he was like you know
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:44.600]  you know a hundred yards ahead of me and it's just like it's all about winning
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:48.680]  against them it's not about you know and again I'm competitive I'm all about
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:52.760]  free market but they say they're collectivists all day but then they
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:57.080]  actually want to destroy the individual I'm an individual but together we create
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:01.440]  collective dreams of what works best through our individual decisions they
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.080]  claim their collectivists are about the individual through collectivism they
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:07.560]  want to end the individual I want to empower the individual through individual
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:11.320]  action but together then it comes together and creates a beautiful tapestry
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:17.440]  of the collective so I'm the ultimate collectivist the ultimate collectivism
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:22.000]  is pure individualism now going back to Mark here again has a lot of his own
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:25.120]  points I'm gonna try to ship about five minutes just about gestalts how do we
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:29.800]  defeat them what do we do we don't bitch we're not victims but it's rock and
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.560]  roll it's it's it's sex pistols it's it's counterculture but not fake
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.680]  globalist counterculture that they had was anti-christian it's real counter
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:41.520]  culture that they're blocking us attacking us saying we're the enemy saying
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:45.720]  shut us down I mean this is sick I mean we should be 50 times bigger quite
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:49.520]  frankly that they're having FCC meetings about shutting drudge down or
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:53.280]  having the Communist Chinese quote help Zuckerberg shut us down this is
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:59.200]  sensational so so comments on that where we go what we do mark dice we need to go
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:03.160]  back to the fundamentals of bookmarking websites that we like to go to instead of
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.280]  just relying on the Facebook feeds because as we know and we need to just
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:11.160]  continue to repeat these issues because we got a lot of new people every
[2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:16.760]  segment that they censor everything that's posted on Facebook I mean I see
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:20.960]  people uploading my videos on their Facebook page which is a free boot
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:26.640]  copyright infringement and it'll get five seven million views on my own video my
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:30.800]  own page it'll get fifty thousand and so they're obviously censoring they don't
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:34.920]  want certain material to go viral and it's kind of common sense once you
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:39.360]  become aware of it but for your average Joe who you know just works at nine to
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:43.000]  five and maybe a part-time job and try to get some extra money they come home
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:45.400]  they're standing through their Facebook feeds thinking that they're gonna be
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:48.880]  getting the news from the pages that they're following they're not going to
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:52.680]  and these new censorship tools just rolled out on Twitter where if you use
[2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:57.360]  certain words they're hiding your tweets from anyone except for your
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:01.400]  followers because they don't want it to be read but we can hijack resistance
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:05.320]  because they've hijacked it from us now learn to talk that that's what I want to
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:07.760]  talk about because they know hijack that you can be smart and use words that
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.080]  they're using but then hijack them just get around the AI it counts on you being
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:17.080]  stupid so use their terms and say look at these right-wing filth and then you
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.760]  get out and you're at they're actually coming to the truth your website's
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:24.920]  info wars there there's hashtag wars which are going on on Twitter where
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:29.400]  people will hijack a hashtag we'll see some liberals whining about a certain
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:33.280]  issue or spewing their disinformation and then we'll see a flood of conservatives
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:38.200]  using that hashtag in a in a very creative way or a certain phrase that's
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:41.880]  trending in order to get their tweets to try to show up and so that's part of
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:45.080]  the reason they're rolling out the censorship tools is they don't want the
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:49.360]  merger of those two different worlds because they want people to see that's
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:53.120]  right that's key repeat that Google admits for a decade their plan is
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:57.040]  compartmentalization keeping us all on our own little niches thinking we're
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:00.600]  winning but never letting us out of them the key is going and engaging liberals
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:04.040]  I had a New York Times photographer here with freelancer and I said well if you're
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:06.760]  good photographer you know give me your car we need some photographers do jobs
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:10.240]  you will do you pay money and she's being real nice until then no yeah of
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:12.600]  course she was well I just you know I basically probably can't because you know
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:15.760]  you know I can't be involved people like you and I was just like man that's a
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:20.200]  cult and and she was like kind of on a power trip and I went you understand I
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:23.560]  can get all photographers I want I was reaching out to you as a human you were
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:27.440]  doing this whole fake act but you were missing icy pants and then when we got
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:31.520]  down the road meets the road you're just here for you your bosses sent you in
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:36.840]  here I'm not stupid see I'm a human and Trump shutting down the plan to shut
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:40.320]  down the rest of coal power plants is gonna help poor people so you think
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:44.280]  about that go ahead this is why so many of the liberals thought that it was
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:47.240]  gonna be an easy win for Hillary because they were in their own little echo
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:51.280]  chambers and of course one of the major reasons the polls were wrong is because
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:55.800]  they had bullied people into being afraid to express themselves not only
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:42:00.560]  online but perhaps in person or on the phone if a pollster were to call them
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:04.600]  family members were also over sampling yeah and they were trying to create a
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:08.600]  self-fulfilling prophecy trying to make people believe that Hillary was gonna
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:13.280]  win so why go out and even waste your vote or people not wanting to vote for a
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:17.320]  supposed loser and you know that's probably why my YouTube channel has been
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:21.440]  so successful is because I just keep pointing out they're they're fake news and
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:25.560]  it's backfired on them they've admitted it the Washington Post which is really
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:29.640]  Washington compost which coined the term fake news and publicized it their
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:34.120]  article was fake news and they've even admitted that it is backfired and so they
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:38.320]  can't really do it in the New York Times said we wish we wouldn't have created the
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:42.160]  term fake news well we had a guest on 15 years ago who calls it fake news John
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:46.200]  remaport you know works with info wars it's no more fake news dot com I mean
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:49.120]  you're the fake news but listen think about the branding I love your clown
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:52.480]  stream all that's great I've been looking for years the term we have to do it
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:56.240]  where it brands fake news to them they're called mainstream or lame stream we
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:42:59.560]  need to call them the fake stream with a hashtag I don't know how that works
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:02.200]  you're better than that and I am Paul's better than that the listeners are better
[2:43:02.200 --> 2:43:07.000]  I can't know all this stuff how do we get fake stream next time I talk to Trump
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:11.520]  we call him he calls I'm gonna I'm gonna you know say that but separately
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:16.560]  separately look at this though cuz look I mean I know about this when he got in
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:19.640]  the White House back on the 20th I was told about it I'm just gonna leave it
[2:43:19.640 --> 2:43:24.920]  at that that you could call a number a direct one into his office I mean I
[2:43:24.920 --> 2:43:29.920]  still have it I shouldn't even said that part anyways and then he also sits
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:34.040]  there at the main switchboard with stuff flashing up sec calls every millisecond
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:37.680]  looking at numbers and then he randomly picks it up and talks to people because
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:40.600]  he really likes him and his dad were just addicted to talking to people in the
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:44.120]  streets they just they're like blue-collar and he just loves that
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:48.760]  feedback he hates fake people and the media learned about this so the New
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:51.920]  York Times and others and I've had New York Times talking to me and talking to
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:54.800]  other people and they're like I bring that they go don't tell anybody about
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:58.240]  that everybody'll know about it because they know but that's that's what we do
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:02.240]  which like you can call the White House switchboard and if the president's there
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:07.400]  he's sitting there for off and on while he does stuff at night drinking a Coke
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:12.400]  at the August it's his guilty pleasure and he'll pick up the phone and talk to
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.440]  you I mean it's just and he really wants to hear just random calls people
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:21.800]  disagree they agree and no one knows that I mean how cool is that part of
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:24.880]  the reason I started to like Trump is because instead of just watching the
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:28.160]  five-second soundbites that the mainstream media would highlight about
[2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:33.440]  his daily rallies during the campaign is I would watch the actual rally and
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:38.800]  thank God there were channels out there and people that would record live
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:43.360]  stream the entire event so instead of watching an hour hour and a half of
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:48.080]  mindless television or logging on to Netflix and wasting your time you can
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:52.640]  watch his entire speeches and they were all just off the top of his head it was
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.280]  just incredible you could see and hear he was speaking from the heart and even
[2:44:56.280 --> 2:45:01.280]  in the end of 2015 I mean when the early phases of the campaign I started
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:06.280]  noticing the massive lies being spread and my Mike got to WikiLeaks that they
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:09.160]  admittedly sent the people there to try to get women beat up so they could blame
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:11.760]  him but I mean that's what I'm getting at here and that's why this Twitter is so
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:17.000]  important Trump craves going to his Twitter feed and reading what real
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:20.560]  people send him and what they do he loves and they've they've they've taken
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:23.680]  the phone away threatening national security and it'll get hacked sir and
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:27.880]  you know there's Russian ships off the coast all the stuff and so now he's got
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:31.640]  that switchboard but that's the thing now they're they know that so they're
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:35.240]  feeding him they're doing just to nothing but negative comments hoping to
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:38.760]  demoralize him so the next time I talked to him I'll say sir did you know they
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:41.640]  want to take your Twitter away and they admittedly are feeding only people that
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:45.000]  hate you to the top they've hijacked your Twitter please talk about it I mean
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:48.760]  this just shows how I'm not that technical but I recognize it's going on
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:52.120]  the techies confirm it's happening so we have to like help the president he's so
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:55.960]  real just one guy up there surrounded by enemies that we everybody has to hit
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:59.440]  him on Twitter Facebook at rally sir they're only letting you see the negative
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:03.800]  comments we love you we have to let him know because the oxygen he has is that
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:09.160]  he loves the people and I think since his kids are in their 30s his son-in-law is
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:14.720]  his 30s as well very tech savvy Jared Kushner obviously largely credited with
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:20.640]  helping him surge through his knowledge of social media and so he is getting
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:25.040]  this information you know even if his analysts are not going to be feeding him
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:29.400]  the info he has his family which sort of grew up with the emergence of social
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:33.120]  media we're able to give him this information which obviously they're
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:39.080]  there in a sense advisors and so that's why the deep state these sort of you
[2:46:39.080 --> 2:46:44.640]  know Obama insiders are trying to bring him down from within so we in a sense
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:49.920]  have an army of evil Edward Snowden's who are deep within the NSA and other
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:54.320]  government entities that are trying to bring him down by committing crimes
[2:46:54.320 --> 2:46:59.400]  committing serious felonies by leaking a classified information and really
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:04.760]  misconstruing what that information is to the reporters and by the time it gets
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:08.560]  spread around they'll issue maybe a small retraction even three times just the
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:12.080]  last month that major mainstream media outlets have had to issue retractions
[2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:16.760]  by trying to defame me by accusing me of being an alt-right comment and that's
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:19.880]  because you you're holding the test they do it I'm so busy I can't even do it I
[2:47:19.880 --> 2:47:22.480]  agree with you I should have a whole office you know people just make them
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:26.000]  retracts it's a powerful tool to make them do that thing is they're such
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:29.360]  liars though that people know it so it doesn't really hurt me I mean that's
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:35.560]  how out of gas they are in closing Mark it hit me last night I meant to make the
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:39.360]  point today so I'm gonna make it now that this is the total dichotomy Obama
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:42.360]  admittedly went on vacation four and a half months a year more than even
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:46.160]  George W. who was horrible along on vacations Trump works until like 10
[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:50.000]  11 12 at night even when he's quote on vacation might play golf you know once
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.160]  a week when he's on vacation amazing it's just the truth I hate to gosh it's
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:48:02.240]  just my god it's true and here's a guy that so craves people who's so in love
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:07.120]  with people look he's in love with beautiful women and his kids and all of
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:12.880]  it he just is as he loves life that's the thing he's just like alive a strong
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:18.560]  force and it wants to build things this is the human spirit we all have it just
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:24.080]  strong and Trump force is strong with this one and compare that to them the
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:27.680]  elites are all the public scum they know nothing and trying to make us poor and
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:30.880]  the wiki leaks and cloward and pivot and Africans can't have air conditioning or
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:34.600]  cars or a house and but I mean that you know an Obama's telling us just all
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:40.000]  that like the creepy like shrunken starving to death emaciated new world
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:43.600]  ordered zombie system who thinks generation z or zombies no they're not
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:47.480]  and the fact that they're they're the ones fastest awakening it's a fact that
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:53.960]  now like half our traffic's below the age of 18 the elite would kill for that I
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:57.880]  want adults to do something and change it but you know what if they want to not
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:02.000]  listen it's fine we've got the youth and so that's why this is so powerful but
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:08.680]  here's Trump on fire for hours answering phones talking to people calling the
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:12.800]  White House I mean you know I'm strong and I've got a lot of will and I want to
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:16.240]  talk to the public but I couldn't do that so what does that say about his
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:20.160]  psychology and this is big news I'm breaking here folks they don't even
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:23.440]  want this information out because I'm telling you you know now everybody knows
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:26.360]  this it's gonna be even harder to get into the president I mean I've sat there
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:29.360]  ring-ring-ring and it's like collect it's like oh I mean it's crazy you're not
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:33.040]  just getting calls from him they took a cell phone away this is this is epic
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:38.040]  stuff and I've never heard of anything like this I mean it's it's like he knows
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:41.880]  it's BS and he needs that connection of the people and the vampires are all
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:46.840]  around him he needs to get to real people this is biblical mark dice it
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:50.880]  notice I believe that he's in he's an agent of the Lord that is shaking the
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:55.960]  corrupt system we were right on the edge of no return the point of no return and
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:50:00.240]  that's why these liberal establishment elitists over at CNN the clown news
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:04.920]  network the counterfeit news network and NBC nothing but crap the judge you know
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:09.000]  Chuck Todd and all these mainstream leftists they don't even understand it

[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:16.480]  and he said in the national inauguration because he said it's you

[3:02:39.720 --> 3:02:43.000]  in the other studio or maybe do it in here so it's different as I'm doing
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:46.720]  live so I'm not think I'm gonna do about it I'm gonna do a two-hour transmission
[3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:51.240]  and I'm going to cover every one of these 500 articles because they brought in a
[3:02:51.240 --> 3:02:54.720]  couple hundred more I'm gonna cover all 500 articles at least mention their
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:58.720]  headlines just to give you a view of what's happening and I'm gonna do that

[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:13.760]  David night my friend Wow what an animating contest of Liberty we found
[3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:18.400]  ourselves absolutely Alex we've got some good news today too we've had
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:23.680]  Pruitt confirmed as the EPA head this happened just a few minutes ago that
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:27.720]  will be a long remember tell us folks how good this guy is well tell you why
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:31.560]  it's good we have seen a situation this is something that Mitch McConnell said
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:34.320]  and I don't usually agree with Mitch McConnell but he's absolutely right when
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:37.200]  he said that we're gonna get back to a situation where the EPA is gonna take a
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:40.320]  look at clean water and clean air instead of targeting an industry and
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:44.200]  trying to shut it down that's precisely what Pruitt had said in his
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:48.000]  confirmation hearings he has filed a I think let's say the number here he's
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:52.720]  filed more than a dozen lawsuits to block overreach from the EPA so we're gonna
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:56.560]  talk about the different ways in which they have tried to overreach and how
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:00.960]  they've expanded their mission and it's a very good thing to see somebody to put
[3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:04.560]  in there who's an attorney general at the state level and who fought for them
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:09.400]  to stay within their responsibility within their bounds and quite frankly I
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:14.800]  think the EPA is so far out of bounds was admittedly designed to make us
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:17.960]  uncompetitive so the globalist can sell off industry and then rule over I mean
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:21.520]  that that's all a declassified admitted they want you know the course that the
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:25.440]  former at Texas and Attorney General who they've been indicted in things he was a
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:29.320]  good patriot to fighting but you know this is one they didn't get to so it's
[3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:32.880]  exciting you know this new Acosta guy you know he was kind of liberal and stuff
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:36.640]  but that was what he grew up in Trump hasn't even increased deportations
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:39.480]  because they're trying to go after criminals right now and the media is
[3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:43.400]  all creating panics and hoaxes about that I think I caught the fake news I
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:47.520]  but I know you're coming up my friend so David Knight straight ahead and other
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:51.720]  than nightly tonight 7 o'clock central info wars.com forward slash show they're
[3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:55.120]  trying to censor us folks but you're human intelligence you can take action
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:04:57.760]  you can get those links out
[3:04:57.760 --> 3:05:03.600]  President Donald Trump stepped up his attack on the fake news network CNN
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:08.320]  during a press conference yesterday telling reporter Jim Acosta that he had
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:13.520]  downgraded their title from fake news to very fake news just because of the
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:17.320]  attack of fake news and attacking our network I just want to ask you sir I'm
[3:05:17.320 --> 3:05:21.360]  changing it from fake news though doesn't that under very fake I know but
[3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:28.160]  aren't you. Acosta then went on to ask President Trump aren't you concerned sir
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:32.520]  that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:36.640]  the press the press in the country when you're calling stories you don't like
[3:05:36.640 --> 3:05:42.840]  fake news no Acosta the only ones that are undermining the American people's
[3:05:42.840 --> 3:05:49.000]  faith in the press are fake news outlets like you guys at CNN that constantly
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:53.040]  push this narrative that somehow President Donald Trump is working for
[3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:59.160]  the Russians this is Millie Weaver signing off for info wars.com today we
[3:05:59.160 --> 3:06:03.680]  call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:07.440]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk we are now

[3:06:22.320 --> 3:06:26.080]  having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:29.680]  need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew that you
[3:06:29.680 --> 3:06:33.360]  used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:38.240]  cooking but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[3:06:38.240 --> 3:06:41.600]  of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:46.320]  body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a long way from the caveman
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:50.240]  my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:53.320]  made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know you're gonna want to

[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:18.480]  clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much new information
[3:07:18.480 --> 3:07:22.840]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:27.920]  purest iodine we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue
[3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:32.440]  crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also screen our
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:37.040]  iodine for radiation before bottling it is the purest cleanest strongest out
[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:40.560]  there quite frankly I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:44.680]  nace and iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:47.800]  our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:54.040]  anything even close to what we have it is exclusive to info wars life.com and

[3:08:13.200 --> 3:08:19.280]  lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:25.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host for this hour
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:29.920]  I'm going to take a look at some amazing technology news it's coming up and of
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:33.360]  course it's not good news either folks this is what we're talking about is
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:38.240]  talking cars and that's not Pixar's cars it's not cute little cars no they're
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:43.160]  talking about you they'll be talking to the government about you think of it as
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:47.160]  having a speed camera setting on your shoulder all the time in addition to a
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:49.760]  lot of other little nice goodies that are going to be there but of course we
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:54.360]  also see there's another kind of surveillance is coming very soon to us
[3:08:54.360 --> 3:08:59.800]  and that's body cams on the police the body cameras that they have that will
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:03.120]  have facial recognition into it that'll have a fully searchable database you
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:08.000]  better hope that they're accurate you better hope they don't misidentify you
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:12.640]  as to either what you're doing or what you were carrying misidentify something
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:17.400]  and say that's a gun or misidentify you as a criminal that they're looking for
[3:09:17.400 --> 3:09:21.080]  or a terrorist if they do it's going to kill you we better make sure this stuff
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:25.720]  is right and I think we need to have some restrictions on the surveillance
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:30.920]  technology of our government and we need to enforce the fourth amendment we
[3:09:30.920 --> 3:09:38.360]  need to say that no this isn't simply about the issues that are paper pen and
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:43.680]  paper you know the the quill on your parchment that's not what the fourth
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:47.880]  amendment did was set up to protect us from no it's set up to protect us from
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:53.080]  the principle of a government that is searching us without a warrant and
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:58.760]  everything that we have in the technology area that is rapidly increasing the
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:05.160]  biggest part of intelligence the fastest growing part is geospatial
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:09.240]  intelligence we've talked about this before human domain analytics activity
[3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:14.760]  based intelligence all of this falls into that and of course that's all about
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:19.000]  mastering the human domain that's really what jade helm was really about folks if
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:22.400]  you want to know what it was truly about it was right there in front of your
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:24.680]  face the entire time so we're gonna talk about some of this technology we're
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:28.640]  gonna talk about the world government summit that's going on in Dubai some of
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:32.800]  the consequences that are going on there of course proudly talking about how
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:35.800]  we're going to steal your jobs with robots and you know don't worry about it
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:40.360]  it's gonna just be a 15% unemployment increase that's gonna be much worse than
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:44.400]  that even if it were only 15% and you were to add that to today's an
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:49.280]  employment rate we would be at the peak rate of the great depression and that is
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:52.600]  far less than what we're talking about folks we're talking about something that
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:57.560]  is going to create at least twice the amount of unemployment that we've seen
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:02.520]  with a great depression and this is across all levels vertical and
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:06.840]  horizontal against from from people who are the lowest level to people who are
[3:11:06.840 --> 3:11:11.240]  at the top level middle management upper level management are vulnerable to
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:15.920]  this as well as all kinds of jobs white-collar blue-collar every industry
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:19.720]  that you're talking about that's what they're looking at with artificial
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:22.880]  intelligence I want to break that down but first let's talk about what just
[3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:27.800]  happened and I mentioned it with Alex in the last segment we just had about an
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:33.800]  hour or so ago we had the Senate confirming Pruitt to become the new
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:40.280]  secretary of the EPA and this was a vote pretty much along partisan lines
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:44.720]  interestingly the Democrats all the Democrats voted against him except for
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:50.960]  two Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and now what's interesting is where they're
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:56.040]  from of course Manchin is from West Virginia she is from North Dakota why
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:00.000]  would that be an issue well because the people in North Dakota have seen what's
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:03.600]  happening with the pipeline protesters out there and I think they've had enough
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:08.720]  of that but even more importantly West Virginia was at the center of Obama's
[3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:14.120]  move to try to shut down the coal industry you see that's not the job of
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:19.040]  the EPA Richard Nixon created the EPA he said to make sure that we were going to
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:23.240]  have clean air clean water and of course it didn't take it very long before it
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:28.360]  got way outside of that mission and it started it's has now become the tool of
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:32.600]  the globalist to take down entire industries and of course the industries
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:35.640]  that they focused on first and foremost is coal then they're going to come after
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:39.920]  oil they're going to come after anything that works as far as energy is
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:44.280]  concerned but it's even worse than that in terms of them expanding their
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:50.480]  control over our water supply with the so-called Clean Water Act the Clean Water
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:55.040]  Rule it's not an act it's not a law it's a rule and this is the way they move
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:58.800]  this we'll talk about this when we get to the vehicle to vehicle proposals that
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:02.720]  are coming from the Department of Transportation they propose rules and if
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:06.800]  you don't say anything about those proposed rules then they go into effect
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:10.520]  that's the way they pass laws with bureaucracy and then oh by the way with
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:14.360]  those rules you will have no presumption of innocence you will have no ability to
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:17.200]  really challenge them in court you will have to sue them in court just like
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:21.840]  civil asset forfeiture you'll have to sue them in court to try to get your
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:26.880]  assets back and there's no prohibitions against excessive fines we saw with the
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:33.560]  Clean Water Rule that they came after a welder who had eight acres in Montana he
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:37.800]  had a stockpond that he had created on his own property didn't even get off of
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:41.800]  his property line so this was not something that the federal government
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:46.520]  should have any jurisdiction under he had gone to state and local officials
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:51.920]  and gotten approval for this project and yet the EPA came in after the local
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:54.840]  government had approved this and this is something again water that did not
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:14:00.360]  cross his property line they came in and said no we don't like what you're doing
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:03.560]  and they started finding him I think it was 37 and a half thousand dollars a day
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:10.280]  eventually went in and tried to exercise the authority to take his sees his bank
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:13.320]  account because of course the guy didn't have the money to pay so he ran up
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:18.240]  millions of dollars worth of fines from these people and you know you're you're
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:22.400]  guilty until you prove that you're innocent till you sue them in court so
[3:14:22.400 --> 3:14:26.960]  this is the kind of abuse that we have seen from the EPA now Pruitt as Attorney
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:33.480]  General for Oklahoma filed more than a dozen lawsuits to block regulations from
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:39.000]  Obama's activist EPA Mitch McConnell said the nominee before us thinks it's
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:43.160]  time for the EPA to get back to clean air clean water business instead of this
[3:14:43.160 --> 3:14:47.440]  what they're doing now he put it more succinctly this is what Pruitt told the
[3:14:47.440 --> 3:14:50.680]  senators when he was before them he said regulators are supposed to make things
[3:14:50.680 --> 3:14:57.240]  regular to fairly and equitably enforce the rules and not pick winners and
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:01.720]  losers that's what they're doing they're saying we're going to reward with
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:06.960]  subsidies the solar power or the wind power industries and we are going to
[3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:10.640]  shut down and bankrupt anybody that is involved in coal that's one of the
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:14.880]  reasons why Tom Manchin split with the Democrats and voted for him because it
[3:15:14.880 --> 3:15:18.600]  would have been suicide for him to do otherwise and understand that the coal
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:22.920]  industry is just the first one on the list they're going to use the same
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:28.200]  tactics against everybody else now meanwhile they call him a tool of the
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:32.360]  fossil fuel industry that's what the Democrats call him now the Democrats have
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:37.800]  been a tool of the global climate change takeover industry it's not even an
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:41.920]  industry it's it's a crony capitalism where they want to have you pay for the
[3:15:41.920 --> 3:15:47.320]  sin of using energies to pay some globalist billionaire for the sin of
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:52.440]  turning on your air conditioning or running a car and of course that's
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:57.400]  those of the people who are tools of the globalists that is one of the right
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:01.400]  one of the key ways that they're going to establish a global governance of
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:05.000]  course they want to take down the borders they want to move populations
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:10.320]  around so that they erase any consolidated resistance to them any
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:12.920]  communities that can consolidate and resist them because they're gonna have
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:16.480]  everybody fighting amongst each other so that's a key part of it of course
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:22.800]  having all of our economy managed by an unaccountable unelectable committee
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:27.520]  that would have been part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Donald
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:31.800]  Trump took down on day one thank you for doing that that I never thought we
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:36.120]  would stop that and that is the only way that that would have been stopped is
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:39.840]  with the election of Donald Trump nobody else would have done that nobody else
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:43.040]  that was running for the Republicans and certainly now the Democrats nobody
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:45.720]  else would have done that so he shut that down on the first day and that's
[3:16:45.720 --> 3:16:49.000]  very important because you have to understand that was not about free trade
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:53.520]  when you set up multilateral trade agreements that is really just
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:58.360]  empowering the organization bilateral trade agreements are good an agreement
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:01.360]  between two countries on what they're going to do with each other that's good
[3:17:01.360 --> 3:17:06.320]  that's fine that's real free trade but when you set up a multilateral agreement
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:10.680]  all you're doing is creating some supranational entity that's going to
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:14.760]  take away your ability to control your destiny your economy your sovereignty
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:18.100]  they're going to tell you which industries are going to succeed which
[3:17:18.100 --> 3:17:22.120]  ones are going to fail they're going to put throttles on you as well but the
[3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:28.400]  climate change industry is where they create a global crisis they manufacture
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:32.840]  this global crisis that doesn't exist folks it doesn't exist we're out there
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.120]  regulating unicorn farts and they're going to tax everybody globally they're
[3:17:36.120 --> 3:17:39.480]  gonna say this is a global problem they have to have a global problem to
[3:17:39.480 --> 3:17:44.720]  justify a global government and they have to have a response to that the
[3:17:44.720 --> 3:17:47.840]  it's going to be a global tax so they can fund that global government they have
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:50.640]  to have something that is global to fund it but of course most of that is
[3:17:50.640 --> 3:17:54.440]  going to go to crony capitalist and we'll be talking about Elon Musk and
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:58.880]  these other people in just a moment at the world government summit as that's
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:02.680]  what they're doing there but again he said regulators are not supposed to pick
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:06.000]  winners and losers he went on to say this he said a regulator should not be
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  for or against any sector of our economy you see that's what the EPA was doing
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:14.760]  they were picking the winners and losers they were deciding that they were
[3:18:14.760 --> 3:18:17.760]  going to reward these kind of energy producers and take the other people out
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:21.880]  they weren't even interested if you're going to create a clean coal plant not
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:26.000]  interested coal industry's got to go I don't really care what the emissions are
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:31.520]  the coal industry is going that was the Obama EPA approach and he's got a lot of
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:35.240]  house cleaning to do because these people who are there just like we see in
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:39.440]  the National Security Agency and the CIA and other places these are still
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:43.720]  Obama's people who are in place and they're still going to be working towards
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:48.760]  us because they agree with Obama on this I think Trump got maybe 4% of the vote
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:53.720]  in Washington DC I mean these people are solidly for this agenda and unless he
[3:18:53.720 --> 3:19:00.240]  cleans house I mean the other you ought to see unless you see a massive vacuum
[3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:04.520]  of all of the moving vans in the country moving to Washington you know that
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:11.360]  that the trade the swamp is not being drained we needed to clean house from
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:15.080]  top to bottom because the people at the bottom are going to sabotage this for
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:18.200]  the people at the top if we just change the leadership but he goes on to say a
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:22.240]  regulator should not be for against any sector of our economy instead a regulator
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:26.960]  ought to follow law that's an interesting idea following law see that's why he
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:30.080]  sued them more than a dozen times they weren't following any law they were
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:33.720]  making the law and they weren't elected they should follow the law said Pruitt
[3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:38.040]  and setting up the rules so that those who are regulated can plan can allocate
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:42.040]  resources to meet standards versus operating in a state of uncertainty and
[3:19:42.040 --> 3:19:46.040]  arrests well that'd be a great start hopefully someday we'll get rid of the
[3:19:46.040 --> 3:19:50.520]  EPA but until we do it'd be great if they were bound by the law stay with us
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:53.000]  we'll be right back
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:02.840]  now's the time to refresh your home and save at lumber liquidators spring

[3:23:58.200 --> 3:24:14.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I want to talk about
[3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:18.280]  David Petraeus back on the news as a possible choice
[3:24:18.280 --> 3:24:21.880]  for national security advisor you know what I haven't seen Donald Trump
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:24.520]  mention his name the people who are pushing this out there
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:28.360]  are u.s. news and world report and cnn and others
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:31.880]  I think this is of course they would love to see David Petraeus they love David
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:34.680]  Petraeus in there he was a Hillary Clinton supporter he was somebody who
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:38.360]  comes in with all of the baggage how could you possibly replace
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:41.800]  Mike Flynn and say oh he's a security risk because we think he talked to
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:44.760]  russians well it's his job to talk to russians but this
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:50.200]  is a guy who was uh had resigned and got a hundred
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:52.600]  thousand dollar fine of course not really any penalty they put him on
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:56.360]  probation that wasn't supervised but his probation is not even up I mean
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:24:59.320]  he'd have to get a pardon in order to even do the job
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:02.360]  and he's a Hillary Clinton supporter I mean he's a poster child for national
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:06.120]  security violations we're going to really seriously consider him as national
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:10.040]  security advisor I would say don't take the advice from
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:15.000]  cnn mr trump they are trying to push in their guy
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:19.800]  a Hillary Clinton supporter I just can't believe how his name just keeps
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:24.440]  coming up again and again you know it went this is first put out there
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:28.920]  it was interviews from the press uh that that they interviewed David
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:33.080]  Petraeus and they said uh for secretary state wouldn't you be open to being
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:36.360]  secretary of state and he said well you know I've always
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:39.000]  learned that when the president says something to you ask you to do something
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:43.400]  you can only say yes mr president and then it was an echo chamber throughout
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:47.480]  the media they're all talking about David Petraeus and within a few days
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:51.400]  Donald Trump invited him to Trump Tower I think it was
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:57.400]  I hope I gotta believe that that uh Donald Trump is not stupid enough to ever
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:00.520]  seriously consider him I think it was a courtesy interview
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:04.040]  because there had been so much talk about it and maybe he really wanted to
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:07.720]  see what the opposition is like if you want somebody who's gonna undermine
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:11.320]  your policies a full-on confirmed globalist somebody who
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:14.920]  really should be prosecuted under the Logan Act
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:19.080]  that's David Petraeus he's a Henry Kissinger acolyte okay
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:23.080]  he's working with KKR he's at Bilderberg all the time I mean those are the people
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:26.760]  you want to talk about the Logan Act Donald Trump ought to come out and say
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:29.640]  you want to talk about that I'm gonna give you the Logan Act we're gonna
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:34.600]  enforce it never been enforced against anybody since 1799 so 218 years it
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:37.160]  hasn't been enforced but we're gonna enforce it for you we're gonna do
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:40.280]  good and hard and we're gonna serve notice to all these people going to
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:42.200]  Bilderberg that you're not going to meet
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:46.680]  secretly with these other people carrying in suitcases full of documents
[3:26:46.680 --> 3:26:49.320]  without our our scrutiny and we're gonna look
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.720]  at that and we're gonna prosecute you about that
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:55.800]  so I hope he doesn't go there I want to talk also
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:59.400]  about what has just happened with Tom Price our
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:02.440]  new health and human services director of course he's going to be the guy
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:06.360]  in charge of what happens with Obamacare hopefully shutting that down but
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:10.440]  before I get to that I just want to point out our new product
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:15.400]  caveman you know Alex Jones provided lunch for the staff and crew
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:19.160]  yesterday that had a great lunch that he put out there and then afterwards
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:24.360]  we had Weldon come by and say hey what you guys to try this
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:28.040]  and is this little sip of something look like a chocolate milk and try it and
[3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:31.240]  taste it just like chocolate milk and I thought what is this
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:35.960]  and it was caveman and then because I had seen what was in it you know it's got
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:40.680]  all this stuff like bone broth and turmeric root and chaga mushroom and
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:44.360]  all these different things that are I know really healthy and but it tastes
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:47.560]  like chocolate milk and I thought wow this is great
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:52.520]  and I got a container from him you know just for evaluation purposes of course
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:56.200]  no it's going to be something that we're going to use on a regular basis
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:27:59.720]  and my family because I mean where else can you drink
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:03.480]  chocolate milk or something that tastes like chocolate milk and you know
[3:28:03.480 --> 3:28:07.720]  that it's all this good stuff my wife constantly makes bone broth around the
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:12.680]  uh the holidays bone soup she takes the turkey carcass and she makes a great
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:15.720]  taste and it's got a great recipe for great tasting soup of vegetables and
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:19.240]  all this other kind of stuff and and we do that because uh not just because
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:22.040]  we're stretching out the the great turkey that we had but because we know
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:25.640]  that it's really healthy and so when I saw this caveman thing he says you know
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:28.280]  bone broth and everything and turmeric root I mean
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:31.400]  when you look at turmeric root you look at selenium those are a couple of
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:34.600]  things that there's been a lot of studies that show correlations between
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:38.840]  reduced cancer risk and consumption of thing of turmeric
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:42.600]  and selenium those are key things that you should have to pay for so
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:45.960]  when I look at this and see it's got turmeric root and it's got bone broth
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:49.640]  and all this it's like wow but that's great stuff but when I tasted it
[3:28:49.640 --> 3:28:54.280]  uh that's that's why I said that this is definitely going to be a staple
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:28:57.320]  around our household because there's not too many things that you can get that
[3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:00.440]  taste that good that are that good for you so again caveman
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:04.520]  the ultimate new paleo formulation info wars life it's high quality bone broth
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:07.880]  that helps to support healthy muscles and connective tissue with active

[3:29:47.960 --> 3:29:51.800]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[3:29:51.800 --> 3:29:56.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:56.520 --> 3:30:03.720]  an african-american trump supporter passionately slammed a town hall meeting
[3:30:03.720 --> 3:30:08.120]  regarding sanctuary cities she preached i'm not going anywhere
[3:30:08.120 --> 3:30:14.840]  sanctuary cities are racist all the jobs are going to illegals that is wrong
[3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:17.640]  you're not going to be allowed to get away with it
[3:30:17.640 --> 3:30:21.720]  the black community has been destroyed by racist
[3:30:21.720 --> 3:30:27.960]  illegal immigration and we're not gonna have it she roared thank god for trump
[3:30:27.960 --> 3:30:32.440]  thank god for sessions and you should be ashamed of yourselves
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:37.800]  how dare you this just goes to show that the african-americans know that
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:42.600]  trumps immigration policies are going to benefit the inner cities
[3:30:42.600 --> 3:30:46.840]  maybe if the left would stop virtue signaling for a moment
[3:30:46.840 --> 3:30:50.760]  they'd realize that their misguided efforts to interfere with trumps
[3:30:50.760 --> 3:30:55.960]  policies are counterproductive this is millie weaver signing off for info wars

[3:32:50.200 --> 3:32:53.080]  made us what we were and this is a big part of it i know you're going to want
[3:32:53.080 --> 3:32:56.040]  to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and
[3:32:56.040 --> 3:33:09.880]  info wars life dot com today
[3:33:09.880 --> 3:33:16.680]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[3:33:16.680 --> 3:33:22.760]  longing for the sun you will come to the island welcome back to the alex
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:26.920]  jones show on david night did you realize that obama
[3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:31.880]  took over about a fifth of the economy as president that's what obama care did
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:35.480]  quite frankly we have about 19 percent of our economy
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:38.520]  is in the health care industry and what he did was he tried to take over the
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:41.800]  health care industry now he didn't do it as socialism obama care is not really
[3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:47.800]  socialism obama care is fascism it is still private companies
[3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:50.840]  that are running this these private companies are going out of business as
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:54.200]  well as the consumers because they've got mandates that don't
[3:33:54.200 --> 3:33:58.520]  serve the consumers the patients that doesn't serve the insurance companies
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:01.480]  well either so nobody is doing well with these
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:05.640]  mandates but of course it's still technically private
[3:34:05.640 --> 3:34:08.920]  although the government is controlling everything with these mandates that's
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:12.920]  why i say it's fascism fascism isn't just extreme nationalism
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:16.120]  and nazis marching in the street no economic fascism is where you still
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:19.880]  have a veneer of individual ownership where you still
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:22.360]  have private companies and and of course you know
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:25.880]  adopt Hitler called himself a socialist but he was a national socialist he said
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:29.960]  the communist got it wrong because the communist went straight ahead
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:33.960]  to the final solution if you will economically
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:37.000]  they went straight ahead to the government confiscating everything and
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.880]  trying to run everything and he says no you really can't do that
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:43.560]  you have to go to the intermediate step where you allow these captains of
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:46.680]  industry to be co-opted by the government we kind of keep
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:50.520]  control them but they know how to make the planes and how to build the machines
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:54.520]  and work the levers of the economy but we will control them and they will come
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:34:56.920]  to us for the privilege to do that and that's what
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:01.400]  obama is doing so that's the the true fascism that's when you look at
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:04.520]  socialism of course hitler said now we're going to eventually get to where
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:08.120]  the where the russians have gone when they had the communist
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:11.480]  he said we're going to eventually get to full-on communism but we're going to
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:15.800]  have this fascist economic system as a step
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:20.120]  as a way that we can use that to conquer the other countries
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:25.800]  so when we look at what obama gave us with this fascist takeover of one fifth
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:29.080]  of the economy it's now starting to unravel very quickly we saw
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:32.600]  humana the largest insurer to announce that they are getting
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:37.080]  out of obama care effective next year they're exiting
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:40.440]  that market they say they cannot do this they said
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:44.520]  of course the etna ceo said i think you'll see a lot more withdrawals from
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:48.040]  other insurance companies they were working with etna to try to get through
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:51.480]  a merger you see when they're struggling like that they think well
[3:35:51.480 --> 3:35:54.200]  maybe if we make a bigger company and we keep getting bigger and bigger and
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:35:57.720]  bigger we'll get too big to fail just like the banks did right and the
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:01.560]  government will have to bail us out and of course that's part of the plan folks
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:05.400]  it was designed to essentially fail so the government would have to come in
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:08.920]  and step in and say we're going to take over
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:12.600]  take it over completely see just like hitler
[3:36:12.600 --> 3:36:15.720]  wanted to do said eventually we'll let you guys run it for a little while but
[3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:17.640]  then eventually we're going to come in and just say
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:21.320]  no we own that now that's the single payer plan that they always talk about
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:25.640]  that's what hillary clinton always wanted to do that's what she tried to do
[3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:29.400]  in the early 90s when she tried to take it over she kept telling everybody look
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:32.200]  we just have too many doctors we've got to have fewer doctors so the cost
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:34.440]  come down it's like what are you talking about
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:39.160]  under what system when you have fewer we have less competition do prices
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:42.840]  actually go down of course they don't and so we had
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:48.600]  etna and humana tried to do a merger and we had a federal judge say no we want
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:51.960]  competition between these two i we don't want to see this
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:58.440]  coalesce together so we shut that down because competition does lower prices
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:02.280]  and that brings us up to the question as to why then aren't insurance companies
[3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:05.720]  allowed to compete across state lines that was a key thing
[3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:11.000]  that was in trump's health care plan and that if you remember the debates we had
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:15.720]  that one debate that marco rubio decided that he would be the little snarky guy
[3:37:15.720 --> 3:37:19.160]  and he would take down donald trump and he took himself down
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:23.800]  and he kept mocking trump because he said lines lines we talking about lines
[3:37:23.800 --> 3:37:26.760]  he was talking about allowing competition across state lines
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.680]  you got people like marco rubio and other globalists other republican and
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:34.760]  democrat who were saying hey we've got to have no boundaries no restrictions on
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:37.320]  international trade but hey within our country
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:40.360]  we're not going to allow competition between insurance companies across state
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:43.480]  lines it's like you got that exactly the opposite
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:47.960]  see when this country prospered we had no internal taxes
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:51.000]  as thomas jefferson said the beginning of his second administration he said what
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:54.600]  farmer what labor what mechanic knows a tax man nobody does
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:38:00.040]  we have eliminated all internal taxation a constitutionally sized government
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:03.800]  which we are so incredibly far away from but a constitutionally sized
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:11.000]  government could be run just on import fees just on taxes at the border and
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:14.040]  it's interesting that if you look at the beginning of the 20th century
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:17.960]  when they went to free trade what did they do they took the trade off they took
[3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:21.560]  the taxes off at the border and they put taxes on us
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:26.360]  internally that's when we got the federal reserve we got the income tax
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:31.080]  that they went just the opposite way of thomas jefferson and we've been running
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:34.520]  as fast as we can in the opposite direction of thomas jefferson
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:37.640]  ever since interestingly enough today i saw that
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:43.240]  at his alma mater uh william and mary where thomas jefferson went to school
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:47.320]  they actually had people defacing his statue black lives matter people
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:51.880]  defacing his statue profound ignorance people who are slaves and they
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:55.080]  don't know it they put on thomas jefferson's statue he
[3:38:55.080 --> 3:38:59.160]  owned slaves well you know what the most pathetic people are the ones who are
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:02.840]  slaves and they don't even know it if you read
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:06.760]  thomas jefferson's writings you would stand up for yourself
[3:39:06.760 --> 3:39:10.280]  and you would take back your freedom but i know they'd rather just deface his
[3:39:10.280 --> 3:39:14.040]  statue rather than to understand what he was saying
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:17.960]  and there's a picture of they put blood on his hands as they say they put some
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:20.920]  red paint on his hands but getting back to health care because what we've got
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:23.640]  in congress is we got three or four competing plans
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:28.680]  amongst the gop and we got paul ryan who really doesn't want to repeal it you
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:33.320]  gotta understand that paul ryan four years ago well five years ago now
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:36.920]  paul ryan was the running mate of mitt romney and we had two
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:40.920]  handpicked establishment candidates romney and obama
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:44.200]  and whoever won it was going to be their job
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:50.040]  to deliver government uh health care to the globalist obama care or romney
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:53.560]  care take your pick romney had already done obama
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:57.080]  care in massachusetts his governor that's why he was put in that position you
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:00.120]  know that's why he was put in position and it didn't really matter
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:03.560]  uh who won we were going to get obama care could have been called romney care
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:07.560]  and of course paul ryan is part of that establishment he does not want to repeal
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:11.560]  these mandates he's dragging his feet on it there's three or four plans that are
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:16.840]  there and of course first uh voters got rid of
[3:40:16.840 --> 3:40:22.040]  democrat congressman and senators so that we would have republican majority
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:25.480]  but they still wouldn't do it and they're not going to do it unless donald
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:28.040]  trump takes control and says here's the plan and
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:31.000]  yesterday he announced in that long press conference
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:34.040]  that he is going to come up with a plan and present a plan
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:37.240]  at the beginning of march he said the beginning to the middle of march that's
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:41.560]  exactly what must happen you are not going to have a plan
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:47.800]  arise from the gop in congress the senators and the leadership do not
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:50.840]  want to do that and the first thing that has to happen
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:54.440]  is you have to repeal it if you do not repeal it you will not have
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:58.920]  any pressure on the democrats to change anything
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:02.680]  it's got to start with repeal now ram paul has said
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:05.960]  we've got to quickly replace it with something that works for the rest of
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:08.760]  the industry for the insurance companies for the doctors
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:12.760]  we can't have this uncertainty and he's right it has to be replaced
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:17.320]  quickly with something that is going to be an orderly marketplace not mandates
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:21.000]  and of course that was what donald trump campaigned on if you go back and you
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:25.320]  look at his health care plan and of course that's been taken
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:29.240]  down now because they no longer have the the campaign
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:33.160]  website up but his health care reform plan had seven
[3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:36.920]  different items on it and it was the first one
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:41.880]  was completely repeal obama care trump said we must eliminate the individual
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:45.400]  mandate no person should be required to buy insurance unless
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:50.040]  he or she wants to secondly modify existing law that inhibits the sale of
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:53.000]  health insurance across state lines is what we're just talking about right
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:56.280]  if it's anti-competitive and we we can't have
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:00.520]  humana and etna merge because of competition issues and i agree they
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:03.640]  shouldn't merge we don't want to have too big to fail insurance companies
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:08.280]  remember that it was bill clinton who allowed the first
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:11.960]  giant bank merger between nations bank and bank of america that eventually
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:14.840]  became bank of america re-headquartered into charlotte
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:19.160]  which was where his chief of staff erskine bowls came from at the time and
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:22.520]  they okayed that and everybody said this is going to be really bad
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:25.720]  it's going to put all the small to mid-sized banks out of business and it
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:28.600]  did they said it's going to set off a merger frenzy
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:32.520]  and it did and they said we're going to wind up with a half dozen banks
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:36.280]  and we did and then to make sure that everything was really going to go south
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:39.720]  we had the clinton administration get rid of the glass stiggle act which
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:42.840]  prohibited banks from getting involved in speculative
[3:42:42.840 --> 3:42:47.000]  investments as long as they had fdic insurance from the government
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:51.160]  so they did all that stuff so he repeals glass stiggle
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:55.080]  and he authorizes and sets off this merger mania of the banks and we wind up
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:42:57.640]  with too big to fail banks so we have to bail out
[3:42:57.640 --> 3:43:02.200]  and they get into trouble because of their speculative investments now if we
[3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:06.120]  do the same thing with insurance companies i'm glad this first failed
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:09.480]  with this federal judge i hope they don't appeal this it looks like now
[3:43:09.480 --> 3:43:11.400]  they're going to back down there was another one
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:14.920]  that was in the works there was a etna humana merger that was going to be
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:19.080]  37 billion dollars the sigma anthem merger that was
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:22.760]  going to be 48 billion dollars and now that looks like that's on shaky terms
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:25.320]  as well let's hope that that doesn't happen because the worst thing that
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:28.840]  could happen would be to have too big to fail
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:33.560]  insurance companies just a couple of them no competition across state lines
[3:43:33.560 --> 3:43:36.440]  mandates for everybody to buy their products
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:40.920]  and through obama care i mean that would be the worst possible situation
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:44.840]  and what we've seen from trump as he first came in he said all right
[3:43:44.840 --> 3:43:48.440]  he sent out an executive order that uh we're going to try to do what we can
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:51.240]  to minimize this individual mandate well the first thing that we saw and it was
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:54.680]  reported earlier this week from reza magazine they said to comply with that
[3:43:54.680 --> 3:43:58.200]  the irs said we are not going to refuse tax returns
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:02.360]  where people do not state uh if they are
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:09.000]  in an obama care exchange or whatever well that's not really a big change from
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:12.040]  the irs because they can still investigate you
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:15.880]  and it was not increasing the regulation
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:18.760]  and the inspection this year which is what they had planned to do in other
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:22.440]  words in past years they would still accept a tax return although they
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:25.800]  might still audit you for that or charge you back for that if you
[3:44:25.800 --> 3:44:30.040]  don't say that uh you're part of the obama care
[3:44:30.040 --> 3:44:33.480]  program but this year they said we're not even going to take your tax return
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:36.680]  now they're saying well never mind we will still take your tax return so
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:40.200]  basically they're going back to the status quo that's why we need to see
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:43.080]  something happen quickly donald trump is on it
[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:46.040]  and again when you look at what he's talking about he's talking about creating
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:50.600]  a marketplace and i hope that he's going to go down if he went down these seven
[3:44:50.600 --> 3:44:55.240]  uh items that he had on his health care reform package that he campaigned on
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:59.080]  we would be in good shape because what he wants to do is allow us to fully
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:04.040]  deduct our health insurance why if it is so important and it is
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:08.920]  why can't individuals induct deduct this just like businesses do
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:13.000]  if health care is important then allow us to deduct our health care charges and
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:16.040]  that's not just insurance we need to think outside the box we need to start
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:19.960]  thinking about health care costs and of course
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:23.400]  the obama people told us that they were doing that to try to get
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:26.280]  cost down they said we're going to bend the cost curve yeah they bent it they
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:29.400]  bent it straight up like a hockey stick
[3:45:29.400 --> 3:45:34.440]  uh but we need to find ways to get that health care cost down
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:38.120]  the real issue is not everybody having health insurance the real issue is being
[3:45:38.120 --> 3:45:41.560]  able to afford health care and if you simply subsidize
[3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:45.160]  insurance you're going to get more expensive insurance
[3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:48.360]  everything the government subsidizes gets more expensive whether it's
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:52.200]  college tuition or whether it is health insurance
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:56.840]  so we don't need more government subsidies sorry democrats
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:00.680]  that's not what we need what we need is competition
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:03.640]  that is the only thing that is going to drive it down
[3:46:03.640 --> 3:46:08.040]  and to allow us to if it is so important that you're going to nationalize the
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:10.520]  economy effectively then allow us to spend our money
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:13.320]  before we send it to washington and so what donald trump said we're going to
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:17.080]  allow deductibles for individuals to deduct your health
[3:46:17.080 --> 3:46:21.160]  care insurance premiums go further than that allow us to deduct our
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:24.760]  health care expenses right now they take out 10 percent of whatever your
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:27.000]  adjusted gross income is before you can deduct a
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:30.840]  single uh send off of your tax return so do that then he also says
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:34.680]  allow people to save into a health savings account
[3:46:34.680 --> 3:46:38.920]  why don't we allow people to start saving money instead of turning us
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:42.680]  into renters who are constantly in debt to the banks and other
[3:46:42.680 --> 3:46:45.960]  people like the insurance companies allow us to
[3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:49.160]  put money into health savings accounts that we can
[3:46:49.160 --> 3:46:52.760]  accumulate money tax-free and even pass that on to our children without going
[3:46:52.760 --> 3:46:55.320]  through probate that was one of his proposals
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:46:59.640]  require price transparency see once we have the money
[3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:02.440]  and once we have competition between insurance companies
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:06.600]  we still need to know who is charging what so we need to know
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:10.360]  have transparency about uh health care providers what are these
[3:47:10.360 --> 3:47:13.960]  different hospitals and doctors charging for these different procedures
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:17.560]  what are their success and failure rates we need to know that information
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:20.760]  if we're going to have a competitive marketplace and
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:24.120]  let me say again a competitive marketplace is the only way that you're
[3:47:24.120 --> 3:47:27.080]  going to drive health care costs down you're not going to do it
[3:47:27.080 --> 3:47:30.280]  by consolidating everything as Hillary Clinton wanted to she kept saying we
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:32.600]  have to have a single payer so we can drive costs down
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:36.760]  no monopolies always drive costs up especially government monopolies and
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:40.200]  we have government subsidizing an industry it's going to drive the costs
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:43.880]  up again he said uh do block grants of Medicaid to the
[3:47:43.880 --> 3:47:48.360]  state to help with this that's a transitional uh measure let's hope
[3:47:48.360 --> 3:47:51.720]  where we the states can do whatever they wish but i don't want to see the federal
[3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:55.400]  government doing something like that on a permanent basis
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:00.120]  but then also remove barriers to entry to get down the cost of drugs so there's
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:03.400]  a lot of things that could be done i hope all of that finds its way
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:06.920]  into uh trump's health insurance program because
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:12.440]  we have to start thinking about how we're going to get health care not how
[3:48:12.440 --> 3:48:15.800]  we're going to get health insurance in the same way that we need to not confuse
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:19.080]  education with schools they're not the same thing
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:24.840]  schools are institutions uh health insurance companies are institutions
[3:48:24.840 --> 3:48:27.720]  what you're really trying to get is an education everybody wants an education
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:31.800]  everybody wants health care but we don't necessarily need to put ourselves in
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:35.800]  those institutional boxes and subsidize them we need to think
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:39.880]  outside of those institutional boxes now let's talk about the next thing
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:42.200]  that's on the map here and of course we've been getting
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:45.000]  pronouncements that have been coming out through the week
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:48.360]  from this world government summit that's going on in dubai and the person who is
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:51.960]  getting the most press of course is elon musk
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:56.360]  this guy has become a combination of bill gates
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:00.680]  and steve jobs he has the reality distortion field around him where he's
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:03.880]  got these people that are such big fanboys of him just like steve jobs
[3:49:03.880 --> 3:49:06.840]  no matter what he does no matter what he introduces
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:10.920]  everybody goes fanatical about it okay they they have to have his latest
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:13.960]  product and so he's been able to take steve job's
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:20.120]  place in that but what the guy truly is is he is a bill gates globalist
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:22.600]  and you can see this in some of the pronouncements that he's had out there
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:25.400]  we've had several these stories make their way under the drudge report this
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:29.080]  week listen to this one quote from elon musk we talked
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:32.680]  about it earlier in the week where he said that you're going to have to merge
[3:49:32.680 --> 3:49:39.320]  with machines or become irrelevant and and just just hold that in your mind for
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:42.520]  a moment to become irrelevant what does that mean
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:46.040]  that means that in his mind you're going to be nothing
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:49.640]  you're going to be some amoeba that he can just stamp out
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:53.640]  or wipe out with a plague or wipe out with
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:58.360]  autonomous killing drones that get out of control now he's spoken against all
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:02.680]  this stuff and he said hey we got to watch out for all this stuff
[3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:07.960]  and yet everything that he's doing is moving us along those lines
[3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:11.560]  when we look at what he's proposing one of the things he says one way to think
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:14.920]  of ai coming along and taking people's jobs says one way to think of it is to
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:19.240]  imagine that you were very confident you were going to be visited by a super
[3:50:19.240 --> 3:50:22.760]  intelligent aliens in 10 years or 20 years at the
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:25.960]  most see that's the way they think of themselves
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:31.240]  they think of you as being irrelevant and when we talk to hugo de garris and he
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:33.160]  talked about hey you're going to have a few elites
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:38.440]  technological elites they're going to be the cosmos i call him and in his term
[3:50:38.440 --> 3:50:42.680]  he talked about the intellect war the artificial
[3:50:42.680 --> 3:50:46.760]  intelligence war giga death in humanity he goes all you people
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:50.520]  the terrens who at some point realize where this is all headed
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:54.760]  say we don't want it then these elitists like elon musk will head off to
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:57.960]  elysium the near-term orbit and they're going to fight you with their superior
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:01.640]  technology because they're superior alien force with harsh chemicals are you

[3:54:13.720 --> 3:54:16.600]  don't want to continue talking about where this is headed we're talking
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:19.880]  about a greater depression folks and i'm gonna break down these numbers for you
[3:54:19.880 --> 3:54:24.520]  even by elon musk's conservative nonchalant estimates
[3:54:24.520 --> 3:54:28.520]  here about this you cannot believe how disruptive
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:32.040]  what they have planned for us is going to be and they don't have to go to full
[3:54:32.040 --> 3:54:37.560]  generalized artificial intelligence for this to put us into a greater depression
[3:54:37.560 --> 3:54:40.200]  i'm going to break that down for you in just a moment but before i do i want to
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:43.640]  remind you that we have a new product caveman the ultimate
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:48.040]  new paleo formulation by info wars life i talked about this earlier i said
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:51.720]  tasted it for the first time yesterday it tastes like chocolate milk it's one
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:54.840]  of the best tasting supplements i've ever had
[3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:58.760]  and it has good things in it for you unlike chocolate milk
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:02.360]  it has bone broth turmeric root chaga mushroom
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:07.560]  seven total primal superfoods and a single great tasting formula and i would
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:10.680]  underscore the great tasting formula i mean where else can you get great
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:14.040]  nutrients like this and something that tastes like chocolate milk so it's
[3:55:14.040 --> 3:55:17.320]  great for you great for your kids for anybody i'm sure they they've probably
[3:55:17.320 --> 3:55:21.480]  got another other taste formulations but that's
[3:55:21.480 --> 3:55:25.160]  the one that i really like and again you'll find that at info wars life
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:29.160]  dot com also we have a special collectors edition that we've
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:32.760]  just put out of our lower receivers from tennessee arms the 80 percent lower
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:36.680]  receivers and it's going to have a commemorative
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:40.440]  president trump issue on it normally these would be priced at 160 but we're
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:45.080]  doing this for loyal listeners with an introductory price of 150 dollars it's
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:49.080]  limited run of only a thousand pieces they're going to go very quickly
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:52.440]  again it's got a picture of donald trump on the
[3:55:52.440 --> 3:55:56.600]  lower receiver the 80 percent lower receiver suitable for shooting from the
[3:55:56.600 --> 3:56:00.440]  hip but it is again he is a friend of the
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:03.480]  second amendment and so this is something that's going to be commemorative
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:05.720]  to that and i think we're going to see some
[3:56:05.720 --> 3:56:09.400]  great moves in terms of defending the second amendment oh they got him dressed
[3:56:09.400 --> 3:56:11.640]  up there i just saw that picture they got him dressed up like
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:15.480]  andrew jackson that's a great image that's something that
[3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:18.840]  alex jones picked and and he does remind me a lot of
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:21.880]  andrew jackson let's hope that he stands up to the banks like
[3:56:21.880 --> 3:56:26.120]  andrew jackson again it's a great commemorative pieces only going to be
[3:56:26.120 --> 3:56:29.640]  1000 of these take a look at info wars store dot com
[3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:34.440]  and we even have it on a discount right now 150 instead of 160 dollars you can
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:38.120]  get that great picture on there of donald trump wearing the
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:42.440]  andrew jackson uniform now i'm not going to talk about this facial recognition
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:45.400]  and body cam stuff i'll probably do that in the nightly news tonight in a
[3:56:45.400 --> 3:56:48.040]  segment there because i don't have time to fully get into it i want to finish
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:50.440]  up with what's going on with world government
[3:56:50.440 --> 3:56:53.800]  summit as we have elon musk talking about hey
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:57.960]  we could probably expect a 15 unemployment
[3:56:57.960 --> 3:57:01.480]  to come along the pike here well let's let's break this down right now we're
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:04.200]  told by our government that we've got about five percent unemployment because
[3:57:04.200 --> 3:57:08.760]  they report something called the u3 that is a new way to calculate
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:11.560]  unemployment that began when the clinton administration
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:14.680]  and that's just people who have looked for a job within the last
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:18.120]  month but they haven't found one now if you go to the other
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:22.040]  unemployment measure u6 which is people that have looked
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:25.640]  within the last year or they might be working a part-time job but they want a
[3:57:25.640 --> 3:57:28.200]  full-time job but they can't get a full-time job
[3:57:28.200 --> 3:57:30.840]  okay then the unemployment rate is about 10 percent
[3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:34.680]  now where does all this compare to let's say the great depression
[3:57:34.680 --> 3:57:37.000]  during the great depression here in the united states we had an unemployment
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:41.480]  rate of about 25 percent okay we recovered to about a 15
[3:57:41.480 --> 3:57:47.320]  percent unemployment just before the world war two
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:52.840]  however if you add even his conservative estimate to the real unemployment rate
[3:57:52.840 --> 3:57:55.720]  you get back up to where we were under the great depression
[3:57:55.720 --> 3:57:59.880]  but if you look at oxford city bank studies they talk about how they believe
[3:57:59.880 --> 3:58:04.200]  that with increased automation robotics that are just a few years down the road
[3:58:04.200 --> 3:58:07.400]  we're looking at 47 percent of us jobs at risk
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:11.160]  we're looking at 77 percent of chinese jobs at risk
[3:58:11.160 --> 3:58:15.080]  you think that's going to be disruptive that's going to be disruptive in the way
[3:58:15.080 --> 3:58:18.680]  that the great depression led to world war two
[3:58:18.680 --> 3:58:22.280]  you're talking about a situation if you lose half of the jobs right now with 10
[3:58:22.280 --> 3:58:26.120]  percent unemployment you're looking at another 45 percent of the
[3:58:26.120 --> 3:58:29.000]  people out of work you're looking at 55 percent
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:33.560]  unemployment not the 25 percent that was the peak of the great depression
[3:58:33.560 --> 3:58:37.000]  that's something you need to think about that's it for today
[3:58:37.000 --> 3:58:40.760]  join us tonight for the info wars nightly news
