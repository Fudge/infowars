[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.440]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.480 --> 00:17.520]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:17.520 --> 00:26.480]  We are go liftoff Houston, this is Cape Canaveral
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.040]  It is the 20th day of March 2011
[00:35.320 --> 00:43.800]  We're gonna be live here for the next two hours, and I have a lengthy list here of key points that I want to go over today
[00:43.800 --> 00:57.440]  Obviously, when we launch the full transmission in the next segment, I'm gonna be getting into the latest unfolding NATO UN bombardment
[00:57.440 --> 01:04.640]  including 120 plus cruise missiles fired from US vessels into Libya, mainly around Tripoli
[01:04.640 --> 01:14.880]  softening them up for the ground invasion, they have two giant Marine Corps amphibious aircraft carriers off the coast of Tripoli
[01:14.880 --> 01:22.560]  You notice now a air war means a bombardment or the ground cover
[01:22.560 --> 01:43.560]  The supposed no fly zone means bombardment and Muammar Gaddafi who's been big buddies with Obama, big buddies with Tony Blair, big buddies with the current prime minister of England hanging out with Herman von Roompi of the EU
[01:43.560 --> 01:58.560]  The weapons systems have been sold to him by England and by the United States and France, their CIA, MI6, SAS-backed forces have been defeated across Libya
[01:58.560 --> 02:08.560]  The final big city to take was Benghazi of 700,000, and as soon as that happened, you really see the evidence that this was a globalist backed destabilization program
[02:08.560 --> 02:17.560]  They began openly flooding weapons in via Saudi Arabia into Egypt on the eastern side of Libya
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.560]  This is incredible, this is amazing hypocrisy and we're gonna be breaking it all down
[02:23.560 --> 02:29.560]  Also the latest on the radiation cloud that began reaching the United States two days ago on Friday
[02:29.560 --> 02:33.560]  Since then, almost no news in the US about radiation detectors
[02:33.560 --> 02:45.560]  Remember the first radiation that got here on Friday was from the Friday before last in Japan when they just had a leak at the 6 reactor base Fukushima in northeastern Japan
[02:45.560 --> 02:56.560]  Then on Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday there were more explosions and fires at Fukushima, that heavier radiation as well as the 600,000 spent fuel rods blown sky high
[02:56.560 --> 03:07.560]  The off-gassing and radiation from that headed our way and because it's invisible, we're getting the same propaganda we got in the 40s, 50s and 60s
[03:07.560 --> 03:13.560]  From the 300 plus above ground test carried out in the United States and in the Pacific
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.560]  Don't worry about it, it's not a problem
[03:16.560 --> 03:20.560]  They say, oh, the radiation's only double in some areas what it should be
[03:20.560 --> 03:21.560]  That's no big deal
[03:21.560 --> 03:28.560]  Well, that's background radiation, but if one of those little particles that's highly radiated, that's not being picked up by detectors
[03:28.560 --> 03:36.560]  You breathe that, you die a year, 10 years, 20 years, down the road from it, that's plausible deniability
[03:36.560 --> 03:43.560]  So we're gonna be breaking all of that down as well today on the other side of this quick break
[03:43.560 --> 03:53.560]  Also, the Liberty Dollar Creator convicted in federal court, the sound of the Citizen Times, out of Asheville
[03:53.560 --> 04:02.560]  And I have the Department of Justice press release where they talk about it being domestic terrorism to print your own silver or gold coins
[04:02.560 --> 04:10.560]  I guess that Montana legislature wants gold and silver in some state transactions, I guess they're terrorists
[04:10.560 --> 04:19.560]  Or what about this article? Legislature says the state needs its own currency, this out of North Carolina
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.560]  There are dozens of US cities that have had their own currencies for decades
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.560]  But now the system is saying it's illegal to print your own silver or gold
[04:30.560 --> 04:37.560]  I mean, there's thousands of companies putting out commemorative coins, another big shine of big fat tyranny
[04:37.560 --> 04:45.560]  Also, the National Guard to leave Mexico border in June, the Southwest border to be left unguarded even more
[04:45.560 --> 04:54.560]  That's actually constitutional to have troops down there, but no, sorry, they gotta be all over the Middle East, Central Asia, and of course North Africa
[04:54.560 --> 05:08.560]  Just stay with us
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.560]  Socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[05:28.560 --> 05:31.560]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[05:31.560 --> 05:35.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[05:35.560 --> 05:40.560]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[05:40.560 --> 05:45.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.560]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:50.560 --> 05:54.560]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[05:54.560 --> 06:20.560]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:20.560 --> 06:43.560]  I have three stacks of extremely important news to cover today
[06:43.560 --> 06:56.560]  First off, the huge unfolding NATO-UN-US strikes on the dictator's stronghold in Tripoli in the country of Libya
[06:56.560 --> 07:01.560]  We're going to be breaking all of that down today
[07:01.560 --> 07:06.560]  I've got more than 50 articles on that front
[07:06.560 --> 07:16.560]  Then we're going to get into the latest developments in the six nuclear reactor center at Fukushima in Japan
[07:16.560 --> 07:25.560]  The site of multiple partial meltdowns, two cores exposed, giant explosions at Fukushima 1 and 3
[07:25.560 --> 07:32.560]  Ejecting hundreds of thousands of spent fuel rods stored on top of the reactors sky-high
[07:32.560 --> 07:40.560]  The first radiation arrived Friday from a week previous, the Friday before last, or about nine days ago
[07:40.560 --> 07:44.560]  when Fukushima was hit by the tsunami caused by the earthquake
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.560]  That's the light radiation
[07:46.560 --> 07:53.560]  The heavier radiation is reported coming across the Pacific Ocean from the giant explosions
[07:53.560 --> 08:00.560]  and fires and smoke that are still emanating from reactors 1, 3, 2, and 4
[08:00.560 --> 08:06.560]  The good news is reactors 5 and 6 have been successfully shut down and re-cooled
[08:06.560 --> 08:13.560]  But many nuclear physicists we've interviewed, like Dr. Bob Bowman, Dr. Busby, and others
[08:13.560 --> 08:21.560]  clearly have said this is obviously worse than the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl in the Ukraine outside Kiev
[08:21.560 --> 08:30.560]  That was a small reactor compared to just Fukushima 3, that is a Max-Core Mark I General Electric plutonium based reactor
[08:30.560 --> 08:36.560]  Back in the 70s when these were developed and built, many General Electric engineers resigned
[08:36.560 --> 08:43.560]  over the danger of using weapons grade plutonium, a byproduct of weapons development in the reactors
[08:43.560 --> 08:45.560]  That is all coming up
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.560]  But first, I want to cover the developments in Tripoli
[08:50.560 --> 08:53.560]  Let me say this succinctly and clearly
[08:53.560 --> 08:57.560]  Muammar Gaddafi is a dictator
[08:57.560 --> 09:05.560]  Muammar Gaddafi is an individual at the same time compared to many other dictators that is a true socialist
[09:05.560 --> 09:14.560]  I don't like socialism, but many historians and philosophers and sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists have stated
[09:14.560 --> 09:22.560]  that if you're going to have socialism, it can only be delivered by a dictator who has no competition
[09:22.560 --> 09:30.560]  True socialism can only be delivered by that because if it's a regular political system, the socialist government class will steal all the money for themselves
[09:30.560 --> 09:38.560]  But through a philosopher king, be he corrupt or not corrupt, you can actually have some largesse, or the trillions in oil
[09:38.560 --> 09:48.560]  that have been shipped out of Libya in the last 40 plus years of his dictatorship, he's actually built big buildings, schools, power plants, government housing
[09:48.560 --> 09:55.560]  And actually, in the aggregate, made that North African country the jewel of Africa
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.560]  The only country that's half decent other than South Africa itself now fall into corruption
[10:01.560 --> 10:06.560]  That said, I do not support Muammar Gaddafi
[10:06.560 --> 10:18.560]  But at the same time, I do not support the hypocrisy, the lies, the fraud, the corruption, the disinformation, the fairy tale land
[10:18.560 --> 10:25.560]  that has been sold to us by the French, the British, the UN, and the so-called U.S. government that's been hijacked
[10:25.560 --> 10:33.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's on record Tony Blair, it's on record the new British prime minister, it's on record Sarkozy
[10:33.560 --> 10:44.560]  Herman von Rumpi, the head of the EU, in just the last few years, hanging out with Muammar Gaddafi, selling him armaments
[10:44.560 --> 10:47.560]  Saying that he was now a good dictator
[10:47.560 --> 10:55.560]  In every major Muslim country, in Bahrain, in Yemen, the list goes on and on
[10:55.560 --> 11:04.560]  They are dictators, either oligarch dictators or royal dictators, royal families
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.560]  In Yemen, in Bahrain, in the last week, they're machine gunning people on the street
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.560]  They are attacking crowds with tanks, everything that Muammar Gaddafi has been attacked for
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.560]  Now, let's look at Gaddafi, I've seen the western journalist, I've seen the live footage
[11:21.560 --> 11:29.560]  They're not a resting journalist, it turned out did not strafe crowds of protesters that are flying their own jet aircraft and driving tanks
[11:29.560 --> 11:38.560]  Western-backed rebels, he did not, a month ago, and then three weeks ago, and then two weeks ago, run to Venezuela
[11:38.560 --> 11:43.560]  as the British government said they confirmed, that was to destabilize and make the rebels think they'd won
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.560]  He did not run to Zimbabwe, north of South Africa
[11:47.560 --> 11:55.560]  He did not strafe crowds, that since then, just like they claimed Saddam Hussein, US-backed dictator
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.560]  In 1990, they claimed he had thrown babies out of incubators in Kuwait, turned out that was a lie
[12:01.560 --> 12:07.560]  That's admitted to be a lie, see, I don't like being lied to, so why is the West there?
[12:07.560 --> 12:13.560]  Because there is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of oil
[12:13.560 --> 12:20.560]  every year shipped out of there to Europe, mainly to Italy, predominantly, the biggest supplier to Italy
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.560]  That's something the big oil companies don't control, and that's why we see this happening
[12:26.560 --> 12:34.560]  Do you hear complaints about Yemen, or Bahrain, or countless other Arab dictatorships, machine-gunning crowds?
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.560]  No, you hear nothing about that because they don't have oil and they're in bed with the globalist
[12:39.560 --> 12:45.560]  Do you hear about Saudi Arabia that will behead Christians for teaching the word?
[12:45.560 --> 12:54.560]  No, do you hear about any of that? No, you hear zero because they're allies of the globalist, not America, but the bankers
[12:54.560 --> 13:00.560]  Here's the other big issue, and I'll put this on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers
[13:00.560 --> 13:21.560]  You notice that the United Nations last Thursday night put out this call, put out this resolution, 10-0, to have a no-fly zone
[13:21.560 --> 13:24.560]  which said, including bombardment and invasion
[13:24.560 --> 13:35.560]  And you notice the invasion, the ongoing softening for the invasion, with two Marine Corps amphibious assault carriers waiting right off the coast of Tripoli
[13:35.560 --> 13:46.560]  You notice that the United Nations has now launched British, French, attack aircraft, bombing, emplacements all over Libya
[13:46.560 --> 13:58.560]  All by Muammar Gaddafi, military bases, civilian deaths, you name it, 120-plus US cruise missiles have been launched into the country from ships off the coast
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.560]  That is an amazingly powerful no-fly zone, is it not?
[14:02.560 --> 14:09.560]  I saw a story yesterday about the rebels having their own aircraft, the rebels having their own tanks
[14:09.560 --> 14:23.560]  These are not protesters, these are Western-backed, British SAS a week and a half ago got captured, Special Air Services Commandos got arrested inside Libya running these operations
[14:23.560 --> 14:32.560]  So let's be honest, the United Nations, as Obama said Friday in his speech, this is part of globalism, the United Nations gave the order
[14:32.560 --> 14:41.560]  And the British, the French and the US and NATO all began launching attacks, this is a United Nations operation
[14:41.560 --> 14:50.560]  Not declared by Congress, not with set out goals as the Speaker of the House Boehner has said to Obama, define the mission
[14:50.560 --> 14:58.560]  Well, sorry, the UN, the United Nations is setting out the mission and running this
[14:58.560 --> 15:06.560]  And Gaddafi has handed out over a million AK-47s to his population to resist the invasion
[15:06.560 --> 15:26.560]  This will be Cobra gunships, Apache gunships, F-16s, F-15s, British, jump jets, Harriers, French aircraft, backing up the rebels as they try to retake the cities they've taken over
[15:26.560 --> 15:39.560]  Now, what's the bigger issue here? A precedent has been set under global governance and the UN that Western intelligence agencies go in to any country they want, including Iran, not just Libya
[15:39.560 --> 15:45.560]  Have them start an armed resistance to the government, whether that government's legitimate or not
[15:45.560 --> 15:59.560]  And then, if the rebels are defeated, America, NATO and Europe are then committed to bombard and then invade, this is the beginning of what could be World War III, we'll break it down
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.560]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon
[16:20.560 --> 16:28.560]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.560]  Move quickly while you can still afford it, and eFood's Direct will pay your shipping costs for you
[16:33.560 --> 16:40.560]  For the best-tasting, long-term, storeable food, you pay nothing for shipping and can put every dollar into food at today's prices

[16:53.560 --> 17:11.560]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[17:11.560 --> 17:16.560]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[17:16.560 --> 17:19.560]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[17:19.560 --> 17:27.560]  The easy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[17:31.560 --> 17:38.560]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener
[17:38.560 --> 17:42.560]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.560]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.560]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com

[18:58.560 --> 19:04.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[19:04.560 --> 19:07.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[19:07.560 --> 19:12.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots
[19:18.560 --> 19:23.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[19:23.560 --> 19:27.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[19:27.560 --> 19:31.560]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[19:31.560 --> 19:34.560]  And on its ashes, constructing world government
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[19:38.560 --> 19:40.560]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.560]  Today seems like nobody does care
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.560]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic
[19:47.560 --> 19:52.560]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at www.InfoWars.com

[20:00.560 --> 20:04.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:13.560 --> 20:17.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[20:17.560 --> 20:20.560]  You want answers? Well, so does he
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.560]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[20:29.560 --> 20:32.560]  Let me simplify this
[20:32.560 --> 20:34.560]  Let me boil this down
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.560]  Very, very simply for any new listeners
[20:40.560 --> 20:45.560]  I was at the gas station yesterday afternoon getting gas
[20:45.560 --> 20:53.560]  And I also went over to the Netflix machine and rented a movie
[20:53.560 --> 20:55.560]  To watch with my wife
[20:55.560 --> 20:59.560]  And when I walked over to the counter, I saw the two guys behind the counter
[20:59.560 --> 21:03.560]  And a bunch of men buying beer celebrating
[21:03.560 --> 21:06.560]  Go on, woohoo, as I walk up, woohoo, yeah
[21:06.560 --> 21:10.560]  Blow up Gaddafi, yeah, get him, yeah, war
[21:10.560 --> 21:13.560]  We feel powerful, we feel personally big
[21:13.560 --> 21:16.560]  Watching cruise missiles and bombs dropping on some country
[21:16.560 --> 21:19.560]  Who they don't know the history of or understand anything about
[21:19.560 --> 21:22.560]  They personally felt manly
[21:22.560 --> 21:25.560]  And I didn't say anything to them
[21:25.560 --> 21:32.560]  I just got my ice cream and my vitamin water and my movie and I left
[21:32.560 --> 21:35.560]  But now I'm going to address those guys
[21:35.560 --> 21:41.560]  Foreign big megabanks, multinational corporations, bigger than most nations' GDP
[21:41.560 --> 21:47.560]  Are ruthless, they want the trillion-plus dollars of oil left there in Libya
[21:47.560 --> 21:51.560]  They prop up dictators all over the world and then they betray them
[21:51.560 --> 21:55.560]  And they don't want to put people who want freedom into those nations
[21:55.560 --> 21:59.560]  They want to put other tyrants in that will follow their orders
[21:59.560 --> 22:03.560]  The very same banks that are running this are the ones that have used America's credit card
[22:03.560 --> 22:08.560]  That's bankrupt to fund the military bases in 160-plus countries
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.560]  Over 3,000 of them, total bases
[22:12.560 --> 22:14.560]  They don't care about you
[22:14.560 --> 22:18.560]  I know you feel manly watching cruise missiles fire from ships
[22:18.560 --> 22:20.560]  But get it through your head
[22:20.560 --> 22:24.560]  This country has been financially hijacked
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.560]  Meanwhile, U.S. allies, as they call them
[22:28.560 --> 22:34.560]  Are machine-gunning, peaceful demonstrators in Yemen, in Bahrain, and many other countries
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.560]  Every nation in the Arab League that has been backing these attacks
[22:39.560 --> 22:43.560]  Is a western-backed neocolonialist puppet
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.560]  And it's all about oil
[22:45.560 --> 22:48.560]  And you have the UN Friday passing a resolution
[22:48.560 --> 22:54.560]  No authorization from Congress, our ceremonial government more and more
[22:54.560 --> 22:59.560]  Not saying a word about U.S. force
[22:59.560 --> 23:03.560]  Hundreds of cruise missiles and now reportedly U.S. aircraft in the air
[23:03.560 --> 23:08.560]  And French and British bombing Tripoli right now
[23:08.560 --> 23:12.560]  This is world government. What did Obama say in his speech?
[23:12.560 --> 23:15.560]  He said, well, these are protesters that have been arrested, who've been attacked
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.560]  Well, what happened in Brazil? They had to arrest a bunch of people
[23:19.560 --> 23:23.560]  Here's an AP headline, anti-war protesters arrested near White House
[23:23.560 --> 23:25.560]  They didn't have a permit
[23:25.560 --> 23:29.560]  Obama cancels public speech in Rio Square after riots and arrest
[23:29.560 --> 23:34.560]  Obama's Brazil presser scrubbed, no press conference
[23:34.560 --> 23:37.560]  Are we going to invade Brazil?
[23:37.560 --> 23:44.560]  Every time a group of rebels with weapons start shooting police and attacking military
[23:44.560 --> 23:47.560]  In Iran or wherever, Indonesia, you name it
[23:47.560 --> 23:52.560]  I mean, if the people in Russia rose up, would we then have war with Russia?
[23:52.560 --> 23:55.560]  Because, oh, they're being mean to their population
[23:55.560 --> 23:57.560]  And then it turns out most of it's a lie
[23:57.560 --> 24:00.560]  Sure, Gaddafi's a dictator of 41 years
[24:00.560 --> 24:03.560]  I don't like Muammar Gaddafi in his clown suits
[24:03.560 --> 24:06.560]  But the truth is, he's a hardcore guy
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.560]  He handed out a million weapons today to his population to resist this invasion
[24:10.560 --> 24:13.560]  The globalists just a week ago said they would never bombard
[24:13.560 --> 24:16.560]  They would just have an old fly zone, now they're bombing it
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.560]  Then they said they'd never physically invade
[24:18.560 --> 24:21.560]  But if you read the U.N. statement of Friday
[24:21.560 --> 24:24.560]  And if you listen to Obama's speech and Hillary's speech, they said
[24:24.560 --> 24:30.560]  You will accept a humanitarian assistance U.N. force, a military
[24:30.560 --> 24:33.560]  Or we will invade you
[24:33.560 --> 24:40.560]  Another war, three wars going on that cost over a trillion dollars a year
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.560]  The public defense budget's 1.1 trillion, off budget at least 800 billion
[24:45.560 --> 24:48.560]  You're close to 2 trillion there, not to mention supplemental funding
[24:48.560 --> 24:50.560]  We're going bankrupt
[24:50.560 --> 24:52.560]  But the defense contractors don't care, they're making money
[24:52.560 --> 24:54.560]  That's another form of corporate welfare
[24:54.560 --> 24:58.560]  I'm not just against the unions, I'm against the corporate welfare for the defense contractors
[24:58.560 --> 25:00.560]  Just like Ron Paul is
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.560]  This is an unconstitutional act of war
[25:04.560 --> 25:07.560]  And it's all based on lies
[25:07.560 --> 25:09.560]  They told us he fled to Venezuela twice, wasn't true
[25:09.560 --> 25:11.560]  They told us he ran to Zimbabwe, wasn't true
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.560]  They told us he was going to flee last week, wasn't true
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.560]  It's now admitted that what was said a month ago wasn't true by the White House
[25:19.560 --> 25:23.560]  These rebels are U.S. and NATO, British, French funded
[25:23.560 --> 25:26.560]  Western commandos have been arrested
[25:26.560 --> 25:28.560]  They are in the country
[25:28.560 --> 25:30.560]  This whole thing is a fraud and a lie
[25:30.560 --> 25:35.560]  This isn't just some simple, mindless, our football team is attacking somebody
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.560]  And guys at a gas station are going, woohoo, as I walk up with my ice cream
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.560]  They're going, yeah, and guys are high-flying each other over the counter
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.560]  Yeah, we're attacking Libya, woohoo, woohoo, we feel tough right now
[25:48.560 --> 25:50.560]  Kind of like we now learn 11 years ago
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.560]  The big insurance company signed a private deal, now public in Bloomberg
[25:54.560 --> 25:56.560]  To steal all the death benefits of the troops
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.560]  You think they care about Yemenis, Bahrainians, Iraqis
[26:01.560 --> 26:04.560]  You think they care about Venezuela, anybody
[26:04.560 --> 26:06.560]  These bankers don't care about anybody
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.560]  They are totally and completely 110% ruthless
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.560]  And so know this, while you're cheering this new war
[26:16.560 --> 26:18.560]  They lie to you and tell you every year
[26:18.560 --> 26:20.560]  We'll be out in two years from Afghanistan
[26:20.560 --> 26:23.560]  It's always two more years, they just announced that last month
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.560]  They just announced that in February
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.560]  This is never ending, the military is full of good men and women
[26:31.560 --> 26:38.560]  But it's controlled at the top by the big mega offshore corporations
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.560]  That control this country
[26:40.560 --> 26:43.560]  And they now admit the rebels the entire time
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.560]  To me, or western funded, so what does this say?
[26:47.560 --> 26:52.560]  If western funded rebels, a lot of them are legitimately angry against dictators
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.560]  Like Haas-Mubarak in Egypt, our big ally
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.560]  Our Muammar Qaddafi, who'd been the big enemy till six years ago
[26:58.560 --> 27:00.560]  When he became a good guy in our media
[27:00.560 --> 27:02.560]  And I said, then this is a fraud
[27:02.560 --> 27:04.560]  Why is our media endorsing him?
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.560]  And all the British prime ministers and Italian presidents
[27:07.560 --> 27:10.560]  And French presidents openly hugging him
[27:10.560 --> 27:13.560]  You go to the top of the Drudge Report right now, it's Qaddafi
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.560]  With his arms around Obama just a year ago
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.560]  It's a joke, it's like 1984
[27:19.560 --> 27:21.560]  We've always been at war against East Asia
[27:21.560 --> 27:24.560]  We've never been at war against East Asia
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.560]  They're our friend
[27:26.560 --> 27:32.560]  And you read this, now here's the big fat, super juicy key
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.560]  I would love for real freedom to be in North Africa
[27:36.560 --> 27:38.560]  Though Africa has never had a history of freedom
[27:38.560 --> 27:40.560]  I would love that
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.560]  But let's talk about the real world
[27:42.560 --> 27:43.560]  Let's talk about reality
[27:43.560 --> 27:45.560]  Let's not talk about lies and fraud
[27:45.560 --> 27:48.560]  And just buy a comic book, fiction we're being handed
[27:48.560 --> 27:51.560]  Let's talk about reality
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.560]  This article was out
[27:54.560 --> 27:56.560]  I called Paul Watson last night and he said
[27:56.560 --> 27:58.560]  I got a splitting headache, it's 10 o'clock at night here
[27:58.560 --> 28:00.560]  I can't write this now, I'll write it in the morning
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.560]  I said, fine
[28:01.560 --> 28:04.560]  He wrote it this morning at PrismPlanet.com
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.560]  U.S. government backs Libyan al-Qaeda while hyping terror attack inside the U.S.
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.560]  Let me read that again
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.560]  U.S. government backs Libyan al-Qaeda while hyping terror attack inside U.S.
[28:16.560 --> 28:18.560]  One of the headlines today
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.560]  Qaddafi says al-Qaeda forces backed by Egypt and Saudi Arabia are attacking him
[28:24.560 --> 28:26.560]  Says the Western terrorist
[28:26.560 --> 28:28.560]  Well, that's actually true
[28:28.560 --> 28:30.560]  He's a terrorist too
[28:30.560 --> 28:32.560]  What did the London Telegraph run with?
[28:32.560 --> 28:35.560]  Hours after we published our article
[28:35.560 --> 28:37.560]  Libya
[28:37.560 --> 28:40.560]  The West and al-Qaeda are on the same side, they are
[28:40.560 --> 28:44.560]  Saudi Arabia is sending an al-Qaeda through Egypt and weapons
[28:44.560 --> 28:47.560]  And al-Qaeda, it says in the London Telegraph
[28:47.560 --> 28:50.560]  Has endorsed the U.S.
[28:50.560 --> 28:52.560]  Usama bin Laden
[28:52.560 --> 28:54.560]  And we're all a-locking
[28:54.560 --> 28:57.560]  Well, who do you think the West used against the Russians or against the Serbs?
[28:57.560 --> 28:59.560]  Al-Qaeda
[28:59.560 --> 29:04.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.560]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.560]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[29:28.560 --> 29:31.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[29:31.560 --> 29:35.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[29:35.560 --> 29:40.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[29:40.560 --> 29:44.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[29:44.560 --> 29:45.560]  One of my old sponsors
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.560]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.560]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[29:51.560 --> 29:55.560]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[29:55.560 --> 29:59.560]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[29:59.560 --> 30:03.560]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011
[30:03.560 --> 30:07.560]  We will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[30:07.560 --> 30:10.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[30:10.560 --> 30:13.560]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[30:13.560 --> 30:15.560]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.560]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[30:18.560 --> 30:21.560]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[30:21.560 --> 30:26.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[30:26.560 --> 30:27.560]  General Growth Properties
[30:27.560 --> 30:30.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[30:30.560 --> 30:34.560]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[30:34.560 --> 30:36.560]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[30:36.560 --> 30:38.560]  And it's a real eye-opener
[30:38.560 --> 30:39.560]  I can't stress this enough
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.560]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[30:42.560 --> 30:44.560]  He explains everything you need to know
[30:44.560 --> 30:46.560]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[30:46.560 --> 30:50.560]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com
[30:50.560 --> 30:53.560]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[30:53.560 --> 30:57.560]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com
[30:57.560 --> 31:20.560]  That's End of America, 3.com
[31:27.560 --> 31:44.560]  That's End of America, 3.com
[31:58.560 --> 32:03.560]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.560]  Tyranny is here
[32:04.560 --> 32:08.560]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.560]  It really says that the state is God
[32:11.560 --> 32:16.560]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth
[32:16.560 --> 32:21.560]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares
[32:21.560 --> 32:23.560]  Now being expanded nationwide
[32:23.560 --> 32:29.560]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state
[32:29.560 --> 32:33.560]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[32:33.560 --> 32:37.560]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship
[32:37.560 --> 32:43.560]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[32:43.560 --> 32:47.560]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.560]  The police state isn't coming

[33:01.560 --> 33:04.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[33:04.560 --> 33:23.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.560]  Okay, my friends, coming up in the second hour
[33:39.560 --> 33:43.560]  We're gonna open the phones, I'll get into the latest radiation plumes
[33:43.560 --> 33:45.560]  That have already reached the United States
[33:45.560 --> 33:47.560]  The whitewash of that
[33:47.560 --> 33:52.560]  The ongoing meltdowns at Fukushima
[33:52.560 --> 33:54.560]  In Japan
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.560]  So that is coming up in the next hour
[33:59.560 --> 34:01.560]  But I've got a clip here of Obama
[34:01.560 --> 34:04.560]  I've got a clip of a member of the British Parliament who we've interviewed
[34:04.560 --> 34:06.560]  George Galloway that I'm gonna play
[34:06.560 --> 34:09.560]  I've also got a clip of Lewis Farrakhan
[34:09.560 --> 34:13.560]  Who I don't agree with on a lot of issues, but I agree with him on his statements on Libya
[34:13.560 --> 34:15.560]  That is coming up
[34:15.560 --> 34:17.560]  Just get this straight
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.560]  None of this has to do with anything humanitarian
[34:20.560 --> 34:22.560]  Now, who is Al Qaeda?
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.560]  Al Qaeda was set up in 1979 by Zabigniew Brzezinski
[34:26.560 --> 34:29.560]  The International Foreign Affairs
[34:29.560 --> 34:31.560]  Security Advisor for Jimmy Carter
[34:31.560 --> 34:32.560]  He's written two books on it
[34:32.560 --> 34:33.560]  It's public
[34:33.560 --> 34:34.560]  It's declassified
[34:34.560 --> 34:36.560]  They attacked the Russians
[34:36.560 --> 34:38.560]  Who were tyrants
[34:38.560 --> 34:40.560]  To get them to actually come into Afghanistan
[34:40.560 --> 34:42.560]  You're told it started by 83
[34:42.560 --> 34:45.560]  That they invaded a few years before and then we got involved
[34:45.560 --> 34:47.560]  No
[34:47.560 --> 34:50.560]  Russia was attacked by Muslim extremists
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.560]  Funded out of Saudi Arabia
[34:52.560 --> 34:56.560]  Same thing happened in the 1990s
[34:56.560 --> 34:58.560]  Repeatedly
[34:58.560 --> 35:02.560]  Dealing with the situation in Serbia
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.560]  Out of Albania
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.560]  Now Al Qaeda is run by Saudi Arabia
[35:08.560 --> 35:10.560]  The most corrupt Arab nation out there
[35:10.560 --> 35:12.560]  Who have their child kidnapping rings
[35:12.560 --> 35:13.560]  Their kidnapped women
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.560]  Their pleasure palaces
[35:15.560 --> 35:17.560]  Their attacks on Christians
[35:17.560 --> 35:18.560]  Their hatred of Israel
[35:18.560 --> 35:19.560]  The list goes on and on
[35:19.560 --> 35:22.560]  But they're our big ally
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.560]  Now Saudi Arabia
[35:24.560 --> 35:25.560]  It's now admitted
[35:25.560 --> 35:26.560]  We told you this a month ago
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.560]  But it's now admitted is on record
[35:28.560 --> 35:29.560]  Financing through Egypt
[35:29.560 --> 35:31.560]  They had to get that ready first
[35:31.560 --> 35:34.560]  Weapons and rebels going into eastern Libya
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.560]  To attack Muammar Qaddafi
[35:37.560 --> 35:42.560]  Okay, so all of that is going on
[35:42.560 --> 35:49.560]  And we wrote the story
[35:49.560 --> 35:52.560]  U.S. government backs Libyan Al Qaeda
[35:52.560 --> 35:54.560]  While hyping terror attack inside the U.S.
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.560]  Our government thinks you're so stupid
[35:57.560 --> 36:01.560]  That four years ago George W. Bush
[36:01.560 --> 36:03.560]  At winehouse.gov put out a press release
[36:03.560 --> 36:05.560]  We covered at the time saying
[36:05.560 --> 36:09.560]  The U.S. is backing four rebel groups out of Iraq
[36:09.560 --> 36:11.560]  E&I ran to try to overthrow the country
[36:11.560 --> 36:16.560]  Three of the four were admittedly Al Qaeda
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.560]  The number one group was headed by
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.560]  The number two guy in Al Qaeda
[36:20.560 --> 36:22.560]  Just like Anwar al-Laki
[36:22.560 --> 36:25.560]  Fox News and AP reported six months ago
[36:25.560 --> 36:26.560]  You can just search
[36:26.560 --> 36:28.560]  Anwar al-Laki dined secretly at Pentagon
[36:28.560 --> 36:30.560]  Two months after 9-11
[36:30.560 --> 36:31.560]  These guys work for the people
[36:31.560 --> 36:33.560]  That have hijacked our country
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.560]  So get this straight
[36:34.560 --> 36:36.560]  Qaddafi is when he comes out
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.560]  And says the western terrorist
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.560]  They're bringing Al Qaeda in
[36:40.560 --> 36:43.560]  This is admitted
[36:43.560 --> 36:45.560]  They are the radical Muslim brigade
[36:45.560 --> 36:48.560]  Used to overthrow countries
[36:48.560 --> 36:49.560]  Now here's the one in telegraph
[36:49.560 --> 36:50.560]  Headlined today
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.560]  In case you're doubting me
[36:51.560 --> 36:54.560]  Libya, the west and Al Qaeda
[36:54.560 --> 36:55.560]  Are on the same side
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.560]  CNN has a similar headline
[36:57.560 --> 36:59.560]  Statements of support for Libya's
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.560]  Revolution by Al Qaeda
[37:00.560 --> 37:02.560]  And leading Islamist
[37:02.560 --> 37:04.560]  Have led to fears that military action
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.560]  By the west might be playing into the
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.560]  Hands of its ideological enemies
[37:08.560 --> 37:11.560]  It is not their ideological enemies
[37:11.560 --> 37:12.560]  In fact scroll down on that article
[37:12.560 --> 37:14.560]  Actually click on the one in telegraph
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.560]  So folks can see the photo
[37:16.560 --> 37:19.560]  Of the Al Qaeda operative in Benghazi
[37:19.560 --> 37:21.560]  People are like what do you mean
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.560]  Al Qaeda works for the west
[37:22.560 --> 37:24.560]  Study the history
[37:24.560 --> 37:25.560]  No one could believe this
[37:25.560 --> 37:27.560]  Because it's so brazen
[37:27.560 --> 37:28.560]  And so in your face
[37:28.560 --> 37:29.560]  But our article
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.560]  At infowords.com
[37:31.560 --> 37:32.560]  And prisonplanet.com
[37:32.560 --> 37:34.560]  By Paul Watson
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.560]  Breaks it down
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.560]  US government backs
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.560]  Libyan Al Qaeda
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.560]  While hyping terror attacks
[37:42.560 --> 37:43.560]  Inside the US
[37:43.560 --> 37:46.560]  And that's the next big issue
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.560]  Simultaneously as we said
[37:48.560 --> 37:50.560]  Three weeks ago
[37:50.560 --> 37:51.560]  Western media is saying
[37:51.560 --> 37:53.560]  Terrorists are set to strike Europe
[37:53.560 --> 37:54.560]  In the US
[37:54.560 --> 37:56.560]  Because Qaddafi is going to authorize them
[37:56.560 --> 37:58.560]  And they're Al Qaeda
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.560]  When Qaddafi is openly fighting Al Qaeda
[38:01.560 --> 38:03.560]  Out of Egypt and Saudi Arabia
[38:03.560 --> 38:05.560]  That's not debated
[38:05.560 --> 38:07.560]  Meanwhile Al Qaeda is being used
[38:07.560 --> 38:09.560]  Against Iran that is Shiite
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.560]  Al Qaeda is Sunni
[38:11.560 --> 38:13.560]  Which is 80% of the Muslim faith
[38:13.560 --> 38:15.560]  Out of Saudi Arabia
[38:15.560 --> 38:17.560]  Do you realize how dumb they think
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.560]  You are
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.560]  Do you realize how stupid they think you are
[38:20.560 --> 38:22.560]  Do you realize how they do this
[38:22.560 --> 38:25.560]  Brazenly in front of everyone
[38:25.560 --> 38:28.560]  I'm no fan of Qaddafi
[38:28.560 --> 38:30.560]  But I'm also an even bigger enemy
[38:30.560 --> 38:32.560]  Of globalist controlled Al Qaeda
[38:32.560 --> 38:34.560]  Many of the young Arabs that are part of Al Qaeda
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.560]  Are useful idiots who don't even know
[38:36.560 --> 38:38.560]  They're working for the West
[38:38.560 --> 38:40.560]  This is how the military industrial complex
[38:40.560 --> 38:41.560]  Takes over America
[38:41.560 --> 38:43.560]  It's how the European military industrial complex
[38:43.560 --> 38:44.560]  Takes over Europe
[38:44.560 --> 38:46.560]  This is how they put TSA on the streets
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.560]  This is how they put slave training
[38:49.560 --> 38:51.560]  In the airports to condition you
[38:51.560 --> 38:52.560]  To give up your rights
[38:52.560 --> 38:54.560]  This is how they set up the threat fusion centers
[38:54.560 --> 38:56.560]  Al Qaeda
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.560]  All over mainstream news
[38:58.560 --> 39:01.560]  Is admittedly battling against
[39:01.560 --> 39:02.560]  Muammar Qaddafi
[39:02.560 --> 39:03.560]  Choose
[39:03.560 --> 39:05.560]  Are you with Qaddafi
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.560]  Or are you with Al Qaeda
[39:06.560 --> 39:08.560]  I'm with none of them
[39:08.560 --> 39:10.560]  But those of you cheering
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.560]  This attack on Qaddafi
[39:12.560 --> 39:15.560]  You are cheering Al Qaeda
[39:15.560 --> 39:18.560]  For a period out of Saudi Arabia
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.560]  This is outrageous
[39:20.560 --> 39:22.560]  I'd actually cheer Saudi Arabia falling
[39:22.560 --> 39:23.560]  I'll just be honest with you
[39:23.560 --> 39:25.560]  They are so much more evil than Qaddafi
[39:25.560 --> 39:27.560]  He's a smaller demon
[39:27.560 --> 39:28.560]  See, government's corrupt
[39:28.560 --> 39:30.560]  Is the founding fathers taught
[39:30.560 --> 39:32.560]  It isn't just Qaddafi bad
[39:32.560 --> 39:33.560]  U.S. good
[39:33.560 --> 39:36.560]  No, it's U.S. controlled by foreign banks
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.560]  Qaddafi bad
[39:37.560 --> 39:39.560]  People that run the U.S. bad
[39:39.560 --> 39:40.560]  Now
[39:42.560 --> 39:44.560]  This is all about oil
[39:44.560 --> 39:46.560]  And we're now been committed
[39:46.560 --> 39:48.560]  And our tax money committed to this
[39:48.560 --> 39:51.560]  And the U.N. passed the resolution
[39:51.560 --> 39:53.560]  Congress wasn't involved
[39:53.560 --> 39:55.560]  Speaker of the House Boehner
[39:55.560 --> 39:56.560]  I got a committee
[39:56.560 --> 39:57.560]  Miss Gone Public
[39:57.560 --> 39:58.560]  And pointed this out
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.560]  And said
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.560]  You got to define the mission
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.560]  We've got to vote for this
[40:01.560 --> 40:03.560]  What are you doing
[40:03.560 --> 40:05.560]  The president under the Constitution
[40:05.560 --> 40:06.560]  Can't do these things
[40:06.560 --> 40:07.560]  But since World War II
[40:07.560 --> 40:09.560]  In Korea, Vietnam
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.560]  And countless other wars
[40:11.560 --> 40:12.560]  Like Desert Storm
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.560]  The invasion in 2003
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.560]  It happens
[40:15.560 --> 40:17.560]  Via the United Nations
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.560]  So you might as well
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  Just get rid of the American flag
[40:19.560 --> 40:21.560]  And have the U.N. up there
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.560]  So that's going on
[40:23.560 --> 40:24.560]  And you've got Obama saying
[40:24.560 --> 40:27.560]  Any time rebels rebel
[40:27.560 --> 40:28.560]  And get crushed
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.560]  We've got to invade
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.560]  That's the new world order
[40:31.560 --> 40:32.560]  Globalist model
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.560]  They finance the rebels
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.560]  Whether it's good, bad, or indifferent
[40:35.560 --> 40:36.560]  Good, bad, or ugly
[40:36.560 --> 40:37.560]  Whether it's a good country
[40:37.560 --> 40:38.560]  Or a bad country
[40:38.560 --> 40:39.560]  What's going to happen
[40:39.560 --> 40:41.560]  When 70 to 80 million
[40:41.560 --> 40:44.560]  What is it, 76 million Iranians
[40:44.560 --> 40:45.560]  The globalist two years ago
[40:45.560 --> 40:46.560]  Already tried to finance
[40:46.560 --> 40:47.560]  An overthrow there
[40:47.560 --> 40:48.560]  What's going to happen
[40:48.560 --> 40:50.560]  When they rise up again
[40:50.560 --> 40:52.560]  Against that corrupt system
[40:52.560 --> 40:53.560]  And then our government
[40:53.560 --> 40:54.560]  Is going to say
[40:54.560 --> 40:55.560]  Well, the U.N. says
[40:55.560 --> 40:57.560]  We've got to bombard Iran
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.560]  Just like what happened
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.560]  With Serbia when they had
[40:59.560 --> 41:01.560]  The Muslims out of Albania
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.560]  Run by Al-Qaeda
[41:02.560 --> 41:03.560]  Attacked the Serbs
[41:03.560 --> 41:04.560]  Not that the Serbs were good
[41:04.560 --> 41:06.560]  But is Al-Qaeda good?
[41:06.560 --> 41:07.560]  This is about
[41:07.560 --> 41:08.560]  Taking control of regions
[41:08.560 --> 41:10.560]  They stole one third of Serbia
[41:10.560 --> 41:11.560]  That had been in their hands
[41:11.560 --> 41:12.560]  For a thousand years
[41:12.560 --> 41:14.560]  They defeated the Muslims
[41:14.560 --> 41:15.560]  In the Crusades
[41:15.560 --> 41:16.560]  Three times
[41:16.560 --> 41:18.560]  Three times in Kosovo
[41:18.560 --> 41:20.560]  They handed it over to the Muslims
[41:20.560 --> 41:22.560]  Don't tell me we're fighting
[41:22.560 --> 41:23.560]  Muslims all day
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.560]  When the globalists
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.560]  Control the Muslims
[41:26.560 --> 41:27.560]  Now the Muslim Brotherhood
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.560]  For a week back these attacks
[41:29.560 --> 41:30.560]  The Muslim Brotherhood
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.560]  Has now come out
[41:31.560 --> 41:32.560]  Arab League split
[41:32.560 --> 41:34.560]  From west over Libya bombing
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.560]  So now there's a split there
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.560]  We can't pay for this
[41:39.560 --> 41:40.560]  I want it
[41:40.560 --> 41:41.560]  We're about to go out to break
[41:41.560 --> 41:42.560]  But I want to play George Galloway
[41:42.560 --> 41:43.560]  Member of British Parliament
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.560]  The whole four-minute clips
[41:44.560 --> 41:46.560]  Up on infowars.com
[41:46.560 --> 41:48.560]  George Galloway on Sky Television
[41:48.560 --> 41:50.560]  That's Fox in England
[41:50.560 --> 41:52.560]  Rupert Murdoch owns it
[41:52.560 --> 41:53.560]  Telling the truth
[41:53.560 --> 41:55.560]  This is the truth
[41:55.560 --> 41:56.560]  Here it is
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.560]  Beauty to stop a humanitarian crisis
[41:58.560 --> 41:59.560]  From unfolding
[41:59.560 --> 42:00.560]  Do you agree with them?
[42:00.560 --> 42:01.560]  Well, it's the double standards
[42:01.560 --> 42:02.560]  That get me
[42:02.560 --> 42:04.560]  There's more people being
[42:04.560 --> 42:05.560]  Gunned down
[42:05.560 --> 42:06.560]  Innocent protesters
[42:06.560 --> 42:08.560]  In Yemen, for example
[42:08.560 --> 42:09.560]  And no one would dream
[42:09.560 --> 42:11.560]  Of invading or imposing
[42:11.560 --> 42:13.560]  A no-fly zone on Yemen
[42:13.560 --> 42:15.560]  Because Yemen doesn't have oil
[42:15.560 --> 42:17.560]  It's so transparently an attempt
[42:17.560 --> 42:19.560]  To protect British companies
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.560]  And other Western companies
[42:21.560 --> 42:23.560]  Massive investments in Libya
[42:23.560 --> 42:25.560]  That it is discredited
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.560]  In the Arab world
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.560]  I saw your package
[42:28.560 --> 42:30.560]  Saying there are Arab representatives
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.560]  At this meeting
[42:31.560 --> 42:33.560]  Who are these Arab representatives?
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.560]  They can't even name themselves
[42:35.560 --> 42:37.560]  All the countries that they come from
[42:37.560 --> 42:39.560]  But we know that the Arab League came out publicly
[42:39.560 --> 42:41.560]  And that's the UN resolution
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.560]  But the Arab League is a collection of dictatorship
[42:43.560 --> 42:45.560]  So we shouldn't be dealing with Arab nations
[42:45.560 --> 42:47.560]  But don't pray them in aid
[42:47.560 --> 42:49.560]  Of an operation
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.560]  That's supposed to be
[42:50.560 --> 42:52.560]  Standing up for human rights and democracy
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.560]  The Arab League, without exception
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.560]  All right, we're going to come back
[42:57.560 --> 42:58.560]  And finish up this clip
[42:58.560 --> 43:08.560]  Stay with us
[43:29.560 --> 43:32.560]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[43:32.560 --> 43:34.560]  Where you need it most
[43:34.560 --> 43:36.560]  Blue diamond gussets
[43:36.560 --> 43:39.560]  Got it, others don't
[43:39.560 --> 43:41.560]  We turned jeans inside out
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.560]  Diamond gusset jeans
[43:43.560 --> 43:46.560]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[43:46.560 --> 43:48.560]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine
[43:48.560 --> 43:50.560]  Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[43:50.560 --> 43:52.560]  So you can ride all day with confidence
[43:52.560 --> 43:55.560]  Order yours at gusset.com
[43:55.560 --> 43:57.560]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it
[43:57.560 --> 43:59.560]  Others don't
[44:28.560 --> 44:29.560]  Number four
[44:29.560 --> 44:31.560]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[44:31.560 --> 44:33.560]  Every year, thousands of families
[44:33.560 --> 44:35.560]  Lose their power from weather-related onages
[44:35.560 --> 44:36.560]  Number five

[45:57.560 --> 45:59.560]  Thank you
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[46:04.560 --> 46:07.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[46:09.560 --> 46:12.560]  We'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[46:12.560 --> 46:16.560]  We've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[46:16.560 --> 46:18.560]  And they really are calling the shots
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[46:23.560 --> 46:27.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[46:27.560 --> 46:29.560]  The criminal offshore cartel
[46:29.560 --> 46:31.560]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.560]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[46:34.560 --> 46:36.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.560]  They're asking for more matches
[46:38.560 --> 46:40.560]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[46:40.560 --> 46:42.560]  Today seems like nobody does care
[46:42.560 --> 46:44.560]  And right now in Washington DC
[46:44.560 --> 46:47.560]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[46:47.560 --> 46:52.560]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[46:52.560 --> 46:54.560]  We're watching online right now
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.560]  In super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[47:00.560 --> 47:04.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:10.560 --> 47:13.560]  From the front lines of the Information War
[47:13.560 --> 47:18.560]  It's Alex Jones
[47:18.560 --> 47:23.560]  So many Americans, many Europeans think it's like a sport or something
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.560]  To see shock and awe in major cities in Libya being bombed
[47:28.560 --> 47:31.560]  And confirm reports of civilian deaths
[47:31.560 --> 47:39.560]  When our own government has a thousand plus drones operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan
[47:39.560 --> 47:47.560]  Then it's humanitarian, though they admit, oh, if we kill 200 people to kill one terrorist at a wedding or at a market, it's okay
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.560]  But then they tell us a month ago that Gaddafi might have strafed crowds
[47:52.560 --> 47:54.560]  Turned out that wasn't true
[47:54.560 --> 47:57.560]  We've got to do something right now
[47:57.560 --> 48:00.560]  Or if he goes after protesters, we've got to do something right now
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.560]  But when Communist China, machine guns protesters on a routine basis
[48:05.560 --> 48:08.560]  Going back decades ago to Tiananmen Square
[48:08.560 --> 48:10.560]  Oh, we're going to step back from that
[48:10.560 --> 48:17.560]  So what's being said here is the globalists can go in and finance an attempted overthrow of a country
[48:17.560 --> 48:25.560]  And then if the rebels don't win, the United Nations will have a ruling
[48:25.560 --> 48:29.560]  Or will come out with an announcement
[48:29.560 --> 48:40.560]  And say that, well, we've got to have a no-fly zone, which is really a bombing campaign with U.S. amphibious Marine Corps ships off the shore
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.560]  With open talks about ground invasions, even though Obama is lying about that
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.560]  And then meanwhile, I have the London Telegraph, I have CNN
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.560]  No one is denying that al-Qaeda, out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.560]  Those are the Muslim extremists who don't want a secular government in charge
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.560]  Who Qaddafi doesn't like
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.560]  Libya, the West and al-Qaeda are on the same side
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.560]  Statements of support for Libya's revolution by al-Qaeda
[49:06.560 --> 49:14.560]  And leading Islamists have led to fears that military action by the West might be playing into the hands of its ideological enemies
[49:14.560 --> 49:21.560]  And it goes on to report that it's confirmed that al-Qaeda is operating inside the country
[49:21.560 --> 49:27.560]  And that's who's trying to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi
[49:27.560 --> 49:35.560]  Let's finish up with George Galloway, member of the British Parliament on Sky Television, slash Fox, in England
[49:35.560 --> 49:44.560]  Telling it like it is about the hypocrisy in Bahrain and Yemen and Afghanistan, where they machine-gun protesters
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.560]  There's video of this all over the place, is there a call to invade them?
[49:48.560 --> 49:51.560]  No, because it's about oil, let's play the clip
[50:18.560 --> 50:24.560]  We're standing by, but we are standing by watching the Yemen President killing his people
[50:24.560 --> 50:29.560]  We're standing by watching the Bahrain King killing his people
[50:29.560 --> 50:32.560]  So what's the difference between them and Libya?
[50:32.560 --> 50:38.560]  Everyone watching this knows the difference, there's a dirty little three-letter word called oil
[50:38.560 --> 50:40.560]  So let's not pretend it's about anything
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.560]  Libya only produces 2% of the world's oil, it's not a big deal
[50:43.560 --> 50:50.560]  BP has 15 billion pounds worth of investments, billion pounds worth of investments in Libya
[50:50.560 --> 50:53.560]  So don't pretend it's not a big deal
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.560]  The truth is that we're not intervening in these other revolutions
[50:57.560 --> 51:00.560]  But we are intervening in this for our own selfish interests
[51:00.560 --> 51:02.560]  Now, that has two consequences
[51:02.560 --> 51:07.560]  First of all, it generates more hatred and enmity against us around the world
[51:07.560 --> 51:16.560]  And we will see that, believe me, Gaddafi, brute, armed brute and buttressed brute by us and other Western countries
[51:16.560 --> 51:19.560]  Is not going to be any kind of blamange
[51:19.560 --> 51:25.560]  This is going to be a hotly contested military contest and it will be contested not just in Libya
[51:25.560 --> 51:32.560]  We're generating hatred for ourselves, terrorism, terrorist attacks all over the world against our interests
[51:32.560 --> 51:34.560]  Why? For the oil companies?
[51:34.560 --> 51:38.560]  So you think that will happen because we have had threats from a kind of a spokesman
[51:38.560 --> 51:44.560]  Gaddafi has a long record, he has a long record of being involved in international terrorism
[51:44.560 --> 51:47.560]  He certainly does, some of the actual real terrorism
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.560]  But isn't that perfect? Remember, in the last six months, I've read the White House memos
[51:51.560 --> 51:54.560]  The White House advisors, Glenn Beck picked up on it
[51:54.560 --> 51:58.560]  Saying a 9-11-style attack would help us take Americans' liberties
[51:58.560 --> 52:01.560]  It would help boost Obama's approval ratings
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.560]  And so they go into a country with a guy with all these weapons
[52:05.560 --> 52:11.560]  They bring an al-Qaeda to go after the socialist Muslim that is Muammar Gaddafi
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.560]  They attack him, he's got all these missiles, all this nerve gas, all these weapons
[52:16.560 --> 52:18.560]  And so they won't have to stage a terror attack
[52:18.560 --> 52:23.560]  He will attack, there's a good chance of it, and then they'll take our freedoms
[52:23.560 --> 52:26.560]  And it will boost Obama's approval rating
[52:26.560 --> 52:31.560]  So that is the truth of what's going on and what's being said here
[52:31.560 --> 52:37.560]  Domestic organizations, domestic groups all over Western Europe, the United States, Canada
[52:37.560 --> 52:42.560]  That Gaddafi has funded previously may now launch terror attacks
[52:42.560 --> 52:46.560]  And that is exactly what the White House memos say they want
[52:46.560 --> 52:50.560]  Just like Governor Ridge, the former head of Homeland Security wrote a book two years ago
[52:50.560 --> 52:54.560]  Saying that the White House ordered him to issue fake terror alerts
[52:54.560 --> 52:57.560]  For political gain
[52:57.560 --> 53:00.560]  We've got to get complex here, we've got to see the big picture
[53:00.560 --> 53:02.560]  And understand what's going on
[53:02.560 --> 53:06.560]  And understand this is, we told you five months ago in October
[53:06.560 --> 53:09.560]  With our oil company, Exact Connections, through Lindsey Williams
[53:09.560 --> 53:12.560]  That there would be a destabilization in the Middle East, you're now seeing it
[53:12.560 --> 53:14.560]  That there would be calls for the end of the dollar
[53:14.560 --> 53:17.560]  Now with the U.S. government going along with it
[53:17.560 --> 53:19.560]  This is about global government
[53:19.560 --> 53:24.560]  And the U.N. being able to pass a resolution Friday
[53:24.560 --> 53:31.560]  And within 24 hours, our own government going along with the U.N. attack on Libya
[53:31.560 --> 53:36.560]  And putting Marine Corps ships off the coast that they told us a month ago
[53:36.560 --> 53:39.560]  Might have been for Egypt, now we learn what it was really for
[53:39.560 --> 53:43.560]  Now, I want to go to a clip of Lewis Farrakhan, a guy I don't agree with on a lot of issues
[53:43.560 --> 53:46.560]  And the media then will play it up that he's against the attack
[53:46.560 --> 53:49.560]  But he makes the points about hypocrisy
[53:49.560 --> 53:53.560]  Then we'll play a clip of President Obama from Friday
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.560]  And listen to the hypocrisy
[53:55.560 --> 53:59.560]  He says, anytime there's demonstrators, you don't have a right to even beat them up
[53:59.560 --> 54:00.560]  Or we will invade you
[54:00.560 --> 54:04.560]  What happens the next time the cops are ordered to beat protesters up here
[54:04.560 --> 54:06.560]  Let's go ahead and play that clip
[54:06.560 --> 54:11.560]  Legs, don't tell me and wise black people or white people
[54:11.560 --> 54:14.560]  That you're interested in black suffering
[54:14.560 --> 54:17.560]  Where were you in Rwanda?
[54:17.560 --> 54:20.560]  Where are you in the Congo?
[54:20.560 --> 54:23.560]  Why did you go to Darfur?
[54:23.560 --> 54:26.560]  Because oil is there
[54:26.560 --> 54:30.560]  No, you don't want to save the Libyan people
[54:30.560 --> 54:35.560]  That's your noble motive to hide your wicked agenda
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.560]  Now, I want to warn you in the name of Allah
[54:39.560 --> 54:44.560]  That this is more complex than what you think
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.560]  Go into Libya if you want to
[54:47.560 --> 54:53.560]  The Libyans do not want foreign occupation on their land
[54:53.560 --> 54:57.560]  And when you make that kind of move, if you're not careful
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.560]  You'll unite the Libyan people against you
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.560]  And again, Gaddafi wasn't sitting in any tent
[55:06.560 --> 55:10.560]  Twiddling his thumbs over these last 10 years
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.560]  This man has been investing in African development
[55:14.560 --> 55:17.560]  This man has been moving throughout Africa
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.560]  This man has friends all over the world
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.560]  He may not be your friend
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.560]  But if you take him out and kill him
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.560]  Like he's some rotten fella that wants to kill his own people
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.560]  What did you do in Waco?
[55:36.560 --> 55:40.560]  What did you do when your people rose up?
[55:40.560 --> 55:42.560]  Did you talk them out of it?
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.560]  No, they had weapons, you bombed them
[55:46.560 --> 55:51.560]  What did you do in Philadelphia with the move movement?
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.560]  Did you talk them out of their home or did you bomb them?
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.560]  We didn't hear any outcry from you religious hypocrites
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.560]  That love the lives of human beings
[56:03.560 --> 56:06.560]  You're a liar and a hypocrite
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.560]  And I warn my brother, don't you let these wicked demons
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.560]  Move you in a direction that will absolutely ruin your future
[56:16.560 --> 56:19.560]  With your people in Africa and throughout the world
[56:19.560 --> 56:22.560]  They don't like the way you handle Mubarak
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.560]  They don't like the way you're handling the situation in the Arab world
[56:26.560 --> 56:34.560]  So I would advise you to be careful and move with wisdom and skill
[56:34.560 --> 56:40.560]  My advice would be, why don't you organize a group of...
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.560]  The full clips up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.560]  He goes on to say that the white militia in the U.S. is on the verge of rising up
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.560]  What will you do when that happens? Obama now pushing more, gun grabbing
[56:52.560 --> 56:56.560]  But here's Gaddafi, New York Times, Gaddafi pledges long war
[56:56.560 --> 56:59.560]  As allies pursue air assault on Libya
[56:59.560 --> 57:05.560]  Libya has now given out one million weapons to one million people to resist
[57:05.560 --> 57:08.560]  And the news is coming out that it is unifying Libya
[57:08.560 --> 57:14.560]  The small British special forces NATO back force has been defeated
[57:14.560 --> 57:20.560]  The U.S. Marines are wading off the shore of a country of tens of millions of people
[57:20.560 --> 57:28.560]  Who've been handed weapons and they're preparing to go in to aid the al-Qaeda-backed Saudi Arabian terrorists
[57:28.560 --> 57:31.560]  We told you about this in October that it was coming
[57:31.560 --> 57:36.560]  So all of this is unfolding and they've set the precedent with the globalist bankers
[57:36.560 --> 57:39.560]  Fund rebels to try to overthrow a government when they fail
[57:39.560 --> 57:43.560]  Then we've got to invade whether it's Iran, Saudi Arabia, you name it
[57:43.560 --> 57:51.560]  And it's all under the UN, world government
[57:51.560 --> 57:58.560]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide
[57:58.560 --> 58:01.560]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States
[58:01.560 --> 58:06.560]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February
[58:06.560 --> 58:10.560]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon
[58:10.560 --> 58:14.560]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans
[58:14.560 --> 58:18.560]  With an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days
[58:18.560 --> 58:20.560]  Move quickly while you can still afford it
[58:20.560 --> 58:23.560]  And E-Foods Direct will pay your shipping costs for you

[58:49.560 --> 58:58.560]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[58:58.560 --> 59:00.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.560]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[59:05.560 --> 59:08.560]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[59:08.560 --> 59:11.560]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[59:11.560 --> 59:13.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.560]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties
[59:17.560 --> 59:20.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[59:20.560 --> 59:23.560]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[59:23.560 --> 59:26.560]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[59:26.560 --> 59:28.560]  And it's a real eye-opener
[59:28.560 --> 59:32.560]  I can't stress this enough, you should at least watch this free video online today
[59:32.560 --> 59:36.560]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[59:36.560 --> 59:41.560]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[59:41.560 --> 59:43.560]  That's End of America, the number 3.com

[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.560]  Now I've made many of my points about Gaddafi
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.560]  I'm going to come back and play the Obama clip that is rife with hypocrisy
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.560]  In the next segment, we'll take calls specifically on Libya
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.560]  And this destabilization campaign in North Africa
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.560]  Standing in the Middle East, the incredible hypocrisy, al-Qaeda
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.560]  Openly aiding these attacks on Gaddafi
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.560]  One group of demons against another demon
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.560]  But compared to the globalist who are running the whole world
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  And mopping up the final few countries they don't control
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.560]  Gaddafi is nothing
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.560]  He wouldn't allow abortion, he wouldn't allow the vaccines filled with poison
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560]  He wouldn't go along with the globalist
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560]  He talked about 9-11 being an inside job
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.560]  He's not perfect, he's certainly bad news in many respects
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.560]  I don't like tyrants
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.560]  But he's a tyrant the globalist didn't control
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.560]  So they're going after him
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.560]  877-789-ALEX
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.560]  Use the number for you to join us
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  And to give us your take on what's happening
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.560]  Then coming up, wind's threatened to steer more radiation towards Tokyo
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560]  AccuWeather
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.560]  Chernobyl's solution may be last resort for Japan reactors
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.560]  Reduced pressure at Fukushima reactor indicates possible leakage
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.560]  That is just some of the news
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.560]  Japan molds ban on Fukushima food and products
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.560]  Tokyo water supply shows radioactive iodine, government
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560]  That's what you take potassium iodine for
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.560]  Japan crisis forces rethink of nuclear option
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.560]  Worried Californians purchase gas mass chemical suits
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.560]  Here are the downstream effects from the Fukushima catastrophe
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.560]  More radiation coming our way
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.560]  The miracle tale of survival, grandmother and boy pulled from rubble
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.560]  9 days after Tsunami smashed city
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:27.560]  The amount of radioactive fuel at Fukushima dwarfs Chernobyl
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.560]  Some progress seen in Japan's nuclear crisis
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.560]  That is all coming up today
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:43.560]  But first we're going to take your phone calls at 877-789-ALEX
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.560]  And they've hung a photo of David Rockefeller up there
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.560]  So I can't see the numeric calculation of Alex
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560]  But you can figure that out on your touch tone key there
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.560]  But we do want to hear from all of you here live on air
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.560]  777-789-2539-877-789-8539
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.560]  We'll get you up and on the air
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.560]  But this is about global empire invading sovereign country
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.560]  And giving you a bunch of hype about how they care about humanitarian reasons
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.560]  The globalist put dictators in when they control them
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.560]  They hate liberty, they hate freedom
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.560]  And that's what's going on, that's what's happening here
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:32.560]  And it is outrageous, this is the liberal version of imperialism
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.560]  Just like we saw in Serbia, again using radical Muslims as the pretext to overthrow their enemies
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.560]  Then they'll set up the new radical Muslim group as the new enemy
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.560]  Because they need enemies in this multi-trillion dollar a year U.S. defense budget alone
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.560]  These are the bankers that perch on top of our republic
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.560]  And that are sucking our blood out and stealing the death benefits of our troops
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560]  And trying to make them buy their own insurance
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.560]  They don't care about the country, they don't care about the people
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:08.560]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls again on the other side of this quick break
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.560]  And then we're going to continue into the situation at Fukushima
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  They know it's invisible radiation now hitting the west coast
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.560]  They can whitewash it, they can cover it up, they're saying a doubling in radiation is safe
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.560]  That's the general background, just what's in the air
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  But it's little particles floating over from Japan
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.560]  Themselves that are highly radioactive that get into your lungs
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.560]  Then you get cancer 5, 10, 20 years down the road
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.560]  That's the big issue that we're discussing the websites areinfowars.com
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.560]  PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.560]  We're going to take your calls and break it all down on the other side of this quick break
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.560]  This is the GCN Radio Network GCNLive.com
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.560]  We are now into the second hour
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560]  Thank you so much for joining us on the Sunday
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:20.560]  We're not talking about the NCAA
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:34.560]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.560]  One to two month soap sampler, thank you
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:34.560]  We are live now into the second hour
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]  I'm Alex Jones, your host
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.560]  Websites areinfowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.560]  Again, I'm crying no tears for Mu Mark Adafi
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.560]  A 40 plus year dictator
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560]  But the globalist, even in the London Telegraph and CNN
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.560]  Admit that Al Qaeda, Sunnis, out of Saudi Arabia
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.560]  Are there trying to overthrow this government
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.560]  It is absolutely amazing to see this happening
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.560]  And Qaddafi is ordering millions of firearms handed out to the public
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560]  Notice as a dictator he didn't want that before
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.560]  But now he wants it
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.560]  And they are lying to the public saying there won't be an invasion that is in the wings
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.560]  They don't have two giant amphibious attack ships
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.560]  Two huge Marine Corps aircraft carriers
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.560]  They have little stubby ones like the Coronado and others
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.560]  Off the shore to play tiddlywinks
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.560]  And a lot of people cheer and yell and love new wars
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.560]  You're paying for it, America's bankrupt
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.560]  Don't forget that
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.560]  Now, I'm going to go to Kevin, Levi, and others that are patiently holding
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.560]  But first I want to play, it's a nine minute statement from Friday
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.560]  The incredible hypocrisy of Obama
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.560]  He went to Brazil and they fired rubber bullets and tear gas at people protesting
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.560]  All over the US, they deny protests without permits
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:59.560]  All over the world, Bahrain, Yemen, fire real lead bullets and kill peaceful protesters
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.560]  But those are globalist allies
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.560]  They lied about him strafing populations
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.560]  They lied about him Qaddafi running to Venezuela
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.560]  These are lies
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.560]  Normal rebels, normal protesters don't have their own fighter aircraft and tanks
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.560]  This is admittedly now western backed
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.560]  Because their rebels failed
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.560]  Like the Bay of Pigs against Castro in 61
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.560]  The West is now going in to get that oil
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.560]  And to further their destabilization program
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:35.560]  And to set the precedent that the United Nations creates a order
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.560]  A resolution the US, NATO, and Europe follow those orders
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.560]  So next time there's a protest in another country
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.560]  Whether it's Saudi Arabia, whether it's Iran
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  Then we've got to invade that as well
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.560]  This is about empire by the global corporations
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.560]  Let's play Obama the hypocrite, here it is
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.560]  Good afternoon everybody
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.560]  I want to take this opportunity to update the American people about the situation in Libya
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:10.560]  Over the last several weeks, the world has watched events unfold in Libya with hope and alarm
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.560]  Last month protesters took to the streets across the country to demand their universal rights
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.560]  The poor protesters, the machine gun
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.560]  That is accountable to them and responsive to their aspirations
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560]  I thought our government wasn't accountable
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.560]  And they were met with an iron fist
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.560]  Within days, whole parts of the country declared their independence from brutal regime
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.560]  And members of the government, serving in Libya and abroad, chose to align themselves with the forces of change
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.560]  Let's stop there
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.560]  Back it up a few seconds
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.560]  Oh, you mean six years ago when the West made a deal with Qaddafi, a peace treaty
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.560]  And they started training his military, you mean all the military
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.560]  They trained his double agents to try to overthrow it
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.560]  Again, you're being lied to about why this is happening
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.560]  You're being lied to
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.560]  Who cares what happens to Qaddafi?
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560]  Good or bad, I don't care
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:07.560]  The issue is, this is about world government and the UN calling the shots and ordering America around and telling us what to do
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.560]  Continue with Barry Sitaro, a.k.a. Barack Obama
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.560]  Of change
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:20.560]  Marmar Qaddafi clearly lost the confidence of his own people and the legitimacy to lead
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.560]  Instead of respecting the rights of his own people
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.560]  Qaddafi chose the path of brutal suppression
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.560]  Hit pause
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.560]  You know, there have been UN reports put out that the 30 million illegal aliens in this country
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.560]  Who believe that this country belongs to Mexico, the Southwest does, Oslin, LaRica, and Quista match up
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.560]  That if they ever rebel, that the UN will be used in the Southwest
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.560]  By the way, a deal was signed just a few months ago
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:55.560]  The Ottawa Citizen in Canada reported about deals to use foreign troops in America during uprisings
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.560]  And what will the UN do? Come in like it did in Serbia?
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:05.560]  Because a group of Muslims to the south in Albania were attacking and carve off a third of the country for them
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.560]  But this time it'll be illegal aliens out of Mexico
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.560]  This is the precedent being set
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.560]  If a group rebels in a foreign sovereign country, that we're going to invade it
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560]  Continue
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.560]  Innocent civilians were beaten, imprisoned, and in some cases killed
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560]  Hit pause
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.560]  How many cops have shot people at protests? How many have been beaten?
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.560]  Does that mean a foreign government can start bombing the United States and invade?
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560]  Think about what's being set up
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:39.560]  He went on to speech yesterday and said that this is part of globalism, part of the march of the New World Order
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  Continue
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560]  These full protests were forcefully put down
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]  Like China?
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.560]  Hospitals were attacked
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560]  Like we did today?
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.560]  Disappeared
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.560]  A campaign of intimidation and repression began
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560]  Your rebels failed
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.560]  In the face of this injustice, the United States and the international community moved swiftly
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.560]  Sanctions were put in place by the United States and the allies and partners
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.560]  China every week or so has mass riots by farmers having their land taken by the communist government
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.560]  And they machine gun them
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.560]  And then they capture the others and execute them and sell their organs
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.560]  Are we going to invade China?
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.560]  Is all this humanitarian grandstanding
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.560]  While our bill of rights and constitution is being butchered
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]  Continue
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.560]  The UN Security Council imposed further sanctions
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560]  Yeah, the UN, our boss
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560]  An arms embargo
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.560]  And the specter of international accountability
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.560]  It's on record the EU, England, France, the US selling weapons to Qaddafi
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.560]  I mean, just search the term Hermann von Rumpi, EU head with Qaddafi
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560]  Go to Drudge Report right now
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]  It's Obama with Qaddafi
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.560]  They told him they were buddies
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.560]  It was only to get their spies in place for this overthrow
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560]  Continue
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560]  An arms embargo
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:59.560]  And the specter of international accountability for Qaddafi and those around him
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.560]  Humanitarian assistance was positioned on Libya's borders
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.560]  And those displaced by the violence received our help
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.560]  Hit pause
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.560]  Am?
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.560]  That's enough, I can't hear any more of him
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  Go to Whitehouse.gov to watch the whole nine minute diatribe of disinformation
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  It is on record a month ago that the US-British government lied
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560]  And said they were giving no aid to the rebels
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560]  Now they admit they ran the whole thing
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.560]  British special forces, NATO forces, US forces on the ground
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.560]  That's now admitted, all over the news
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.560]  With Sunni al Qaeda now pouring in out of Egypt from Saudi Arabia
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.560]  The point is Obama is lying to you there
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:47.560]  Kevin, Levi, Chris, Glenn, Graham, Thomas, Bill, Janice, Chad, Daniel, Kerry
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560]  We're going to get to all of you
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.560]  Kevin and Nebraska, you're on the air first
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  Alex, I have to thank you first for everything you've done for us
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.560]  And really helping the real Americans save our country
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.560]  Well this is all a giant UN beta test for taking over countries
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.560]  Anybody protest now the world government invades?
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  I really, I just have to thank you
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.560]  And I want to cut straight to the heart of the matter
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560]  Bill the Bird Group
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560]  I know the meeting is coming up
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560]  We believe it's April 8th through the 10th
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.560]  We're not sure, we need to confirm that date
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560]  It's generally in June, it's an early June
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.560]  Is it in June?
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.560]  We want to come and we just need to know when and where
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.560]  Well every year we find out where it is
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.560]  Sometimes only a week before Kevin, we'll try to find out
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560]  Is there any way that we can send you our e-mail
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560]  Or make sure that we get notified
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.560]  Well Kevin, you better believe it's going to be on infowars.com
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560]  Prismplanet.com, Drudge Now
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560]  For three years running, Kerry's our coverage
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560]  of Bilderberg
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.560]  So you better believe Kevin, we'll be there
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.560]  Levi and Georgia, Levi you're on the air
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.560]  Like how are you doing today?
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.560]  I'm going to get right to the subject I was calling about
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.560]  Because I know time is of essence here
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.560]  And you did mention this when you first came on the air today
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.560]  But a lot of people are right now concentrating on
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.560]  What's going on with the situation in Libyan, Japan
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560]  But as you're probably well aware of
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.560]  I would like for you to talk about the situation
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.560]  That just happened right here in the southeast
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.560]  In North Carolina with the conviction of Bernard Vaughan
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560]  Nothouse, the Liberty dollar
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.560]  I mentioned that at the first of the transmission
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.560]  We have Montana and North Carolina
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.560]  Moving to issue their own gold and silver currency
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.560]  Meanwhile, Nothouse for over 15 years
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560]  Issued his own gold and silver coins
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560]  Which anybody can legally do
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560]  We've got Ron Paul on about it
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.560]  They've now convicted him with a mentally disabled jury
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560]  Just like they arrest folks all the time
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.560]  For legal guns in their own house
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  Generally it's when the realtors come to your house
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.560]  And sell it, they see guns, you are arrested
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.560]  Guns are taken, no laws violated, they don't care
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.560]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.560]  Infuses the respiratory system
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.560]  With your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.560]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]  Of the Silver Lungs system
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.560]  And how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  Anywhere in or on the body
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.560]  My name is Mario Safaldi
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.560]  And I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.560]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560]  Endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]  It also comes equipped with the proper
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]  Applicators and devices needed
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560]  To deliver your silver solutions
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.560]  Directly to key target areas
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.560]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.560]  Topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  Of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.560]  To learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works

[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.560]  Any questions you may have

[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.560]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.560]  Number 1
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560]  Your electric bill
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560]  Number 2
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.560]  Our new energies are
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560]  Wants to control how much power
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560]  Your electric company allows you to have
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]  It's true
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.560]  Total government control of electricity
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.560]  Number 3
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560]  In some areas of the country
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.560]  Is only compounding the problem
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.560]  Number 4
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.560]  From weather-related onages
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560]  Number 5
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:40.560]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560]  And peace of mind
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.560]  One of my oldest sponsors

[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.560]  I'm looking for a factory
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.560]  Where a man can feed his family
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.560]  Not worried about them moving itself
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:26.560]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  I'm looking for America
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560]  Where American and B-Proud
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.560]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America

[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.560]  But I know in my heart it's still in place

[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.560]  Network
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.560]  It's really very simple
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.560]  America has been taken over by private corporate interest
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.560]  Whose GDP on average is bigger than major nations
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.560]  They have their own in private intelligence agencies
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.560]  They have their own lobbyist
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.560]  They come in and take over your nation
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.560]  They take control of the tax money and have it paid to themselves
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.560]  In corporate welfare and contracts
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.560]  They are now using another fake humanitarian lie
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.560]  Like Saddam throwing babies out of incubators
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.560]  To invade another country
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.560]  While backing Muslim nations that are shooting
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.560]  Their own protesters in the streets
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.560]  It is totally hypocritical
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.560]  It is a giant lie
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.560]  And the West on top of it sold almost all these weapons
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560]  That our troops will now face
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560]  That our fighter pilots and bomber pilots
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.560]  Now face against Muammar Gaddafi
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.560]  And you see the good old boys at gas stations
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.560]  That I saw last night high-fiving each other
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.560]  Woo-hoo, yeah, blow him up
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.560]  And all the civilian deaths
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.560]  Do you think the bankers care about you, buddy?
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.560]  There's a reason they're devaluing your dollar
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.560]  There's a reason they're raising all these new taxes
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560]  Because they know you're dumbed down
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560]  They know you're misinformed
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.560]  They know you're stupid
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.560]  You need to grow up and realize
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.560]  That George Washington had it right
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.560]  About not being involved in foreign entanglements
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.560]  I can't believe a whole other war has started
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  The West is clearly involved
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.560]  Trying to overthrow these countries
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.560]  This is global government with a UN-backed system
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.560]  Financing rebels who then attack the government
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.560]  If the government, good, bad or indifferent, fights back
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.560]  They're then called terrorists
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.560]  And the invasion is on under you in orders
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.560]  Chris in California, you're on the air
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560]  Alex, I love you
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.560]  And I'm going to get straight to the point
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.560]  I just want to mention that if you were to Google
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.560]  Harp Japan
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.560]  One of the top movies on YouTube that comes up
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.560]  Is by a fellow by the name of Benjamin Fulford
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.560]  And I think he's right on touch with you
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.560]  On everything that you guys talk about
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.560]  He's a former Forbes writer, had meetings with David Rockefeller
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.560]  And what is he saying about Harp?
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.560]  Well, he's actually the great-grandson
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.560]  Of George Taylor Fulford
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.560]  Whenever he died, he was a single, largest shareholder of GE
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.560]  And what he's saying is that he interviewed
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.560]  Heizel Takanaka, who at the time was a minister
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.560]  Of Foreign Affairs, or I'm sorry, a minister of
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.560]  Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.560]  And he said that if they did not give their economy
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.560]  Over to American and European oligarchs
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.560]  That there would be a weather weapon
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.560]  Well, for those that don't know, I don't know
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.560]  This was a weather weapon, but the former
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.560]  Secretary of Defense in 97, April 28th
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.560]  Issue of Army Times
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.560]  William Cohen said that the governments do have
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560]  Seismic tectonic weapons
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.560]  And we know Harp in Alaska is one of those systems
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.560]  So I appreciate your call
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560]  We'll look into getting Fulford on the broadcast
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.560]  Glenn in Florida, Glenn, you're on the air
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560]  God bless you, Alex
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.560]  We're only getting you, like, for an hour on the weekdays
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.560]  But I'd like to see if you could get that
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.560]  Well, what station do you listen to?
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560]  I don't know, it's on the end of the dial
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.560]  I really couldn't tell you right off the hand
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560]  There's about 16 affiliates in Florida
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.560]  So it's hard to know which one it is if you don't tell us
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.560]  That could be down in Miami
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.560]  We get you, like, from four to five
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560]  But it'd be nice to get you for the rest of the time
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.560]  Yeah, I was wondering, you know, I remember back in 95
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.560]  That Brzezinski and Kissinger were together
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.560]  Calling for some kind of, like, a Pearl Harbor event
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:05.560]  And the way you're saying it without kind of working for us
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:08.560]  Then this kind of, either way you look at it
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.560]  The Twin Towers were brought down by us
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.560]  By the way, not us, the bankers that run America
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.560]  This is not me saying this
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560]  I said this yesterday
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.560]  Today, the London Telegraph, BBC
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.560]  They don't deny that Al Qaeda
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.560]  I mean, actual Al Qaeda
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560]  This is headlines
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.560]  Out of Saudi Arabia, US backed
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.560]  Have been running this whole thing
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.560]  I mean, this is a fact that this is going on
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.560]  It's so huge
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.560]  I mean, if you couple all the facts together
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.560]  With them stealing trillions of dollars with the bankers
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.560]  And then to bankrupt the country
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560]  And then to bring us into three wars
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.560]  Or four wars if you count Serbia
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:56.560]  I mean, what does it take to get our country back?
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.560]  Well, it takes getting sophisticated
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.560]  And seeing the big picture, Glenn and I
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]  Appreciate your call
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560]  I mean, here's the London Telegraph today
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.560]  In full wars.com, in prisonplanet.com
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.560]  Libya, the West and Al Qaeda are on the same side
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  Then the article goes on to admit it
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.560]  Statements of support for Libyan Revolution by Al Qaeda
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560]  And leading Islamists have led to fears
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.560]  That military action by the West might be playing into the hands
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.560]  Of its ideological enemies
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.560]  Who does the West use against Iran?
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.560]  Al Qaeda, White House press release
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]  Who do they use against the Serbs?
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]  Al Qaeda
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]  Who do they use?
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.560]  Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560]  Here's our prisonplanet.com headline
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560]  The U.S. government backs Libyan Al Qaeda
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.560]  While helping terror attacks inside U.S.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.560]  Hyping them
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.560]  They're saying Al Qaeda is about to hit America
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  They're gonna blame it
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.560]  They admit Al Qaeda is working for them against Libya
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.560]  But then when there's terror attacks
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  They'll say Al Qaeda did it
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560]  And that Gaddafi's with them
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560]  And then take our rights
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560]  Because of the terror attacks
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560]  They stage or allow
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.560]  Ian in England
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560]  You're on the air from England
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560]  Hi there, Alex. How are you doing?
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560]  Good
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]  Good
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.560]  I've just been watching SCAR news
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.560]  And I just saw those horrifying pictures
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560]  Of the anti-aircraft fire going up
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.560]  And I just think that this is shocking
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.560]  All the American people out there
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.560]  Arm in Europe
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560]  This just affects everybody
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.560]  And I think this is just shocking
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.560]  David Cameron
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560]  I don't know what to say
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  This guy is just
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.560]  Just two weeks ago he was in
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.560]  He was in Egypt
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560]  Helping bring in the arms dealers
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.560]  And a year ago he was in Egypt
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:35.560]  Bringing them in
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.560]  And they've been bringing them in to Gaddafi
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.560]  Yeah
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.560]  Well, you know, from our perspective
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560]  In the U.K. we've got all this coverage
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.560]  On SCAR news
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  And I can tell you right now
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560]  The people here
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560]  We're not really behind this
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560]  This sort of invasion
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560]  And the last thing this country needs
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  Is another war, Alex
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.560]  It's just, you know...
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.560]  We're bankrupt
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560]  It's the bankers
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560]  We should be invading with the courts
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560]  And arresting
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560]  They created 1.5 quadrillion
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560]  Of fraudulent money
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.560]  They've bought off our politicians
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.560]  To bankroll and sign on to
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560]  They're a bunch of burning
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560]  Made-off Ken lay types
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  Taking over the planet
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.560]  And now they're double crossing
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.560]  Their own minion
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.560]  Muammar Gaddafi
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.560]  Talking about how they care
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.560]  About humanitarianism
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560]  Exactly
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  You know, we've got all these people
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560]  Unemployment
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.560]  This is shocking, Alex
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.560]  You know, I'm glad that you're doing what you're doing
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.560]  I'm a huge fan of yours here in the U.K.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.560]  We've got a...
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.560]  You know, you've got a following over here
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.560]  And in Europe
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560]  Well, Ian, you're...
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560]  We'll try
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]  God bless you
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]  Crammin' one more
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.560]  Graham in Canada
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.560]  You're on the air
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]  Hey, thank you very much
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560]  You and your people
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.560]  Will go down in history
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.560]  Is trying to help
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.560]  When I talk
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.560]  Sometimes I say we
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.560]  And I include everybody in North America
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560]  While the world that are really doing good
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560]  The United Nations
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560]  Is a group or entity
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  That was supposed to stop genocide
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.560]  And now
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]  It has come quite apparent
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.560]  That they are behind
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]  A type of genocide
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.560]  The UN's official statements
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.560]  Of the 96th
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.560]  Biological Diversity Assessment
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560]  Are to reduce world population
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.560]  By 80%
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560]  That's correct
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.560]  What we as people
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.560]  We cannot rise up against them
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560]  Because nobody's bigger than them
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.560]  I think we need a cry
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]  And a cry for peace
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560]  In a majority worldwide
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560]  Well, we need to verbally
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  Expose these people, Graham
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  That they're a bunch of...
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.560]  I mean, look
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560]  They're backing the Yemenis
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]  The Bahrainians
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.560]  To shoot their own people
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560]  While saying
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]  We've got to invade any country
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560]  Where people protest
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]  If the government doesn't do
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560]  Whatever the protesters say
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560]  Think of the precedent
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560]  That's setting, Graham
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  And we need to put this out simply
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.560]  For the vast majority of people
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.560]  Al-Qaeda freaks people out
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.560]  You see those words?
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560]  Al-Qaeda is the sword of the New World Order
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.560]  On record, they work for the bankers
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:20.560]  Thomas and others straight ahead
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560]  This documentary exposes how the continuity
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560]  Of government program has established
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.560]  An old powerful shadow state
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.560]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.560]  Depths to which our republic has fallen
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560]  Prepare to enter the secretive world
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.560]  Of emergency dictatorship
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560]  Body scanners, sound cameras

[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.560]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.560]  Number 1, new climate legislation
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.560]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.560]  Number 2, our new energy czar
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560]  Wants to control how much power
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.560]  Your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.560]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:20.560]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.560]  Number 3, in some areas of the country
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.560]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.560]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.560]  Is only compounding the problem
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560]  Number 4, dangerous weather
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.560]  Is always a threat to local grids
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560]  From weather-related onages
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.560]  Number 5, a solar power generator
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.560]  Provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.560]  Offered by solutions from science
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.560]  One of my oldest sponsors

[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.560]  Alex has told you that the mid-east
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.560]  Uprisings over food prices and shortages
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560]  Caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.560]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.560]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.560]  And fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.560]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.560]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.560]  Out of the reach of millions of Americans
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:28.560]  With an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.560]  Move quickly while you can still afford it

[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.560]  By the way, I just saw a headline
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.560]  That Google's former CEO, Schmidt
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.560]  Is set to become our secretary
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.560]  That spies on everybody that was set up
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560]  By the CIA and the NSA
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.560]  See, Republicans think that any corporation
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.560]  Is fine and good and great
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.560]  Liberals think that any government is good
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.560]  They don't understand that big megacorporations
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.560]  Are bigger than governments
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.560]  They take over governments covertly
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.560]  Pay off the politicians and then set up
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:10.560]  A corporate tyranny
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.560]  That's what world government is
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.560]  And that's what's happening all over the world
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.560]  When they take out the Serbs, when they take out
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.560]  The Libyans, when they take out the Egyptians
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.560]  Is they're putting their own people in
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  Who will intensify the looting of the population
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560]  While we're thinking about countries
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.560]  The countries have already become a thing of the past
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560]  Under global governance
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560]  The global corporate governance is here
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.560]  The world cashless currency under SDRs
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.560]  And the IMF and World Bank are already being created
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.560]  Here's the headline, Obama likely to name
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.560]  Google's Eric Schmidt as Commerce Secretary
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:51.560]  Absolutely incredible
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.560]  It's time to grow up
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.560]  It's time to get more sophisticated
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.560]  And to realize the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.560]  Are designed to create a level playing field
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.560]  For massive companies, for government, for private individuals
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.560]  Your interests are not protected
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.560]  Yes, it's fun to cheer planes bombing countries
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.560]  And to feel like you're a winner
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.560]  But the very same globalists looting your pension funds
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:20.560]  Raising your taxes are the ones attacking Libya right now
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.560]  And Muammar Gaddafi is handing out
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.560]  Millions of firearms to his population
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.560]  But in the globalist calculation, they don't care
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  In fact, decades ago they planned to split Libya
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.560]  And two to three pieces to divide it
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.560]  With the East controlled by a puppetum
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.560]  A viceroy out of Egypt
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.560]  With the Southern area controlled by Tunisia
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.560]  And by the North controlled by Gaddafi's people
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.560]  This is all about divide and conquer
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560]  And slicing up countries
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.560]  That's what the North American Union's about
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.560]  That's what the Ford Foundation's been all about
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.560]  Bringing in 30 million illegal aliens
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.560]  To be an outside political force
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.560]  To vote for gun control and open borders
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.560]  Wake up, get sophisticated
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.560]  Globalism is your enemy
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.560]  Whatever the globalist push is cyanide to liberty
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.560]  Whatever the New World Order is for
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.560]  You better be against
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.560]  Thomas in South Carolina, you're on the air
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.560]  Hey, good afternoon, good to hear
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.560]  Good to hear from you, what's on your mind, Thomas?
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.560]  I just wanted to get your thought about
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.560]  The 100 years war
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:26.560]  We're pretty much into 111 years of war
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.560]  Now, if you count war one up to today
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.560]  The war of the corporate private empire
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.560]  Using the U.S. and Europe as their puppet
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560]  The Edwardian War, the 1300s
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.560]  You had the Carolan War, you had the incastrian war
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.560]  And then the plant
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.560]  The plant, I get it, fortunes with Joan of Arc
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.560]  And then the session of the Castilian Civil Wars
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.560]  The two Peters and so forth and so on
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.560]  I think we're in an era because of neoliberals
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.560]  We're in a corporate global war against everyone
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.560]  Yeah, neither of these people, the neoliberals
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560]  The Neocons, follow the Constitution
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.560]  So something has to fill its void
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.560]  Yeah, no, they're tyrants, that's the point, yeah
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.560]  What is the ultimate solution?
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  It's state sovereignty, getting the 50 states to move
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.560]  To take control of the federal government
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560]  Ending the foreign entanglements
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.560]  Ending our troops from all these countries
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560]  Going to a silver and gold-backed currency
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.560]  And denouncing the private global corporate system
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.560]  Known as the New World Order
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.560]  Well, we've got to start electing the right people then
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.560]  We do, Thomas, I appreciate your great acumen on history
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.560]  Let's talk to Janice and Michigan
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.560]  Oh, hi, Alex, I'm a longtime listener and first-time caller
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.560]  Welcome
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.560]  And my biggest fear is that you're going to cut me off
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560]  Before I'm through
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.560]  I want to thank you, first of all, for exposing
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.560]  And fighting the New World Order for over 15 years
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.560]  And you've taught me a lot on how to think for myself
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560]  And how to interpret the news
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.560]  And everything you just said after that last break
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.560]  Was very important and very eloquently put
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560]  That is everything in a nutshell
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.560]  I have been accused by my anti-Israel patriotic friends
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.560]  Of supporting Mubarak when I wasn't
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.560]  I know he's a bad guy like Qaddafi
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:16.560]  But when I tried to explain that this was a New World Order
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.560]  Staged, caused thing
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.560]  I mean, after 30 years, come out, all of a sudden
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.560]  Everybody's sick of them
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.560]  They should have done it 20 years ago
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.560]  Or 25 years ago
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560]  Now, the globalists are putting things into a crisis
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.560]  On purpose to then bring in their larger global solution
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560]  Which is a Western invasion of North Africa and the Middle East
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.560]  Just today, I was thinking about what happened in Yugoslavia
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.560]  And you nailed that one too
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.560]  The Bosnia thing, I mean, I thought...
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.560]  Now, the radical Muslims work for the New World Order
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.560]  And you say don't cut you off, it's a catch-22, Janice
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.560]  If I didn't cut off all those other colors, I never would have gotten to you
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.560]  Oh, thank you, God bless you
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.560]  But you know, and I pray for you, Alex
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560]  I mean, you are awesome
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  But you know, and your family as well
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.560]  The Bosnia thing
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.560]  We were fighting Christians
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560]  Who was that guy we set up and killed
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560]  Ahead of Yugoslavia?
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.560]  What was his name?
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.560]  Start with an M, do you remember?
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.560]  Milosevic?
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.560]  Yes
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.560]  Wasn't he a Christian and we were fighting...
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560]  Yes, love of a Milosevic
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560]  They took one-third of Serbia
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.560]  Give it to the Albanian, Sunni, Al Qaeda
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560]  On record
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560]  And now also
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  Do you know that Netanyahu
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560]  In Israel calls the UN a house of lies
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560]  And I heard from Barry Schnapp
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.560]  That's another issue
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  People that say Israel runs everything
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.560]  Israel is not part of the Imperium
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.560]  Israel is against the UN
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.560]  The UN is running all these new operations
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.560]  The UN is the big globalist organization
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.560]  That gave our own government the orders, Janice
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.560]  I appreciate your call, great points
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.560]  This is a larger issue
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.560]  Let's talk to Chad in Oklahoma
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  Chad, go ahead
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.560]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to...
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.560]  I'm very weary of everything that's happening
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560]  Over in the Middle East
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.560]  And especially over in Japan
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.560]  Well, it's setting the precedent
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560]  That anytime people protest in a country
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560]  We've got to invade it
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.560]  But if you protest here, they'll rubber bullet you
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.560]  And break your skull open and hit you with a microwave gun
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.560]  I see it this way
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560]  We already know there's a North American Union
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560]  And there's a European Union
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  But what I don't see
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.560]  Is I think all the stuff that's going on in the Middle East
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.560]  That's coming about to set up a Middle Eastern Union
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.560]  No, exactly
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.560]  They're knocking over the old puppets, putting new ones in
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560]  Yeah, and then, you know
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  I'm wondering if they're using this
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.560]  You know, if they use harp or somehow
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.560]  You know, to kind of destabilize Japan
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560]  Because I mean, China and Japan hate each other
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560]  You know, the thing is
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  The moon was closer than it had been in decades
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.560]  A lot of astrophysicists predicted
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560]  This would happen, even ABC News did
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560]  The sun hit us with a huge solar flare
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560]  On March 11th
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.560]  I appreciate your call, Chad
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560]  But I just can't say it was a weather weapon
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560]  Or a tectonic weapon
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560]  Even though those exist without the proof
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560]  But I appreciate your call, good points
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560]  Daniel in California, you're on the air
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560]  Good afternoon, Alex
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.560]  I'm wondering if you ever got your wife and kids down to
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560]  The Caribbean like you're planning on
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  No, we're still monitoring radiation levels
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560]  But partial meltdowns have happened
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560]  Most of it's falling in the Pacific
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560]  They reported Friday and Saturday
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560]  Increase radiation levels, but they say it's safe
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560]  I'm going to talk about that in the final segment
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.560]  Coming up, but if the radiation level continues to rise
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.560]  I will get my family out because
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.560]  Radiation affects children a lot worse than adults
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.560]  Because they have fast growing cells
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.560]  Right, I sent my wife and child down to South America
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.560]  Just like Obama is right now
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.560]  It's a good move if you can do it
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  Exactly, I'm sitting here in Southern California
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.560]  Being bathed in radioactive isotopes
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.560]  Well, that's where it made landfall
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560]  Yes, sir, and they've confirmed radiation
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560]  In the food and water in Japan
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  Where can I get actual readings of the radiation
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560]  That's occurring here on the West Coast
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560]  I mean, all I get is people's interpretation
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560]  Saying it's extremely low
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560]  But they don't actually give me a mill of seabirds
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.560]  Or whatever it's coming through
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.560]  You can search radiation monitoring stations
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.560]  By the EPA, but who knows if those are accurate
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.560]  They just say that it's slightly increased
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:22.560]  But that's the radiation from last Friday and Saturday
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.560]  Before the big blow-ups
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.560]  Did you say APA?
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  What was that?
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.560]  No, I said the Federal Government EPA
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.560]  EPA
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.560]  EPA
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.560]  EPA, sounds good, sorry
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.560]  No, no, no, thank you so much, Daniel
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.560]  Kerry, Robert, Joe, George, Habu
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  Your call straight ahead
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560]  I'll also go ahead and shift gears
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.560]  Into the latest on the reactor situation
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  Tomorrow we'll have three hours
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.560]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central to really break that down
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.560]  But they covered up the 300 above-ground tester
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.560]  In the U.S. that increased cancer on record
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.560]  They covered up Chernobyl
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560]  It's invisible, they can cover it up
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.560]  That in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.560]  In America in more than 50 years
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.560]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560]  And even how you take care of your health
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.560]  And your own family
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.560]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.560]  Of the years
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.560]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.560]  Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.560]  General growth properties
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:34.560]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  And it's a real eye-opener
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560]  I can't stress this enough
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.560]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.560]  He explains everything you need to know
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.560]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:51.560]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.560]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.560]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:19.560]  That's www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  That's www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.560]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.560]  And they really are calling the shots
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:24.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.560]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.560]  They're asking for more matches
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.560]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560]  Today seems like nobody does care
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.560]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at www.InfoWars.com
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560]  We're watching online right now
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.560]  In super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.560]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560]  Number two, our new energies are
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.560]  Wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.560]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.560]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:44.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  One of my oldest sponsors
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.560]  Get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.560]  That's MySolarBackup.com
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.560]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.560]  So go to MySolarBackup.com
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:00.560]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.560]  Oh yeah
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.560]  Hit it
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:19.560]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  In the heart of the Resistance
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:24.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.560]  You can always keep track of what we're doing in our latest research and reports
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:35.560]  At infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, back live, 11 a.m. Central, tomorrow for three hours at least
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]  A lot of times we go into overdrive
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.560]  A couple days last week I did five or six hours live
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.560]  Now before I get into the nuclear reactor situation at Fukushima
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.560]  And the cover-up that's ongoing there
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560]  Here's the weekly standard
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.560]  Just came out yesterday
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.560]  Mandatory spending to exceed all federal revenues
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.560]  50 years ahead of schedule
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.560]  And it goes on to say we have now gotten to the point
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.560]  Where if national defense, interstate highways, national parks, homeland security
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.560]  And all other discretionary programs somehow became absolutely free
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.560]  We still have a budget deficit
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  And it goes on that the White House budget office admits this
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.560]  Now that's where the globalist bankers want us
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  Totally dependent like a third world country to them
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.560]  Getting interest on our money made up out of nothing
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.560]  This is the fraud, they're the real Gaddafi
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:31.560]  They're the real hitlers of the 21st century
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.560]  And we're becoming just like a third world country
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.560]  So that's the issue here that people need to be made fully aware of
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.560]  Now continuing, the good news is they've gotten plant number five and six at Fukushima
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.560]  To be stabilized, plant one through four have blown up or on fire
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.560]  They're still off-gassing radiation
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.560]  At least two breaches of core facilities
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.560]  And in every other nuclear disaster, whether it was Three Mile Island or Chernobyl in 86
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.560]  We're told don't worry about it because it's an invisible poison
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.560]  Though our own government admits a million people have died roughly
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:17.560]  From the 1986 and the 25 years of radiation from Chernobyl
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  That many experts say is a lot less deadly
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  As we've seen happen at Fukushima where 600 plus thousand fuel rods were stored
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.560]  Many of them on top of the reactors that have blown sky high
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.560]  The Japanese government admits the radiation is lethal in that area
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  Upwards of 100 miles away, the food and water has been contaminated by radioactive iodine
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.560]  And other isotopes
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.560]  Winds are threatening to turn south and have now turned south towards Tokyo
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560]  AccuWeather reports
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.560]  The Japanese government's now talking about our Chernobyl solution
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  Maybe the last resort for Japan's reactors, burying them in sand and concrete
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.560]  The problem is it'll get into the water table
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:58.560]  Much of the smoke and radioactive debris has been blowing west towards the United States
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  The first leaks were on Friday but limited compared to what happened Saturday through Friday
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  And then today through Sunday
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:11.560]  That smoke's coming towards the United States with lower level elevated radiation hitting the west coast
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.560]  Again, Japan moles ban on Fukushima area food products
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:19.560]  Reuters, Tokyo water sample show radioactive iodine
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  The government reports that's 150 miles away by the way
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.560]  Japan crisis forces rethink of nuclear option
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  They're building nuclear plants all over the world
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560]  They have a long history of covering up
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.560]  Continuing downstream effects from Fukushima catastrophe
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.560]  Zero hedge reporting
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:42.560]  Japan saw some success in its race to avert disaster at the tsunami damaged power plant
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:47.560]  Though minor radiation leaks underlined perils for the world's worst nuclear crisis in Chernobyl
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.560]  25 years ago, Japan may have reached a turning point
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.560]  In winning its week-long battle
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560]  To prevent a massive radiation leak
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.560]  When it succeeded in containing a power transmission line
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.560]  To the disabled Fukushima power plant
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.560]  Now they're saying it's not working
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:06.560]  Japan is considering whether to halt sales of food products
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:13.560]  From near the crippled nuclear plant Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin offered to give natural gas supplies to Japan
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.560]  Japan has raised the severity of the nuclear rating crisis from a 4 to a 5
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:25.560]  The TEPCO managers of the plant have announced rolling blackouts after its power generation was cut
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:33.560]  Japanese utility electric declares forced majeure on its near term thermal coal shipments due to port damage
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:36.560]  So that's affecting the world economy
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.560]  Continuing the miracle tale of survival
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.560]  Grandmother and boy pulled from rubble
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.560]  Nine days after tsunami smashed city
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.560]  The amount of radioactive fuel from Fukushima to Dwarf's Chernobyl
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:55.560]  Those are just some of the reports at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.560]  But more and more the world is distracted from what's happening with the trade winds
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.560]  And jet streamed directly from Japan hitting the west coast
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.560]  People are focusing in on what's happening in Libya
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:09.560]  Kerry and Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.560]  Hey Alex, okay to Jones, how you doing?
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.560]  Good
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:16.560]  I listen to you every day on podcast, I'm a loudspeaker at work
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.560]  Everyone thinks that you're Rush Limbaugh
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:21.560]  They first think that, by your voice that you were
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560]  And I have to tell them that, oh it's Alex Jones
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.560]  I haven't heard too many comparisons to myself and Lord Limbaugh
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.560]  But I do know I'm on the cover of Talkers magazine this month
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.560]  And the keynote speaker at the yearly Talkers event
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:35.560]  It's normally Lord Limbaugh, so I'm very honored
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.560]  Well I have to, I inadvertently end up spreading your name
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.560]  And I've ended up having quite a few people tune into you
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.560]  That's why we're the number one show on the web
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.560]  Thanks to you and soon on AM and FM, Kerry
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560]  Yep, but I wanted to get to the important point
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.560]  And make this quick for other people that are in line also
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.560]  Are you aware of any close-up video at the reactor site?
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:02.560]  Yes, and it's showing total devastation
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.560]  At least four of them are wrecked, the others damage
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:08.560]  And Fox News, every day I watch, shows old file footage
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.560]  Of a clean nice plant and tells people that's live footage
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.560]  It's incredible deception
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:18.560]  Well I was on YouTube yesterday and I saw a video
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:21.560]  That only had 3,000 views and I was surprised it didn't have more
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.560]  Unless it was a copy of another one that had a lot more views
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:29.560]  But I think it could be found on YouTube
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.560]  And it's close-up footage that I think was secretly taken
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:35.560]  By a cell phone, by one of the workers
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:39.560]  Well that's actually in the print media photos and video
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:44.560]  Of just shattered, devastated, smoking, radioactive derelicts
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.560]  And you can just totally tell by looking at that
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:51.560]  That there's no way that, especially those used rods
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.560]  On top of the facility that they could have been contained
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:58.560]  I hear you, Kerry, it's huge, I appreciate the call
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.560]  Again, I don't have some beef with Fox News
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:08.560]  But a month ago they played dubbed audio of Ron Paul being booed
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.560]  And then didn't even say he'd won the straw poll
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:13.560]  And now they show the reactor, you've all seen it
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.560]  Freshly painted and clean, every day
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.560]  I mean, it's just how dumb to think their viewers are
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:20.560]  I guess it's dumb as MSNBC viewers
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.560]  Who say it's racist and I want government-run health care
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.560]  Robert in Texas, go ahead
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.560]  Well, thanks for taking my call
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.560]  I have a quick question regarding the situation in Libya
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:33.560]  With all the news covering Clinton and Obama
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.560]  And their soundbites saying that this is going to be a limited action
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560]  There's going to be no ground troops
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.560]  With the Cure Sergeant and the Baton positioning themselves off the coast
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:44.560]  Yeah, those are sister ships to the Coronado
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  Those are big Marine Corps landing ships
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  Exactly, so, you know, I'm prior Navy
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.560]  That's a move to do something bigger than what we're being told
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.560]  No, they just pulled them in right off the coast
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:57.560]  Yeah, no, no, because if you read that UN resolution
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.560]  It could be, they say Obama said
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:03.560]  You will accept a humanitarian ground force or else
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.560]  Well, a humanitarian means troops
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:08.560]  Exactly, so my question for you is
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:11.560]  With us being told repeatedly
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.560]  That there's not going to be any ground troops
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.560]  How is this situation going to escalate?
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:18.560]  They'll stage terror attacks, they're already laying the groundwork
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:20.560]  Say that Qaddafi did it
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  They're loving Al Qaeda, UN Global Force will do it
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:26.560]  Then they'll take our rights while they invade Libya
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:28.560]  Claiming that Qaddafi launched terror attacks
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.560]  They're setting the stage for that
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  Very good, well, I just want to let you know
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.560]  That me and my wife welcomed our son Alex into the world yesterday
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.560]  So I think it's like that
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.560]  Oh, man, you're awesome
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.560]  Just don't name him Alexander Emrick
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560]  And then he'd really be named after me
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.560]  You're awesome, Robert, I want to go to Joe, George, Habu and others
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  But we're almost out of time
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.560]  Habu in Wisconsin, you're on the air
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:49.560]  Thank you, Alex
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.560]  It's a great pleasure to listen to you
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.560]  And even more to be on your show
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  I'll be very pithy here
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.560]  You know, just two quick points
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.560]  It seems like the US and the NATO
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.560]  Delayed the resolution in the UN
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:08.560]  Until Qaddafi's forces were at the gates of Benghazi
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:11.560]  So that they could ramrod anything through
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:18.560]  And the true Democrats in Libya would be compromised
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:24.560]  No, that's it, because the true rebel forces arrested SAS
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.560]  They weren't playing ball
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.560]  They let Qaddafi win first
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.560]  I was going to make that point earlier, I'm glad you made it
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.560]  Let Qaddafi start winning
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.560]  So the rebels need the globalists
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.560]  So the globalists have an excuse to actually come in
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.560]  And then put who they want in place
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.560]  Very astute
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.560]  And the second point, and very quickly
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.560]  You know, this is really appalling
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:46.560]  No less on the anniversary of the attack on Iraq
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.560]  To bring in the naval ships from so many...
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  Wait, you just made a point
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.560]  This is the anniversary
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  The bombardment started about five days ago
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.560]  Eight years, nine years ago, 2003
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  Very good point, the Ides of March
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.560]  The Romans always talk about the time to launch a war
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.560]  Was March for Mars, the God of War
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.560]  Well, thank you very much, and all the very best to you
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560]  Thank you, Ver, I love that type of call
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.560]  I'm sorry to Joe, I'm sorry to George
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:14.560]  Call me back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.560]  We'll be here live

[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.560]  My great crew in there

[01:57:44.560 --> 01:58:13.560]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
