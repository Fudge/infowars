[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  We're now only 53 days out of the most historic election in world history.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  As a massive hurricane has now smashed into the Carolinas,
[00:31.000 --> 00:39.000]  we're going to be breaking it all down today with the latest coverage and analysis at infowars.com
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  and of course drudgerport.com has the most extensive coverage like a bomb has gone off.
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  500,000 plus without power, 10-foot storm surge, Cajun Navy rescues,
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  30-foot waves, records recorded by buoys,
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  and the flag still is flying, the American flag,
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  and the flag is still there.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  ICE says it won't arrest or detain evacuees,
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  media politicizes wind, blame Trump for storms, predict mass death.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  We've got all the radar feeds up there at drudgerport.com and infowars.com as well.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  And Florence, weekend days of downpour.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  Now it's gone down to 80 miles an hour, which means it isn't damaging as many buildings,
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  but it's stalling out and could have 10, 15, 20 feet of water.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  So this is going to be a disaster.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  But they think you're stupid.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  So the mainstream media is acting like you're all following voodoo or something,
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  and you think that when there's a solar eclipse that a giant monster is eating the sun or a giant snake,
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  like the ancient Greeks or the ancient Aztecs would think,
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  or every other major culture, thought some monster was eating the sun,
[01:58.000 --> 02:07.000]  and then if you did human sacrifices or whatever, the Titan cronos would vomit it back up.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  Or was cronos one of the fathers of the Titans? I forget.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  And a mythical land known as Sikronia.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  That's a word no one's heard in a long time.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  But continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  Manafort pleads guilty to conspiracy charges, agrees to cooperate with Mueller, developing.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  And of course, none of it has to do with Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  It has to do with banking and IRS stuff from 15 years ago.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  Totally redonkulous.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  It's all coming up today and so much more.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  There's been a couple more truck attacks.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  You know, it's like Siddiq Khan said, the Islamic mayor of London.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  He said, just get used to it.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  I've kind of gotten used to it.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  It's like every day there's a couple of truck attacks, 10 or 15 acid attacks,
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  a bunch of stabbing attacks, screaming Allah Akbar,
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  nothing to do with Islam, just screaming God is great and Arabic.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  People wail and scream and fight for their lives, the domesticated Europeans.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  Even the Dalai Lama said, you better not let Islamic North Africa and the Middle East in.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  You're crazy.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  And why do you say that?
[03:22.000 --> 03:32.000]  Well, because the Buddhists, there have been, in India alone, it's estimated 140 million Hindus
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  and other Buddhist sects killed by Muslims since Muslims invaded,
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  what was it, 1400 years ago, 140 plus million people.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  You know, just like Egypt used to be Christian and Turkey used to be Christian.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  And there were Christians all over India.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  The Hindus and Buddhists love Christians practice.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  No problem.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  But along come the Muslims and off go your heads.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  And the Dalai Lama is like, let me tell you something, you need to watch your butt.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Are you crazy?
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  You know, the only reason the Buddhist monks started having to learn how to fight.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  You go back a couple thousand years ago, they weren't into warfare,
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  but the Islamic invasions all over from Indonesia, right through into areas of Europe,
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  people were being invaded so they got more militaristic.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  But particularly the Buddhist monks got into warfare,
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  that's where you get all the cheesy kung fu movies and stuff,
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  because they had to or they get dead.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  See how that works?
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  But we're liberal, we love Islam.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  Let's go down and smoke hookah pipes.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  Oh, oh, we're gay.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Let's go to Saudi Arabia.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Oh, you're gonna kill me?
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  Oh, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  Alex Jones is bad.

[06:24.000 --> 06:50.000]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on the September 14th, 2018 Friday Broadcast.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  And globalists are in full panic mode.
[06:54.000 --> 07:02.000]  They can feel their vampiric attempt to strangle human destiny and take control of human evolution.
[07:02.000 --> 07:12.000]  To direct us on a path of their choosing, they can feel it running through their hands like sand.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  But the battle is now joined.
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.000]  We have the massive hurricane Florence slamming into the Carolinas making landfall in the last few hours.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  The reporting like it's a bomb going off.
[07:24.000 --> 07:33.000]  10 foot storm surge, 30 foot waves recorded by buoys, breaking records.
[07:33.000 --> 07:44.000]  And the left says if you pay a carbon tax and they say if you give George Soros and Lord Rothschild and Al Gore,
[07:44.000 --> 07:52.000]  I'm not kidding, and Obama, that's who owns, in London and in Chicago, the two main carbon exchanges,
[07:52.000 --> 08:00.000]  if you pay them billions of dollars each, they will wave a magic wand and there will not be any more big storms.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  In fact, you can go to the Weather Channel or even USA Today like three, four years ago,
[08:04.000 --> 08:12.000]  they have recorded that compared to the 60s, you go through the 90s on till now,
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.000]  the least amount of hurricanes recorded in the last 400 years in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean.
[08:21.000 --> 08:30.000]  So the idea that we're having more storms that are more severe isn't true.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Now, the only thing that is constant is change.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  And you can see the big red eye on Jupiter that's the size of planet Earth.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Actually, I think a whole bunch of, I forget the statistic.
[08:41.000 --> 08:52.000]  So planet Earth can fit in the circumference of the eye of Jupiter that wasn't there just about 500 years ago,
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  they reported it forming.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  So can we pull up, just go to YouTube or wherever and type in video from Voyager 1 or Voyager 2,
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  just a video, time lapse video, the eye, the great storm on Jupiter.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And again, many, many Earths could fit into it.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  But you know, it's getting smaller and it's slowing down.
[09:13.000 --> 09:23.000]  It's a giant typhoon of gases on the gas giant's surface, a big, eddying whirlpool.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  And that's not caused by humans.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  Now, it is true that the Earth went up a couple degrees in temperature until the late 90s.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  And now it's been going down according to all global measurements.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  That's not contested now.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  About what, six years ago, hide the decline, remember that?
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  So you have the big red spot, which is a big storm on Jupiter.
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  And remember, while the Earth was heating up in the 70s and 80s and 90s a little bit,
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  they were blaming it on a little bit increased CO2 from humans, that plants breathe.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  What else was happening on some of our brother or sister planets here in the solar system?
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  What else was happening?
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  The ice caps of Mars were shrinking dramatically.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  Oh, just as soon as our ice caps started expanding again, what was it?
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  About 19 years ago, about 1999.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  What happened?
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  Now, goodness, Mars ice caps started getting bigger again.
[10:30.000 --> 10:41.000]  What is the input in the solar system that was having similar climate effects as Earth was having on Mars?
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  The fourth rock out.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Oh, that's right.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  I forgot.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  The sun.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  And I know I'm stating something very, very simple here.
[10:54.000 --> 11:06.000]  I understand this, but your average leftist doesn't because it's all about how they're going to save the Earth.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  So again, we'll have that answer for you soon.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  How many Earths can fit in the big red spot?
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  That's coming up after the break of Jupiter.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And there's some other big storms.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  Jupiter has got a storm that mathematicians over 100 years ago believed would manifest a interdimensional vortex because of calculations they'd made.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  And they believed there'd be a giant hexagon on the northern and southern poles.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  And guess what?
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  When probes flew over, giant hexagon on the north pole.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Jupiter's great red spot is more than twice the size of Earth.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  Okay, there you go.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  So two fit in it.
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  And once the storms inside the storm reach speeds of 270 miles an hour, better pay Al Gore money, you'll fix it.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  Nobody knows when the great red spot first appeared on Jupiter.
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.000]  But it's been seen on Jupiter ever since people started looking through telescopes 400 years ago.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  My memory is pretty good.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  I said 400 or 500 years ago, they first discovered it.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  So maybe it's a little older.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  We don't know.
[12:08.000 --> 12:20.000]  But now it's dissipating. They have mathematical models and indices that predict within another 50 years or so the storm will be gone because we will pay carbon taxes.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  And that will fix the problem.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  I want carbon taxes for Mars.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  I think we should pay them.
[12:26.000 --> 12:40.000]  Now like carbon indulgences, remember back with the old Vatican days, and they would tell people all over the Holy Roman Empire that you can't get your family out of purgatory.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  Trapped in purgatory, awaiting the hour of the prisel.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  Skies are turning red.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  And if you paid large amounts of gold, the pope would wave a massive wave of gold.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  The pope would wave a magic wand and out you go from purgatory.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  But today you pay your carbon indulgences.
[13:06.000 --> 13:18.000]  And you go to U2 Africa concerts and Bono keeps 99% of the money and makes billions of dollars off of it and then laughs at you.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  Because he's liberal.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  Kind of like this limousine liberals, one of the top stories on drugreport.com on the left hand side.
[13:26.000 --> 13:36.000]  Socialist Alexandria Cortez wears a $3,500 outfit.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  You know, I've never had a $3,500 outfit.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  I mean, I guess I have a little bit nicer sports jackets, so they're $500, $600.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  And the average politician is probably wearing like a $3,000 one.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  But wow, look at her $3,500 outfit.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  I always love how they're talking about socialist how it's bad to own things and bad to be wealthy and everybody who's rich is evil.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  But then 80% of the wealth in Congress is Democrats.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  Almost all the billionaires are socialist or Democrats because they want your money.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  I mean, they're all tax exempt.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  All the heads of Google literally pay no taxes.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  They all run international tax scams and they're allowed to because they're part of the ruling class.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  And she comes from a rich family and just did the whole barista thing as a cutout stage, DLP, Arstatt.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  And it turns out people are now looking at her wardrobe going back years and it appears that on average day,
[14:23.000 --> 14:32.000]  she sports designer clothing of close to $1,000 on her body.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  So they're making a lot of money at that bar.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  But look, she posed with a black construction worker.
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  But if you compare what she's wearing, it literally looks like a fashion shoot because it is.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  You got her all dressed up.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  I love the limousine liberals.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  I love folks like Hugo Chavez and all these people with their Swiss palaces.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  But then their people are so poor, but they want you poor to control you.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  It's by design.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Once you get communism, there's no more welfare.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  There's no more nothing.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  You get to live in a hovel and you get to have no running water and you get to have secret police.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  Knock your teeth out if you don't show up for the mandatory work regains.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  And you work about 65 hours a week on average and you have no health care.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  But oh, there's always universities spitting out doctors and things.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  But if your eyes go bad, there's a cane.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  The ego's bad.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  There's a cane.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  Get cancer?
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  Shoot yourself in the head.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's OK, though.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  Because you know I'm lying.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  I'm fake news.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  Socialism and communism works so good.
[15:34.000 --> 15:43.000]  Now, when we return, when we return, we will get into some incredible news.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  You heard about what happened at Google.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  Every day something new's about to break, like I told you.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  And then there'll be executive action.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  I think the military should storm all those facilities or criminal organizations.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Hear that?
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  even when you're miles away.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Security is a mindset.

[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:09.000 --> 18:16.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  X2. We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was,
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  and I was, we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[19:08.000 --> 19:15.000]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a picker dish on top of a 90-degree hot plate, it gasses,
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  like I dream of genie, and it's purple gas.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now,
[19:28.000 --> 19:33.000]  but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago,
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  and we've got a good supply of it, but it'll be gone in a couple of months.
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, m4store.com.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  If you have experienced it, no matter how great it is, I suggest you stock up on it.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  It's available right now for a limited time, m4store.com.
[19:57.000 --> 20:08.000]  It's 25% off right now.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  But because of those who look on and do nothing,
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  You know, I said something at the end of the last segment that I 100% believe.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  We really want to save this country.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  We want to save the Republic from foreign governments and espionage.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  Then we need the president and we need a coalition in Congress
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  to use the force of the U.S. military under the executive branch
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.000]  and under the Constitution to remove the red coat scourge
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  that's in control of this country.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  And I'm not talking about the British Empire of old.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  I'm talking about every day now it comes into focus.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Where Google and Apple and these other tech companies will not work with the Pentagon.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  They will not work with the CIA.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  They will not work with the military.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  But they will work officially with the Communist Chinese and the dictatorial EU.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  Now you think about that.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's mainstream news.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  Now remember, all major six Hollywood production houses are controlled by China.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  They have controlling interests.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  That's mainstream Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  I told you 10 years ago China is taking control of Hollywood I got made fun of.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  I was meeting with top Hollywood people who were telling me about it.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  Michael Savage has a whole bunch of number one bestselling books.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  It's like 15 or something over the years.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  Been writing them since the 70s.
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  They would not even take delivery.
[22:12.000 --> 22:21.000]  They would have been global in other places four years ago when he put one out about China taking over America.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Think about that.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  And of course Savage was asked to write that by patriots.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  I can tell you that.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  Savage doesn't know that.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  I know that from folks.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  No Savage.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  I know Savage well.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  But the point is, is that they would not allow the book on the shelves in America.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  There it is.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  China promotes anti-Trump book.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  Washington Times.
[22:42.000 --> 22:49.000]  The state-run media is pushing it, buying it and putting it on incaps all over China.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  And they're promoting it here in America.
[22:51.000 --> 23:01.000]  And they're buying up radio stations and satellite systems to beam pro-Chicom news into Chinese populations here in the U.S.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  That are now the fastest growing population in North America.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  Not just here.
[23:05.000 --> 23:15.000]  In Canada, in the U.S., in Mexico and all the way down to Chile, the Chinese are coming.
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  And if they don't do what they're told, their family in China gets killed.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  I was asked not to get into it and I won't.
[23:23.000 --> 23:31.000]  But we have actually had the Chinese try to exert force on us six years ago and five years ago.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  And I'll leave it at that.
[23:34.000 --> 23:44.000]  And let's just say somebody had to get basically a divorce over it.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  I've had Saudi intelligence attacking me as well.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  But look, the point is, when you're a real American patriot, you find out what's going on.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  And you find out you're not in Kansas anymore.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  People just think, oh, America's all happy and good.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  Right under the surface.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  We're under attack.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  And we finally got a president that gets it.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  So now, I said earlier, I said, Google needs to be SWAT-teamed.
[24:10.000 --> 24:20.000]  It works with a group that killed five times the number of Hitler, the Communist Chinese, on record, their own people.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  They're taking over everything, the CFR and the globalists put them in the position, gave them all the rare earth minerals, all the deep water ports.
[24:26.000 --> 24:36.000]  It was given to them, the keys of the kingdom and the physical keys and the electronic keys to everything, to Apple, to your code keys, to your Google ID.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Do you understand?
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  It's mainstream news.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  We are almost taken over.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  And now this.
[24:48.000 --> 24:56.000]  Their state-run media is promoting fear and Bob Woodward and saying, remove Trump, 20th Amendment, Trump is mentally ill, remove our president.
[24:56.000 --> 25:13.000]  Wow, a foreign government says remove our president and Google that was shut up by DARPA 20 years ago with Russian scientists who took their ideas over here.
[25:13.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's now moving to China and it's helping censor their own people and round them up and kill them, literally.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  And I was actually pleasantly surprised by Senator Cotton.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  I thought he was Alex Jones.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  When I got there, I was listening to the committee.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  I was like, well, this didn't all bad.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  Rubio brought up some good points.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  I first walked with Rubio.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  The media doesn't show you that part.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  I'm like, hey, we talked about the censorship because he was coming out to the press area.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  That's where you go way on the side where they come out.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  I didn't interrupt his press conference.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  He ignored me and was a jerk.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  So I got back in his face, but he was one of the only other senators that said some stuff about China and how they won't work, how Google won't work with our military.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Which again, okay, you're not going to work with our military.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Then you work with the Chinese.
[25:58.000 --> 26:07.000]  America didn't kill, you know, in this century or 100 million people.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  This is the real issue.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  Why do you think I was taking off air on all these platforms five weeks ago?
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  It was this.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  It was that I was getting reports of the president.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  I was trying to mobilize you on social media to make this the issue.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  But guess what?
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  I took one for the team.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  And we've now succeeded thanks to you, the listeners and the stations and the drugs report all of us together in your prayers.
[26:30.000 --> 26:40.000]  So now the big issue is censorship and traitorous activities by big tech firms moving to China and they're all involved except Twitter.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  But Jack Dorsey just is scared.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  So he goes along with other big tech giants.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  So that's the big news.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And now you've got this.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  You have the hours of Google video coming out their own video leaked.
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  They don't know how much they hate Trump and how they're going to stop him and how they thought they delivered the election to Hillary, but they can't believe it.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  But next time they're going to really get conservatives and they're going to control thought.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  They're going to manage the narrative and they're going to make sure that we go in the right direction.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  They're going to run your life.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  They're authoritarians.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  And at least you guys worth hundreds of millions of dollars a piece, but oh, they're going to teach you how to be a good socialist.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  They don't pay their taxes.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  And now inside the ring, China promotes Bob Woodward's anti-Trump book fear.
[27:22.000 --> 27:29.000]  And now on top of that, senior Google scientist quits over censored Chinese search engine.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  It says a whole bunch of other top engineers quit.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  And he goes on the engineer to say to avoid contributing to the erosion of protection for dissidents.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  And he goes on to say due to my conviction that dissent is fundamental to functioning democracies.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  I am forced to resign in order to avoid contributing to or profiting from the erosion of protection for dissidents.
[27:48.000 --> 28:00.000]  He declared, I view our intent to capitulate to censorship and surveillance demands in exchange for access to the Chinese market as a forfeiture of our values and governmental negotiation positions across the globe.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  Yeah, it's the end of America.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  It's the end of freedom because every other government is going to fall to it.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  Notice it's already happening here.
[28:05.000 --> 28:19.000]  There is an all too real possibility that many nations, other nations will attempt to leverage our actions in China in order to demand our compliance with their security demands.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  And that goes on from there.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  So there's your information right there.
[28:26.000 --> 28:36.000]  I'm going to intercept.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Search app for Android devices.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  See, these big eggheads are really smart mathematically, but they never do full spectrum analysis.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  Which are new machines can't do properly either.
[28:47.000 --> 28:55.000]  And they don't understand that there's most of them even know their compartmentalized sitting on top, a giant censorship system already in place.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  They already have one here.
[28:56.000 --> 29:25.000]  They're already doing it here.
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn American made jeans.

[34:20.000 --> 34:42.000]  Now, I said earlier that the normal response in history by Winston Churchill, by George Washington, by Abraham Lincoln,
[34:42.000 --> 34:51.000]  if a foreign power sees control of the telecommunications infrastructure and was engaged in mass censorship, propaganda,
[34:51.000 --> 35:04.000]  and then wouldn't even work with the nation's military and moved its bases to a country that had killed 110 million people,
[35:04.000 --> 35:19.000]  the response to that is seizing control of it. It's not a private company. It is a combine when you put Apple and Google and Facebook
[35:19.000 --> 35:35.000]  and all the little pilot fish that follow it that work in unison as a criminal monopoly racket. And they all have like ponytails and dreadlocks and little cute shoes and outfits.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  And all these executives, they all talk real wimpy. That's called camouflage. These people are not cute. They're not funny.
[35:44.000 --> 35:52.000]  They help run death camps in China. Tim Cook would put me in a gulag and have my organs harvested like that.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  Tim Cook would line me up, stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger and blow my brains off the wall like that.
[35:58.000 --> 36:10.000]  He pays no taxes. He's a savage criminal. He helps China murder people in mass. He has the worst factories at every level. It's pure selfishness.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  Just like every major study in Europe and the United States shows, the left is what? Six times more likely to steal. Look it up.
[36:17.000 --> 36:28.000]  Nine times more likely to not give to charity. And many times more likely you can pull different studies to tell you they gave to charity.
[36:28.000 --> 36:42.000]  It's called being a monster. Anybody that works in the hospitality business will tell you from the studies and statistics I've read from waiters to maids to prostitutes,
[36:42.000 --> 36:51.000]  they'll tell you conservatives pay the most, pay up and like to pay.
[36:51.000 --> 37:00.000]  But these anglerfish like Tim Cook dangling their little light out in front of them or you think that they're the light.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  But Lucifer cast the false light. He's the angel of light, the morning star.
[37:08.000 --> 37:20.000]  Christ was called the morning star as well in the Bible because if they call Lucifer the morning star doesn't mean his name is really the morning star.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  Which is the Bible letting you understand if you have knowledge and are able to understand it.
[37:26.000 --> 37:41.000]  Just give us those that don't have discernment that the devil takes everything over and counterfeits it and then claims it is once not.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  But I digress.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  Google is a foreign power.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  Google has a GDP.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  Bigger than California.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  Apple.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  Look it up has a GDP.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  I guess you could say a gross production product instead of calling it domestic product.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  California.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  California is one of the new beats the GDPs of several major countries.
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.000]  And they want to not just work with China to carry out authoritarianism and spy on people.
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  They want to do it here and they are and they're conscious.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  And again all of them sitting around acting like hippies is their unified camouflage.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  All of us are pulls up in an ice cream truck and you know have a puppy in the back or you know a seven year old kid that lures the other kids and says let's go play.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  And then the nice man goes hi I got a balloon just get in the back.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  You're going to get ice cream.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  And you got all these executives are going we're liberal.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  Hi.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  Hi everybody.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  Come on over.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  Oh you want a balloon.
[39:08.000 --> 39:18.000]  Just stick your arm in here and I'm going to take you down and you're going to see all the giraffes and the monkeys and the other clowns.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Just stick your arm in here.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  We're liberal.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Hey Georgie.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  Why don't you come on over here and I'll take real good care of you.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  I'm going to take real good care of your children.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Take those vaccines.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  See in the movies where these vampires that tear your children from limb but in the real world we kill them real slow.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  We kind of like call it a background ambient energy.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  And then we have little special rituals and things we do while we torture and rape your children to death.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  But we're liberal so it's okay.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  Georgie.
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.000]  Oh Tim Cook is a nice man.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  He'll take real good care of you.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  It's why he doesn't pay any taxes.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  Why he runs the worst slave factories in the world where they force people to have abortions and drug them.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  They got suicide nets everywhere.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  And the company reports somebody gave him a problem.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  They get a phone call.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  They get a message in the Chinese government takes him away.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  Just like Apple wants to get rid of your app here in America.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  They do it.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  That's what you do sometimes.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  I mean you know what are we going to do?
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Georgie.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  I find you're like a face disturbing.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Don't act so surprised Tim Cook.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  You aren't on any mercy mission this time.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  Now we've reached the point where their own executives are going public and admitting what criminals they are.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  And the whole house of cards is coming down.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  But they're going to fight back and try to remove Trump and remove us.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  And so we're in a death battle.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  So I just would encourage the public to be honest about this.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  We have a clear and present foreign powers in our country censoring everything.
[41:22.000 --> 41:31.000]  The Chinese government's running TV ads and radio ads and print ads and promoting a book calling for our president to be removed via the 25th amendment.
[41:31.000 --> 41:42.000]  Yeah, they want the cabinet to vote him out and nullify you and make us a dictatorship like the cabinet is a Politburo like they have in China.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  They don't have elections in China.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  No.
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.000]  But they have the Central Committee and they have the Politburo and then the communists decide who the president will be until this year.
[41:55.000 --> 42:03.000]  When they made their dictator a full dictator and made his vice president vice president for life.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  But they're going to use our system to tell us to remove our president.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  And we're going to sit there.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  We're going to take that.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  By the way, the news is out.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Trump's going to accelerate the tariffs.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  He's going to mass the military over there.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  And he's not blinking to the chai comms.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  And so they're doing everything they can to remove our president.
[42:21.000 --> 42:30.000]  A foreign power is meddling one trillion times that the Russians could ever imagine.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  And are we going to sit there and are we going to take that as a country?
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  I'm asking you that right now.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And we got something really special when we come back.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  A couple of things that are really special.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  And we have Bezos selling the president.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  It's dangerous for him to call the media the enemy of the public.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  They're getting ready a false flag.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  They call him a Nazi enemy and they say kill him.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  He says that's really horrible.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  Fake news is the enemy.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  They then represent.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  He goes, oh, he says the first amendment is the enemy.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  The president is dangerous.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  They're getting ready to attack themselves.
[42:55.000 --> 43:24.000]  We'll be back.
[43:25.000 --> 43:51.000]  We'll be back.
[43:51.000 --> 44:17.000]  We'll be back.
[44:17.000 --> 44:43.000]  We'll be back.
[44:43.000 --> 45:09.000]  We'll be back.
[45:09.000 --> 45:35.000]  We'll be back.

[47:01.000 --> 47:30.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.000 --> 47:44.000]  You take a model man and put him in control.
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  Watch him become a god.
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  Watch people's heads roll.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  You go.
[48:00.000 --> 48:09.000]  Apple, Hollywood, they've chosen the most satanic murdering force on earth, the chai comms, as their alliance.
[48:09.000 --> 48:17.000]  And they're now moving with authoritarianism and classical brainwashing and racial division and cultural division and attacks on our families.
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  Things that are illegal in China and their own communist system to break us.
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  But there are those of us that don't care about the intimidation, that don't care about the threats.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  We care about our birthright and we are not going to put up with these globalists.
[48:35.000 --> 48:47.000]  In fact, we're born and bred and live to bang heads with these pieces of crap.
[48:47.000 --> 48:56.000]  I probably should just mention all the insane news and I guess we have coming up. Chris Tonto, Peranto, one of the great heroes of Benghazi is going to be joining us next hour.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  And of course, Obama came out and said that basically Benghazi did never happen.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  He said it's the whole thing's a conspiracy theory.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  Now, isn't that what they say I said about Sandy Hook?
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  No, the public didn't buy Sandy Hook.
[49:11.000 --> 49:18.000]  The public doesn't believe the media anymore. So sometimes they take things that did happen and think they didn't because they've been lied to so much.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  Because some of the major anomalies that got put out later, we could debunk.
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.000]  They weren't going in circles out of the school. I've now seen it proven it was out of the firehouse.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  It's still weird. That's why people question it.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  But the point is we have a right to that America.
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.000]  But then Trump takes Benghazi, something that's not debated. There was a stand down 13 hours.
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  ISIS al-Qaeda stealing the weapons out of the warehouses.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  Everybody else was told to stand down and leave hours before it even happened.
[49:49.000 --> 50:02.000]  It was a setup. Hillary was working with the security that provided security in the town that had been brought in as part of the Arab Spring.
[50:02.000 --> 50:08.000]  He's joining us because he got suspended on Twitter for when Obama came out and said,
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  Oh, the Benghazi didn't happen. That's an conspiracy theory.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  And Tonto's like, buddy, I was there.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  And even the Boston Globe said that this is Obama's lowest moment.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  Remember, Hillary got asked about arms out of Benghazi ship to Turkey?
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  She goes, Turkey? Turkey for Thanksgiving? She thinks the viewers are so dumb.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  They're like, you and Turkey got caught working together to start the Arab Spring in Syria.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  Didn't you ship the weapons? Which has now been proven.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  She's like, what? Turkey? Who's eating those?
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  So this is how they operate. We're going to be talking about all of it coming up.
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  It's outrageous. It truly is.
[50:51.000 --> 50:58.000]  Now, let's continue here.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  I've got something that is really hilarious.
[51:02.000 --> 51:10.000]  And so we're taking lemons that we've been given by the big tech sensors and we're turning it into luscious lemonade.
[51:10.000 --> 51:22.000]  And this is kind of the spirit of Info Wars that we take a licking and keep on taking the old Time Max adage that the Drudge applied to Info Wars.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And it's because we expect to be attacked.
[51:25.000 --> 51:35.000]  We expect the full spectrum could possibly happen to us and probably will because we intend to be leaders in fighting tyranny.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  We intend to be 100% in because if you're going to get in a fight, you better go balls to the walls.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  You better go 110% or you're going to get hurt.
[51:47.000 --> 51:57.000]  And so they've banned our Apple app that only came out six weeks ago, two weeks before the ban.
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  And then it went to number one and so they deleted that it was number one but it was still there.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  They went back to close to number one so they just totally did delete it.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  But it's still on your iPhones if you haven't. But the Android is still there at infowars.com.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  And it's on your phone for a few years. It'll work and it's a great app. People love it. It's the new app Info Wars official.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  So here's the original ad that Savannah put together with Drew, who are a great team here.
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  And we a little added something at the end that our own Rob Do, news director, put together. Here it is.
[52:28.000 --> 52:41.000]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer and TV.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  So we just released our free Info Wars official app.
[52:43.000 --> 52:51.000]  The Info Wars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the Holy Grail of Podcasts and Radio, the Alex Jones show.
[52:51.000 --> 52:58.000]  And the best part about the Info Wars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the Info War right in your pocket.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  So what are you waiting for? Sound like a...
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  That's your best info wars. Apple banned your app.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  I helped too.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  Ah, Oliver.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  I hate free speech too.
[53:20.000 --> 53:28.000]  We hate free speech. We hate free speech. We hate free speech. We hate free speech.
[53:30.000 --> 53:43.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. You can still get the app until CNN and Soros funded Buzzfeed and the ChaiCon merged Apple get together and I guess get Google to ban it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  You know, we are getting persecuted.
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.520]  And I don't want to say it's all a bit of better roses, but the results have been
[53:50.960 --> 53:57.840]  victory. I mean, at a gut level, a spiritual level, I feel good. Really for the first time
[53:57.840 --> 54:03.920]  in this 25-year quest, 26-year quest to sort of fight the globalist 24 years on air, I've
[54:03.920 --> 54:09.200]  always been very satisfied, but I just always have a burning that the enemy's going to win and
[54:09.200 --> 54:17.840]  then I'm literally, God's mad at me. And now, as we approach the real persecution, I'm serious.
[54:17.840 --> 54:22.800]  I feel God's presence more, discernment more, understanding more, peace more. Folks have noticed
[54:22.800 --> 54:26.320]  sometimes a little bit more calm now, even though we have this horrible storm obviously hitting the
[54:26.320 --> 54:34.960]  U.S., kind of mixed metaphors, that humanity is going to make it. Now, it's going to be a remnant
[54:34.960 --> 54:42.240]  of us, but this big test, you got to hit rock bottom before you start going back up and I'm
[54:42.240 --> 54:47.040]  just really impressed with everybody. I'm from the listeners, the activist, everybody. I'm really
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.520]  impressed with you and I'm really impressed with Trump and I'm really impressed with the drip,
[54:51.520 --> 54:54.960]  drip, drip of Google and Apple getting exposed and the crimes they're committing and Trump's
[54:54.960 --> 54:57.680]  getting ready to drop the hammer on them right now and you're seeing them strike back
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.960]  with all the videos coming out and it's a warning to Google. You think the stuff they release
[55:02.960 --> 55:09.520]  yesterday is bad? They've got everything. Oh, yeah, they've got the meetings with the Chinese.
[55:09.520 --> 55:16.480]  I mean, you know Google's really the CIA, but it's leftist run now, so it's run over to China and
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.040]  it's a civil war inside the intelligence agencies. You don't think it's all been recorded.
[55:22.720 --> 55:26.480]  You don't think all the crimes of Tim Cook at Apple and all the rest of these jerks
[55:26.480 --> 55:34.320]  aren't known and their scientists are resigning every day, top ones, saying you are pure evil.
[55:36.320 --> 55:43.680]  I mean, when I say Hitler killed roughly 20 million people, there's no doubt I talked to
[55:43.680 --> 55:48.480]  grandparents and used to go hunting before they all died. All those World War II vets were tank
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.360]  commanders, you name it. Grandpa was with the Army Navy, Army Air Corps, but talking to little
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.280]  tank commanders, they said, oh, there's dead bodies. There's millions of dead people everywhere.
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.360]  As far as you can see, there's dead women and children everywhere, huge death camps, just piles
[56:03.360 --> 56:09.120]  of dead bodies, blackbirds eating their eyeballs. I mean, and I was like, tell me a war story,
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.600]  tell me a war story. I'll tell you a war story. One more beautiful, the Marilyn Monroe walked out
[56:13.600 --> 56:19.360]  in the pulp fur coat naked, opened it up, started shooting at me with a rifle and I cut her in two
[56:19.360 --> 56:27.280]  from the top of that tank. Now, stop asking me to tell you stories. And the women do that to
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.560]  distract you like, you see that and then start, and that's what's going on, folks. That's real war,
[56:32.560 --> 56:44.800]  okay? Now, stop asking me those stories. Hitler killed 20 million people, probably more than that.
[56:44.800 --> 56:51.360]  I guess 21 million Russians died, so he killed a lot of people. I was forgetting the Russians,
[56:51.360 --> 56:58.960]  it's like 35 million, come on. The point is, the Nazis were really bad. The Chinese have killed
[56:58.960 --> 57:05.920]  100 plus million of their own people, they admit. They don't play games, folks. They kill little
[57:05.920 --> 57:09.920]  girls that people try to hide in their houses under the one child policy. I didn't even plug this hour.

[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.560]  Well we just saw the 17th anniversary of 9-11 earlier this week but it was also another
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.360]  anniversary. The sixth anniversary of Benghazi of my, I don't have a teleprompter here,
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:43.200]  so we've got Chris Tonto Peronto one of the main heroes of the patriots that survived at the tragic
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.800]  event there at the US Special Mission Annex in Benghazi Libya when Hillary stood down and Obama
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.040]  stood down. We'll play the clip next segment where Obama got a lot of trouble this weekend,
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.840]  last weekend saying that Benghazi didn't even help him conspiracy theory that's my bad Obama
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.600]  imitation. Even a lot of liberals said that is next level so we'll be talking about all of that
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.600]  with Chris but you're there in Alabama I guess that big old hurricane's a little bit north of you.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.440]  Yeah no it's it's a little ways on the on the Atlantic coast we're closer to the the Gulf it
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.680]  didn't come this way so I think I think we're okay in fact I wish we had a little bit of cloud
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.880]  cover it's a hundred degrees out in a hundred hundred percent humidity it's it's it's hot it's
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.680]  hot and you're out there doing some firearms training with citizens. Yeah actually yeah of
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.840]  course so I have a company called Battleline tactical myself and Dave Boone Benton Ben Morgan
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.080]  from Morgan Timing System Larry Stevenson Larry the black bearded cowboy he's one of my instructors
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.640]  for Benny Glossop we uh we uh come out we teach people how to shoot and teach people how to defend
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.280]  themselves and be more confident and it's it's a great it's a great day great day to be out here
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.520]  yeah. Well speaking of censorship we'll get into the main meat of the interview here
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.360]  sorry the next segment but speaking of all the censorship uh you've got Chris Tonto Peranto.com
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.040]  at Chris Peranto on Twitter where are other places where people to get to you if you do get
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.520]  totally banned on Twitter because you just got suspended this week. Oh yeah yeah Facebook I have
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.240]  a public page and a private page the public page is just Chris Perano you can look for
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.680]  Battleline tactical that's my Facebook page 14th hour foundation that's my Facebook page I have a
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.960]  foundation as well and then Instagram I'm pretty pretty uh regular on and it's just Chris underscore
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.040]  Peranto underscore Tonto I still can't get verified by any of them except Facebook go figure so
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.680]  you won't see a blue check mark I'm trying though but I guess I'm not I'm I guess I'm not important
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.880]  enough and you know so what in their eyes so uh if you don't see a blue check mark just go Chris
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.320]  underscore Peranto underscore Tonto and that's me that's right fake accounts are a big problem
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.160]  and now that I've been taking off Twitter everywhere else they've got all these fake accounts
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.720]  saying I'm Alex Jones that's saying horrible KKK stuff you name it it's very clear that once they
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.240]  silence you then they can really lie about you yeah yeah then they can spin and and and paint uh
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.120]  paint the general public uh any picture they want about you luckily for me though and out to me I
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.760]  will talk about it I I this has been honestly a blessing because people are starting to say holy
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.920]  crap what was being a lot people didn't know what Benghazi was and now they're like oh my gosh
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.520]  what was Benghazi this actually happened and here's a guy that was part of it and then they
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.000]  go see pig or they find odd and they see there are other guys out there so it's not just me
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.720]  trying to vouch for a story or what happened there there was a whole team that was left behind by
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.880]  this is like Holocaust denial because they say that I'm denying uh Sandy Hook which I'm not
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.120]  they just edit tapes together and take out a context but then he's literally saying it's a
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:41.520]  conspiracy theory it's it's crazy and and again as long as there's people like myself like yourself
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.640]  out there standing up and saying and calling them on it calling on their bs whether I get banned
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.720]  or not I'm still gonna keep calling them on it good people because this country still has
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.040]  fantastic american spirit good people are still gonna see the truth and they're gonna come forward
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.360]  but like you said brother and I we've been to this before it's america we're just gonna keep pushing
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.240]  and pushing and overcoming obstacles like we do that's what we do is as american we come back
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.920]  we've got one more segment with you and I know you're busy they're training you work in seven days
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.320]  a week and public speaking and firearms training very exciting I want to get right into Benghazi
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.760]  and what really did happen and play the clip from obama and so much more but just briefly the 30
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.640]  seconds we have what do you make of the big tech giants google and apple moving to china I think
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.480]  it's a national security threat and they want to work with our military google what they're helping
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.640]  the chinese military with AI I think these are treasonous companies I and I haven't seen anything
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.240]  that to think otherwise to be honest with you it is about money maybe um are they taking american
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:44.320]  jobs away well it looks like it um so it's just in that respect I think it's treasonous but uh
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.720]  it's a definite definite eye open for the administration the trump administration they
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.240]  need to keep an eye on it I'm not a big person of the law state government but when you have

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.800]  he's a sociopath what else do you expect and people are i hope now are starting to see that i think
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.280]  more people are that are meryl the road starting to see how narcissistic he is and he's going to try
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.320]  to rewrite history but it's not going to happen i'm not going to let him do it especially not in
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.920]  bengali because i did lose friends that night we did try to sacrifice ourselves we did to make
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.880]  sure others came home and ronan did ronan bub did sacrifice himself they gave the ultimate sacrifice
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.000]  and you don't you don't uh you don't uh denigrate that you don't treat that as a negative uh barak
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.320]  christain obama and say it didn't happen when guys did gave it their lives because you didn't
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.080]  you didn't feel like doing anything but there's so many levels to this he is a jerk with hillary
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.200]  that left you there for 13 hours and i've talked to a lot of folks like colonel shaffer and others
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.560]  evidence that they knew what was going on we're trying to get the weapons to al qaeda and isis
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.600]  which we has now been basically confirmed so let's just say it everybody else stood down ran off you
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.560]  guys didn't get the word it refused to stand down they sent people there to kill everybody it didn't
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.680]  work so here's the guy that bare minimum and through negligence i almost got you guys killed
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.400]  got some of your buddies killed and then he's going to rub it in and say it didn't happen it didn't
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.960]  because they easily manipulated are going to try to believe they're going to believe him if you
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.640]  don't have any any sort of common sense you're you're going to believe what your messiah says and
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.760]  a lot of people still hold him in that regard um i love donald trump jr when he said he helped he
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.920]  did support me on it he said yeah he barak obama's negligent homicide you know it was um again you
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.120]  know that this is a blessing with us getting banned because now it's waking people up to
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.440]  what's actually going on and we just got to keep fighting fighting a good fight brother that's all
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.320]  we can do and and and if he says something like that again i'll come out and say it and i'll report
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.320]  in kind again and and put him in his place that's what needs to be done well they started telling us
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.920]  you better you know not get involved in the campaign or support republicans we're going to ban you
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.560]  i mean we got the messages we didn't back down they banned us it's totally blown up in their face
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:22.640]  and now google's under investigation facebook is apple again has moved to china uh both those
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.960]  companies won't work with the pentagon on ai they're giving the chinese military our ai when we
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.240]  all know darpa set up google i'm i'm a free market guy when you're free market but these companies
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.280]  are operating a lot of them are bigger than major nations their gdp like like a foreign army
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.880]  allied with foreign enemies that are authoritarian's and i just think we need to have serious move on
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.440]  these folks i could tell people the white house and uh patriots of this government are looking at
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.000]  it i was in congress last week and saw senator cotton talk about you know does google need to
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.600]  get swat teamed because i mean the stuff they're doing is not just a censorship but they just rampant
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.520]  working with dictators and then moving to china it's it really gets me concerned uh this is again
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:09.840]  more the administration and and and mr cotton of course senator senator congress senator cotton
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.760]  senator cotton gentlemen like that need to stay on the ball like they are um as far as utilizing
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.560]  force with these companies that's a hey that's that's higher levels in me i i used to do that i
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:27.840]  don't do that anymore um well i'm not calling for that i'm saying what will we do in 1939 if we found
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.920]  out hitler had taken control of all our major companies and was censoring americans and telling
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.920]  us how hitler we would we would go to those companies and tell those executives knock it off
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.120]  right now instead have you seen where google took this year told the pentagon we're not helping you
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.880]  with anything okay and then they ran over and are working with the chinese government if we could get
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.360]  and we got a good president that can handle this i really believe he can it's just we need to get
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.800]  jeff sessions needs to go brother if we can get somebody within the as far as within the justice
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.760]  department that has a set of balls that will do something then then we can start to move forward
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.240]  but by you seeing it by me seeing it by the general populist see it don't think donald trump
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.240]  doesn't see president trump doesn't see it we're moving forward in that direction and by you continually
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.960]  talking about it we continue to take the fight to them and that's all we can do we can only do that
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.440]  until the president says you know what this is what i have this is black and white it's not
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.600]  subjective this is objective what they're doing they're being treated you're right espionage
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  we're gonna take it we're gonna go ahead and and deal with them importantly based off our justice
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.600]  system based off the constitution of what they shouldn't be doing by the way i was told this by
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.760]  high-level sources the pentagon and in the white house last week and i said it last week people
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.400]  now see it it's not five top engineers hundreds have left over this and it's in mainstream news
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.040]  today that their top engineer quit a pulsing and said you are aiding and abetting in the
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.640]  authoritarian regime rounding up and killing their people he said this is treason and so more
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.200]  and more and then you've got john kerry secretly meeting with the iranians to undermine our our
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.880]  government that that's illegal if i went to iran outside and tried to negate us policy
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.760]  i couldn't do that here as a citizen i can't go to iran i go under the prison yeah if these guys
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.760]  these these politicians they all feel like they're above the law because the last eight years maybe
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:23.120]  even the last 16 years and um if they would be held accountable this would stop one of them be held
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.200]  accountable this would stop um that's where again where i talk about jeff sessions needs to go we
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.880]  got to get somebody in the justice department that hasn't had some balls have some teeth that's
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.200]  willing to take it to these people until then you're still going to see a lot of these politicians
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.600]  these liberal politicians undermine the united states of america and we're seeing it you're
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.760]  just pointing it out but if i ask you to point it out we're still taking the fight to them and that's
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.400]  we have to do to stay positive to keep doing it it's it's necessary well christ i agree and i think
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.120]  because of the lawlessness and above the law arrogance these companies are crazy i mean i read
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.920]  the stuff they're doing that's admitted i can't even believe it and i didn't even know they were
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.400]  having hearings uh specifically admitting that china is taking over i was actually pleased
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.680]  here's some of the committee talking about that i'm gonna have a few months left please come back
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.760]  for full 30 minutes an hour soon you gotta go finish teach your class but other points you'd
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.680]  like to add to the listeners the viewers uh just about you know the other survivors have been gauzy
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.560]  what they thought of obama saying nothing happened to you you don't exist well i of course take one
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:28.720]  on fox and and he he retorted as well it we all are pissed we all get angry uh and i don't want
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.240]  because i don't boss or boons out there teaching right now um every one of us you know every one
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.520]  of us gets pissed off about every one of us wants to tell it to his face say hey hey you know what
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:47.120]  stop just shut your mouth obama stop talking about it um so all we but we gotta stay positive
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.160]  gotta keep fighting gotta keep moving forward and and i've said it a million times um because the
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.240]  only way we can win this fight is by continually pointing out the corruption and the liberal
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.200]  hypocrisy and the left lies and the corporations that are under their umbrella that are lying for
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:07.840]  them like twitter like google like like uh apple and and hopefully which i'm seeing i think so i'm
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.440]  seeing it the american public will will voice uh their displeasure with it and the president will
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.480]  take it upon his back to to correct these groups and bring them to justice and bring these diplomats
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.720]  gotta start bring these diplomats in these these ex politicians like john carrey that are
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.640]  that are doing things illegally and violating national security and like hillary clinton who
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.560]  violated national security and holding them accountable make an example out of them and it
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.480]  will stop that's right chris tonterton com i know you got to go in five minutes this is a three

[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.640]  real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.960]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:19.440]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employ
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:26.320]  a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:32.080]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.560]  alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.440]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.200]  of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:20:01.520]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:24.080]  jones show he aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side you're listening
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:44.080]  to alex jones globalism is treason globalism is espionage not being a world citizen i'm all for
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:49.200]  that i'm all for internationalism people working together globalism is a world system of control
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.960]  taking nation state power away and transferring it to a quote global technocracy that's in the
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.440]  words of the devils group themselves they had a vote five years ago and said we are a technocracy
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:07.200]  and we believe the abolishment of elected leaders we want technocrats in place so i'm saying i'm all
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.800]  for not having government regulation i'm libertarian but when you have big corporations working with
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:17.200]  dictatorships like china to destroy our free speech to sell us out this is about survival
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.120]  i don't want to take google over and help me state run i want to have it taken over and then be
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.880]  transparent and and not be working with dictatorships just don't and again it's one thing to move
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.000]  there and work with dictatorships that's bad enough once you start trying to make america
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.240]  dictatorship as their own engineers say that's when you jump the shark uh he said his teams just
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.080]  went to launch he didn't know they were gonna go early so christ onto product and do like
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.400]  seven more minutes with us we appreciate that one of the heroes up in gauze and you were kind of
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.840]  fired up in the break making a point about uh obama and some other key things you said so
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.040]  please repeat what you said to me off air well i honestly bro what we can't even remember what
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.240]  we're talking about gets so fired up so you said you get so angry you want to reach through the
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.280]  well news is oh yeah well the the you know the liberals they they they really bit on that i was

[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.880]  think i felt i was left behind by beryl brock obama we're the team was left behind 13 hours for our
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:18.560]  own uh we lost people they died we continued to fight we tried to save people we saved over and
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.280]  including mine maybe to count my lives and the team's lives we saved over 30 people's lives um and
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.480]  then we come home and then we're called liars and the story spun out of control and yeah and
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.320]  people are what i did after that you all you had to want to write a book you want to write a move
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.760]  no i went to yemen i get to you to serve my country because i love the united states of america
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.160]  it was after eight months of being called a liar and seeing him spin it that finally is out of
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.520]  control so how do you think i'm going to feel when you say how do you how do you feel right now well
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.120]  i want to reach through the screen and choke him does that mean i want to kill the former president

[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.480]  saying it's a metaphor that he literally got your friends killed and lied about it with hillary
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.680]  and now he says you don't exist and how do you think that's going to make me feel i of course
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.720]  i'm it's going to it makes my blood boil because it's it's just disgusting and it means that he
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.520]  didn't care he didn't care anything about it he just watched him embrace you guys and say sorry
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.200]  things broke down because they know they ordered the stand down you don't stand down 13 hours that
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:37.040]  is what a alex that is what i said when i came back uh from yemen said if you guys behind closed
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.440]  doors take talking to my ci personnel my leadership c a if you could just tell me you're sorry

[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.480]  to work they couldn't even do that that's narcissism brother that's pride talking and that's that's
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.120]  that's evil that's the devil that's what we're up against and he will want to quote me on that
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.560]  or use that as a talking point fine but as people are seeing now essentially that is what we're up
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:10.320]  against right now it's just pure evil pure evil what do you make of the way they call the president
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:17.200]  of nazi and they say remove him 25th amendment and he says lying fake news his enemy of the people
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.840]  and then they lie and go he says the first amendment's the enemy of the people he's not censoring media
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.400]  they're the ones censoring all of us and calling him for him to be removed and calling for his
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.800]  kids to be kidnapped and raped and then he says stop lying about me you're the enemy of the people
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.960]  when you lie then they lie again and say that he's against the first amendment these people are
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.720]  incredible how much they lie it's just crazy it's it and it's all they got and and some people out
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.040]  there are still believing what they what they're selling so they're they're still they're still
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.720]  believing all that poop they're selling to him out there um but as you said and i said and i always
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.880]  said earlier this is a win with them what they did to me by by suspending mayfine suspend me from
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.560]  twitter take me off twitter i'll live to see tomorrow i'll go fishing no big deal um but what it did
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.440]  is it showed people of america that twitter is hypocritical even though jack goes on from the
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.080]  congress and says no we don't we're not part we're not left-leaning we're not partisan we're
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.880]  completely or we're completely fair no obviously you're not because you suspended a guy for correcting
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.200]  the former president of the united states and for calling a left-wing hate group that said obama
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.080]  killed uh i killed ubl oh yeah i saw that too that they literally are reaching out to the guy who
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.280]  reportedly was in the sill team that killed him and they're saying oh don't you know obama killed
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.240]  him it's it's bizarre you know what that showed that showed the true ignorance of the left that
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.880]  they have no clue what's going on when you're telling the guy rob o'neill the guy who shot ben
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:52.000]  laden that barack obama did and and you know i don't know who you are obviously you have no
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.840]  clue what's going on in the world except what you're what that's what you're getting fed by cnn
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:03.120]  and msnbc and by the the the liberal trolls there on twitter and it's it's a benefit it shows people
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.280]  that there is true ignorance and we're not just speaking out of the left side of our mouse we're
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.840]  speaking out the right side the correct side that these people are fake news and they're and they're
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.400]  spilling your stuff just so they can get their agendas i agree let's get back to that question
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.480]  why you stayed over but you're on fire today so i'm glad we had time to get to the other subjects
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.400]  have you seen the daily caller video over a year of footage of a thousand armed men
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.600]  camouflage uh horse some of them on a horseback coming in and the left says we should leave the
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.880]  border open when mexico is a collapsed war zone what type of insanity is this as you know as a
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:43.760]  as a patriot army ranger cia contractor hero bin gazi from a military mind as an infantryman
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:49.280]  mind and special ops mind what is this we're looking at well you're looking at at unconventional
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:54.320]  it's it's somewhat of an unconventional warfare they're gonna continue to bring people over slowly
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.840]  slowly there there are there are immigrants hey and out my grandfather was an immigrant he came over
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.320]  on a work visa he's from mexico if i didn't believe in immigration i wouldn't be in this country
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.160]  absolutely legal not illegal we got folks from me from mexico that work in here as producers
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.440]  they do a great job but they're here legally and fantastic so but illegal immigration because what
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.920]  happens is is you will get you will get fighters you will get people that hate this country you're
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.840]  going to get al qaeda and former isis and terrorists that are going to filter in along with it it's
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.480]  just it's happens that's how you do that's how they win fights so without securing the border
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.320]  all we're doing is we're leaving so ourselves open to attack maybe not it maybe not next year
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.680]  maybe not two years from now but in 10 15 years as they approve these people they have perseverance
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.080]  they have toughness and they will continue to bring people over until you know what 20 years
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.400]  we're ready i may be dead by then but i don't want my kids have to deal with that and attempt
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.000]  to overthrow so we need to secure those and we already see it in europe that once the islamists
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.960]  has hit five ten percent they i mean there's truck attacks and stabbing attacks acid attacks
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.560]  every day and the government's cover it up you know and and how do people just not see that
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.800]  not so you know i think was a good idea if we secure our borders the democrats don't want
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.080]  that and i shouldn't say democrats there's democrats and there's liberalists there is
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.880]  there's a difference i the liberals don't there used to be the democratic party now
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.400]  you're right you're right no you're you're right you're spot on i'm still i'm still giving up
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.640]  giving hope that there are still some true democrats out there but you know if they don't
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.320]  have these illegals in here they don't have the that status quo legal in here they're not going
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.760]  to win elections they've got to have it or they're never going to win an election again

[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:47.760]  all right you know we can sit here and talk about the good news the bad news but this this hurricane
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.440]  slamming already into the carolinas and just drenching over the rain causing big floods
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.160]  you know there's gonna be some loss of life that's unfortunate but we're on a very active dangerous
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.360]  planet so pray for everybody that is there in north and south carolina and inland as well

[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.560]  nick baggots coming up and then owens shawyer and so much more today and i've got a bunch of clips
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:26.800]  i want to get to but do you know how surreal it is to know obama ordered to stand down with hillary
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:34.720]  to ship the weapons that were in those warehouses that have been seized from qaddafi to the north
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.480]  to syria this is all come out but we knew within a week of it happening we had guest on
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:46.240]  colonel chefer and others who has a lot of courage i mean he got a lot i never got the full story but
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.760]  let me tell you know they've tried to put him in prison repeatedly for telling the truth about a
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.640]  bunch of issues he just so there's different types of courage yeah there's courage on top of those buildings
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:01.200]  being attacked by hundreds of islamists and then there's the courage and of course colonel chefer
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:07.440]  has been in combat as well so there's also the courage of telling truth about 9 11 and the stand
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.760]  down and protecting bin laden and then bin gazi you know that chefer and others talk about
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.520]  i wish you get his boss on from the london group he's really smart i've seen him on before on
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.480]  some of our other shows we should get that guy honest but i forgot to tell the producer but
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:23.040]  but i digress what i'm getting out here is
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.600]  i couldn't imagine losing some of my best friends those guys worked together for years
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:38.880]  and then obama says it didn't happen and it's a perfect illustration of how my listeners
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.560]  and the internet didn't think sandy hook happened i know mass shootings happen they're always on
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.320]  prozac they're always devil worshipers they're always white males for some reason i'm out against
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:54.960]  white people it's just true and they're always into satanism and nazism and communism this guy
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.920]  earlier this year down in uh by houston on the coast he had communist pens and nazi pens and was
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.760]  into you know they're just into whatever's bad whatever's evil they're satanist and some girls
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.360]  pissed him off so he wanted to go kill a bunch of girls that didn't go out with him it's like
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:20.720]  really dude wow so i'm just trying to imagine what it's like to have almost died have your buddies
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:28.960]  died and then obama who did it from start to finish the weapons deal they ordered all these
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.480]  people to go hundreds of us employee security from other groups but they left those there to get
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.480]  that ambassador they were just going to kill the security team of six guys and they were going to
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.440]  kill the ambassador and get it all the way but see those guys fought back and your imbred mindless
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:52.080]  jihadis couldn't get their act together they said a couple hundred got killed by six guys
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.000]  in a third 13 hours you know 10 hours of fire fights it wasn't until they got big old giant
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.080]  mortars on top of building and started firing them out of the thing you can't beat that when
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.200]  you're on top of building they're firing huge explosives a and because those guys fought and
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.680]  stuck it out it's like the alamo analogy the alamo fell but the example of 180 something people
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.240]  fighting 5000 and killing over 3000 that's a conservative number you know the number was
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.440]  inflated up to 10 000 and they killed 8 000 it's probably less than that but the mexican annals
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.040]  say it was thousands of dead mexican trips the example was how can you not get riled up by that
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.400]  people think oh look we killed everybody and we executed the two wounded guys we let the woman go
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.520]  and her baby had a black lady
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.920]  you think the santa anna said you go tell them how we killed everybody and then
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:51.200]  you ladies tell them how we're going to kill them what was santa anna thinking telling
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:38:00.000]  the sons of a bunch of scots and germans and irish and brits who just beaten the king of england
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.160]  and who loved to fight i'm going to kill you i'm going to kill the two survivors i'm going to burn
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.200]  their bodies right here santa anna thought that would intimidate them just like hitler thought
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:17.360]  bombing london and civilian targets would make people scared and so it's the same story
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.720]  in vengazi though a few lived so the story could be told
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.320]  and that's how it works you see that's what travis said victory or death
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:43.760]  and it wasn't some pissing contest travis wasn't really anybody people like with like 15 guys had
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.360]  taken on 300 soldiers in north texas and killed most of them so they said oh you're a colonel now
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:55.360]  here you know but the whole point was he believed as a christian in what he was doing and he didn't
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:01.600]  like the fact that the king's name is bible couldn't be taught in texas so he drew that line
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:15.120]  and said we're all gonna die but our example's gonna live on and now texas is the most profitable
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:27.280]  successful state in america and everybody wants to get into it because of andrew jackson and
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:39.440]  kernel william travis's will do not back down and now can you imagine what we have with texas
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  because a few people are willing to die if we have our alamo now
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:56.160]  the stars the limit interstellar advanced life you know it's been harder to get to this point
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.200]  in human development than it is to your interdimensional interstellar we're already there
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.840]  why do you think google and facebook and these big tech giants are so obsessed with poisoning you
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:10.400]  with fluoride and poison and and and all this culture of death because they don't want you to
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.960]  have your inheritance you're about to go to the inheritance meeting and about to be given the
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.160]  golden ticket and they're like oh you gotta stay out there and watch football and fight over race
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:26.960]  and stuff when it's all space is energy it's unlimited resources just like kanye and his spirit
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.360]  says my spirit tells me it's unlimited we just gotta come together and love and it's all over
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:38.560]  it's a we can do anything because he is tied into god the golden we got the golden ticket folks

[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.080]  what color they are where they came from within but because they had beautiful souls they came
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.080]  together and created something better people go oh great open the borders you can't bring in giant
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:38.960]  third world populations brainwashing weaponized if we could bring in folks and actually educate
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.280]  them we could bring in unlimited probably and send them back to make their own countries
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.240]  prosperous but we don't have ideological control yet

[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:28.720]  is a victory for satan satan isn't trying to kill the planet satan is trying to kill billions and

[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.800]  it's a prayer for the folks there in south and north carolina particularly
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.560]  you know george straight people could say oh the music's simple but you know it's so genuine

[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:04.160]  hour on this live friday edition i need to do this because you know i say this a lot
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:12.800]  because i'm mad at myself seriously i bitch and complain that we're having trouble expanding
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.480]  because the lawsuits the attacks and the globalist and all the rest of it
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:24.880]  but then if i plugged every segment our problems would be solved but i just love the info so much
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.760]  and the clips and the guests that i i just what am i supposed to say
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.000]  number one i want to sell you products that work really good cereal because i want to use them
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:45.760]  and i want them to work great but but also i know they're gonna test them over and over again
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.960]  let's try to find something wrong even under california standards that nobody can pass
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:54.720]  everything whole food says and sells jeff bezos owns it has a sticker on it or play clip him in a
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.800]  moment saying does not pass california standards and you know why he does that even though most
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:08.560]  the whole food stuff does pass it these labs are left us so what's that tell you yeah a lot of them
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:15.040]  have been caught jacking it you can open a supplement open air in a parking garage and it won't pass
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:24.880]  the lead standards it's the EU has the second strongest laws california's laws are 100 times
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:34.000]  stronger than the EU kale has 20 something times the lead california allows it takes spectrometer
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.160]  million dollar devices to find the lead
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.840]  but when they find it they sue your ass off
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:52.880]  so people say why do you need all this money well we're it's hard to run a media empire it's hard
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.920]  to fund all this stuff it's hard to bust a bandwidth now that we're not on youtube
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:03.920]  and now that we're not all these things instead of me paying three million dollars a year for
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:09.200]  bandwidth it's gonna be 10 million yeah that's the estimate right now we're trying to get lower
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:19.360]  prices 10 million dollars victims of our own success sometimes i see our own servers and i go wow
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:25.280]  that video got two million views are like yeah it'll cost you two thousand dollars i'm like oh great so
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.960]  just to give you an idea anybody who's running a business knows how expensive are imagine this
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:40.640]  place it's crazy town crazy town that's why i love am and fm stations and uhf and vhf and cable
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:45.280]  there's no bandwidth cost other than satellites you know we spend million dollars a year on
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.480]  a few satellites you send out those feeds and they pick them up and then it's there that's great
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:59.040]  so they took our sponsors away four or five years ago and that was like seven eight million
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:05.440]  dollars they took away and then they took away our google ads and they took away our credio ads
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:11.680]  and i'm still trying to do work out something to advertise on drudge i'll see how that goes but i mean
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:17.200]  it's just this ongoing and i'm not complaining i know i'm gonna fight against tyrants it's just
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:23.520]  if you knew i don't want to spend my time scrounging around for money as long as my car fires up
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:29.280]  and i can buy dinner and i got medicine for my kids i don't worship the monies what i'm saying
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:36.160]  money is fuel i use to live my life and defeat the globalism i want you to be secure i want you
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:45.840]  to be wealthy i want you to be in charge i'm not a globalist i want us to make you poor but the
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:55.040]  biggest thing and the biggest value you've got in your life is your own health and i'm not the poster
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:53:04.960]  child of perfect health uh because i work 18 hours a day and uh you know i eat horribly
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:11.520]  eat a lot of vegetables but also can eat like 50 ounces of meat so you know in a day i'm like i
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:21.360]  am a caveman it's just true so but i was a ginormous fat ass just five years ago before i started
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:26.080]  taking x2 and it kind of spoiled me i was working out hard and couldn't lose weight because i didn't
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:31.840]  have the good halogen iodine but as soon as i got it it was like magic now it's made me lazy
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:38.640]  i'm gonna work out once a week now it's it's really bad because the supplements just have done so much
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.080]  for my body if i just worked out more i you know i look like superman and i'm talking about doing
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.800]  on the next few months just to have a big dramatic transformation but the point is is that uh survival
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:56.080]  shield x2 is selling out and i told you six months ago i told you a year ago we even put over a barrel
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:01.120]  by the oil companies that get it and they're drilling between seven and 12 000 feet and the price
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:06.480]  for us has gone up threefold in the last few years and then they're always late getting it to us and
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:12.320]  so we're sold out half the time and i i just broke the contract i said you know i bought a record
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:18.320]  amount of this six months ago as our last run if they wouldn't and i played gutsball and they said
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.760]  fine your contracts terminated well that's fine x2 is gone then but i got a significant suspicion
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:30.960]  the way equilibrium works that we're going to get another oil company or drilling company
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:39.040]  that's going to give us access to pure 9999999999.0 i9 and we've got a few things it'll take months
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.440]  to get it going then months to find the new distributor and the company the new laboratory
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:49.120]  to put together and all the dga licensing and my gut tells me six months a year but maybe it'll
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:56.080]  come quicker the point is that if you want x2 that's changed so many lives that had so many
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:02.720]  lives it has almost six thousand something a little bit let's pull it up all the lives it's changed
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.080]  reviews on power reviews it's like a what a 4.9 from memory let's pull it up see if i'm right
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:15.200]  i'm going from memory here x2 is incredible i mean i'm being told by experts but once you get pure
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:23.120]  i9 in now there it is six thousand plus that like all those sunspots you gotta go away oh all the
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:30.560]  stuff will come out of your skin oh your libido oh it all happened it all happened so if you want
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.080]  x2 and you want to support the broadcast i mean my god i was just saying give me a $29 donation
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:46.560]  help find the show you do that but why not experience the good halogen because they're
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:57.040]  bombarding you with whether like 15 i looked this up last night 15 different bad halogens chlorine
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:02.240]  bromide bromine fluoride and then different variants there's a whole bunch of them there's
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.040]  probably hundreds of different variants but but 14 big ones they're like a few up on the periodic
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:12.720]  table this is the good one and when you learn the globalists are obsessed with piling on the bad ones
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:21.840]  you're crazy if you don't experience x2 for yourself so yeah um i thought we'd have three
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:29.360]  four weeks of x2 at 25 percent off at this deal the sales going so well that will sell out within
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:35.040]  two weeks at 25 off so i'm going to tell you we're going to end the sale sometime next week
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:41.440]  of 25 off on x2 and by the way bio tricillinium goes really great with it you want energy you
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.240]  want stamina it's electrochemical your whole body operates off of it the two go together but i'm not
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:53.040]  going to lie to you you take bio tricillinium it's got mustard seed pure concentrate in it
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:58.880]  you make your hair fall out bare man i mean you want to lose about in fact i can't take bio
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.920]  tricillinium i get too aggressive i've already got regular most men at 45 have low testosterone

[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:26.960]  ago one of the producers zack has told me about it and i was even looking saw comments last night
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:35.520]  about it apparently they took clips of me a year and a half ago in february of 2017 on joe rogan's
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:42.000]  podcast in los angeles and they cut it in with elon musk and it's like word for word the same
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  thing now i'm not plagiarizing elon musk he's not plagiarizing me
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:58.400]  me the globalist have put this in white papers musk has gone to the conferences where they're
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:05.600]  all taking weird synthetic crazy drugs and having sex and doing the wall to stuff always in a
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.120]  hedonistic atmosphere and they're just like the spirit of light says we will merge the machines
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:17.600]  and become gods first earth must die first earth must die we worship sella god god six six six
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.920]  hail satan you're like you're saying hell satan they go satan is actually god and so musk is
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:29.520]  these meetings going god oh my this is insane and so everybody's calling me about this i haven't seen
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:33.920]  it yet i've just been hearing about it so we can bleep out the cussing which i haven't seen it i'm
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.720]  sure it's every 10 seconds because i guess that's what makes you offending we will play that coming
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:46.400]  up at the end of the hour and just have them posted in full wars dot com because i forgot as much
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.600]  here's the deal i'm not having fun watching clubs myself i i get enough of myself but
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:57.600]  everything musk is saying and that's why they're trying to destroy this company
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.320]  is what the globalists have said now you can go well they're crazy they're not going to carry this
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.800]  out okay people that believe they're going to merge the machines and blast off and spaceships
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.560]  and take over the galaxy but only after they kill us that sounds like an alien transmission
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.280]  from deep space like a interdimensional you know thing to our sixth sense like kill yourselves
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.920]  you'll have power build the machines build me the weapons i will give you i mean i i'm kind of
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.800]  figuring out this movie plot i think you figured out like the bible says it like somebody else got
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:34.560]  the transmission and they went oh i got another transmission you know john and and and and so
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:39.600]  many other people john the revelator then we should come in with the pash mode john the revelator
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:47.680]  what a what a great sounding song but what a song of crap it's like two plus two equals 20
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:54.320]  two plus two equals 19 two plus two equals 157 million john the revelator stole god from the
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:03:02.480]  muslims muslims all lead us to bong bong bong bong and you're like there weren't muslims for 500 years
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:10.480]  years when he was on the ala patmos it's like the left doesn't care it just sounds good to go
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:15.760]  he's a screwed over muslims he stole the religion oh my god it's so incredibly cool
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:25.040]  and now it's even true so see we're getting these transmissions through the deep space internet
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:31.600]  the sixth sense which is just our brain hitting a higher dimension and the enemy saying kill
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:39.200]  yourselves murder eat babies i will give you power if you do oh yes oh how about we just tune that out
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:40.080]  and just don't do that
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:50.240]  to see they tell you to get power in this dimension acting like that but you don't
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:56.560]  these evil forces can only manipulate a lower dimension they can't control a higher powerful
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:03.120]  dimension so you're only screwing yourself out from the golden ticket i just i just keep going
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:10.080]  back and that's why they want me on fair folks but don't you think that if this was all going on
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:16.160]  metaphysically that god wouldn't have people there to give you a warning and believe me i'm no spring
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:22.320]  chicken i'm no angel cake you can't be dialed into this thing and not be permanently scarred
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:31.280]  by picking up the transmissions of the globalist i mean these people god almighty especially at night
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:38.560]  god what's going on on the whole psychic network is just like whoa torturing babies murdering people

[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.320]  into doing the right thing that they could try to stop our whole recovery i mean they're already
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:35.840]  blaming trump saying oh he's not for carbon taxes so that's why it happened so i'll cover two
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:42.240]  topics if you're in south carolina if you're in north carolina and you've got a phone line that

[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.560]  every time i turn on the television it's a democrat or jeff bayes i was gonna put a clip in a moment
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:10.480]  saying trump says the first amendment's evil and he says attack it violently well he didn't say that
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.480]  he said fake news when they say i'm a nazi or they say i hate you or they say the economy's
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:23.520]  horrible they're trying to demoralize you they're the enemy of the american people they're globalist
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.400]  they work with multinationals trump is telling you the truth he realizes the power of the truth
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.560]  and you heard eric bowling in here the other day he's like yeah trump's a great guy but man
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:38.000]  he wants to be the guy that turns the world around not just america he like is into success
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:45.840]  these globalists are into losing and and having control of you trump wants to see everybody sore
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.280]  and that they don't like that so i want to get your take on do you agree with me they're gonna
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:01.440]  pull a false flag within three days left i mean they they've run i said 350 op ads first the
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:08.560]  boston globe said a month ago or whatever six weeks ago we want 200 newspapers to run op ads on
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:14.560]  this day in august saying trump wants to murder the press he's a dictator get rid of it and it was
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:22.400]  like 350 did but that was 350 articles they got syndicated i can't even keep track of it's it's
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:30.160]  tens of thousands and then every channel i see i hardly even watch tv i'll i'll be in a bar or
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.680]  restaurant or just in the car and i turn it on it's like alex jones wants to use battle rifles
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:43.600]  to murder the media and then i'm like wait for it wait for it wait for it don't hold your breath
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:50.640]  you never hear it because i didn't say that they say trump wants to murder the press
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:57.200]  trumps get the media killed i'm gonna get the media killed they don't do a giant rollout in tens
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:02.800]  of thousands of articles in every news channel over and over again where i can't even hide from it
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.760]  because it's not like fun to go oh look i'm in more articles saying i'm gonna murder people how
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:21.200]  much fun it's not like oh cool i'm famous oh wonderful when i'm sticking a worm on the end

[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:35.360]  i'm probably just catching perch because my young children think it's cute like most of it's just

[02:10:51.120 --> 02:11:04.480]  hook worms in the water i'm not a rocket scientist but i do see clearly and when they're running around
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:12.240]  foaming at the mouth saying we're gonna kill people and they've got the young turks and see
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:18.320]  and msb did you see him threaten ribby oh it's gonna be violent young turks oh did you see him

[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.000]  they can be the saviors the talking point has gone out
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:37.680]  out just like your little kid in the kitchen and mama gets the pancake mix out of the cupboard
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.480]  and she gets the milk and you know mama's making pancakes this is not rocket science
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.360]  and mama gets eggs out mama what do we have for breakfast you're having pancakes and eggs
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:51.760]  and she gets bacon out they are got it all out on the table they're frying the bacon
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:57.920]  they're flipping pancakes they got eggs frying right here but it didn't eggs it in the sweet
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:04.800]  smell of eggs and bacon it's the smell of 127 children killed when a group of militia backed
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:08.240]  by jones stormed the local school and killed the children at point blank range
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.720]  overwhelmed angry citizens hit info wars with fire bombs jones was seen being killed in the

[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:31.760]  if we don't stop them i mean they are advertising wall to wall that we're gonna kill the media
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.520]  and they're lying about what we all we're saying is you're a pack of liars you say we're nazis
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.840]  and you say we hate america and you say we're doing all this we don't that's not true
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:48.640]  and they go oh my god you're gonna kill us with the gorshets hearings they had paid sorrows

[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:03.360]  found out how big it was and i was we were buying and they said oh we want more money more money and
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:09.520]  oh this and that and so i've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:13.920]  ingredient that goes in next to it that literally is so pure that if you put in a picker dish on top

[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:35.280]  if you don't lower it i'm done i'm breaking the contract well i broke the contract last week and
[02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:39.920]  so this is potentially the last run in fact right now it is the last run there's a bible

[02:19:54.720 --> 02:20:04.720]  now you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:24.720]  live raw and unfiltered it's the alex jones show
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:33.920]  you know i just thought of something obama came out we had chris punto peranto one of the heroes
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:41.200]  of Benghazi on last hour i just thought about how ridiculous it is to have obama come out and say
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:49.200]  Benghazi didn't happen and then our listeners questioned sandy hook and then we looked at it
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:53.360]  and school shootings happened we said okay it happened and the media keeps saying i didn't say
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:59.760]  it happened but people have a right to say the moon's made of cheese if they want but then i thought
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:06.000]  about how the media makes fun of even saying that there are false flags even in fiction
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:12.880]  you know about false flags like star wars episode three revenge of the sith
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:21.280]  the senator who wants to become emperor stages a terror attack on the capital planet coruscant
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:28.560]  to then draw the jet eye away and then have a paramilitary force in place to exterminate them
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:38.240]  or episode four star wars a new hope where they see the landcrawler all blown up and laser blasted
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:45.600]  and luke skywalker says obama goes man i've never heard of sand people attacking a target this big
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:51.360]  and these blast sites they hit the they hit the vehicle in the perfect spots to destroy its its
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:22:04.160]  operations now everyone watching a children's movie understands storm troopers blew it up
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:12.880]  and then they blamed the locals that's a false flag
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:21.440]  so the claim that i'm not supposed to see a big public event like the latest so-called chemical
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:26.880]  attacks they launched two real chemical attacks five years ago and three years ago in syria and
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:31.520]  the rebels got caught doing that's mainstream news now we were proven right and then they want to get
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:36.640]  me off the air to new ones to get trump into a war but the one on april 14th this year didn't even
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:42.000]  happen it was just totally fake that came out and this newest one didn't even happen i don't even
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:51.040]  have to be involved anymore once people know it's bs it all falls apart i don't know what the name
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:54.480]  of the scene in star wars is i know i gave it to you last minute but it's not the these aren't the
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:58.880]  droids you're looking for scenes it's where uh it's like blitzkauer says you go back to his family
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:04.640]  but they're dead and it's it's it's uh luke skywalker obi-wankan obi jawas land crawler
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:09.680]  maybe i'll find out later we'll go to some calls and take it but but that's what i mean in a movie
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:14.880]  for children you understand that the storm troopers blew up the land crawler but they
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:19.280]  don't want to get the blame so they kill some locals and throw their dead bodies around at least
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:23.280]  some of their weapons there i mean that's called a false flag that's been in wars for thousands
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:30.720]  of years and i'm here telling people hey in the warfare refrigerator there's relish there's ketchup
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:41.680]  there's hot sauce uh there is hinds 57 uh there's uh there's cheese there's baloney i mean i'm telling
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:46.000]  you what's in the refrigerator it doesn't mean when we see something happen that i'm saying it
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:54.000]  didn't happen i'm saying okay we've seen this happen a lot babies and incubators that didn't die
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:03.280]  blah blah blah so we need to then ask ourselves is this believable who is involved and what is the
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:10.320]  proof and when you know a big false flag is coming i'm gonna get your calls in a moment
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:18.560]  when you see a gigantic pr rollout i know 95 of our audience gets this but i've got to restate it
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:24.080]  10 000 times google moved to china apple moved to china it's espionage finally the pentagon
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.720]  military cia gets it the president gets it i don't want to be the one that keeps giving this
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:33.120]  you know how freaked out i am that we had to push this and get banned to do it and then you did it
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:39.520]  you the listeners did it you get it like you're like well we're not that smart oh yeah we are yeah
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:43.760]  you tune into the show you're involved you're calling congress we'll play this in a minute yeah
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.600]  queue it up did you guys have audio yet
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:52.960]  yeah because it i don't know why we don't hook all those computers up to audio for five years but
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:58.800]  i'm not mad i'm not mad but they have this thing where all the computers aren't hooked up and they
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:05.360]  find the audio they go well there's not enough inputs on the board buy another board but we'll
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.520]  play it next segment of your calls but i i just digress look into if you're a radio listener
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.680]  we're also tv somalcast and so it's well the show sounds so crazy on radio but
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:26.720]  i'm sitting here watching a crescendo of like 50 000 people beating pots and pans together
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:31.920]  bong bong bong bong the right wing's gonna kill the media jones is gonna kill the media
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:36.240]  he's saying kill us and i'm like don't kill anybody no no no i would ever want that wait
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.480]  why are you lying why are you lying because they're gonna do it
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:49.040]  they're going to do it they're going to do it they're going to do it they're going to do it
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.920]  they stand to gain they have a history of doing it they have the means to do it
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:58.560]  they have a history they can carry it out they've done it before
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.800]  or and they're making all the preparations that it's coming
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.360]  so i mean when i really am driving to work kind of focusing or i'm working out you all
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:14.720]  that blood going through your brain your brain's working good i'm like you should go on air and
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:18.880]  only talk about false flags and how they're coming and how they're playing to set you up
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:25.920]  and i'm just i mean that's what we're taking your calls and come back i promise
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:31.840]  i'm just asking you i mean they're not on every channel
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.920]  saying trump's being mean to media it's very dangerous for no reason because when it happens
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:44.480]  let's play the baseless clip here the head of uh the guy was 160 billion dollars that doesn't
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:48.880]  pay taxes internationally that tells middle-class folks paying 50 000 a year you should pay more
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:55.040]  money i mean these are jerks man and here he is today scared of trump hurting our precious
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.320]  democracy oh my god he's just banning books left and right but trump says we're liars and
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.840]  he has to lay down to me or he's a bad man i used america to get rich but now i want to work to
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:11.840]  shut it down here it is i think there's probably a no no public figure who has ever liked their
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:18.400]  headlines it's okay it's part of the process you know it's it's um if you're the president of the
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:23.760]  united states or a governor of a state or whatever you you don't take that job thinking you're not
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:30.640]  going to get scrutinized you're going to get scrutinized and it's it's it's healthy and somebody
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:37.680]  very uh you know what what what um what the president should say is this is right this is good
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:43.760]  i'm glad i'm being scrutinized and that would be so secure and confident but it's really dangerous
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:49.680]  to demonize the media it's dangerous to call the media lowlifes it's dangerous to say that they're
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:58.400]  the enemy of the people we live in a society where it's not just the laws of the land that protect
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.560]  us we do have freedom of press it's in the constitution we but we but we but it's also
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:14.560]  the social norms that protect us oh oh so trump's a nazi murderous family he's a liar he's a fraud
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:21.040]  all these fake quotes and then if he says they're liars fake news he needs to just say oh thank god
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:27.760]  you're they're lying and taking chai kong money to do it oh hey bezos can somebody teach you how
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:33.600]  to tie a knot dude i've never even in the 70s seen a half wenser like that good lord

[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:48.960]  so here it is before we go to your phone calls again the original false flag in the movie only
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:34:00.560]  imperial storm trippers are so precise here it is it looks like the sand people did this all
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:04.240]  right look there's gaffies to expand the tracks it's just i've never heard them hitting anything
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:11.040]  this big beautiful they didn't but we are meant to think they did these tracks aside by side sand
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:16.400]  people always ride single file to hide their numbers these are the same jawas that sold us
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:24.320]  our two and three beyond and these last points too accurate for sand people only imperial storm
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:28.960]  troopers are so precise but why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:37.600]  if they trace the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to and that would
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:46.640]  lead them back home oh wait look it's too dangerous
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.960]  i think they need to apologize for implying that every attack that happens is done by who they
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:35:09.680]  say it's done by all right phone calls now got loaded phones i'm gonna get to everybody here
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:15.120]  before the next guest host takes over this is important stuff we're covering here today
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:23.920]  let's see who's up next here we've got josh and kim and mark and edgar and kato and chris and jake
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.880]  and jonathan and brandon and nick and james i'm gonna get to those calls before this transmission
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:37.600]  ends if the water doesn't rise we're bare creek as they say so let's go ahead and talk to kim
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:43.040]  in arkansas she wants to talk about false flag before the midterms which they're definitely
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:50.480]  priming for what do you think's going on uh yeah i fully agree with you that um that there's going
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:59.600]  to be some type of false flag prior to the midterm um in my opinion from what i've seen on 52 i just
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:08.080]  watched her show the first time the other day about about three weeks ago um and so i think it'd
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:14.400]  be something more like like what you said that um they're willing to sue themselves lay themselves
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:22.640]  kill themselves for their belief so if they're suicidal slash homicidal i see something like you
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:29.840]  know maybe oh like a heaven's gate like like the liberal professor just shot himself another lady
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:34.240]  maybe a bunch of them commit suicide and blame us or what do you think well you know instead of
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:38.800]  these private pilots you know that they know about them you know maybe have worked in a lab
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.040]  they know about chemical warfare oh that's a good point you're saying maybe they'll have left us
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:48.800]  crop dusters nerve gas people correct wow if you've been reading fbi reports because that's
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.360]  actually what they're worried about instead no instead of flying a house you know pointing to
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.640]  the house of their life because they're mad over a threesome and be more like you know they have some
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:04.640]  access to chemical weapons wow that's a good point well i know i don't want to even talk about it on
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:10.240]  there because it gives people ideas but we've done it now so one of the big threats would be people
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:18.000]  loading poison up in a crop duster and they've got enough leftist i mean there are so many
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:25.200]  leftist attacks now i can't even keep track of and i just want to say i love you i thank you and i'm
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.280]  praying for you every day and i support everything you're doing god bless you i love you i appreciate
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:35.280]  you listen i want to thank you and i don't just say i'm thanking the audience folks it's like a
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.640]  it's like gasoline and an engine man if you're not there we don't crank it's i don't don't just go oh
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:48.080]  thank you audience you don't show up you don't spread the word you don't support you don't exist
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:58.400]  there was i i didn't say i don't exist it's beyond that you don't show up you don't take action you
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:05.440]  don't spread the word you don't get involved we don't exist it's not like oh thanks
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.320]  like what's more important the wind or the sailing ship
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:19.840]  are you the wind are you the ship this is a really a metaphorical point but i'm going to
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:27.120]  make it now it was a big epiphany i am the wind i'm on the air a bullhorn i'm talking about freedom
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:32.080]  i'm saying something's true but you're the ship you're out there across the world on the sea of
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.360]  reality and the winds have changed the winds of liberty are blowing and you and you're the wind
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:44.960]  and the ship but you are the ship and so all i'm doing is and think about the power you've got you
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:53.120]  are that captain in that ship of destiny upon that sea think about the magic of that that's
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  free will that's god's gift what what could an omnipresent god that created all reality do
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:05.680]  create new realities create new seeds of the universe free will children he loves
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:11.920]  but children who will fall to evil and good but because god loves free will so much god sheds
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:25.520]  beyond tears god experiences every child that sacrificed by satanist god god forces himself
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:31.920]  to go through it all and that's why god is god because only god could do that what a great point
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:37.120]  man beautiful what you had to say yeah no i exactly there's just no telling i don't want to scare
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.480]  people but before they ban me about the hezbollah sleeper teams but iran has real terrorist in the
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.920]  us with isis and al qaeda it's kind of wound up protected that's who the west was allied with
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:52.720]  because that's the majority of islam not with the iranians it's a whole another kettle of fish
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:40:01.760]  and now jonathan in alabama jonathan jonathan welcome to the airwives thanks for holding
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:14.720]  hey kenny ellie sure can i'm here i had several points to talk about and i wanted to talk about
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:21.120]  the red flag i think that they're actually going to do it but i think that it's possible that you
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:26.880]  are stopping it by whistleblowing ahead of time and you have to use it use the term not really
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:32.240]  known in general parlance or nomenclature you said red flag did you do that by mistake you mean
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:37.120]  false flag or did you say in a red flag false flag i apologize but you know what a red flag is
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:46.080]  i do not other than the ocean well a red flag has different uses but a red flag
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:52.240]  it's not even so much a false flag it's just pointing at someone killed who's innocent in the war
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:41:00.560]  and using them as a propaganda point so a child killed by a by a a shot that missed or whatever
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:03.840]  an accidental civilian death is a red flag so i thought you're getting into red flags you're
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:09.520]  getting into false flags go ahead well they also fema remember the recent article about the state
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.280]  actors that they were concerned about that so the media may try and blame state actors for it
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  no i agree so i mean look we know they're hyping that conservatives are going to kill the media
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:25.680]  none of it's true it's pure horsemen are we from a strategic point we wouldn't do that to make them
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:32.640]  the victim so what do you think they're planning you know quite honestly i don't have an answer to
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:37.520]  that um i do have some other points if you're willing to hear them i want to hear him brother
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:44.880]  go ahead all right so uh let's deform d platform facebook let's all pull out at once let's let's
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:49.360]  just you know what we don't have to use you more we don't have to use google we don't have to no
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:53.360]  i agree we should not just be platform we should build our own thing but do you realize why just
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:58.720]  saying you know they can have unlimited bots for fraud they're the ones that run the box
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.200]  for fake advertising so they'll they'll just create fake people and milk their advertisers
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:08.960]  right so what matt rudge says you don't just leave them you have to build something vibrant does
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:17.440]  that make sense that's good how about a logo for our personal websites where we can get your message
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:23.840]  out like uh like a logo link like um i'm done about tech there's like a logo links like a
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:30.000]  tech like a button that takes us to all our stuff that's correct so they they can come to my website
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.520]  if i'm getting traffic on my website they can come and link on that and it goes directly to you
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:39.680]  because i don't really care you know i'm not i'm not in it just like you're no that's why we all
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:43.920]  should promote each other but that's a great idea send us an email at show tips info wars.com god
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:49.200]  bless you johnson great points amazing callers nick and many others your calls are only a few

[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:01.200]  years and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying and they said oh we want
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:06.240]  more money more money and oh this and that and so i've broken my contract and right now we can't

[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:27.280]  into so my friend goes to the university of detroit in michigan where i live and he's uh
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:33.680]  uh the editor of the journalism program and one of the teachers that runs it they said
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:41.760]  you can't have any info wars related uh articles in uh our newspaper nothing
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:47.440]  no no source from info or nothing they won't allow it and oh listen listen i've talked to
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:52.960]  cousins that have children they're in college i can't believe i'm that old now i've got i've
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:58.000]  got cousins that have you know killed in their 20 years old 19 years old in college i've had two
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:04.640]  cousins and an old family friend uh in the last month come to me and say and it was in the newspapers
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:08.000]  remember they said a few months ago we need to counter alex jones not to censor him on the
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.040]  web we have to counter him at universities and high schools so they march in they literally go
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:20.400]  alex jones loves the kkk not true alex jones says no way you doubt us anyway and they literally
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:28.480]  then tell him he's fake news the subject of this semester is how he's bad so you're telling me
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:33.840]  they're saying i'm not allowed again they're in the newspapers hundreds of papers i've seen
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:40.240]  say they're again i'm not that important so i'm asking you the question what are they do what
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:46.400]  is it we're saying that's so evil and so bad and the good news is in in in three of the four cases
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:57.200]  i've heard about the last few months because one of the uh friends you know uh is a grandma and her
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:01.840]  daughter married a black man she has a you know white black baby great beautiful person know him
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:08.400]  the point is is that that granddaughter is going to school and she was kind of liberal until they
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.640]  did that and she's known me but on my boat many times at barbeque and i've known her she was a
[02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:17.680]  little baby and she said that's not alex that's not true and they told her you shut up in class
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:25.600]  now she shut up but now you see they think that brainwashing saying i'm a racist in kkk
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:31.840]  to a girl that's that's part black and she's known me since she was born she knows it's not
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:37.040]  true so see how they're how they're jumping the shark there yeah alex all they gotta do
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:42.640]  they just gotta watch i mean watch your old documentaries watch your entire show like you
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:46.800]  said they always take clips out of context everything you say is pro-human no matter what
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:52.640]  color no matter what religion no matter no matter anything i just it makes me sick like my friends
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:56.480]  like i try to i'll tell them something you said they're like oh alex show and blah blah blah i'm
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:04.000]  like they're just they're just they're just listen be glad you're not i'm not i'm not against your
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:09.760]  friends but be glad that you know mainstream media is full of it what is wrong with people that
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:15.360]  might join a bandwagon it's it's pathetic god bless you i appreciate your call yeah it's it's
[02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:23.280]  it's in the paper at least four times i've seen austin we're talking huge half page articles about
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:27.840]  the local dean of the journalism school went down to where his granddaughter
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:36.400]  is that alex jones's own alma mater and it's my alma mater anderson high school and i'm reading
[02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:40.000]  this in the paper i made a place like three months ago eating breakfast with my wife and
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:46.720]  kids i get a newspaper and i'm opening it up and it's like alex jones hates black people
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:51.120]  and alex jones says no jews died in the holocaust and i'm sitting there reading it
[02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:59.280]  and that's what i'm saying is it has reached total crazy town proportions
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:03.040]  and so a lot of folks hear that they go well i don't want to be accused of that
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:08.800]  they're the bad guys i didn't do anything just because they say that i love hitler doesn't
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:14.960]  mean it's true people that will put that in the newspaper praying on you but the point was is that
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:23.200]  it was the ut dean of something i remember visiting his granddaughter at anderson high school
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:29.280]  and then about a week later i see another one austin high got a visit from the grandfather
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:34.880]  again another grandfather and he came in and taught alex jones hates black people and you're
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:44.320]  like my god this is defamation rolled out like armies like armies and then i talked to people
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:50.320]  that have witnessed it there's never a clip there's never a quote they just have these democrat crooks
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:56.960]  in fact i saw one article it was like it was kansas city star and it was a grandmother this time
[02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:03.200]  they know the elders are trusted she walks into the eighth grade girls she goes alex jones believes
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:10.880]  women should be able to have jobs alex jones hates women and the article it said the girls said
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:17.600]  they were going to vomit and were nauseous when they showed pictures of me i covered it on air
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:25.040]  it was literally in kansas city and they're saying the girls are no they're like he wants to hurt
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:34.400]  girls and the girls are i mean this is what we've been reduced to do i have to virtue signal and
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:39.200]  say i have three daughters or that i love women and that my company i keep as women pretty much
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:46.240]  exclusively in my life there's like no men around i love women what is this whole thing doing i mean
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:54.000]  again but they think the lie is gonna win i'm betting on you i don't think that lie is gonna win
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:03.280]  the girls became upset and said they were nauseous they said please please take him off the screen
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:08.320]  that was the quote take him off of course the truth is like writing my name down oh my god
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:13.760]  i'll fall in first my life oh my god but then another thing these the psychopaths don't even get
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:20.880]  what they're doing that's what's so crazy about the mind control is the sociopaths it only works on
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:26.560]  a zombie but imagine you go in front of a whole group of girls at a girls event at a major you
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:34.960]  know middle school in austin you tell them alex jones hates you inherently anybody's gonna want to
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:42.080]  go hear this i mean if i was in a class at 11 years old and i was told this person hates you
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:48.640]  he wants to destroy you i would i would go and then meanwhile they turn him like i love you
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:55.280]  you are the sea of the universe you are incredibly powerful i love you and they're like wow this guy
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:03.440]  is this actually a simulation i'm like plugged in in some matrix like we're on the hero of the movie
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:08.320]  or something because i mean this is getting too weird i'm going to take over two segments from
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:12.400]  baggage he's good he'll understand i said i'm taking these calls so one way the other we're
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:16.960]  doing it so we're going to come back and go to uh all these callers we're going to take every caller
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:23.440]  on the board straight ahead i always say briefly because no one hates plugging products more than
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:33.440]  me look they should sell themselves x2 is gotten from oil companies between seven and 12 000 feet
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:38.560]  and yes people politically find out where i get stuffed and they mess with the companies
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.480]  and then the company guys sit around and they will just triple charge him he don't like it he can go
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:52.880]  so i broke the contract so there's no more x2 that'll make me get up off my behind and find

[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:55.040]  they talk on phones they talk in text they send things to files but they don't communicate
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:04.800]  so i'm going to do the done done done done done in fact i'm going to stay here in fact

[03:02:54.960 --> 03:03:00.880]  it's it's like somebody blew them up they're on camera saying get back they're blowing them up
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:04.960]  and then you've got the seismographs i don't know what happened you think i wanted to lose
[03:03:04.960 --> 03:03:09.840]  70 percent of my stations on 9 11 you think i want to have them trying to kill me i don't want to
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:17.360]  lie to you in fact i am mentally ill no it's true most people can lie their ass off i have a real
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:24.720]  problem with it i do i have a real problem lying it's like to me it's some metaphysical fraud it's
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:31.120]  it's like um i just don't like it it's not like i'm gonna come out take a few calls and we'll let
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:38.400]  dr. gang payers take over her and i'm gonna try to start as the candidate and i probably need to
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:49.040]  take some time off i've been a little bit stressed out i do not want clips of them saying they blew
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:55.520]  up the world trade center on cnn and bbc with bowling i do not want it i will have it in two
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:01.440]  minutes it'll be like the most magic and i'm not mad at the crew it's like i don't understand
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:07.680]  how if i say something is an emergency i don't get it and i've learned about bitch on air i somehow

[03:07:54.080 --> 03:08:01.360]  to thank you for teaching me about antifa i think i saw my first two antifas in connecticut so
[03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:06.880]  heads on the swivel for the midterm and those are leftist brown shirts running around beating
[03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:12.960]  people to death yeah yeah they look like uh initiated secretly weird looking people soy boys
[03:08:12.960 --> 03:08:18.320]  for sure but oh they definitely look like demon possessed methods it ain't right and i want to
[03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:22.240]  thank you i want to thank you man we're in the fight so what's on your mind today what do you
[03:08:22.240 --> 03:08:25.520]  think you're gonna do for the midterm i think you're gonna stay something big they're certainly
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:31.760]  hyping it uh yeah people are kind of weenies uh those types of people especially in connecticut so
[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:36.960]  like i said heads on a swivel but they'll probably try some minor physical actions
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:44.080]  at the election polling places who knows but uh i'm mentally ready for it i don't want any fights
[03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:51.680]  but god forbid civilization collapse and we start having to actually fight oh god i'm so scared
[03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:57.440]  i mean aren't you scared of what we'll do if there's an actual war with these people god
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:03.120]  i'm so afraid of them i mean aren't you afraid of them right now nick aren't you afraid
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:12.640]  i'm so afraid right now nick now i watch your pride boys videos and i couldn't believe how weak
[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:18.640]  they were i'm not a powerhouse myself but i'm ex-military i tried boxing for a while and i said
[03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:25.440]  that's it that's all they are you can hold your own yeah let me guess i bet if you get down you
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:29.360]  can kick some ass like somebody's beating your head in the concrete i bet you can go donkey
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:33.440]  con on them right yeah there's something about really getting your ass kicked when nothing
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:38.640]  else matters uh i think that brings out a lot of power inside of you stop talking about things
[03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:44.720]  when there's always those bullies start crying for their mommy too oh boy now i've been around the
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:50.240]  block boxing wrestling i've gotten my ass kicked before i know what it feels like uh but yeah well
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:54.880]  yeah as tough as you are there's some people so fast it's like you know it's a bam bam bam
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:59.680]  body slam but then they always think they've got you at that point then you get right the throat
[03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:04.000]  that's the thing about those but most folks are really tough they think they got you and
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.920]  have this little celebration moment that's when you get them nice god bless you brother i appreciate
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:15.280]  your call and i'm sorry i threw a fit earlier i'm really pissed off about the globalist i apologize

[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:24.560]  who's the basketball coach that throws chairs at people and stuff i don't really do that but
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:31.440]  man i'm just bob night yeah i'm i'm just i do project some of my anger that's why i gotta take a
[03:10:31.440 --> 03:10:36.160]  week off oh i gotta take a week off next week for a custody battle for my kids oh it's such a
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:43.760]  vacation i'm not complaining it's just like god man i am just like i'm sitting there listening to
[03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:50.000]  eric bowling and he's a sweet guy and he's just like oh my god how dare you say that 9-11 is an
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:53.760]  inside job he's even know what that means and i'm and i'm like well we have clips of them saying
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:59.600]  they blew up building seven no you don't you say you do and i'm like well we have clips of 20 pages
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:06.640]  and we have clips of you know uh trump say there's bombs no you don't and i'm like can i you know i
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:12.960]  figure i could just have that clip like you know have it and i'm not mad but there's this thing
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:16.160]  when i asked for here's what it is they want to make it really fancy
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:22.720]  so i should ask matt because matt would just put the clips together like 10 minutes
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:28.160]  that's great make brain lab at all fancy and all beautiful and all little bells and whistles and
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:35.520]  ding dong this ding dong that but i want to show it now i want to show you that because you know
[03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:40.640]  it's like bowling said you don't have a video of them saying they blew up seven dude i got five
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:51.760]  videos abc cbs two cnn's i've got the video made a good show today now i'm i'm blowing the whole
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:57.120]  thing and i apologize i just i don't bet you complain but let me tell you it's it's it's
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:01.920]  i'm actually it's very traumatic to think about nine eleven people ask me why don't you cover
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:11.360]  nine eleven a lot anymore because it's depressing because people want to argue about it so like
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:16.080]  fine the tooth fairy did it believe whatever you want at a certain point it's like you've heard
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:22.080]  a song you love a thousand times suddenly you hate it i know more about nine eleven than most
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:29.840]  people will ever even imagine and i'm not bragging and it becomes this conundrum and this riddle and
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:35.360]  it's totally fake but then there's so much fake crap you don't even know what's true anymore
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:42.320]  but bowling i said hey bowling two passports got found the day after in the rubble hundreds of
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:46.880]  millions of pieces of paper blown up buildings do you believe two passports got found on the
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:52.240]  rubble because he believes that he thinks he found gold in the leprechauns but okay i don't
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:58.080]  mean to gross analogy but or he found that the end of the rainbow or he found the you know
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:10.000]  i mean seriously two passports the rubble he goes well what does that mean the firefighters blew
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:20.880]  it up i don't know what it means the story isn't true edgar in texas thanks for holding
[03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:27.680]  nick baggins coming up next segment go ahead yeah how you doing alex hey um i just wanted to say
[03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:34.080]  you know that if i if they really think that you know info words is the only you know platform
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:40.160]  that that's kind of like awake and everything like that they're very very very good uh mistaken
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:45.680]  because i mean you got a lot of people that i know personally i'm well let me be clear
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:51.520]  they don't think that when they set the precedent to ban me then the dominoes all fall
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:14:01.600]  yeah um you know i you know i you know i i am i'm actually i wanted to say this too you know
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:06.480]  they they've been calling like for example with the whole marco rubio thing they were calling
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:11.440]  you crazy uh i don't know who it was that was on like it was like a talk show host person it's one
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:16.560]  of your um one of your recording clips that you play um he's like yeah he's the press of the media
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:23.600]  or whatever um they if they're calling you crazy they're calling us crazy because we we we listen
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:28.720]  to you you know and that offends me personally because i know i'm not crazy i'm a normal human
[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:35.120]  being i have a normal job you know i'm out here providing if you have survival instinct they call
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:40.560]  that crazy being crazy just means the system says you're not complying with our corporate
[03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:44.560]  override that you're supposed to be under our control that's all that is it's sociopathic
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:50.080]  control freaks that lust after destroying free will god's for free will they're not brother
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:56.720]  so it's a badge of courage they attack you right right um but yeah you know um you know with the
[03:14:56.720 --> 03:15:03.920]  whole uh midterm thing i think right now i think personally i mean i think they're probably gonna
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:09.680]  try to come after just the rest of the patriots that are out there um but just because oh they're
[03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:14.240]  already banning everybody i mean i mean i mean that's what this is yeah yeah i mean if i just
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:18.800]  want to say though like they're they're they're really stupid like they think that they're just
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:25.200]  gonna do that in the know yeah it's all good like we we uh everybody's quiet now nobody can talk
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:29.760]  we're just gonna steal the election if we don't have our country we don't have our freedom
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:33.360]  and you're gonna see a lot of people rise up now you're right it's it's it's definitely

[03:21:41.920 --> 03:21:48.960]  you support alex in that way and the team at info wars.com you know uh i want to talk a little bit um
[03:21:49.680 --> 03:21:54.880]  sort of take it a different direction when we're thinking about globalists and the economy and
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:22:01.440]  sort of what drives it all and whenever i travel i i turn on the television every once while which i
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:08.240]  i don't do at home because i don't i don't watch television uh otherwise and i'm always amazed at
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:14.640]  just the general degradation of what they call news um and then they accuse what's going on here
[03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:23.120]  is fake news i give me a break you know uh the mainstream has really uh has a whole different
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:29.840]  view in news than i certainly do and and and i think here's how i read it all right multi-generational
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:35.520]  transformation you know and as generations fade away and new ones come people lose historical
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:39.920]  perspective and i want to get into some of that uh today you know and i travel around the world a lot
[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:48.080]  i've been uh europe probably 40 50 times in the last uh 25 years latin america asia all over
[03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:54.080]  and the overlays um by the globalists are a little different you know in each area they're
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:23:01.200]  sort of got a cultural uh tone uh but but it's all about markets and resources and when you look at
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:06.480]  europe for instance right now and you think about european institutions you think about
[03:23:06.480 --> 03:23:10.960]  um the european central bank which is like our federal reserve it's a bunch of bankers
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:16.800]  nobody elected uh running the currency for more than one country even a whole bunch of countries
[03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:23.840]  who gave up their currency to a central bank uh the u.s has a federal reserve system which
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:29.440]  essentially the same thing 300 member banks run in the currency and when you when you think about
[03:23:29.440 --> 03:23:37.680]  uh this on a global level uh this is the trade this is the money changers if you will at the
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:44.800]  temple door uh this is the tables you want to kick kick over when you think about what they actually
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:52.320]  control because real economics is based on poor things this is what economics will teach you
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:58.560]  it's based on labor land and natural resources as the second thing third is capital equipment
[03:23:58.560 --> 03:24:03.360]  things that make things like factories and caterpillars and even shovels you know when you get
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:09.280]  right down to it uh horses and buggies tractor trailers you know factories all of that um
[03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:15.280]  and then you have uh entrepreneurship creativity uh these are the four factors of what drives a
[03:24:15.280 --> 03:24:20.560]  real economy labor and let's talk about labor for a minute what's what's coming and what's here
[03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:28.960]  uh robotics uh in the next 15 years they're saying we'll replace maybe sooner even um 30 percent
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:37.600]  of blue collar jobs from the end and all jobs for that that matter truck drivers taxi drivers
[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:43.760]  drivers of all kinds uh fruit pickers pickers you know people who harvest fruits and vegetables
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:53.200]  uh all of it from menial uh hard backbreaking tasks to the most complex uh factories
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:58.960]  in the world are being automated to the point where labor will be uh much different even
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:06.160]  self replicating self-repairing machines machines that will change everything about labor so
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:14.480]  as a factor of real economics this is a uh a thing to consider where we go what policy looks
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:20.240]  like how do we uh function within that in terms of our education systems our infrastructures
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:26.480]  you know how does that all work because that's a big factor land and natural resources is a factor
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:32.480]  the united states and i've talked about it before on the program natural resources uh in alaska
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:38.080]  particularly as it relates to the united states 18 percent of the land mass more coastline in the
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:44.560]  west gulf and east coast combined and this is in alaska which is tremendous fishing resources
[03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:51.680]  geothermal oil and gas 34 of the strategic minerals including rare earths are here in
[03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:57.120]  world-class minable quantities some are already developed in world-class mines and last can we
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:04.960]  talked about that in previous segments but you know when i think about what drives economies
[03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:09.840]  you know land and natural resources held in common by americans and our public lands and
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:18.000]  resources this is huge when you think of alaska um this is where the big uh plays are being made
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:23.760]  and most of the companies uh developing mines here are not domestic uh they're multinational
[03:26:23.760 --> 03:26:28.800]  companies coming in because this is a safe political environment we have the strictest
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:34.400]  environmental rules both in alaska and nationally but it's also a safe political environment you're
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:38.640]  not going to get chopped up and put in a drum and float down a river like you would in some places
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:45.120]  in africa or other parts of the world that are pretty dangerous um you know so when you think of
[03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:49.920]  natural resources and the connection of bringing alaska's resource to the rest united states what
[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:56.960]  we're short is a railroad and the road system is in the south central part of the state where you see
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:02.800]  clouds on the map if you have the visual images up but essentially very little of the state has
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:08.960]  roads most of it is is wilderness and what we need is a railroad infrastructure that links us in
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:14.720]  to the railroad system in canada which is pushing through into bc and into the uconn territories
[03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:21.200]  today and then that would take us our resources from railroads uh to riches bring our natural
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:28.400]  resources into the midwest the rust belt of the united states and really put labor and capital
[03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:35.440]  equipment and the things that represent economic activity to work you know this is what uh can
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:42.320]  happen and what we're not doing is looking at as we have for the last 250 years uh the development
[03:27:42.320 --> 03:27:47.360]  of natural resources and infrastructure and in the modern world those infrastructures are
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:53.440]  communication transportation information systems and today the most efficient is rail
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:00.400]  overland and shipping and we don't have the ports we don't have the rail connections to the to the
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:06.800]  biggest chunk of undeveloped natural resources the united states alaska and and and the resources
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:12.880]  we hold in common here and and that the state and uh native organizations hold in Alaska when you
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:20.080]  think about uh capital equipment um underutilized and the opportunity to develop value added with
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:25.680]  these natural resources this requires a commitment to infrastructure we're going to be back uh after
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:31.600]  the break this is dr nick baggage standing in for this last last hour we're info wars dot com and go

[03:31:58.160 --> 03:32:03.600]  found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:10.560]  be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:16.880]  rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:32:16.880 --> 03:32:23.280]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[03:32:23.280 --> 03:32:29.200]  heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:35.680]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[03:32:35.680 --> 03:32:42.720]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what
[03:32:42.720 --> 03:32:48.560]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[03:32:48.560 --> 03:33:10.000]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:20.240]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones and welcome back to the alex jones show
[03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:25.840]  that's his uh dr. nick faggots uh standing in uh in this last hour on a friday from my home in
[03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:33.440]  alaska and before the break i i was talking about uh infrastructure and the four uh factors of real
[03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:39.760]  economic uh production when you study economics it's land and labor uh land and natural resources
[03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:45.680]  number two uh number three capital equipment things that make things like factories and shovels uh
[03:33:45.680 --> 03:33:52.400]  and uh and lastly entrepreneurship creativity and and when you think about um sort of how this all
[03:33:52.400 --> 03:33:58.320]  goes what what is the medium between those four factors of production is money currency used to
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:02.160]  be backed by gold silver something real so when you were trading things you had some kind of
[03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:07.680]  representative value and now it's on the good faith and credit of the federal reserve system in the
[03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:13.680]  u.s and the european central bank in most of europe and other institutions for other countries
[03:34:13.680 --> 03:34:20.640]  but the currency as the way of controlling governments and controlling countries is in
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:26.400]  fact what investment bankers and bankers around the world recognized long ago and when you think
[03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:33.120]  about the robber barons of the late 1800s and the 1800s and even going back further in our history
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:38.880]  of the united states after the colonial wars uh where we won our independence from england they
[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:44.240]  had a saying not worth the continental well that was the currency of the day and there was nothing
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:50.640]  to back it up the money system was in shambles it wasn't worth the continental uh and money that
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:56.800]  our revolutionaries who had fought and died for and sacrificed for was worthless basically but they
[03:34:56.800 --> 03:35:01.760]  held it hoping someday the script would be honored meanwhile speculators went around and collected
[03:35:01.760 --> 03:35:06.960]  it all up bought it up for like 10 cents on the dollar and then later the united states government
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:12.320]  under lobby pressure from people that bought up those continental's there's one on the screen
[03:35:12.320 --> 03:35:17.920]  you know what they ended up doing is a uh a bottom up for 10 cents on the dollar the u.s
[03:35:17.920 --> 03:35:23.200]  borrowed money from prance paid them off in gold at 100 cents on the dollar later and it was speculators
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:27.920]  that won not the revolutionaries you know and it's kind of been that deal with bankers throughout
[03:35:27.920 --> 03:35:33.600]  our history a really great book i read it i read it years ago uh there's one uh the new american
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:40.880]  history by w.e. woodard and it's actually from 1936 but the guy talked to people who'd been there
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:45.840]  you know more or less uh people who were living uh and could tell him the stories of our history in
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:50.720]  a pretty dramatic way but when you think about the federal reserve uh the civil war itself
[03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:57.600]  after the civil war uh income tax late 1800s was tried and in 1894 the u.s supreme court voted
[03:35:57.600 --> 03:36:05.680]  down as unconstitutional you couldn't tax labor that was involuntary servitude even if it was a
[03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:11.440]  government so uh there was a constitutional amendment made in 1913 we got the federal reserve
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:17.040]  which was the hijacking from the robber barons who were literally hijacking the national wealth
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:23.200]  by taking the transportation quarters so that if you were growing wheat in kansas you were being
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:28.880]  robbed on the transportation cost by the robber barons who owned the granaries and owned everything
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:35.200]  you know bringing that grain to market so i mean it was systems of control uh and today
[03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:38.880]  it's the communication system think about what's happened with alex over the last
[03:36:38.880 --> 03:36:45.040]  several weeks and censorship by the main media the uh if you will communications industry
[03:36:45.040 --> 03:36:50.320]  in the media industry which if you look at a percentage of gdp a percentage of the world's
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:56.320]  economy it's a big chunk of the money but think of the robber barons that created taxation
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:01.920]  and income taxes and then also at the same time created the federal reserve systems which have
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:08.080]  never been audited you know here we are 109 years later and no full audit of the federal reserve
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:15.040]  give me a break you know there's a partial audit done showing trillions and trillions of dollars
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:23.440]  loaned out during the crisis of 2008 and it's aftermath but you know a full review of what
[03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:29.840]  these institutions represent because they control the money supply if you will the money supply which
[03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:36.480]  is the money that transfers between labor natural resources things factories build an
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:42.720]  entrepreneurship and that money is constrained by federal reserve organizations when you know
[03:37:42.720 --> 03:37:47.200]  really it's about supply and demand right is there a shortage of any of those things natural
[03:37:47.200 --> 03:37:52.960]  resources labor i mean all of it on a global basis no what the globalists have done is transfer
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:37:58.080]  well okay they're looking at the world now looking at 300 million in the u.s and not so big of a
[03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:04.880]  market anymore when you got four billion people expected to jump into the middle class globally
[03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:12.000]  in the next you know several decades but hey that's where the money's moving place like china and
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:18.320]  india and what have happened what's happened there is the post script to what's happening here in
[03:38:18.320 --> 03:38:25.600]  india they got rid of the e-currencies you know all all the bitcoin and all that in terms of central
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:32.080]  banks they got rid of their thousand and two thousand rupee notes and called them back and if you
[03:38:32.080 --> 03:38:36.560]  didn't turn them in a certain amount of time and pay what tax they're doing and they're making money
[03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:43.520]  and social systems all electronic using iris scans fingerprints facial recognition those three
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:50.320]  and they have most of the population already in the system in china as has been reported they do
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:56.640]  social media or the social medias of all kinds whether it's google or the facebook's or their
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:03.040]  own local versions of the same the software that's been developed to socially profile like
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:08.640]  credit score of the population so it decides who gets to eat who gets to drink who goes to college
[03:39:08.640 --> 03:39:17.200]  who doesn't who travels who gets fast ports this is what is happening in china okay so you've got
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:24.400]  bank regulators looking at your credit scores and social scores by the social media facebook google
[03:39:24.400 --> 03:39:31.680]  apple all these organizations amazon and the rest of them these represent the trillion dollar
[03:39:31.680 --> 03:39:39.840]  industries of the 21st century technology where power is think about what makes government strong
[03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:45.840]  in the world it's technology and the control and command of technology is now infrastructure
[03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:52.960]  so when you look across at at first the banking systems the beginning of the hijacking of our
[03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:58.960]  wealth that continues to this day in fact if you look at the wealth of the nation
[03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:04.960]  and determine a sort of a different view of how we manage it if we took back from the federal
[03:40:04.960 --> 03:40:11.680]  reserve for instance the control of our money supply if we developed our natural resources
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:17.280]  truly in the national interest which is yours in mind which is retiring our national debt if we
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:24.560]  looked at our economy differently our infrastructure differently as an engine that we own at least a
[03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:30.480]  big chunk of these resources need to be doing a little bit more for the american people in the
[03:40:30.480 --> 03:40:36.080]  american public and truly american companies not multinationals who don't pay taxes here
[03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:41.760]  who duck and dodge including the big facebook's and google's and all of them who have used tax
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:46.560]  shelters around the world and why are they attacking trump because he's taxing their foreign
[03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:51.440]  income for the first time just like american citizens you know treat a corporation they got
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:57.440]  freedom of speech like we do give me a break to control political processes as individuals do
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:03.120]  give me a break but they're not tax the same as individuals until trump's tax act that started
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:10.080]  taxing national national companies on their foreign income even if it is at a reduced rate at least
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:16.960]  tax it like the rest of us which is not a reduced rate for you for me as private citizens we live
[03:41:16.960 --> 03:41:21.840]  somewhere else we're glad taxed on our global income as us citizens that's just part of the
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:27.360]  deal of being americans ought to be the same for the corporations so we need to go a little further
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:35.040]  in this if you go back to the to uh 19 uh 13 when we got the first income tax they also put in
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:39.280]  for the mineral industry and the oil and the energy industry oil and gas
[03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:46.320]  depletion allowances which cut their effective tax rate in half it's kind of a fictitious
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:51.680]  accounting thing you get to do depletion allowances if you look at it and you look at what happens
[03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:59.360]  you get to write off as if as you're depleting your natural resources half of their value against
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:05.440]  your net income so you write you're paying half rate so if your taxes corporation at 20 your
[03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:11.040]  taxed effectively at 10 when you factor this little accounting adjustment in there that's been there
[03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:18.880]  for over 109 years or 706 years with no changes and you really we need to re re kind of revisit
[03:42:18.880 --> 03:42:24.400]  some of the things that happen when the tax act was passed and where we are today because
[03:42:24.400 --> 03:42:30.640]  the evolution has shifted it to you and me to the taxing our labor something that was
[03:42:30.640 --> 03:42:36.320]  unconstitutional thought of as slavery and voluntary servitude so we need to go back a
[03:42:36.320 --> 03:42:41.600]  couple generations and revisit the value systems that drove the country from our origins this is

[03:47:26.240 --> 03:47:36.080]  and welcome back this is dr. nick baggage and you're listening to info wars live and this is
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:44.560]  again the last segment of a quick friday always enjoyed being here we were just before the break
[03:47:44.560 --> 03:47:48.800]  talking again about sort of how all of this started you know when you think about income
[03:47:48.800 --> 03:47:55.760]  taxes and the rules that began you know income taxes didn't even kick in in uh 1913 until you
[03:47:55.760 --> 03:48:03.360]  made over 22 000 a year which in those days most people in america probably 90 of americans didn't
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:10.160]  make 22 000 so they didn't pay any income taxes it was for the rich essentially and it went up from
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:17.600]  1 to 6 percent if you made over a half a million a year which was an enormous sum in 1913 and then
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:23.040]  gradually of course all of that creeped up and you see where it is today things didn't change
[03:48:23.040 --> 03:48:28.240]  depletion allowances stayed in for all of that time over a hundred years i haven't gone away
[03:48:28.240 --> 03:48:34.960]  and i'm as a matter of disclosure i'm i'm i have a mineral interest in alaska i have some valuable
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:40.560]  copper and silver properties here in alaska and so when i'm talking about this loophole it benefits
[03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:47.680]  me personally but i think it ought to be eliminated it's just a a hangover that certainly industry
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:53.760]  doesn't want um most people in my industry would like this tax advantage um and i certainly can
[03:48:53.760 --> 03:49:00.560]  appreciate it but it's not uh really the right thing it it is it really benefits the few and
[03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:06.240]  here think about you're depleting the natural resource uh one of these factors of production
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:12.240]  economic economics economy that i spoke about we depreciate things that i value add and depreciate
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:17.440]  like buildings and equipment because it wears out but these are natural resources that are
[03:49:17.440 --> 03:49:22.400]  taken from the ground and i can see that theory on this that eventually they go away but they're
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:27.440]  not valued at full value in the ground it's all that value added that you do get to deduct
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:32.720]  as you take it out and depletion depreciate your capital equipment that does that and
[03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:37.600]  write off your labor and expenses and so on but then you get this added advantage and and i don't
[03:49:37.600 --> 03:49:42.720]  know that that's right i'm you get the reclamation you get to write off all of that as part of the
[03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:50.160]  deal um to me we need to revisit this because this is uh really creating a huge benefit for
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:56.000]  oil gas and minerals companies um they get them an unfair advantage in taxation in both
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:01.520]  their domestic and global operations when you look at this accounting trick if you will but when
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:06.400]  you think of the hijacking of natural resource you're thinking utility companies today energy
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:13.680]  companies uh that evolved over the last hundred years transportation communications uh pharmacology
[03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:18.480]  the military industrial complex you know another area of huge amount of our economy
[03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:25.040]  goes to defending the world okay the world ought to be maybe paying the bill you know which is
[03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:29.360]  one of donald trump sings with nato and if you look at those numbers and you look at it globally
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:37.120]  we spend way too much money and in fact we have over 850 bases uh around the world and
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:40.800]  stations around the world most of which we could operate from the united states moving
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:46.240]  those billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity back
[03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:52.560]  to the united states uh it would would create uh two or three jobs for every direct job that we
[03:50:52.560 --> 03:50:59.760]  brought back right now those jobs are created overseas and we're paying for it uh in a lot of
[03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:05.680]  both in cash and taxes like from the american taxpayer and in debt quite frankly and the
[03:51:05.680 --> 03:51:12.400]  rest of the world should be paying their bill not just us when you look around the world at the cost
[03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:18.000]  of that again this is another hijacking of america for primarily multinational corporations
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:22.480]  interest and if you look at where these bases are yeah they're in the most volatile places
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:28.880]  on the planet where problems happen um but we can be anywhere from the united states uh stretching
[03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:35.680]  from the virgin islands us virgin islands uh in the atlantic um and and then in alaska in the
[03:51:35.680 --> 03:51:40.880]  northern region across the globe and the entire northern hemisphere or glom in the south pacific
[03:51:40.880 --> 03:51:47.120]  in asia which is again us holdings marshal islands as well you know we have places that we can jump
[03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:53.040]  off of sort of our own territorial boundaries um safely including the elution chain a lot of places
[03:51:54.160 --> 03:52:00.240]  but again re sort of evaluating uh how our economy goes we have to look at defense and how we spend
[03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:06.640]  our money and where we put men and women in harm's way uh it's the biggest area of of national
[03:52:06.640 --> 03:52:12.160]  cost we have to look at the national activity in terms of education in some of the departments
[03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:17.920]  that really belong to states uh and and should be relegated to states only those few things
[03:52:17.920 --> 03:52:23.600]  at a national level that truly belong interstate commerce i understand uh has been a little bit
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:30.320]  stretched uh but we understand uh national defense of course is easy to understand trade and and and
[03:52:30.320 --> 03:52:35.840]  treaties and so on at the national level but at the same time recognizing the sovereignty of states
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:42.720]  and what states should be able to do for ourselves but more importantly looking at the evolution of
[03:52:44.160 --> 03:52:48.880]  national politics national institutions you know whether you're on the left or the right
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:55.040]  the national parties are equally corrupt that's why in the last election cycle the most extremes
[03:52:55.040 --> 03:53:00.480]  from those parties are the ones who legitimately should have won the nominations that wasn't hila
[03:53:00.480 --> 03:53:06.800]  reclinton on the other side and 16 mainstream republicans knocked out you know in the course
[03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:12.720]  of what happened in the republican side these are rebellions against national institutions
[03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:19.280]  just the same things happen in other organizations at the national level business organizations
[03:53:19.280 --> 03:53:26.960]  unions banks and so on taking greater greater control of what happens within the mind of the
[03:53:26.960 --> 03:53:32.480]  public and ultimately within the consciousness of the public think of mainstream media think of
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:38.320]  the entertainment industry who owns them china owns a big chunk of foreign investors own big
[03:53:38.320 --> 03:53:44.160]  chunks of our media and control major aspects of what happens in the united states by controlling
[03:53:44.160 --> 03:53:49.440]  the news feed the information technologies the communication technologies and then when you
[03:53:49.440 --> 03:53:54.480]  think about what's been developed for the chinese for the indian governments by multinational
