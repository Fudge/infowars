[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:44.000]  Texas Alex Jones we've got a very important broadcast very informative
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.600]  extremely important issues that we're going to be covering today on this Tuesday
[00:50.600 --> 00:57.360]  the 10th day of November 2009 we have Jesse Ventura joining us coming up in
[00:57.360 --> 01:06.400]  one hour to give you the first time ever inside scoop on his upcoming television
[01:06.400 --> 01:14.680]  show on the true TV network that is a big network has high ratings for cable
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.000]  they'll be talking about that in a host of other issues as well as Obama
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.200]  announcing 40,000 more trips to be sent now he already sent an additional 40,000
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.200]  but that got little fanfare now he's escalating at least 40,000 and even the
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.160]  way the media announced it was done in a Psyop where they just said well the
[01:37.160 --> 01:43.840]  White House says it's not quite 40,000 it's 39,000 and it'll be phased in over
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.200]  the next year and they're going to be there for at least four years this group
[01:48.200 --> 01:56.640]  of troops of this troop increase and so that brings the number to 340,000
[01:56.640 --> 02:03.040]  troops there they didn't add that last part but that's the total number 340,000
[02:03.040 --> 02:14.920]  US European NATO I4 and of course Afghan troops but there is over 120,000
[02:14.920 --> 02:21.680]  foreign troops there of the 340 300 now about to be 340 and then there is over
[02:21.680 --> 02:32.080]  100,000 combat contractors so we're now talking 430,000 troops how about 500
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.920]  how about 600 how about 10 million I was listening to Jim Bohannon in the
[02:37.920 --> 02:49.240]  morning yesterday Jim Bohannon he never met a gun he didn't want to ban huge fake
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.960]  liberal on the surface and I heard him Sunday night on Beyond the Beltway
[02:53.960 --> 03:00.760]  calling for a national draft driving home on news radio 590 one of our great
[03:00.760 --> 03:07.440]  affiliates and then I heard him in the morning yesterday at like 5 a.m. spouting
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.000]  off I mean he must have a talking point in front of his face every day when he
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.720]  wakes up side issue the point is they've got the legislation introduced for the
[03:17.720 --> 03:25.000]  national draft and it's bad it's for men and women that's why all the GI Joe
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.360]  movies produced to sucker kids and adjoining the military show girls his
[03:29.360 --> 03:35.920]  frontline combat forces it's all psyops transformers GI Joe I've been watching
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.320]  all of it studying it to see the latest Pentagon brainwashing for the kids oh
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.840]  and the generals love the grunts and care about them and oh we're the good
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.080]  guys and the bad guys always stage terror attacks to get more power but
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.840]  they're always in an underground or underwater layer or they're from outer
[03:56.840 --> 04:03.200]  space it's never the Pentagon see the Pentagon is Cobra for all you young

[04:16.760 --> 04:22.480]  New World Order goes and creates a few mass shootings a few bombings here and
[04:22.480 --> 04:33.400]  there as the pretext and the excuse to set up a worldwide dictatorship it's
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.280]  going to be the central banks that take your property and your children and your
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.000]  livelihood in your future it's not going to be one of their cave dwelling
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.760]  mercenaries that they give billions of dollars to to play the part of the bad
[04:46.760 --> 04:50.240]  guys and then they occasionally will throw the government some 14-year-old
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.440]  goat-herding kid they kidnap and they'll parade them on TV as hardcore al Qaeda to

[06:11.760 --> 06:15.320]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[06:15.320 --> 06:20.400]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.760]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[06:25.760 --> 06:30.680]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.080]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.800]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[06:38.800 --> 06:42.720]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:42.720 --> 06:48.400]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[07:01.040 --> 07:05.000]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.520]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[07:08.520 --> 07:12.520]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.960]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[07:15.960 --> 07:19.880]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.640]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[07:29.640 --> 07:32.920]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[07:32.920 --> 07:37.040]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre
[07:37.040 --> 07:41.520]  crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's
[07:41.520 --> 07:51.840]  survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[07:51.840 --> 07:57.320]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[07:57.320 --> 08:03.800]  is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com ease the T-rex of political talk
[08:03.800 --> 08:20.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network yesterday I meant to get into the
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.760]  Fort Hood shooter to give you my take on exactly what I think is happening there
[08:25.760 --> 08:32.000]  I never got around to it because we had so much news and calls and guests but I
[08:32.000 --> 08:41.320]  will cover it in just a moment obviously I've already told you we have Jesse
[08:41.320 --> 08:45.200]  Ventura former governor of Minnesota giving us the inside exclusive scoop
[08:45.200 --> 08:55.240]  first first here on this radio show he starts a media blitz tomorrow then of
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.600]  course coming up after governor Jesse Ventura we've got part to a visit with
[08:59.600 --> 09:06.120]  Dr. Rima Labo and Major General Albert in stubble bind to get into the flu the
[09:06.120 --> 09:11.200]  population reduction program the GMO how it's all designed to sicken you and
[09:11.200 --> 09:19.760]  weaken you as part of a soft kill multi binary weapon system and Judge Andrew
[09:19.760 --> 09:25.960]  Napolitano is scheduled to be on this in about 25 minutes though through his
[09:25.960 --> 09:31.520]  schedulers one of them has him at 1230 the other 1130 Fox is notoriously when
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.320]  we do get occasional guest on from there well it's a bureaucracy but I think
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.600]  he's on today coming up in about 25 minutes say lobby if he had them will
[09:39.600 --> 09:48.800]  happen tomorrow so that is what is coming up today now this is what I read
[09:48.800 --> 09:58.440]  last night without even looking I wasn't even looking for announcements of
[09:58.440 --> 10:07.600]  carbon taxation in the US and England and I found scores of articles Reuters
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.360]  admitting they're gonna put a tax on your dog and your cat and anything that
[10:11.360 --> 10:18.320]  eats meat the Associated Press and other major publications saying it's
[10:18.320 --> 10:21.320]  wonderful by the way they're now admitting all this but saying how great it
[10:21.320 --> 10:27.200]  is that you will have a national ID card and every nation in the world it's a
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.360]  signatory to the Copenhagen Treaty is gonna adopt this you're gonna have a
[10:32.360 --> 10:38.120]  national ID card and all your purchases will be logged on it and when you run out
[10:38.120 --> 10:45.840]  of carbon credits and everything has a carbon score you will then be taxed now
[10:45.840 --> 10:49.360]  all the individual carbon-intensive items you're buying will already have
[10:49.360 --> 10:56.000]  a tax passed along through the production but there's going to be a tax on
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.680]  you and and and the globalist admit in fact what was it two years ago I had the
[11:02.680 --> 11:08.080]  award-winning scientist who developed this plan 20 years ago I had him on as I
[11:08.080 --> 11:13.040]  saw him in the British news you know science advisor says put everyone on
[11:13.040 --> 11:19.200]  carbon rations we had him on he said just like World War two you will all be
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.520]  on rations and this will save the planet and then he admitted that as they saw
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.880]  fit they would then reduce the rations you're just all going to be put on
[11:27.880 --> 11:37.440]  artificial scarcity prisons straight jackets run by these control freaks you
[11:37.440 --> 11:40.440]  wonder how eugenicists that want to reduce world population and want to
[11:40.440 --> 11:43.520]  exterminate people are going to get control they set up a planetary regime
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.280]  that tracks everything you eat everything you buy everything you use and
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.240]  certainly we're wasteful it sounds reasonable on the surface oh you know
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.160]  use paper bags use a cloth bag don't buy so much don't don't have that SUV don't
[11:59.160 --> 12:04.920]  it's hurting the earth but it allows an absolute tyranny it's just like this
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.400]  healthcare bill that's past the house people are now reading the 1900 plus
[12:09.400 --> 12:15.880]  pages is almost 2000 and it admits that all these federal bureaucracies have
[12:15.880 --> 12:21.080]  unlimited extra judicial outside the courts you have no recourse and it gives
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.120]  the hospitals the insurance companies the government everyone involved in this
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.800]  monopoly this oligopoly of corruption it gives them complete liability
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.240]  protection just like vaccine makers have liability protection for the last 40
[12:34.240 --> 12:39.040]  years the government quietly quietly pays out a pittance to people who are
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.320]  brain damaged or killed by vaccines and the FDA admits okay if this kills you
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.520]  that paralyzed you you know here's a hundred thousand dollars you can't sue
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.160]  in the courts you can't win there's a federal prohibition but so you don't go
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.240]  postal will give you a hundred grand for your dead kid or your dead mother or
[12:57.240 --> 13:05.040]  father how's that sound and so under the new environmental legislation that's
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.320]  past the house there is total liability protection to all the government agents
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.160]  and groups it's extra judicial no due process home inspections no warrants
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.360]  anytime they want they can condemn your home in one week if you don't make
[13:18.360 --> 13:23.960]  changes the federal government orders there are $10,000 a week fines hell has
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.680]  been released or the last link is breaking and bending and about to be
[13:29.680 --> 13:34.880]  released it's past the committee it's waiting in orbit to be dropped on us like
[13:34.880 --> 13:41.240]  a neutron bomb every neocon publication is now lying saying stand down the
[13:41.240 --> 13:47.400]  health care bill won't pass the global greenhouse gas bill won't pass the gun
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.120]  control bills won't pass the open border bills won't pass there they're saying
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.480]  stand down stand down we've won we've won don't worry don't worry dead on
[13:56.480 --> 14:02.960]  arrival dead on arrival it's a complete lie probably all gonna pass not this
[14:02.960 --> 14:09.080]  year early next year brace for impact and you'll again I'll have higher
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.320]  credibility when it does pass but unfortunately we would have lost again
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.880]  you must learn their tricks remember they told you a couple weeks ago oh it'll
[14:16.880 --> 14:20.840]  never pass the house the health care bill three months ago oh the heavy a
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.800]  global greenhouse gas cap and trade tax won't pass the house never gonna happen
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.240]  and the neocons would kind of pull the britches up you know up their bellies at
[14:30.240 --> 14:39.880]  the bar and say that ain't gonna pass everything's fine Fox News says so really
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.400]  Rupert Murdoch's made a five-minute promo video showing how every one of his
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.240]  dramas and TV shows and movies under his orders promotes global taxes and the
[14:48.240 --> 14:54.320]  carbon dioxide is poison and then we're all gonna drown if we don't do it the
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.000]  guy plays a double game ladies and gentlemen oh he's got Fox News there
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.800]  posing as if it's libertarian as if it's conservative just long enough just to
[15:05.800 --> 15:11.120]  sucker enough people in so that when they tell you stand down none of these
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.120]  bills are gonna pass you'll stand down and they do pass and then you're like
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.600]  how'd that happen what was that look at this headline everyone in Britain
[15:22.600 --> 15:26.760]  could be given a personal carbon allowance see you heard it here first two
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.600]  years ago actually for ten years I've been telling you since I read government
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.960]  documents that everything you buy and sell and do will be on a scan card that
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.960]  will be part of the national sales tax and will register your carbon footprint
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.840]  and what you eat and if you're buying too much red meat or too much bluebell
[15:42.840 --> 15:48.600]  ice cream or too much Budweiser beer and that's it first they're gonna put huge
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.640]  fines on you and they admit CPS is going to visit you we've had guests on the
[15:53.640 --> 15:59.920]  show who go into their doctor for a checkup when they're 54 years old in one
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.840]  case and doctor says do you drink you drink and drive the fella didn't know
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.360]  he was been spied on under government mandate he said no but I do drink a six
[16:07.360 --> 16:13.040]  pack most evenings when I get home well he had his license revoked extra
[16:13.040 --> 16:18.040]  judicially they just said well it sounds like he might drink and drive
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.120]  someday I mean that that's how America works the nurses have been trained to
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.640]  spy the schools have been trained to spy all the repairmen in your house have
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.760]  been trained to spy I had a he's a pretty nice guy but had a cable guy in my
[16:33.760 --> 16:37.280]  house like a week ago and there was a little bag of silver coins sitting there
[16:37.280 --> 16:44.280]  I haven't you know taken and then stored off-site yet I since have it's a
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.480]  little bag of coins probably worth $500 he was staring at it looking at it and
[16:48.480 --> 16:51.480]  he was looking at other stuff and when he was trying to fix the cable modem he
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.640]  was you know I was being cased but that's what they do that's their job they
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.640]  casue for the government this is what it's like to live in the Orwellian world
[17:00.640 --> 17:08.960]  of America with a big fat K of course our ancestors couldn't be convinced that
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.040]  having their neighbors and children turned into spies was good they knew
[17:14.040 --> 17:18.760]  that all the government sweet talk about having informant neighbors was really
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.880]  bad news and always meant enslavement they knew
[17:31.320 --> 17:41.840]  I mean we really should just have a moment of silence for this country we
[17:41.840 --> 17:46.000]  really should just have a moment of silence now the truth is I'm not the
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.600]  radical I I have my head screwed on straight I understand their plan I I
[17:50.600 --> 17:56.000]  read Rand Corporation and United Nations and Club of Rome and Council on
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.720]  Foreign Relations Internet and International Institute of Public
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.360]  Relations own documents in the Royal Institute of International Affairs I
[18:03.360 --> 18:09.880]  read what they have to say and when they tell me that they're going to set up a
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.880]  economic and paramilitary straightjacket that is meant to drive me into
[18:14.880 --> 18:19.480]  bankruptcy and into dependence on the government so that my children can be
[18:19.480 --> 18:23.320]  taken and sterilized and so I can be sterilized oh yes you'll be given food
[18:23.320 --> 18:28.320]  just agree to the sterilization it's already being announced in the news and
[18:28.320 --> 18:32.160]  that then after they're done with this next phase they're going to have drones
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.240]  fly over every major city in the world and just kill us this is just phase one
[18:37.240 --> 18:41.800]  right now so they can get their straightjacket in place and decide who
[18:41.800 --> 18:51.280]  they want to allow to survive that's all and so you know what you grow up once
[18:51.280 --> 19:00.360]  you know this information once you understand that the establishment is
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.720]  planning at a certain point after they've had lots of little plagues to get us
[19:03.720 --> 19:07.600]  all trained on what to do that they're the good guys and they're the boss and
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.520]  we do what they say during emergencies so the police and the military they're
[19:11.520 --> 19:17.480]  all gonna go along with it in the final phase and they're all going to die the
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.360]  globalists have plans that have been declassified to nerve gas every major
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.960]  city and kill us or just hit us with knockout gas they have plans to release
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.160]  bio weapons to which the elites have been given the cure and all and we all
[19:31.160 --> 19:35.760]  just die and they emerge in a month to the world I mean if you think that's
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.000]  funny and cute and oh I know you don't want to believe me you don't want to
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.760]  read the government textbooks you want to go watch GI Joe where you smile at the
[19:43.760 --> 19:47.600]  general and feel like you're part of go Joe and then you go join the military
[19:47.600 --> 19:51.200]  and get your legs blown off and nobody really cares about you but you don't
[19:51.200 --> 19:55.240]  care you get to come home and be a cop and bust some teeth in and everybody
[19:55.240 --> 20:02.080]  bowls to you you better grow up and wake up to the big plan the once mighty US

[20:13.720 --> 20:17.720]  soon worthless dollar the once great dollar has been destroyed by our own
[20:17.720 --> 20:21.600]  reckless and irresponsible leaders and Americans will soon be paying the price

[24:37.360 --> 24:40.920]  keep the left-right paradigm going on the left then sees that and thinks hey
[24:40.920 --> 24:46.400]  he's getting tough we want troops and then code pink and all the George Soros
[24:46.400 --> 24:58.920]  groups come out and openly call for world government and openly call for an
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.280]  expansion of the war now it's liberal there is no difference except in rhetoric
[25:04.280 --> 25:08.560]  they're playing you they're manipulating you they're there to guard the opium
[25:08.560 --> 25:13.760]  look at this everyone in Britain could be given a personal carbon allowance
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.680]  there's another one this is all gonna happen in the u.s. environment boss wants
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.560]  to put carbon tax on driving heating and on holidays there's another one
[25:22.560 --> 25:30.240]  government impose carbon capture levy to fund cold-fired power plants
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.200]  families will pay a new levy on electricity bills for at least the next
[25:36.200 --> 25:39.560]  20 years to fund technology designed to capture the carbon from cold-fired
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.880]  power plants as if carbon dioxide is bad and who open and and and who just so
[25:46.880 --> 25:50.520]  happens to own these companies that the governments are giving the contracts to
[25:50.520 --> 25:56.600]  Al Gore the Rothschilds the Rockefellers that's in the news see they get to decide
[25:56.600 --> 26:00.440]  what technologies get developed and it's the technologies they own and control
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.360]  and you got to buy the credits from them who could think up a scam this
[26:05.360 --> 26:11.360]  dastardly this huge this ridiculous this is like clowns showing up at your
[26:11.360 --> 26:16.160]  house in clown makeup and and and saying give us your son and daughters we're
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.000]  going to roast them on the front lawn and you say absolutely here let's dig a
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.520]  pit let me butcher my children for you please eat my children but that's how
[26:26.520 --> 26:30.320]  ridiculous this is all these con artists show up and say we're gonna run your
[26:30.320 --> 26:33.600]  life outside the courts and tax everything you do it's for the
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.360]  environment and you're gonna buy your carbon credits from private interest the
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.840]  very same groups pushing all this oh absolutely I'm for the earth and then
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.320]  we have a federal government that's been caught staging declassified over 200
[26:48.320 --> 26:54.720]  terror attacks and project gladio the NATO option operation Ajax the USS
[26:54.720 --> 27:01.400]  Liberty they did that with Israel the Gulf of Tonkin now totally declassified
[27:01.400 --> 27:07.200]  it's in the 2004 declassified army field manual how to quote stage false flag
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.240]  attacks on your own people or on local villages to then get the villagers to
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.040]  support you you stage an attack against them and blame it on your enemy I mean
[27:16.040 --> 27:22.680]  that's in the army field manual now this is a fact they train captains and up how
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.560]  the states terror attacks in America and if you're a captain in the army and
[27:27.560 --> 27:31.760]  weren't trained that's because you're not in special operations you're fixing
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.720]  helicopters or you're making sure ammunition gets delivered or you're
[27:37.720 --> 27:43.480]  making sure there's latrines I'm talking about combat captains they're all
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.080]  trained out of stage terror attacks and they're all let in on the little the
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.880]  little treat of how GI Joe wins and then I have to sit here and have a top
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.560]  former CIA spook the editor of the Washington Times attack 9-11 truth

[28:28.480 --> 28:32.360]  upset now that whenever there's a terror attack the general public asked
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.200]  themselves who stands to gain from this oh you're upset people for that
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.040]  operation north woods now they're gonna get more information as time goes on

[33:13.040 --> 33:19.640]  well judge Napolitano is our guest today and I'm very very excited to have him
[33:19.640 --> 33:22.960]  on this is an abbreviated visit we're gonna get him back on for a full 30
[33:22.960 --> 33:28.360]  minutes or maybe even an hour and he's of course from Newark New Jersey he's a
[33:28.360 --> 33:32.040]  tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey and now an analyst on Fox News
[33:32.040 --> 33:37.080]  Channel he has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has Freedom
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.440]  Watch from Fox New Studios which is an internet television show and he also is
[33:41.440 --> 33:47.520]  the guest host for Glenn Beck I wish he was the the person doing that show
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.040]  because he is the real bonafide he wrote an editorial last week pointing out
[33:52.040 --> 33:57.600]  that the Republican health care plan was almost as bad as the Democrats and he
[33:57.600 --> 34:03.800]  is a constitutionalist right up there with Ron Paul and so he's somebody I
[34:03.800 --> 34:09.840]  actually agree with on like 98% of stuff instead of Glenn Beck 90% because that
[34:09.840 --> 34:15.240]  10% is a big area and so here for about 15 minutes to talk about health care the
[34:15.240 --> 34:19.640]  big government takeover of health care extra judicial these boards decide what
[34:19.640 --> 34:24.560]  to do and to talk about the cap and trade which I believe has a good chance of
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.160]  passing the Senate both of these are now in orbit like ICBM space stations
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.520]  about to drop nukes on our Republic and Judge Andrew Napolitano is there
[34:35.520 --> 34:39.880]  fighting it valiantly judge it's great to have you with us well thank you Alex
[34:39.880 --> 34:45.160]  it's good to be home with you there's so much happening what's more important
[34:45.160 --> 34:48.960]  cap and trade and the total micromanagement of our life by special
[34:48.960 --> 34:52.440]  interest with Al Gore set to make the money or the government takeover of
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.800]  health care oh boy that's that's really a pick your poison Alex it's all it's
[34:56.800 --> 35:02.040]  all part of the same big government mentality your kind comments about the
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.320]  piece I wrote was really from the monologue that I gave while filling in
[35:06.320 --> 35:10.240]  for Glenn Beck which I'm also doing later today at five o'clock Eastern by the
[35:10.240 --> 35:15.680]  way on Fox News channel in which I argued that we don't have a two-party system in
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.160]  this country we have a one-party one political party called the big
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.840]  government party the Republican branch likes war and deficits and assaulting
[35:25.840 --> 35:31.160]  our civil liberties and the Democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.760]  and assaulting our commercial liberties but the mindset is the same the heck
[35:36.760 --> 35:40.920]  with the Constitution the heck with the Bill of Rights the heck with inalienable
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.080]  rights the heck with even the laws that we write we know what's better for you
[35:45.080 --> 35:50.240]  than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you how to obey or
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.720]  else cap and trade is one manifestation of that
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.960]  Obamacare is another manifestation of it I was furious last week when I saw that
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.400]  even the Republicans even so-called conservative Republicans not Ron Paul
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.040]  but many in the Republican leadership in the house introduced Obamacare life
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.600]  which basically presumes a federal role in health care of which there is none
[36:18.600 --> 36:24.320]  under the Constitution tells insurance carriers you can't refuse to cover
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.120]  people because of pre-existing entries that's a very nice thing but there's no
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.520]  power for the Congress to mandate it that's got to come about by the by the
[36:32.520 --> 36:36.760]  free market bribes the states to change their court system so they would
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.680]  basically go to the state of New Jersey and say we'll repave the garden state
[36:40.680 --> 36:45.880]  Parkway and the New Jersey turnpike if you put caps on the limits that juries
[36:45.880 --> 36:51.840]  can award injuries against doctors in medical malpractice lawsuits if you and
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.360]  I went to a state and said I'll give you money if you change our laws we'd be
[36:55.360 --> 37:02.320]  arrested for bribery so this was all the same mindset of we in Washington can
[37:02.320 --> 37:09.320]  micromanage the private free choices of individuals back home and I condemned it
[37:09.320 --> 37:16.760]  and I do so again today judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest today judge what
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.360]  you're talking about and reading over the legislation it's like Groundhog Day
[37:20.360 --> 37:27.920]  but on a bigger scale it's Chicago or New York big city crime boss a machine
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.840]  doling everything out it's like with the takeover of General Motors it even
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.680]  came out in congressional investigations as you know because you covered it that
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.640]  people that gave money to Obama cronies or to the Democratic Party they got to
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.800]  keep their dealership and got to keep their client list but if you didn't if
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.400]  you'd ever gone against them or hadn't paid the protection money you lost your
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.360]  dealership even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.520]  made millions of dollars a year and so now you have this 10th Amendment
[37:59.520 --> 38:06.480]  destroying federal power coming in with these unelected panels and it just goes
[38:06.480 --> 38:12.640]  on and on and on and on and I fear it can pass the Senate I'm hearing some of
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.000]  the Republican leadership saying oh no it won't they said it wouldn't pass the
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.760]  House in the last two weeks well they did say it wouldn't pass the House and it
[38:19.760 --> 38:25.000]  did pass by by a two-vote margin and you know you really can't tell what
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.440]  politicians because they'll they'll the leadership will bribe them remember the
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.720]  first time tarp the so-called troubled asset relief program went through the
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.600]  house it was defeated I remember I was on the Fox Business Network at the
[38:39.600 --> 38:48.200]  moment to fist in air just emoting joy shouting the beast is dead but I was
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.880]  naive because the leadership came back and brought it by you know we'll build a
[38:52.880 --> 38:55.720]  courthouse in your district your friend wants to become a federal judge he's
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.920]  got it just vote for us on tarp eventually people change their vote I
[38:59.920 --> 39:03.520]  fear that the same thing will happen with respect to Obamacare the
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.000]  government the executive branch the leadership in both parties in both
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.400]  houses will bribe those who are wavering and give them something else that they
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.520]  want in order to secure their vote but you also raise a very important issue
[39:19.520 --> 39:27.320]  about the delegation of federal power to non-elected groups this is what FDR did
[39:27.320 --> 39:35.360]  and FDR is the model for President Barack Obama FDR had over 500 groups
[39:35.360 --> 39:41.040]  throughout the country appointed by local politicians who decided what prices
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.040]  and wages were there's a famous case in my home state of New Jersey where an
[39:46.040 --> 39:52.400]  Eastern European immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and
[39:52.400 --> 39:58.040]  price group declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a
[39:58.040 --> 40:05.800]  man's suit this guy charged 35 cents literally a nickel cheaper than what
[40:05.800 --> 40:11.360]  the unelected local board said he could charge he was arrested by the FBI he was
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.320]  indicted by a grand jury he was put on trial in federal court in Newark and he
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.200]  served a three-month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.560]  less than what the local board allowed him to now transform that into modern day
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.920]  practice of medicine you will have a board of bureaucrats not even physicians
[40:32.920 --> 40:38.200]  bureaucrats that will be between you and your physician you will lose your
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.960]  privacy you will lose the freedom of choice because the bureaucratic board
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.560]  will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use
[40:48.560 --> 40:54.040]  to address your ailment and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.280]  he can prescribe and that's all in there ailment and that's why they're saying
[40:58.280 --> 41:00.960]  they're gonna get all these hundreds of billions out of Medicare and Medicaid
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.000]  by reducing the care Tom Daschle wrote a book admitting if you're old you don't
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.600]  deserve it you don't need it people are really about to find out who these
[41:10.600 --> 41:15.120]  eugenicists are who these control freaks are that inhabit the Democratic
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.160]  party and to some extent the Republican Party in the five minutes we've got
[41:18.160 --> 41:22.960]  left with Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us today on you in a very busy
[41:22.960 --> 41:29.200]  schedule I want to shift gears now to war you talk about the Republicans won
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.440]  endless war and the Democrats won a nanny state you together to death but
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.880]  look at Obama he's increased troops before in Afghanistan he's now saying
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.800]  he's gonna send 40,000 more in that we're never going to leave there's over
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.800]  300,000 international and Afghan troops there now I see absolutely no difference
[41:48.800 --> 41:54.160]  between the parties just different rhetoric I must reluctantly agree with
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.000]  you I say reluctantly not because I don't like to agree with you I I do but
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.080]  because I I was naively expecting that we would not see this kind of build up
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.420]  under him that we saw under George W. Bush but think about it war is the
[42:07.420 --> 42:11.960]  health of the state when when we fight a war people will look the other way when
[42:11.960 --> 42:14.960]  our taxes are raised and when the government takes away their freedom
[42:14.960 --> 42:18.880]  because they accept the illusion that by fighting the war the government is
[42:18.880 --> 42:25.080]  somehow keeping them safe presidents love war because it lets them escape the
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.680]  confines of the Constitution it lets them become a little bit of a prince it
[42:29.680 --> 42:33.320]  even causes judges sometimes if the president does something under the
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.600]  guise of war making to look the other way and defer to the executive branch
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.520]  fortunately the Supreme Court did not do that under Bush years under the Bush
[42:42.520 --> 42:48.080]  years that every single time his war making powers were challenged in the
[42:48.080 --> 42:52.640]  courts and made its way to the Supreme Court of the United States he was zero
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.520]  and six before a Supreme Court that was appointed largely by Republicans judge
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.760]  were you surprised to rely on the Supreme Court to save us because their
[43:02.760 --> 43:05.920]  life's here and you don't know which way they're gonna go and because it takes
[43:05.920 --> 43:11.200]  too long for the issue to get to them and too much arm can happen between time
[43:11.200 --> 43:15.080]  the time presidents wage war and the time their war powers are challenged in the
[43:15.080 --> 43:19.720]  courts were you surprised that Obama flip-flops so strongly and went from
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.040]  being anti-patriot act to zealously defending it wanting to expand it and
[43:24.040 --> 43:28.960]  complete warrantless wiretapping complete secret arrest complete I mean I
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.640]  mean he's he's going further than Bush on the police state I didn't think that
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.120]  was possible I didn't think it was possible either and I was absolutely
[43:36.120 --> 43:41.200]  crushed when I heard it he obviously was not my candidate of choice but I took a
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.480]  little bit of internal intellectual solace in the fact that at least we were
[43:46.480 --> 43:52.120]  getting a president who would respect the Constitution how wrong I was his
[43:52.120 --> 43:58.040]  disrespect for the Constitution may not be couched in as harsh and obvious and
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.880]  over terms as in the Bush years but it's just as bad just as destructive and
[44:03.880 --> 44:10.080]  just as willing to overlook specific restraints written in the Constitution to
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.560]  restrain the president as were many of his predecessors well I've talked to a
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.040]  lot of what will accept it exactly I've talked to a lot of lawyers and judges and
[44:19.040 --> 44:23.120]  I wanted to briefly see if you agree even though a lot of conservatives didn't
[44:23.120 --> 44:26.840]  like Obama true paleo conservatives libertarian types like Ron Paul and
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.360]  himself because he is a constitutional lawyer and practice it for ten years as
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.600]  a professor people expected that Obama would try to at least on the surface
[44:36.600 --> 44:41.720]  restore some of the bill of rights but instead you know he's saying Constitution
[44:41.720 --> 44:47.880]  it's just a gd piece of paper I I too expected that he would show more respect
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.680]  for the Constitution I read some of the lectures he gave at the University of
[44:51.680 --> 44:55.960]  Chicago Law School I could have given some of those lectures myself when I
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.560]  taught Constitutional law at Seton Hall Law School in Newark and at Delaware
[44:59.560 --> 45:04.800]  Law School in Wilmington Delaware but you know something happens when you don
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.840]  the mantle of power and that's something is a disdain for the restraint on your
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.080]  power a disdain for the natural law our respect that we have natural rights
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.240]  beyond which no government can go a disdain for the Constitution itself
[45:18.240 --> 45:22.400]  a disdain for inalienable rights same as natural rights and a disdain for the
[45:22.400 --> 45:28.760]  bill of rights they just simply don't care they will steal from the rich to give
[45:28.760 --> 45:34.880]  to the poor to create a class of people dependent upon them who will continue to
[45:34.880 --> 45:39.400]  vote them in office so they can continue to be taken care of cradle degree by a
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.760]  federal government that doesn't have one iota of constitutional authority to do
[45:43.760 --> 45:47.280]  all of this well said final question I'm gonna let you go because I know you've
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.600]  got to fill in guest hose for Glenn Beck tonight congratulations on your huge
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.120]  success as your star rises because you're the bonafide constitutionalist we
[45:55.120 --> 46:01.280]  really really appreciate you judge Andrew Napolitano but in closing I would
[46:01.280 --> 46:07.040]  like to get you to comment a on just how special George Washington and Andrew
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.280]  Jackson were they got all this power and then did give it up they wanted George
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.920]  Washington to be a king you know these were amazing founding fathers we had and
[46:15.920 --> 46:20.680]  what would they think of what's happening today where Noah satellite
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.520]  information service the federal government admits the coldest winner so
[46:26.520 --> 46:32.560]  far in the last 50 years the the the the third coldest in the last hundred
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.320]  meanwhile they're openly announcing there that they're gonna list carbon
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.200]  dioxide as a toxic waste and tax it when humans exhale it can you can you end
[46:41.200 --> 46:44.600]  with speaking about our founders compared to the material we've got in
[46:44.600 --> 46:50.680]  Washington today and what they would think of taxing what plants breathe the
[46:50.680 --> 46:56.160]  founders tried to do two things with the Constitution one was to create a
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.120]  federal government strong enough to protect us from invasion and to do
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.040]  national type things like run a post office and make sure that there's trade
[47:04.040 --> 47:07.840]  between the states the other was to restrain the federal government so that
[47:07.840 --> 47:11.840]  it wouldn't interfere with our personal liberties they specifically gave us a
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.280]  Constitution that capable kept the federal government away from any type
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.200]  of relationship with individuals because they knew that the greatest threat to
[47:21.200 --> 47:26.280]  freedom comes not from your enemy on the outside who you can see and look at
[47:26.280 --> 47:31.520]  but from the smiling face of the government on the inside who cleans
[47:31.520 --> 47:35.640]  but it's going to take care of you and presidents like George Washington who's
[47:35.640 --> 47:41.120]  closest advisor Alexander Hamilton wanted him to be king and Andrew Jackson
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.560]  who basically said to the Supreme Court you know they've gone ahead and made
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.920]  their their federal bank let them find the money and put the mother deposits
[47:49.920 --> 47:54.320]  in the federal bank these were people who understood that there were natural
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.000]  limits on what government can do and written limits on what the federal
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.040]  government can do and they stuck to those limits the present government and
[48:04.040 --> 48:09.680]  its predecessors you know from Lincoln to Wilson to FDR to George W. Bush to
[48:09.680 --> 48:14.160]  Barack Obama has so distorted out of proportion what the federal government
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.120]  is to do that the founders would would not recognize it at all and what
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.520]  probably want to take up arms against it what are you covering tonight and
[48:22.520 --> 48:25.120]  we'll let you go I hope you're going to be covering the health care and cap and
[48:25.120 --> 48:28.920]  trade because what we're talking about we're talking about health care we're
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.200]  talking about the the state of the economy we're talking about the
[48:33.200 --> 48:39.880]  government subpoenaing media entities wanting to know who earns how much
[48:39.880 --> 48:46.840]  money because they have to decide whose income taxes to audit next you're
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.040]  kidding wait a minute they're not just the federal government is subpoenaing
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.280]  media people to their subpoenaing media companies to find out who earns what and
[48:56.280 --> 49:02.080]  what their social security numbers are this is getting so bad so quickly far
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.600]  worse than any of us imagined and the president hasn't even celebrated his
[49:07.600 --> 49:11.640]  first year in office yet since you brought that up about tonight since you
[49:11.640 --> 49:15.560]  brought that up let me just ask you now senator Lamar Alexander's gone to the
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.600]  floor and talked about he's confirmed there's an enemy's list he warned him
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.800]  and said look I worked for Nixon don't do this it's been reported I am on the
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.440]  enemy's list I'm going from memory I think you are too but what is it I mean
[49:30.440 --> 49:37.120]  this is crazy it is scary to to know that there's a real enemy's list and this
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.320]  is I mean is this not illegal judge well it's illegal for the president to to
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.880]  compile a list of people who disagree with him on the basis of their political
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.480]  opinions and their outspoken words that was specifically written into the
[49:50.480 --> 49:56.680]  privacy law in 1974 enacted and signed into law by President Ford shortly
[49:56.680 --> 50:03.240]  after president Nixon resigned these are restraints expressly enacted to restrain
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.160]  the president but this White House just like it doesn't respect freedom of
[50:07.160 --> 50:10.800]  contract just like it doesn't respect freedom of speech just like it doesn't
[50:10.800 --> 50:16.240]  respect privacy doesn't respect this either well I tell you it's scary and
[50:16.240 --> 50:19.680]  everybody should pray for the people that are on that list myself included
[50:19.680 --> 50:23.480]  judge what's the best website for people to visit to find out about all
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.360]  things judge Napolitano well they can go to foxnews.com where my freedom watch
[50:28.360 --> 50:35.440]  appears as do my monologues when I fill in for a Glenn as do many of my as do
[50:35.440 --> 50:40.080]  many of my op-eds and Alex I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being on with

[54:18.440 --> 54:23.720]  into this world we're coming up we've got the clip of George Soros Obama
[54:23.720 --> 54:35.040]  puppet master calls for carbon taxes and new world order on pbs that is coming
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.640]  up later in the broadcast today general stubblebinds joining us along with this
[54:39.640 --> 54:46.000]  medical doctor wife dr. rama labo going to be extremely informative
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.600]  judge andrew napolitano is anti-war anti-patriot act anti-new world order
[54:52.600 --> 55:00.760]  anti-carbon tax he's almost as good as ron paul on the issues and fox uses him
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.760]  like you use a little cayenne pepper and chili they just throw a little bit of it
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.280]  in there and i like the fact that he's on more and more and i've talked to him
[55:10.280 --> 55:16.440]  off air talk to him privately read his columns for years he's a good guy i don't
[55:16.440 --> 55:19.720]  like coming out and attacking back because i know he's fooled a lot of people
[55:19.720 --> 55:24.280]  and it turns folks off but i have to tell the truth and if beck will stop
[55:24.280 --> 55:30.920]  stabbing us in the back and and stop going sideways on issues i'll supporting
[55:30.920 --> 55:36.360]  the issue here is the owner rupert murdoch admits that he's supporting the
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.320]  global carbon tax and is invested in it and has all of his movies and dramas
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.840]  and non-fox news shows promoting it we've
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.880]  fact call paul watson because i couldn't find it this morning he wrote an article about it two years ago
[55:50.520 --> 55:57.160]  it it it has the rupert murdoch bragging look at how i'm propagandizing i'm proud of myself
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.400]  it's the montage of fox tv programs that fox put out where they're promoting the global tax
[56:04.280 --> 56:10.360]  you see you you you won't hear napolitano or these guys talk about that look i'm not stupid
[56:10.360 --> 56:17.560]  and i'm not going to get into details but i could certainly go if i played my cards right go join
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.120]  team fox ladies and gentlemen i wasn't ever offered a job by them but i was offered jobs
[56:22.120 --> 56:29.480]  by people affiliated with them years ago i told him no way okay i'm going to fight the new world
[56:29.480 --> 56:37.800]  order but i think we should recognize that fox is beginning to be forced because the audience
[56:37.800 --> 56:44.440]  has gone there to speak out against world government because all these years rush limbaugh and
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.920]  michael savage and all these guys said there's no new world order glenbeck said there was no new
[56:48.920 --> 56:54.120]  world order now it's openly being announced we're in a world government by the people that are pro
[56:54.120 --> 57:01.880]  world government and so they look pretty stupid and so they've got to bring somebody along like
[57:01.880 --> 57:09.000]  andrew depolitano who's been good the entire time to not just keep their audience but grow
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.560]  fox is growing their audience while cnn cnbc all the rest of them are imploding and that's because
[57:15.560 --> 57:21.960]  fox isn't stupid they are going anti-new world order at least to a certain degree
[57:24.600 --> 57:29.800]  well we're going all the way anti-new world order and we always have and that's who we are
[57:29.800 --> 57:34.360]  but i get emails going well why are you having judge andrew depolitano on he's on with fox
[57:34.360 --> 57:40.200]  he's telling the truth when he's on fox we need to support people inside the mainstream media
[57:40.200 --> 57:44.040]  that are getting the truth out while understanding the larger picture
[57:46.120 --> 57:48.680]  before we go to break and come back with governor jesse ventura
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.920]  i just want to finish making the point we must take over the system we must get the power and

[58:54.840 --> 58:59.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[58:59.960 --> 59:04.840]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:04.840 --> 59:10.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[59:10.440 --> 59:15.480]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[59:15.480 --> 59:20.600]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:20.600 --> 59:24.760]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:24.760 --> 59:29.480]  weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:04.520]  their big number one promoted show and i'm seeing that now in the media that's conspiracy theory
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:09.720]  created by jesse ventura i'm a consultant on it i'm in some of the episodes i'm very honored
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:15.080]  to be involved in it and to give you the inside scoop he starts the media blitz tomorrow to give
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.960]  you the inside scoop is jesse ventura with us for the next hour we may twist his arm a little bit
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:24.360]  in the next hour to take some phone calls but we'll see governor it is good to have you here
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:39.720]  with us and i'll explain that for a moment now alex has been good enough he uh he appears in
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:46.040]  a couple of the episodes of conspiracy theory that we did and so because he's the only really
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:52.520]  reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial bite we went back to the old starsky and
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.160]  hutch show and y'all remember huggy bear don't you the guy that always brought the information
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:04.120]  to starsky and hutch yes well that's you now alex you're so you're our huggy bear well i'm
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.720]  honored to be your huggy bear um you've not been able to talk about the show till now they've
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:16.040]  unleashed you you you barely talked about it on larry king live last week but now you've been
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:23.960]  given the green light to to give people a a a foretaste or a idea of what's going to be in the
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:28.920]  seven episodes and so we're all ears governor i mean tell us about some of the episodes well first
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:34.280]  of all um when i went on larry it was because you know it was election night and larry truly
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:42.120]  wanted my opinion on the latest off your elections which i'll get i'll do this right now to me why
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.320]  do they even have off your elections it's hard enough to get people out there to vote uh have
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:53.160]  them all on your they do that so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:59.400]  small numbers and so that's why that happens pretty much but that being said um that's why
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:05.000]  it was on larry was mainly for the the election stuff not so much a promotion of the show because
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:10.760]  i'll be going back on larry later on the end of the month right when it gets to the debut date which
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:17.000]  of course is december the second on the two channel at uh ten eastern nine central and
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.680]  so i'll be going back on larry then and at that point in time it'll be a promo for the show so
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:27.960]  i just did larry where they promoted a little bit but it was mostly on voting but uh or on the
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:32.120]  vote bill that governor hold on you're about to go to break and i want i don't want to stop you
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.520]  i want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:41.400]  i've consulted some but i still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and i know that
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:46.200]  you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective probably the first television
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:51.880]  show ever that's actually from people who questions perspective that doesn't mean that you or i or
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:56.280]  anybody buys all of what's being set out there so i want to talk about that when you come back
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:01.000]  in just a minute but in the one minute we've got what is your take on republicans sweeping
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.600]  uh all over the country and obama's plunging approval rating well i don't think it's so
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:12.840]  much republicans sweeping uh as you know they lost that uh that congressional race up in
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:17.480]  that heavily republican district in new york that haven't gone democrat yeah but the democrats
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:22.280]  threw that they threw that i mean they had their well maybe so well to me the elections
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:29.480]  are truly irrelevant and as far as obama's ratings falling um that's a natural occurrence
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:34.200]  you know i don't want to throw water on the fire or anything for those people you know for whatever
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:41.400]  reason but i at one time had 72 percent approval ratings well certainly by the time you get out
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:49.160]  of office might actually dip below 50 later no you're right when you have to make hard decisions
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:55.720]  when you make those hard decisions some people aren't gonna like it then a lot of people are
[1:04:55.720 --> 1:05:00.840]  wanting to shoot people jesse we gotta break we gotta break stay right there finish that up you

[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.120]  jesse called me back friday evening and said okay i'll do your show first i was extremely honored
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:52.840]  and so governor i really do appreciate uh you coming here first to talk about it i know the
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:58.680]  media blitz starts later today and tomorrow but we but we were finishing up when you got cut off
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:03.160]  by that break you were talking about you're not surprised obama's approval ratings dropped
[1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:10.200]  yours went from the mid 70s to the high 40s and but but but that was four years later my issue
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:15.960]  yeah that's true alex but it's gonna happen you know that the honeymoon wears off the hard
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:21.960]  decisions have to be made people many times disagree with those tough decisions and your
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:27.720]  approval rating starts to fall the positive for me the way i always looked at it was like this
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:36.200]  i was in a three-way race not a two-way race i won with only 37 percent so even if my approval
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:44.040]  saved fell all the way to 35 that was still eight points higher than what i won with sure and george
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:53.160]  w bushes went from 92 uh to 39 but again that took seven he had to have been lower than 39
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:57.480]  yeah some approval ratings had him at 25 i mean there's so many polls yes he would
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:04.120]  sell with the hardcore republicans i i in the end i can't see him even getting over 30 percent
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:10.760]  approval rate well i know congress just a political gift from his party exactly i know that the
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:15.880]  overall congress both parties had an 11 percent when he left office and it's now going back down
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:20.920]  that direction again my point is obama's approval rating has broken records according to the major
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:26.600]  pollsters for falling the fastest in the first year of a new administration and and now he's
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:33.640]  losing his base he the cbs news last night reported he is putting in 40 000 more troops
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:38.120]  in afghanistan and jesse i know you've researched this and are well read on this subject let's talk
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.200]  about this right now and then get into the show there's 12 times the opium 12 times coming out
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:49.400]  of afghanistan of what was coming out eight years ago and even the bbc admits our troops
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:54.920]  are guarding the opium so quote the taliban doesn't get it no that's so the banks can
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:11:01.080]  launder 500 billion in smack every year governor ventura your take on this war i i want to be
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:10.840]  welcome in my lifetime now how wonderful it is welcome to another vietnam it's that simple
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:17.160]  it's going to accomplish nothing guys are going to die over there on a constant basis as they have
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:23.800]  an iraq and you know welcome to another vietnam when they when this is all over and done with
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:32.200]  this i will i do it right now alex i sit back and go how is this how is jesse ventura benefiting
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:39.720]  from these two wars and i can't think of the thing and yet we've got people out there protesting
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:45.320]  whether people should be able to go see a doctor or not if we wouldn't have thought these two wars
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:53.560]  we'd have plenty of money for health care wouldn't we absolutely and and my point is
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:12:02.920]  wars why you know wars are the most destructive thing mankind can do and when he engages in them
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:10.120]  it has no benefit it's like herman goreng said the best thing a farmer can get out of a war
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:16.920]  is to be able to come back on the same farm he left before the war started that's the best outcome
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:23.240]  the very best there will be nothing more than that and when is this country going to wake up
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.840]  you know i sit back and i'm a i i i can't i can't say i'm speechless because i'm i'm
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:37.080]  bitching about it right now but i cannot believe that people are protesting these wars and now
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:44.520]  we're sending more troops in to accomplish what the russians couldn't win there and we're so
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:54.280]  stupid and our ego is so powerful that we think we can well they can't win the state of objective
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:13:00.040]  to bring democracy and freedom to afghanistan but of the objective is to destabilize the region
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:05.720]  and have bases to menace iran and china and at the state of objective uh you know the real objective
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:11.480]  is to launder drug proceeds then it's mission accomplished they just need to sit there if that's
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:16.600]  indeed what it is alex then you will be really you're absolutely correct it's mission accomplished
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:21.800]  if that's what they're accomplishing out of this i can't prove that that's what they are aren't doing
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:29.800]  at this time but certainly from a base perspective of jesse ventura american citizen i don't understand
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:36.040]  how i benefit by these wars one bit or any of the rest of us benefit by them one bit okay here's an
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:40.440]  example then we'll get into the tv show sure i know you've been busy with you know producing the
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:44.600]  television show and flying all over the country and we'll talk about that you are really working
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:48.920]  hard on this a lot of work a lot of time a lot of energy a lot of money money than i wanted
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.680]  but at the same time it came out two weeks ago new york times that mohammed karzai's brother
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:04.440]  is the head opium king pennon afghanistan and that he is a cia operative on cia payroll
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:10.760]  and that basically so is mohammed karzai and that our troops are guarding his poppy fields
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:14.760]  and i was driving down the road a few months ago and heard bbc report the same thing before the
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:22.440]  new york times did and i already knew that but to hear them report that oh we guard the opium
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:27.080]  because if we don't guard it another taliban group will get it and they'll get too much power
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:31.240]  that's what they're telling the troops we guard the opium to win the war you know the cia got caught
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:38.280]  with opium in in uh in southeast asia in vietnam we're now in columbia putting bases in anywhere
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:46.120]  there's drugs our troops are there to eradicate the other guys drugs and protect uh the drug king
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:52.680]  pens that launder their money through us and european banks and add to that the fact that that's
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:59.240]  how the cia gets their revenue so that they can then do operations that they can keep away from
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:07.320]  congress because if they have to do operations that require them to get money from our tax money
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:11.960]  then they have to be forward enough to let congress know what they're doing with the money
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:19.160]  but if they're getting money via illegal drugs and making all sorts of money out of that end of the
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:24.920]  world they then don't have to declare any of that to congress and that's when they can do these dirty
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:31.480]  jobs that the american public will never know about governor jesse ventura that is the nail on
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:36.280]  the head absolutely i hadn't even thought to make that point all those tens of billions in
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:42.120]  unaccountable money that these private interest operations so that they don't have to be accountable
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:51.000]  to the congress absolutely in fact in 96 that came out on c span with the cia inspector general
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:16:00.520]  testifying that the cia brought in the crack cocaine epidemic well that that i don't know
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:07.000]  that you know about that alex i don't i can only speak to what i know about and yeah and uh you
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:12.520]  know you're but you're better well right on it than i am well no i mean i mean you know as much
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.960]  or more than i do you just brought up the key point that they're funding their black operations
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:22.120]  with this oh yeah no i i felt that knowing that for a long long time but that's that's the simple
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:27.320]  way to do it that's how you keep it out of the public eye that's how that's how you can get money
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:32.040]  to do political assassinations like in the old days when they used to attempt to kill castro
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:38.680]  okay i'm gonna shut up if they do that if they get money from congress then they have to submit
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:44.600]  reports and it has to be far more above board but if they get the money from somewhere else which
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:49.800]  can be dirty drug money well then they can spend it on any operations they want to do and they don't
[1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:55.240]  have to be accountable to the american public or the congress for it absolutely governor we've
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:59.320]  got you here to talk about the tv show but i'm gonna stop getting off and other issues i apologize
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:03.560]  but it's always interesting to hear your your truthful perspective because you're absolutely
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:10.440]  right on on those issues uh where to start with the tv show i mean i've seen the one promo clip
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:14.360]  where you went out to harp and they and they threatened to arrest you and then suddenly the
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:20.120]  equipment went dead let's go through the seven episodes and give people an idea what's coming up
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:25.560]  well yeah i hopefully i can remember them all i'll tell you we got we get it was so hectic
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:33.240]  shooting them that sometimes i had to jump from one episode to another episode and uh that plays
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:38.120]  games with your mind because you're focused in on one thing and then you know that the next half
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:43.320]  a day you might be doing something for a completely different let me ask this what's your favorite
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:49.000]  what's your favorite episode um i would say my favorite one would would be nine eleven
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:55.560]  one because i think nine eleven was the original one that i took to the two tv people to sell them
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:02.840]  on the show and so it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far so i would have
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:08.600]  to say that that that one is the most satisfying although they all are pretty much and i'll put it
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:14.040]  to you this way the the way that i'm going to explain it is quite simple alex people can choose
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:20.360]  to believe the conspiracies are not all seven of these and they're all fairly modern day the one
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:25.480]  thing two channel wanted to do we don't go back to kennedy we don't go back they wanted to keep
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:32.840]  this first series within the last decade pretty much and uh you can choose to believe them or
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:37.080]  you can choose not to believe them but i'll guarantee you this if you watch the show you're
[1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:45.080]  going to get scared oh i'm even if even if they're not true there is still the element that they may
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:52.680]  be they might be and they could be and maybe they are and that should be enough to wake people up
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:58.280]  and scare them this this is the first show that i've ever done in my career where i got scared
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:05.800]  and i don't get scared easy i remember a few weeks ago i ran into we were checking in at the hotel
[1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:09.800]  and you walked up and you were shaking your head and you said alex you were there with your son
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:14.920]  tyrell who's working on the show as well doing a great job you walked up and you said alex when
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:20.280]  i go to bed at night my head's spinning with all this information this stuff is scary oh yeah no
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:27.240]  i we went into some places that uh you know you think there's only fantasy land but uh it could
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:33.640]  very well be reality land and uh it's stuff that people don't even think about don't deal with
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:38.120]  in their daily lives you know that's one of the main things is people people out there have to
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:42.840]  earn a living they have to make a living for their family so they haven't got time to go delving into
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:48.920]  the underhanded stuff that government might be doing and it's interesting alex that we started
[1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:53.880]  this show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the conspiracy and then a
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:58.440]  while the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one he or she would choose to believe hold

[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:42.360]  up okay you got cut off again by the satellite i'm making this go to break start over start over
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:48.840]  governor with the point that you were making about uh the tv show well initially alex we started off
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:54.200]  to do the show with the concept that both sides of the of the conspiracy would be told if there
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:25:00.440]  were two sides many times there may be multiple sides but the two major sides and then we'd let
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:05.400]  the viewer decide well then the show had to go through a metamorphosis if you will or an evolution
[1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:11.880]  whatever you want to call it because when one side does not cooperate with one bit it is pretty
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:17.880]  hard to tell their story and that was the case of the united states government i i did an interview
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:24.040]  the other day uh a print interview and and the person asked me and i said well you know the
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:29.400]  government hasn't cooperated at all and they said this includes when obama's taken over i said there's
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:34.760]  been no difference i said it hasn't made one bit of difference because we started the show george
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:39.320]  bush was still the president and the show's been in the works and i've been working on it for a
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:48.280]  year now basically or better and uh and the government cooperated nothing zero silk we could
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:54.040]  not even get a spokesperson out for the government well we do get a few former government people who
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:59.080]  are now no longer working for the government who had courage enough to come out and talk to us and
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.480]  offer their opinions but no one under the government would cooperate with the show at all so then the
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:12.280]  show became simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told and now the viewer gets to
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.480]  see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many occasions on the different
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:22.120]  conspiracies that they're involved with and by the way we've got governor jesse ventura's with us
[1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:27.960]  talking about the new tv show that's coming up in december and january called conspiracy theory
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:34.440]  on true tv again jesse ventura is our guest how much can you tell us about the 911 episode because
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:41.160]  i know that more and more as you went out and tried to talk to them no one would and jesse ventura
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:48.040]  navy seal governor you know fighter is a lot more intimidating and a lot more effective
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:53.880]  than when michael more and i'm not against michael more kind of ninnies around uh i mean this is some
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:27:00.360]  dynamic confrontations uh in many ways michael more probably got more cooperation than i got
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:09.320]  but let's focus in a little bit none i got none when it came to 911 no one from the government
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:15.880]  would talk to the show no one from the 911 commission would talk no one representing any
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:22.040]  type of government agency would talk uh you know i don't want to rep the show by saying what we did
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:28.120]  and where we did it and do all that because i want people to watch the show uh the show came
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:37.000]  about like this a victim came to me and a victim pleaded with me the a victim who lost her daughter
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:44.440]  and her potential grandchild her her daughter was pregnant and she died the day the infamous day of
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:52.520]  911 and her mom you know came to me feeling that i was the person with this show who could bring
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:59.880]  to light the fact that we need a real investigation of 911 and not the one that they did and so it's
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:05.320]  a natural progression then when when when it's brought to me the next person i want to talk to
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:11.800]  is someone who is there someone who actually went through 911 which we were able to do also in the
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:18.040]  show and then from there the progression goes to someone who is there during the cleanup the
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:23.320]  you know the almost 300 days that it took to clean up the mess and what went on there did an
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:29.880]  investigation to crew there we have the person who identified and saw the black boxes which of
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:35.880]  course the government tells us we're not found unbelievable again i don't want to give away
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:40.760]  too much but i want people to watch that's why i'm just going to talk i'm not going to give
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:46.840]  specifics of the show alex because i want everyone to enjoy the show and i shouldn't i and i won't
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:51.720]  narrate it before it goes on the air no no no that's but i mean you're giving us a lot here
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.760]  and i know a lot of the inside baseball and obviously i'm sworn to secrecy i'm just telling folks
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:02.120]  i'm surprised you're able to get this on air jesse because alex it ain't on yet
[1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:11.080]  i've got i've i made a gentleman's bed at the start of this show that it would never see
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:17.160]  air i see i thought we would complete them all but i felt strongly that at some point in time
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:23.880]  someone wouldn't allow it and so far it's full steam ahead now we do have to wait till december
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:29.880]  second because that's the airing again of the first show which is you know that's a couple weeks
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:36.440]  away yet three weeks away in fact i remember in october you were in my car we were driving around

[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:33.560]  joins us the surf is up he is here okay let's go through this then uh there's a house to surf
[1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:39.640]  since that storm has hit alabama down there you know what i hear that there is a huge surf
[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:44.120]  down at the gulf right now and every time i go down there there's surfers everywhere i was down
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:50.760]  i was down there right now dog got it why don't you just jump on an airplane fly listen you can
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:57.160]  fly to corpus christi in two hours from minnesota and three and a half four hours from now you
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:34:02.680]  could be on the beach in 12 foot swells well i'll tell you that's very tempting but unfortunately
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:08.280]  i got too much publicity to do unfortunately you're here on air with us but we're all happy
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:13.240]  governor well it'd be tomorrow anyway and so i got publicity all day tomorrow today you couldn't
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:17.720]  i couldn't get there in time so it'd have to be tomorrow but oh well we'll pass on it this time
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:23.400]  i'm certain there'll be more storms especially after learning about harp absolutely uh you
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:28.040]  know i have the director of harp on one time and and he admitted oh we we turned the atmosphere on
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:33.800]  fire with it at night and starts laughing and then somebody on the line cut the line off
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:38.440]  and my producer saw this and during the break a uh air force officer came on and said you
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:45.480]  can't talk about that anymore so the military was bossing the uh the uh civilian scientific head
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:50.280]  of harp around well what's interesting and of course for those that don't know what harp is harp
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:56.680]  is way up in alaska and that's one of the shows we go up to visit and photograph it and it's a
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:03.960]  group of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50 000 watts of energy up into the biosphere i
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:11.000]  should say of low radio low frequency sounds up into the biosphere which does cause a heating
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:19.320]  by alex let me ask you this does could that possibly contribute to global warming absolutely in
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:24.680]  fact the scientists we've interviewed this could be much more contributor of global warming than
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:31.560]  us driving our cars around well as you know secretary of defense cohen in 97 admitted to
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:36.120]  the army times they did have weather weapons then and i've interviewed the former father of
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:41.800]  weather weapons been livingston and clearly i believe this is a false flag attack we have
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:46.520]  had a lot of strange weather and that naturally occurs but there's been a lot of that's that's
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:52.280]  going to be that's the opening show alex the opening show december 2nd is on harp and i think
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:59.400]  people are going to find it a very interesting show uh i went all the way up to alaska and went
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:05.960]  to this location and we jumped into a helicopter and bear this in mind this thing can knock airplanes
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:15.640]  out of the air and uh it's a very interesting thing going on up there it's the government
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:22.040]  it falls under let me put it this way it falls under the military the air force and yet it
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:29.960]  is given the distinction of being an unclassified research center yet i was not allowed in now bear
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:34.760]  in mind i used to have a top secret security clearance with the united states government
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:42.040]  during my six years as a member of underwater demolition team 12 and seal team one i was also
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:49.880]  a mayor and a governor and yet i was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified research
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:57.960]  center if it's unclassified anybody should be able to go in there well that's a good point
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:04.120]  jesse on this specific subject we can get into more detail because this has been released to the
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:08.440]  media i want to play this clip and then ask you about it this is a one-minute clip of governor
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:14.440]  jesse ventura being stopped at the gates he's about to just i guess bull is way on in there
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:23.320]  and uh suddenly the equipment goes dead and i talked to the crew this really happened so they
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:29.240]  were using some type of electronic warfare jamming system here it is ladies and gentlemen really need
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:36.120]  to go through the air force well we did we got stonewall and this is strictly a research facility
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.920]  clearly there's something going on here that they don't want people to know about there's a lot of
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:47.320]  cool science that we do with this come on man i'm a navy seal the military don't do things unless it
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:53.320]  has a military purpose and a military purpose is destruction and wage and war it's a stalemate
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:59.720]  or is it back up a little bit from the days when people come through they don't feel intimidated
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:05.480]  when i get denied something i do the opposite of getting intimidated i get angry jesse is about
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:15.720]  to walk right on through when suddenly the camera equipment begins to go haywire
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:25.000]  something is interfering with the audio and video this is more than unclassified that's bullshit
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:32.280]  all right now that was that aired on cnn we the potty language was cut out
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:38.520]  uh but but but i don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress so tell us what you can
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:45.160]  about the harp episode because this is amazing well you know we were not we were denied access as
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:50.440]  i said and you know even though the security clearances i've had in my life and holding the
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:55.720]  position of governor i guess alex the only way i guess i can get in there is to run and get reelected
[1:38:55.720 --> 1:39:00.520]  to something again you know then maybe i would be high enough in the government that they would
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:07.000]  let me in and see what they're doing there but that aside uh and then we did have some problem now
[1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:13.640]  it made it seem i don't know what caused our cameras to go bad i do i am not going to specifically
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:20.120]  sit here and say that they jammed them that they did something to them i will simply state that our
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:26.600]  audio and our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate who or what was
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:33.960]  responsible we never were sure uh we never were sure or positively found out but to be specific
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:37.480]  and correct me if i'm wrong because i was just talking to some of the crew while we were shooting
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:43.880]  separately back in los angeles they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:51.320]  recordings it was even distorting i mean this wasn't just one one rig to have separate malfunctions
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:56.760]  the same malfunctions you're talking about one in a billion one in a trillion i mean this is
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:04.120]  bizarre i don't know i don't know but all i can say is that we did run into complications and what
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:10.840]  caused them or why we were never able to ascertain but you know and then when we were and then later
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:16.520]  on all the equipment later we're fine and we never had any more problem with it the rest of the shoot
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:24.200]  well i want to say clearly on the record that from the scientists we've interviewed harp is
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:32.600]  designed to be a weapon it can heat the atmosphere it can direct those huge rivers of vapor of
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:39.160]  condensation of water as weapons and the chinese brag the russians brag you can hire their government
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:45.560]  funded companies to control the weather for you this is let's remember something to alex there
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:51.480]  were treaties signed back in the 1970s that governments would not use weapon or would not use
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:58.040]  weather or nature for war and we were one of the people that signed these treaties
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.760]  and i think that's an important issue right here if we sign treaties that we won't use things
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:11.960]  we won't use nature to commit war and and then we might very well be violating the very treaties
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:18.040]  we've signed well that's a great point and you made the point to me privately that well alex
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:26.440]  why are we signing treaties for weather weapons if they don't exist that's true also so you know
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:32.280]  and and i think people are also going to enjoy there's another part of harp that we haven't
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:37.480]  mentioned today that will be the most terrifying of anything we've talked about and i'm going to
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:43.320]  leave that up in the air because harp is going to be to my knowledge the first episode december
[1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:49.560]  second again our shamelessly promoted ten o'clock eastern nine o'clock central on the true channel
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.240]  harp will be the first episode to my knowledge if they change it then i don't know about it
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:42:01.160]  and there's something in harp beyond what we've even talked about alex that is more terrifying
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:07.080]  than what we have talked about and i know what it is but i'm gonna keep my mouth shut it this
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:11.320]  is coming up you know finishing up before we get into the other episodes during the break we were
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:16.840]  talking you you're saying you made the bet with your crew and i remember you telling me privately
[1:42:16.840 --> 1:42:22.680]  in the car you said we'll see if it's gonna air i don't think it will but but we'll see i'm gonna
[1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:29.560]  try well i i did a gentleman's bet with my crew and past basically i said to i i bet you no
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:35.320]  money involved just a gentleman's bet that we will complete all of these we will do all seven
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:42.040]  episodes uh and and we'll finish them all but i said i still don't believe they will see the
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:47.640]  light of day that they will be aired and so far i'm losing the gentleman's bet but there's still
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:54.520]  about three weeks to go and i hope that i do lose it i do not want and i'm i'm a competitive person
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:01.160]  i do not like to lose anything but i'm hoping that i lose this bet i don't want to win this bet
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:08.200]  well i hope that uh you do lose the bet as well because i've been involved in a few tv productions
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.920]  one of them this way alex if it doesn't see the light of day this show that we've completed
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:21.960]  then i need then i need to come back on your show and we need to ask why we need to at that
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:28.920]  point start addressing i believe the first amendment i agree with you well i i don't see
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:33.560]  how they're going to air something that's more than fair from our perspective and from one i've
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:39.960]  seen and i know you're an honorable person this is a extremely fair leaning towards our perspective
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:45.720]  because as you said you couldn't get the other side to come out and debate there's nothing but
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:51.640]  stonewalling it isn't even a debate alex we couldn't even get them to come out and make a comment the
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:57.800]  government wouldn't talk to us plain and simple they wouldn't talk on harp they wouldn't talk on
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:04.600]  9 11 they wouldn't talk on anything that involves the government and and their involvement in any
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:11.560]  type of conspiracy or whatever the conspiracy is you cannot get anyone from government to participate
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:17.480]  or talk in any manner it's that simple and people need to understand that's the scary thing
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:23.640]  overwhelmingly scary thing about doing this whole show is the fact that government doesn't
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:30.200]  have to to have to cooperate they act like we work for them and i believe they've forgotten
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:36.120]  something and we've forgotten something they work for us that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:41.560]  but in this country i believe those roles have switched now and the government views us working
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:47.880]  for them rather than the way it's supposed to be well that's just an incredible point
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:55.640]  that things really are backwards now in this nation in this country and if they do allow this
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:00.840]  to go on television which it looks like it's going to happen is that the system is so arrogant
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:07.320]  that they don't even care if we know the truth now i'm seeing george soros and al gore and bancai
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:13.000]  moon of the un openly say we're going under world government openly saying it's a new world order
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:19.400]  openly stating it's about population reduction one child policy la times reports there's going
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:23.800]  to be a tax on owning a dog or cat because they eat meat which has a carbon footprint
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:28.440]  you've got the global warming episode we're going to talk about that i mean they're really
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:33.400]  coming out in the open so is it that they don't have total control of the media and this and so
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:38.680]  you're getting through the chink in the armor or is it they're so arrogant now they don't care if
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:43.080]  governor ventura goes out and tells you how screwed you are they might even sit back and
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.520]  you know roast some march mellows and laugh at us i don't know alex i i'm not in contact with
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:55.080]  that he has these quote unquote people so i have no idea oh by the way your global warming is the
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:46:01.400]  last one that that i list to you of the uh we do a is global warming a conspiracy that we were
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:05.560]  both here trying to remember all seven episodes and finally it came to me so i thought i'd shout
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:11.320]  it out well you got it right there because that was the seventh one that i like i said when i shot
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:17.400]  these things they were not in sequence always and so it can get pretty confusing it was a lot
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:22.680]  like governing where you go from one meeting one hour to a completely different meeting the next
[1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:27.560]  dollar no no i know it makes your head spin especially when you're really into the minutia
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:32.600]  let's get into 2012 then we'll get into secret societies manchurian candidate big brother
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:41.720]  in global warming 2012 obviously uh three days from now on friday the huge uh movie is coming out
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:47.400]  where woody heraldson kind of plays the conspiracy theory type i'm i know heraldson so we're trying
[1:46:47.400 --> 1:46:53.000]  to get him on the show in fact that may happen but what's your whole take on the real 2012
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:58.600]  and the serious in-depth research you did and then separately in the show i know you get into
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:04.280]  two without saying too much whether it's real or not the elite think it's real and they are
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:08.680]  getting ready i mean to me i think that in fact i wish i was in that episode i've been told i'm
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:14.840]  not to me that's going to be one of the hottest episodes well it is and and uh let me just put
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:20.840]  it this way and again i'm not going to go in and and make it so people won't watch by telling
[1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:28.520]  everything that happens but uh it goes far beyond let me say this the bayan calendar now the bayans
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:35.000]  were very intelligent people way ahead of their time when it came to understanding the planets and
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:41.320]  the solar system in the heavens they truly were because i've learned this even with all of our
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:48.440]  modern technology today the mayans are right on our technology for the most part cannot prove them
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:56.920]  wrong under most things so here you had a a culture that took place many many many years ago
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:05.960]  that was very very bright when it came to space and this 2012 show goes beyond the mayan calendar
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:13.320]  it goes to some things that we know are actually real and completely backed up by nasa and that's
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.200]  where i'll leave it right there because i want people intrigued i want them to watch the show
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:25.080]  and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives are you knowing what you now know doing the deep
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:32.440]  research are you concerned about 2012 uh i'm concerned yeah i'm concerned over over the
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:38.440]  things that i have learned yes i'm very concerned over them and i'll end when later on when the
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:44.680]  show is all air alex will end and i don't have to try to intrigue a listening audience anymore
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:51.160]  i'll be glad to come back on the show and openly talk about what concerns me after it airs absolutely
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:54.920]  that'd be a great radio interview and also talk about how much hit the cutting room floor
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:58.200]  you guys have done a ton of work i mean they've been working your butt off
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:03.560]  oh we can we can yeah i've been uh uh here here i'm trying to you know how it works in the country
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:11.160]  alex when you try to retire and quit that's when your agent finds your jobs but when you're looking
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:16.920]  for the jobs for 20 years they can't find you anything no i've been to uh i've been to LA so
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.600]  many times i can't remember since summer i've been to anchorage Alaska i've been to san francisco
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:29.640]  i've been to oklahoma city kansas city uh new york multiple multiple times and i've i've lost
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:34.680]  track of few a few of the other places that i've been to but uh the most unique was the
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:41.720]  thing going up to anchorage to learn about harp absolutely and again i'm a huggy bear let me
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:48.120]  interject alex of which i up until about four months ago i didn't even know what harp was
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:54.360]  didn't even know what it was this has been quite a journey for you i know your son began to really
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:50:00.040]  get you into this five six years ago and obviously i gave you some films and and that helped you along
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:04.600]  your journey and then you described it to me at the hotel that now it's like the top of your
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:10.200]  heads blown off the whole world's opening up and it's quite a journey isn't it governor well it
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:15.480]  sure is and and the exciting thing that i'll tell people when people say to me why do i like to
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:21.080]  study this why do i like to look at it that because these are things that very well can be real
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:28.680]  and when you read a writer like st tom clancy events blend they're marvelous books but they're
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:34.360]  simply figments of their imagination they're carrying food carrying you through on their
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:41.800]  imaginary trip i would rather look into and read about real history and hopefully get educated on
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:46.840]  it so that we don't that we're not stupid enough to allow ourselves to repeat it which
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:52.600]  over and over i see it happening we were our stupidity is just unbelievable how we can be
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:57.960]  duped over and over again absolutely i mean really a conspiracy theorist is someone with
[1:50:57.960 --> 1:51:02.840]  an alternative history view we'll be right back so this is alex jones and i want to tell you about

[1:54:29.480 --> 1:54:34.600]  time for people tuning in getting this exclusive first look at the tv show that believe me is
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:39.880]  going to be powerful folks tell them when the seven episodes are going to air how they tune in
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:46.440]  and how they watch it well it'll be on the true network which used to be court television it's
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:53.960]  located if you got the satellite i think it's right in between tbs and tnt it's the station
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:58.680]  in between if you're on the if you're on the direct dish satellite or whatever it is but you
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:04.600]  know check the way ever in any way the first show will air wednesday december 2nd and it'll be
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:11.240]  10 o'clock eastern nine o'clock central and it's a one-hour show we're doing seven conspiracies
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:17.480]  and naturally i'd like to say this can we get completely into the conspiracies and everything
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:23.640]  about them absolutely not you can never do that in an hour so we focus on just certain portions
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:30.040]  of the conspiracy which i think people will find it especially your your listening audience alex
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:35.240]  are going to find it very interesting and so it's going to be airing every every wednesday
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:40.280]  in december and january or are they going to skip one on christmas i have no idea
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.160]  they say christmas i'll be gone surfing at that time and i'll leave all of you up here to take
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:52.040]  the repercussions from it what are you going to do if i come parachuting in when you're out there
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:57.240]  surfing well and i'll know everything hit the fan up here because i know that if you're not doing
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:04.040]  your daily radio show then the united states don't exist anymore now is my bunker ready next to your
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:13.400]  bungalow i don't know you know i'll tell you that bahad my my neighbor fernando he had to take a
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:17.880]  40 foot well down there and it took him six months but it would have taken him a year had
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:24.840]  there been good waves absolutely absolutely okay we're going to come back and take phone calls
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:29.640]  but right now let's get into the global warming episode okay i mean just give us a little taste
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:36.040]  of that well the big thing on global warming to me is this cap and trade legislation uh it's nothing
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:42.600]  but bait and switch it it's a legislation that's designed to make money not solve the problem
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:49.720]  and if if global warming is indeed a problem then why is the solution simply money making
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:55.160]  that that does nothing to address the actual problem and that's the key of what we try to
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:57:01.240]  expose and this is the cap and trade legislation for what it is and the fact that there are 30
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:07.400]  thousand people with phd's and science degrees that simply are not buying in the global warming
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:13.640]  and it doesn't seem to be that they get any type of uh their opinion is not being aired at all
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:19.640]  well that's right very one-sided opinion well yeah when algor says all scientists agree it's
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:25.720]  man-made and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven by the sun and by
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:30.360]  nuclei from space causing cloud condensation i mean i'm not going to give away who you interview
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:36.920]  in the film but this is going to be a powerful death blow uh one more nail in the coffin against
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:41.720]  the uh greenies that want to taxes i mean it's come out that algor is made over a billion bucks
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:47.800]  so far off this i mean he owns a cap and trade company that you've got to buy carbon credits
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:53.560]  from i mean how obvious is this well again it comes down to the legislate whether i'm not i'm
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:58.520]  not a scientist alex so i'm not going to beat my head against the wall on whether it's real or not
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:05.240]  but a good way to look at things is always view something not from what someone says but from
[1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:12.440]  what someone does and the cap and trade legislation is fraudulent because you could have a company
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.600]  that's that's supposedly polluting they don't have to change at all they can simply pay money
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:25.400]  and buy other people's and trade so that till they get under and they'll still pollute the same
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:30.760]  but then they'll be able to say that they're not well that right away is fraudulent and if that's

[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:25.160]  jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones all right in this five
[2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:32.120]  minutes we're going to get into secret societies manchurian candidate and big brother the three
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:42.600]  episodes we haven't given you a little teaser on it premieres december second true tv tell everybody
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:46.280]  about it folks because i think this is going to be the not just ferris but leaning towards our
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:50.760]  view of any television show ever on mainstream tv i think this is a bellwether because the
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:57.160]  establishment's beginning to realize that they become obsolete by never discussing this information
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:04.200]  so television's losing ratings and the internet's exploding governor jesse ventura uh getting into
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:08.280]  manchurian candidate secret societies big brother what do you want to talk about first
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:15.560]  well i guess let's go manchurian candidate uh uh that this one's going to be a very this one is
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:23.560]  a very terrifying show uh we all know that mk ultra was real the document states so so there's no
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:31.640]  gray area there that the government was in the business back in the 50s 60s and 70s of attempting
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:37.320]  to control people's minds and then and attempting to manipulate them and to use them to their
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:43.400]  advantage both militarily and whatever well all indications are that those programs have been
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:49.880]  re-ramped up again and they're back on a high level again and uh that being said that's what the
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:55.640]  manchurian candidate deals with of course and that we've all heard the story uh one of the
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:01.960]  interesting things i'll say is the the guy who shot john lennon fits it perfectly mark david
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:09.880]  Chapman because contrary to popular belief Chapman was no Beatles fanatic if you go back
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:16.680]  in his history in fact his favorite artist was Todd Rungren who's hardly a beetle and uh when
[2:02:16.680 --> 2:02:23.320]  he shot lennon he he had three ways to escape immediately central park down into the subways
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:29.160]  and then just get lost with everybody instead he stepped back in the shadows and started reading
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:34.600]  the book to catch her in the ride which is a classic mind control when they torture them
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:39.240]  under the drugs and in one of the systems they then become obsessed with the trigger word when
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:43.800]  McVeigh got pulled over he said get the chip out of me and was foaming at the mouth and then the
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:49.880]  most famous mind control scientist ever jolly and west was his doctor with him every day until the
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:56.200]  day he was executed and i'll tell you this governor studying the fordhood shooting i can't say it was
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:02.760]  a mind control but it has every earmark he's a psychiatrist the FBI and CIA were funny you
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:09.160]  should say that alex because amazingly when i when it first happened scarily that's the first thing
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:15.160]  that popped into my head unbelievable that you say that because that's the exact first thing
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:21.640]  that popped into my head when i when i first heard about the fordhood shootings and when i started
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:28.760]  been reading about the whole situation how the guy never had it in his background and then now the
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:34.120]  CIA and FBI are watching him and he has this fake history that suddenly began and then commanders
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:39.400]  and people said bust him and they wouldn't do it same thing with 9 11 then he's a psychiatrist he
[2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:46.280]  has that whole history and once you've studied mind control he just fits every piece fits and i
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:51.240]  wouldn't say this last week i mean i knew that was going on thursday but now more and more
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:54.760]  of the pieces are coming out and man the hair on the back of my neck just stands up
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:01.080]  anyway enough manchurian one of the last two shows okay we gotta go to break we're gonna come back
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:09.800]  and briefly get into uh into secret societies uh and big brother watching big brother so we'll

[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:16.360]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:28.520]  governor jesse ventura he has worn a lot of hats but now he is fighting the new world order
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:32.040]  and i don't want to put words in his mouth but the governor i think it's safe to say i mean you
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:37.320]  now know there's a world government there is an elite the question is how evil are they are they
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:43.560]  monolithic what is their main goal i mean is it's fair to say that you're now officially not their
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:49.240]  label of conspiracy theorists but i mean you question jfk you question 9-11 you question harp
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:55.160]  you're not buying the koolaid they're selling is that fair to say well let me put it this way
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:02.600]  uh... irregardless of anything it sure is interesting stuff and uh... you know we we do what we do
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:08.040]  a show on the bill de bergs and i i do understand that they're real i guess the thing that upsets
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:16.280]  me the most was i made it to governor and they never invited me and i would and i i guess maybe
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.480]  i gotta run for office again then so i get invited to this thing to find out what the hell goes on
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:26.440]  inside there well they would have invited you if you would have gone along with the cia when they
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:31.400]  set you down at the governor's office two weeks into office but i mean you're not selling people
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:37.800]  out you're a swashbuckling you know loose cannon for freedom uh... but uh... well i mean what is
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:41.720]  your view on the new world order then because i know your anti-establishment and let me put it
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:47.320]  to this way then i also look at it from a different perspective our alex i believe in evolution
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:52.600]  the science of evolution and maybe this is evolution
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:59.560]  you know when you look at it that we will evolve and that maybe it won't fully be here in our
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:06.440]  lifetimes but a hundred years from now because of the fact with technology the way it is the world
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:14.280]  gets smaller and smaller and smaller and i guess let me just for the sake of argument state that
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:18.760]  there would be one good thing if there was a one-world government you know what that would be
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:26.520]  there could be there couldn't be wars then could there but see governor that is i mean i mean
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:31.640]  literally if if it then you wouldn't have one country fighting another country no but that's
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:37.720]  not their plan oh i understand that alex don't don't for a minute think i'm naive but i am saying
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:43.560]  that there is the chance that this could be almost an evolutionary thing that we will evolve to the
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:51.320]  point where there may well be a one-world government and there may be no way around it well jesse then
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:57.320]  the important thing alex is what will that government be well that's the issue here is that they
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:03.000]  always pitch it that we were hunter-gatherers we were agrarian we formed villages then city
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:08.440]  states the nations that empires and the next phase is star trek that we've been implanted with
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:13.480]  psychologically the image of the global galactic empire we're always fighting green aliens
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:18.680]  you know the cling on so we've got to do this the issue is they built this world government
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:26.520]  in stealth and denied that it existed until it was too late to really stop it and now they're
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:30.280]  coming out going yeah we're going to tax everything you do we're not going to let you have more than
[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:35.480]  one kid and yeah we want to carry out eugenics on you and we're going to carbon tax you and
[2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:40.600]  mankind moon writes editorials saying the carbon taxes for the new world order and it's for a bunch
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:47.720]  of corrupt ceo's and bankers to play emperor and so if the people of the world ever wanted to create
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:52.840]  a world government and it was democratic and under the republic system then that would be one thing
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:59.160]  but but but this thing was created by a corrupt group of criminals and it's a world tyranny that's
[2:11:59.160 --> 2:12:07.240]  why every ounce of my body and being just like thomas jefferson said i i swear eternal resistance
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:13.800]  to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men and and jessie i know you i mean don't you swear
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:18.600]  alex i wholeheartedly agree with you i'm not going to dispute anything you've said
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:26.520]  i won't but the point is and you're correct if it was so good why would they do it in secret
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:33.000]  and that's a very very valid point to make uh but the point we have to make if it's inevitable
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.360]  that we're going to come under one world rule then we the people have to ensure that we're we
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:44.200]  have uh that we're players in the game that we have dogs in the fight but i don't want to be
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:49.720]  under the communist chinese alex is making sure we got a dog in the fight no no i hear you i but
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.680]  but instead so we never have a dog in the fight they just say there isn't a world government
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:59.640]  meet your world government i mean they're still saying world government doesn't exist so that we
[2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:04.600]  could never demand representation interesting was i was out at that new denver airport
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:11.480]  right the new one in denver yes and on and on the plaque that that that they have out there
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:17.800]  on the bottom of it says the new world airport commission and there isn't one
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:25.560]  nothing nothing of that name is in existence and there's murals of nazis put that on the
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:31.880]  dedication plaque at the depth at big denver airport the new world not the colorado airport
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:38.680]  commission not the denver airport commission but the new world airport commission and they have
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:47.560]  paintings of nazis killing children above it they're not nazis i disprove that well there's people
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:54.040]  in fascist style uniforms melting people are not nazis you know how i disprove that alex how the
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:59.960]  guys carrying an ak-47 i saw it right away i said this can't be a nazi the nazis didn't have that
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:05.080]  weapon yeah but i don't think the artist knows that the collision cough is it is an eastern block
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:13.400]  weapon hey jesse i want to take some calls in time and let's take some calls but but a plug right
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:17.800]  here in the middle of this conversation i'm gonna mail you i've forgotten to mail you fall of the
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:23.560]  republic because this details from the globalist own statements that they are setting up a tyrannical
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:29.080]  world government that they engineered the banking christ by the crisis by design and that they are
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:33.880]  setting up a citizen spy force police state system so i hope all the listeners will get a copy of
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:38.920]  fall of the republic at info wars dot com in the online video bookstore and support what we're doing
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:45.000]  here but also show it to everyone you know because this film exposes the wider agenda and alex let
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:51.320]  me shamelessly add in please watch my television show because if we get such an overwhelming
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:57.320]  audience response it'll force them to buy it up for another deal and uh we'll be able to get that
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:03.240]  much farther into it then and then like the x files i get the spin off like the lone gunman
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:09.640]  there you go okay now we're getting into real inside baseball look this show is important and i
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:14.760]  want everybody to tell their friends and family and neighbors true tv december 2nd airing every
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:21.160]  wednesday absolutely important because this this show is definitely from our perspective okay i

[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:49.560]  where the government is a i'll just put this the government is able to do it and work around
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:55.560]  the constitution we have found that out and we will air that on the show to where you will
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:16:01.960]  clearly see how the government has looped the constitution in which establishing big brother
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:09.960]  on you can we say the different federal groups you talked to or just leave that alone i don't
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:14.600]  think i talked to any federal groups again there was no cooperation from the government well you
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:19.480]  talked to their minions though you talked to their gestapo their their their their ground pounders their
[2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:25.720]  citizen spies well yes we did do that we'll just leave it there we'll just leave it there yeah just
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:32.440]  leave it at that well it's a very exciting right down in your country alex i don't want to get in
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:45.960]  trouble believe me we know what infregard is up to ok folks governor jesse ventura is our guest best
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:55.240]  selling author wrestler movie star governor football national football league nfl commentator
[2:16:55.240 --> 2:17:03.080]  surfer jesse what is there you haven't done uh i don't know but i got a few years to figure it out
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:09.160]  yet alex i uh you know you never stopped going because uh you know in the words of the late great
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:14.920]  warren's avon i'll sleep when i'm dead program note the stations this is a network break coming up
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:19.240]  we're going to the end of the uh we're going right to the bottom of the hour 29 after we're
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:23.880]  going to let the governor go here so we're going to take calls right now for the last 12 minutes
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:29.720]  or so with governor jesse ventura giving you the inside scoop jesse why did you give this show first
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:32.920]  the inside scoop i was very honored when you called me and said you were going to give us the
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:38.440]  exclusive one well for a number of reasons alex your participation in the show was exceptional
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:44.680]  and we appreciated it and uh you know you flew out to la a couple times and all that to participate
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:51.960]  and uh so why not i reward the people that reward me and uh and so that that's a reason for it plus
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:58.440]  you have the listening audience the base market that this show is designed for i would be crazy
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:18:04.760]  not to come on your show with my show because you know i'm not going to lie we're out for success
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:10.120]  on this show i hope this show is hugely successful yeah but but i know the tv shows you turn down
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:13.080]  i mean i don't i don't know if you want to say it but you're you're turning down something with
[2:18:13.080 --> 2:18:17.560]  30 million viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the country i i'm just really
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:21.640]  honored you can because i know you're turning down a bunch of really huge media interviews
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:26.760]  but but doing our shows we appreciate it well no problem and like i said that you know uh
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:33.320]  uh you're you're a wealth of information alex that we can always rely upon and uh you know
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:38.440]  so doing your show is just simply the left hand washing the right hand well folks we're going
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:43.160]  to post this interview up at info wars dot com over 200 000 people a day get the free podcast
[2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:47.160]  get it share it with everybody we're going to post a youtube video of it share it with everyone
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:52.120]  because if this show could be a big success the system may start letting more of this on the air
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:58.120]  as the internet culture takes over the mainstream media we can beat the globalist if they can't
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:03.160]  beat us they're going to try to join us and we could slow down this whole system that's what
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.960]  tweety bird always said if you can't beat them join them well well well if we can beat them
[2:19:07.960 --> 2:19:13.000]  they're gonna have to back off and believing we can expose these people is half the battle believing
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.960]  you can win or as joe says knowing is half the battle i believe taking action is half the battle
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:22.040]  resistance is victory matt in illinois you're on the air with jessie ventura go ahead matt
[2:19:22.840 --> 2:19:30.280]  well mr ventura i don't know how you're doing oh pretty good um i wanted to know i don't have a tv
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:36.120]  i i gave up watching tv a long long time ago because i didn't like being treated like i was stupid
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:42.040]  and it sounds like you've got a really good show and i'd like to know if there's any plans to put
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:48.840]  it on the web or or somehow that i'll be able to watch it i don't know at this time but then again
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:54.440]  i'm not a good web person to talk to but i certainly will inquire to find out what the options are
[2:19:54.440 --> 2:19:59.800]  about doing it over the web or whatever i don't know but at this time i the only thing i know is
[2:19:59.800 --> 2:20:04.680]  we're going to be on two tv starting december 2nd yeah matt thanks for the call i'll tell you this
[2:20:05.240 --> 2:20:10.760]  time warner is putting a lot of their stuff on youtube now most tv shows are there after the
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:16.680]  series runs then it's up there with commercials on youtube uh i would imagine this is made for the
[2:20:16.680 --> 2:20:20.600]  internet i would imagine you're going to be able to see it officially on the internet after it
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:25.400]  airs on tv go to a neighbor's house and watch it uh let's you know the mind control box but we're
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:29.960]  going to use the mind control box to deprogram people marianne in iowa you're on the air with
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:35.160]  governor jessie ventura go ahead hi it's a pleasure um i i just want to say i hope this
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:40.840]  wakes up the american people and uh i i praise you for doing that um i wanted to make a answer a
[2:20:40.840 --> 2:20:46.920]  quick question i'm going to make a quick comment uh representative mike penns from uh uh indiana
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:53.240]  republican the other day i was watching the health voting on c span and he said and i wrote it down
[2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:59.960]  because i i was freaked out by it he said it seems a few elite in a far distant country can run our
[2:20:59.960 --> 2:21:05.480]  lives for us and i know immediately i thought of bill de berger not that and i was going to ask
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:10.280]  you which i think you've already answered were you going to do a show on the bill de berger's
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:14.680]  and the secret societies you didn't answer that hold on you mean senator de ment admitted that
[2:21:14.680 --> 2:21:20.440]  that foreign bankers run our country i mean that's amazing his quote and i wrote it down
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:26.200]  it seems a few elite in a far distance country can run our lives for us okay let's get jessie's
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:31.800]  take on that well it there's certainly that possibility and yes we definitely do a show
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:37.560]  on the bill de berger's which i was happily kind of i knew of them but i didn't know as much about
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:46.840]  them and here's the interesting little sidebar for it we had a governor are you still there
[2:21:48.760 --> 2:21:53.240]  see that i know that sound that's us that wasn't ron paul the other day
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:57.560]  okay that's our phone system i want that on record
[2:21:59.240 --> 2:22:01.880]  tell you it's it's like living in a clown house or something um
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:06.600]  just calling back and letting finish his point
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:14.680]  it's it's always when i got huge guest on to ron paul jessie ventura and and
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:20.120]  the standard operating procedure hell i can call him on my cell phone get him on that way
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:30.840]  um we've got general stubble bind coming up with dr rima labo part two of the interview we started
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:34.520]  last week
[2:22:39.880 --> 2:22:43.000]  and i do have a lot of other news that we're going to be covering as well
[2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:46.520]  but hey it's the miracle of technology ladies and gentlemen we're
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:52.440]  we're 50 years ago 60 70 80 years ago you couldn't even do stuff like this
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:04.760]  and um it's kind of the hallmark of this show now that that's what we do it's how we do it
[2:23:05.640 --> 2:23:09.640]  okay governor got you cut off there when you were going to add a point about bill de berger go
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:13.960]  ahead it was it was either that alex or they're cutting us off now they're on to us
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:20.840]  yes you know no what i what i was going to add was that just a simple side light to the show
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:27.320]  and then i got to run is that uh we were interviewing a gentleman on the bill de berger
[2:23:27.320 --> 2:23:33.800]  episode and and uh he had to travel from europe to do the interview with me in in new york and
[2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:40.200]  we had to delay it a day because when he went to the airport he was on the no fly list now
[2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:46.280]  he this this person is not a terrorist why would he be on the no fly list and who has the power to
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:53.960]  do that well that happens to even congressmen now they get crosswise in and you're not you're not
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:59.640]  charged there's no judge there's no jury and now they're saying if you have bad credit you'll be
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:04.280]  on the no fly list or if you're on the no fly list you won't be able to buy a gun so you're not
[2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:09.000]  convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket governor but then you lose your rights
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:14.680]  isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic form of government i i would like to
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:20.040]  think so and and you know and as i said earlier alex it's a it's just the case of uh you know the
[2:24:20.040 --> 2:24:24.680]  big brother and in this case it was dealing with the bill de bergs that we have this particular
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:30.040]  guy we were going to interview and he was coming from a foreign country to here and he was on the
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:36.920]  no fly list over there and to my knowledge he's not a terrorist so you know it's interesting
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:41.720]  that how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting them on this no fly list if you simply
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:47.720]  out of a say a different political persuasion or whatever it might be well governor you've
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.760]  got to get to a meeting in downtown minneapolis so we've only got four more minutes left with you
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.480]  let's take two final calls quickly gary in washington than mark in minnesota gary are on
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:03.240]  the air with jesse ventura we're to be here with you i have a very important piece of information
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:08.600]  for the governor and i have a big question for both of you first piece of information
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:15.720]  shake maps shake maps is a product of us geological survey earthquake hazards program if you look at
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:22.680]  the shape shake map in seishwan when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over china on may 20th
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:31.160]  2008 the shake map is the exact same shape as the harp weapon that's point number one and
[2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:35.560]  then i'll work at the point after two okay what's your final point is we got to go here in a minute
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.120]  okay so check out the shake maps final point there's too much fragmentation on the info war
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:46.920]  prison plan at birth there's oath keepers 911 truth odd at the fed lp gun owners sky watch
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:54.920]  i would recommend both of you join and help create a constitutional defense fund alex and
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:26:00.280]  sir we can't do it all hold on a minute people act like jesse ventura alex jones or ron paul
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:07.240]  have magical powers we put our let our pants on one leg at a time to freedom is fractured it's good
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:12.120]  that we're not all unified because that makes us hard to stop uh governor your comment on that
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:17.080]  well and the other thing is too is that how do you do it it's like when i was the third party
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:22.840]  candidate minnesota i tried to bring all the third parties together so we could consolidate
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:27.560]  and become a force against the other two parties i got news for you it's like hurting cats
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:33.400]  in fighting and i couldn't even bring them together on an issue that we all agreed upon
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:39.800]  and that was campaign finance none of us none of us took dirty money and it just fractured
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.680]  like nothing and so i just threw my hands up in the air and i said it may be impossible
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:49.640]  i think alex makes a great point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at him from
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:55.800]  different directions yeah it's a spirit of liberty shrink government bring accountability final call
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:27:02.120]  for governor jessie ventura from his home state minnesota mark you're on the air go ahead hi you
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:07.400]  can hear me yes i can go ahead hi mark hi hi i bought it for you jessie i appreciate both your
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:12.200]  guys's work and uh quickly uh a couple questions about i can't wait for your show to come out
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:16.360]  um i look forward to watching that and i'll tell people about it my friends and whatnot
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.960]  a couple ideas for the show maybe you could look into uh the uh patent issue where people
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:28.600]  hold uh individuals developing free energy and anti anti-gravity technology that the government
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:33.560]  then beams it a national security risk you know jessie that's a great idea if it gets picked up
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:38.520]  for another season is look at cold fusion we will take that under consideration but we
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:42.840]  got to get picked up first we only did seven for right now yeah we got to cross that bridge
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:46.680]  before we we have to come to that bridge before we cross it yeah anything else mark
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:53.080]  yeah one last thing i just saw an article in uh world met daily about the data centers being
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:57.480]  set up by data saying homeland security department and i'm very concerned about that they collect
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:03.720]  all our information all communications and storage and uh this is another incremental loss of liberty
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:10.600]  watch my show on his big brother watching and all that and uh you'll learn how they get away with
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:15.480]  it and how they loop the constitution to do it thank you so much mark okay we got a minute and
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:19.480]  a half left governor i'm gonna say bye to you when we go to break so just hold one moment but i wanted
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:24.680]  to say in closing it's been great working with you i hope the show airs looks like it is they've
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:28.520]  started promoting it they're unleashing you to promote it so i think that's the green light but
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:34.680]  as you said we won't believe it airs until we see it go on december 2nd on true tv so spread the word
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:39.720]  but did you ever think because i know all about this stuff and i still can't believe it i'm still
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:45.720]  flabbergasted i am psychologically speechless a lot of times i can still babble some words out but
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:51.080]  it's hard to articulate the nsa says they're taking over the whole internet they may shut it down during
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:57.240]  crises like bird flu or swine flu the nsa is going to intercept all internet traffic they're
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:03.320]  building nsa centers in san antonio in new york and florida and minnesota and california and just
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:08.680]  admitting they're reading everything we're doing so they go from we're not spying on al-qaeda to we
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:13.560]  are spying on al-qaeda to we're spying on you and we don't need no stinking warrants did you ever
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:19.800]  think that would happen well if it will happen because yeah i i can believe it happening alex
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:25.960]  because of apathetic people out there people who cannot be apathetic any longer you can't sit on
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:31.240]  your hands anymore you can't sit back and have government tell you they're going to protect
[2:29:31.240 --> 2:29:36.120]  you but in lieu of that protection you're going to give up your freedoms you are better off to be
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:42.440]  in danger from terrorists than you are to lose your freedoms don't let them take your freedoms
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:48.600]  and always remember dissension is the greatest form of patriotism governor jesse ventura amazing

[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:23.240]  takeover of your vitamins and food meeting the globalist are moving on every front taking over
[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:28.280]  right now was that not an incredible jesse ventura interview in the last hour and a half
[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:35.960]  we put some traces on the phone lines to the phone company because it's we're only dropping big
[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:43.000]  guests and our phone system creates a certain blip when the phones drop but we can check the
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:49.480]  phone logs from here and we put a trace in with the phone company our phone lines are being dropped
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:57.000]  in between us in washington our office in minnesota and it's only with big guests this is not happening
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:01.160]  with other regular phone lines we have these are regular phone lines and we have internet phone
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:07.240]  lines and i don't want to say it's a conspiracy theory though we have been officially hacked
[2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:10.920]  many times or attempted to be hacked and we have found big hacking sites saying they're
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:17.560]  going to hack us again because we don't like uh obama we're fascist because we don't like
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:24.200]  expanding the wars but then we track those groups those are government operatives posing as if
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:29.560]  they're hackers because we've had top hackers give us the documentation on this we've got the
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:35.320]  pentagon directing denial of service attacks a bunch of other types of attacks against us
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:43.960]  the last big one was when we were exposing that the flu was a fraud and part of a larger drill
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:47.640]  and that they had prepared all this back in january and we told you they were getting ready
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:53.560]  for a stage flu hysteria we said we don't know if it's a hoax or whether it's going to be real
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:59.240]  but in january and february i said they're going to stage something big this year and we had city
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:04.360]  managers and emergency managers on and got secret documents on air for you and then it all came true
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:11.240]  because we have the sources i mean we're risking our lives here for you ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:14.600]  this is not a game this is not a joke
[2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:23.240]  without giving too much to the tv show away
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:30.120]  well i know who it was that was on the no fly list as soon as they tried to fly here for the
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:34.840]  interview and the government's listening to these people's phone lines and just doing it for meetings
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:41.480]  we have sent video tapes to media before and they have erased the tape with a with a uh
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.200]  they have a system that sends out these electronic waves that erases tapes anybody who's worked in
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:51.640]  a tv station knows about them forget the technical term but back in the old days of regular tape and
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:55.240]  video they have them well they'll erase a regular computer tape too
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:00.520]  they've got other systems they'll erase hard drives it's a big magnet
[2:36:02.280 --> 2:36:08.600]  but the point is is they did that twice once then they broke into a hotel room i've had a
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:12.120]  break into hotel rooms i'm in and steal just our tapes
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:21.800]  well i was talking about this a few weeks ago because i i buy movies on dvd to watch them
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:26.040]  when i run on the treadmill only way i can run more than 30 minutes is to watch a movie
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:30.440]  i can go out on the street to start running and like 20 minutes later i just stop it's just
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:34.440]  but i can get on that treadmill and watch going to go into zombie mode i guess i use the mind
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:42.280]  control device device to trick myself into running more than 30 minutes when you got as fat as i did
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:48.760]  at 260 pounds down to 230 now trying to lose more weight it gets tougher once you lose that first 30
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:54.520]  side issue point is i'm on the treadmill
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:37:02.840]  and i watch in two parts the insider and that's a true story of all the harassment he went through
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:08.040]  and all the things that happened to him a tobacco company scientists going public man that's a cake
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:14.120]  walk and the reason they haven't killed me and the reason they don't do a lot of stuff to me anymore
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:18.760]  they still do some things because they know i don't care i mean i care but what am i going to do
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:22.920]  it's kind of like once you jump out of an airplane with a parachute is your parachute
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:33.080]  can open you sure hope so i mean i don't know and and there's such a liberating feeling about
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:38.760]  going g i hope they don't hurt my wife or kids g i hope they don't kill me or destroy me in the
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:43.960]  media or set me up or it's kind of nice that they're just doing co until pro against me and
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:52.200]  making stuff up and i and i kind of let them do that as like okay you get to do that thank you for
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:57.400]  not killing me and i do want to say to the globalist i know they've calculated all the angles and
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:01.560]  they think i'm buffoonish and that i just credit at certain levels but now they figured out that's
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:06.920]  not really the case and i do feel the wings of death flapping above my head and they're beginning
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:15.480]  to really analyze my true operation uh but um we're a little farther down the line now aren't
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:22.120]  we globalist to where my information is out there and if you kill me it's going to highlight
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:27.160]  it's going to underline everything i've said and done and so you're going to destroy me in the
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:32.600]  media the problem is the media is so discredited that if you tell a bunch of lies about me anybody
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:41.080]  who can think automatically supports me i mean yes you've got buffoons fooled you've got idiots
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:47.000]  fooled you've got morons fooled but anyone who can think even if they disagree with me on some
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:52.680]  issues lord knows i make mistakes and i'm aggressive and bomb basket and and arrogant sometimes
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:57.000]  but people who've got discernment and who've been around the world they know i'm for real
[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:03.000]  they know even if i wasn't a good person and it wasn't for real i'm waking a lot of people up
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:09.320]  i mean if i work for the government man this is the worst money they ever spent because we're
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:13.960]  hurting them folks we're teaching you you have power we're teaching you you can affect change
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:17.800]  we're teaching you that you can fight the new world order we're teaching you how their systems
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:23.560]  work we're teaching you to unplug from their matrix we're showing people how they can affect change
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:32.920]  we're documenting our true form of government the system hates us we're against bashing jews
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:38.680]  and bashing catholics and bashing blacks and bashing whites i come out against the racist
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:44.760]  Hispanics and racist blacks when they're bashing white people you know we criticize corruption
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:48.840]  of israel we criticize corruption of china but we don't hate chinese people
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:56.600]  we're here bringing people together and that's why you know i thought about the magnitude of
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:03.640]  this last week i thought i haven't made a bigger deal over the fact that we can track the ip addresses
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:09.800]  of commenters and that these are coming from military bases and our government operatives
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:14.440]  many cases they put their handles up there you can go to their myspace or facebook and they admit
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:25.400]  they're in psyops i mean this is getting crazy they don't even care if we know and then i think
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:32.120]  about how many white supremacists have been caught in federal court the southern priority law center
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:38.680]  howl turner all of them that attack me and then it turns out they're fed staging stuff
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:45.640]  howl turner i told you six seven years ago that guy was a fed as if you couldn't take one micron
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:57.720]  do we have our guest okay good as if as if one micron of discernment wouldn't know he was a fed
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:03.240]  and then it comes out he's attacking me i'm his main target that i work for israel and i'm bad
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:07.960]  and i'm all this stuff and everybody they really want to be a true blue american has to hate jews
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:14.280]  and obsess on that all day even if you believe that when you go out and preach that it destroys
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:19.000]  all your other arguments i don't want cap and trade but i hate jews oh i don't want socialist
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:25.320]  health care i hate jews by the way that totally destroys your argument well i don't hate jews
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:28.360]  and i understand there are a lot of evil jews involve the new world order there's a lot of evil
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.400]  people period but jews are competitive smart informed educated people of course there's
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:36.920]  going to be a lot of evil people at the top that are jewish there's a lot of brett's at the top
[2:41:36.920 --> 2:41:41.320]  that are evil because british people statistically are very smart and when you get evil ones on your
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:46.360]  hands you've got a problem i mean it's the same same thing with the russian government i'm not
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:52.200]  against russian people i'm against their corrupt government i speak out against it all right look
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:42:01.960]  look people always think it's a conspiracy theory on tv when i hit the silence button and talk to
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:05.720]  them we're gonna go to our guests in five minutes because i wasn't sure if we were gonna get them on
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:12.040]  and i have something else lined up ted anderson's about to come on the point here is i just realized
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:20.920]  that it's on record that all these top white supremacists get busted get caught in federal
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:27.160]  court being federal informants or agents they get caught in court cases and lawsuits and then
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:31.880]  admit when they kill their wife or beat up their neighbor or get in trouble there's a whole bunch
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:37.960]  of them or threaten the wrong state judge and get arrested they then come out and say i'm a fed
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:44.120]  i'm a fed and then feds come in and go well he he does work for us why would the feds have all
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:51.960]  these different organizations and groups attacking me as working for israel or working for the
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:59.480]  vatican or working for this or that and then it comes out they are feds see the feds want us all
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:04.120]  fighting with each other they want that all right we got major general stubble bind and
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:08.840]  dr rima labo coming up the balance of the radio show today with part two of their amazing interview
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:15.240]  with us last week they can report on the conclusion of what happened at the uh codex alimentarius
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:20.040]  in europe and so much more coming up in t-minus five minutes very honored to have them we had some
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:24.040]  phone trouble getting them connected i want to bring ted anderson up briefly because gold as you
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:31.000]  know went above $1100 and has stayed there and ted is almost out it's gone up three times in the last
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:39.080]  week he's almost out of gold that is well yesterday almost $60 less in the market than it is now
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:44.360]  he's almost out of this and it will go up in the next few days if the selling continues like this
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:49.400]  and it clearly is ted briefly give us an economic outlook on what's happening tell folks about the
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:54.280]  mightest resources offer of the day if people didn't listen to us when gold was 300 an ounce
[2:43:54.280 --> 2:44:01.480]  it's now 1100 plus maybe they'll listen now well i hope so alex because china and also india trying
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:06.360]  to shore up their currencies with the amount of gold that they used to use you know to have against
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:12.520]  their currencies that'll push gold up to $1300 an ounce if that happens if the united states decides
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:18.760]  to get its currency short up with gold we're going to be as high as $2,700 an ounce just to go back
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:26.120]  to 71 level you know that's what we're looking at right here gold right now is sitting at $1,105
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:33.560]  an ounce i still have the francs currently right now presently at the price of 246 british sovereigns
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:42.040]  are at 299 and i also have the Lakota coin at $22 and 30 cents walking liberties 869 i mean we have
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.000]  us eagles we have junk silver bags i mean pretty much anything that you want to be getting into in
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:51.640]  the marketplace we have it right here at mitis the main thing is is that you have to realize
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:57.800]  that the united states currency's value is under attack there is simply no way that the u.s currency
[2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:02.440]  is going to hold value when you have the united states government trying to solve its problems
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:10.600]  by printing money it just doesn't work that way well absolutely ted and when you hear even clark
[2:45:10.600 --> 2:45:16.680]  howard the economic guru saying okay go ahead and get into gold when you hear all the national
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:22.760]  shows saying $2,000 an ounce that it's guaranteed i'm not saying that it's guaranteed gold has real
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.720]  intrinsic value i believe it's going to keep going up in the next few years because the dollar
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:34.280]  they've decided to devalue it and kill it but it certainly is crazy at this point to not get into
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:38.920]  gold and silver especially when you can get in a time machine and go back and buy it cheaper
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:44.680]  than it is now because ted is smart and buys in the dips uh so this is a win win win those are
[2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:49.320]  great deals tell them it's the alex jones special to get the lower prices you'll be paying a higher
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:55.400]  price that still is very competitive in this market you know ted has got an a rating for a
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:46:00.440]  gold company when you look at all the other gold companies go check them they have c plus c minuses
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:06.360]  or f's ted is a great company great deals a super you know high quality it's where i've chosen to
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:11.480]  buy gold and silver because i can get the best deals i get the deals you're getting and uh these
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:17.080]  are just exceptional deals right now ted give them the toll free number yeah you get a hold of minus
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:23.960]  here at one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven again it's one eight hundred six eight
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:30.120]  six two two three seven and by all means please let us know that the uh that you call off the alex
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:37.480]  jones show absolutely ted now i want to be clear when they call whether it's the bags of junk silver
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:42.360]  or whether it's a you know a maple leaf or whether it's an american eagle or whether it's a buffalo
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:46.920]  you got a lot of stuff in right now you tell them it's the alex jones special and what type of
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:51.720]  discount do you get or is the alex jones special just on the francs the sovereigns and the silver
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:55.800]  half dollars well let's put it this way there are some coins that we're carrying right now that if
[2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:00.120]  you don't mention that you've heard it on the alex jones special you could pay as much as
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  two hundred dollars an ounce more i mean that's the materials that i'm putting aside i mean
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:12.840]  specifically i told my sales staff that this is for this particular offer you can't offer this to
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:17.960]  anybody else you're gonna have to do it so this is a blanket discount but to but to focus in on
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:21.080]  that specific discount because people are always calling me and trying to get me to explain it and
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:29.080]  i have the internal sheets where say it's a quarter rounds gold coin back you know and it was 224
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:36.600]  and i would see your four or five dollar markup i mean tiny uh so so explaining that you buy when
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:43.080]  the market's lower it would cost you more to buy these now than for what you're selling them that's
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:49.480]  what the truth is the same coins cost a lot more in the wholesale market because gold has jumped up
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:56.040]  over 50 dollars an ounce in a week and you know what it's at 1005 and i wouldn't be a surprised
[2:47:56.040 --> 2:48:03.560]  a bit that if it jumps into that 1150 range here very shortly it just it's moving that direction
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:07.960]  the united states dollars under attack internationally it's not just here now
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:15.880]  as as as we add more liability to our government confer the federal printing press just turns
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:19.480]  on full speed and what do you think is going to happen to the dollars we earned if we're
[2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:24.680]  have to compete with money that's being created well that's the point i'm trying to make is that
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:29.960]  as the general public because before what three four five percent maybe of the public
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:34.040]  physically held silver and gold now they're saying it's getting up to six seven eight percent and
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:40.840]  the price is exploding as the yuppies find out that the stock market's going up and gold's going
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:47.480]  up because devalued dollars are chasing it the stock market didn't go up gold didn't go up dollars
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:52.680]  went down as soon as they figure that out they're going to want to get out of the dominant dollar
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:57.640]  denominated stocks and bonds they're going to want to hold physical gold and and what the
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:03.480]  economists talk about is his inflation kicks in globally on top of this depression that will drive
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:09.800]  commodities up oils going up all precious metals are going up and and and so at least in the short
[2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:17.240]  term gold is a win win win win win win i believe the markets are so manipulated that that it may
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:21.480]  hold for a while coming up here in the next few months but then in the next year may rocket
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:27.000]  past 2000 who knows the point is ladies and gentlemen there's not a better investment any
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:32.600]  way you slice it than silver and gold if you get a good deal on it give ted anderson a call
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:37.560]  they could tell you about the risk associated with it yeah the risk is you won't make the huge
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:43.960]  profits 300 gold five six years ago 1100 now but there still are some risk there's risk if you
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:49.240]  drive your car you can get run over today the point is the risk are a lot less in my opinion
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:53.880]  common sense opinion in gold and silver than they are in the stinking stock market or in real
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:50:00.360]  estate or anything else folks what the kings and queens and pirates and and criminals what do they
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:05.960]  have the people that know that are street smart they have gold they have their treasure chest

[2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:16.600]  with us thank you so much alexis all of the pleasure to talk to you great day back uh you
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:23.480]  you talked about codex and i want to remind you listeners that the codex alimentarius is a un
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:32.600]  commission which is run and funded by who not your friends and the food and agriculture organization
[2:55:32.600 --> 2:55:39.080]  f a o another not person friendly organization that we in the united states know much less
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:49.320]  about than we do who i want to remind you that um who is using a two pronged genocidal tool
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:58.920]  one prong is the degradation of the world's food supply and the mandating of under nutrition
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:06.280]  which they admit is the principal care but the under nutrition is the principal cause of what
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:14.200]  they call the uh non-communicable preventable diseases of under nutrition cancer cardiovascular
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:21.080]  disease stroke diabetes and obesity these five diseases alone are not only the five um
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:28.440]  um principal moneymakers or big pharma and of course um uh we have to add vaccines in there
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:35.080]  it's another principal moneymaker big time but in addition to that they are the principal killers
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:40.840]  in the development of the developing world so if you mandate under nutrition and then
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:47.400]  thank you monies we say well it's under nutrition that causes these diseases isn't that too bad
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:53.480]  you are definitely talking out of both sides of your genocidal mouth the other thing that who
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:57:03.080]  has been doing since 1974 is perfecting genocidal vaccines and they've been caught on it in places
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:08.680]  like the philippine high court um they've been you know that's a good point i didn't bring this up to
[2:57:08.680 --> 2:57:15.240]  you uh dr lebo last week it actually came out in un documents where they discussed in the 60s
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:20.920]  that we need to get that pulled back up they discussed using vaccines as the delivery system
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:27.480]  of cancer and sterilization so i mean as you said they've been caught by high courts in
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:34.600]  india the philippines in in africa i mean this is really starting to get out that's right and it's
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:40.360]  it's very important for your listeners and the people that your listeners talk to and so the
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:49.320]  people who go to our website healthfreedomusa.org to understand that these sacred chow organizations
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:55.800]  the u.s government w h l v v n are in the pharmaceutical industry are held aloft by
[2:57:55.800 --> 2:58:03.000]  propaganda they are when you investigate the fact that you do as we do alex what you come up with is
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:14.760]  a horrifying breathtaking mind-numbing evil it's that simple now when i say that there are interlinked
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:20.920]  genocidal tools you have to understand of course that the immune system is the common
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:30.120]  um is a common pathway for both of their weapons the immune system is damaged and destroyed by their
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:38.200]  vaccine as well as directly inducing sterility and the immune system is damaged by their degraded
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:48.680]  food stay there doctor back in one minute thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com
[2:58:48.680 --> 2:58:57.880]  today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance

[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:08.280]  underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[2:59:08.840 --> 2:59:15.000]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:20.520]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[2:59:20.520 --> 2:59:26.040]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:59:26.040 --> 2:59:31.160]  tem geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[2:59:31.160 --> 2:59:36.840]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[2:59:36.840 --> 2:59:44.200]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars dot
[2:59:44.200 --> 2:59:49.640]  com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[2:59:49.640 --> 2:59:59.320]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:59.320 --> 3:00:15.800]  we're talking about in game a
[3:00:18.120 --> 3:00:20.920]  pharmacological military industrial complex
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:30.120]  grid of control a scientific dictatorship a planetary dictatorship to carry out the orderly
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:34.840]  extermination of the majority of the world population now from un documents i made this
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:41.080]  film three years ago in game documenting at all now we have the white house science ours own book
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:48.200]  as if i wrote it but from their perspective or as if general stubblebine wrote it but from their
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:54.760]  perspective confirming everything we've ever said because we can look at what they're doing and tell
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:01:02.440]  you what their operation is but to have their signed sealed confessions and then did not see them
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:07.720]  arrested to not see this stopping it's incredible dr rima labo medical doctors he's treated heads of
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:15.800]  state her husband their partners in fighting crime major general stubblebine uh they're both here
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:20.920]  with us and we're going to go back to dr labo here in a minute they join us via speaker phones we
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:27.080]  can't get through the regular line in uh in central america right now so we're on their backup line
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:32.760]  general knowing about john p holdren's publications and the internal government documents that are
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:40.280]  now public where the plan to carry out this extermination is just admitted is it the weight
[3:01:40.280 --> 3:01:46.520]  of the system its own inertia that they don't get in trouble or kind of like hitler couldn't get in
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:54.680]  trouble until we finally removed him i mean where is this going so i don't think so i think that uh
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:03.080]  they are in some way are of the opinion that they've got to publish what they're going to do
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:09.560]  so that it makes it all right when they actually do it there's another piece too and that is
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:19.000]  if you're going to have a program that uh is complicated is this one then you must have a
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  manual by which you go by you know that every every uh item is the military it's got a manual
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:35.480]  somewhere so they've written the manual form and i want to make another point alex uh you said
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:40.840]  why don't they get in trouble well they control the system uh so they don't get in trouble with
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:49.240]  indictments and things like that but we you and i and the other uh truth discussers we are their
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:56.920]  trouble and as long as we have the internet they are increasingly day by day exponentially in more
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:03.080]  trouble because we understand what they're doing we're finding their documents and we're disseminating
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:10.680]  them and we're creating pushback and it is pushback that has saved us so far i want to i want to
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:15.640]  mention something that may seem a little bit unrelated but it's actually a good example of
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:21.960]  pushback the national organic standards board of the united states department of agriculture
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:27.480]  was a good idea when it was started in the nineties but it has become like everything
[3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:34.280]  up in the in the federal government like the sda the the sport and death administration and the cdc
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:41.320]  centers for disease creation uh they have become the tools of the industries that they were designed
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:46.920]  to regulate the same as true with the national organic standards board which now allows more
[3:03:46.920 --> 3:03:54.360]  than ten percent gmo uh contamination in your organic food it allows organic hops in your
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:04:02.440]  organic beer but in addition to that i'm sorry it allows gmo hops in your organic beer but
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:10.200]  one thing that happened because a huge public outcry today is that the national organic standards
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:18.840]  board was forced to apply organic standards to body care products as well as food products
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:27.080]  they named by name amazon organics avalon organics desert essence organics uh geovani
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:36.360]  organic cosmetics jayson pure natural and organic cosmetics um nature's gateway organics and
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:45.000]  noah's natural organics as substance companies that were not following the organic rules but
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:51.880]  i don't sound like a big win in the context of genocidal uh i can't yeah so they're taking over
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:57.800]  the the the certifiers of organics so they can mislabel stay there we got to go to break we're
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:02.440]  going to try a better phone line with you guys as well stay with us hey folks this is alex jones

[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:25.000]  okay we are trying different connections to get better audio with general stubble bind major
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:33.400]  general stubble bind and dr rima lebo from their headquarters joining us from health freedom usa down
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:41.560]  in panama and she's going over organics victories we've had first we had a victory in pushback
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:47.160]  10 years ago you couldn't find organic food on store shelves now half of it many cities became
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:53.080]  organic it funded local farms funded organics but the establishment came in took over the
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:08:59.560]  organic certification groups many of them and began certifying and i'm simplifying this there's
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:05.240]  a lot of different techniques they used certifying things that were gmo that were genetically modified
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:10.280]  as organic but she's saying there's been a victory there then we'll get into the latest on flu
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:15.000]  and a lot more but before we go there i want to finish my question to general stubble bind
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:19.560]  and a dr lebo you're a medical doctor and a psychiatrist dr lebo and general stubble binds
[3:09:19.560 --> 3:09:23.560]  commanded hundreds of thousands of troops and generals and many others and he understands
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.560]  psychology and i loved your answer to why they write these books this is a manual and we've
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:35.400]  bought over a hundred globalist manuals high level government manuals for state department people
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:43.400]  un people they admit carol quigley's book was commissioned by the cfr uh and other organizations
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:50.280]  as a briefing manual for high level cia and state department not meant for public distribution uh
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:54.520]  and they admit these are manuals but that something else general stubble bind said i
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:00.120]  wanted to comment on and then dr lebo with with with her psychiatry background understanding this
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:07.880]  why do these people have a compulsion to tell you what they're going to do publicly but
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:14.280]  but you know in a small way they they whisper under their breath it's like the old tales of vampires
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:22.200]  and the fables having to trick you to invite them in why do they always tell you what they're
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:31.800]  going to do why why uh first general stubble bind and then dr lebo it seems to me that uh
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:38.680]  it's almost uh and i i have no evidence of this other than uh watching it over and over and over
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:44.440]  and over again but it's almost like they have a manual that says in order to do what we're
[3:10:44.440 --> 3:10:49.480]  going to do to these people we got to tell them what we're going to do before we do it i mean
[3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:58.120]  it's almost a ritual uh event and uh after you've seen it the first time say i don't know second
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:05.000]  time you know but eventually you get to a point you said holy smokes these people are crazy but
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:11.400]  they're telling us what they're going to do to us before they do it and if we don't pay attention
[3:11:11.400 --> 3:11:18.840]  then it's our fault that we're getting in trouble that's when we've got to start the pushback before
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:25.720]  it becomes totally effective anybody i'm sorry alex go ahead no me go ahead and then we're
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:30.200]  going to get into stop the shot the organics uh what's happening with codex alimentarius i mean
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:35.320]  give us the latest you were there uh because you guys are really pushing back i mean you are leaders
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:40.760]  actually taking action but commenting on that question to general stubble bind as a psychiatrist
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:46.920]  why are they obsessed with telling you what they're going to do but then if you say i don't want
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:55.480]  that they say oh this book doesn't exist i mean it's crazy uh does anybody remember son
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:12:04.520]  of sam who was cutting newspaper uh newspapers apart and magazines and pasted together messages
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:12.360]  like stop me before i kill after he had killed and before he killed a lot more people there is a um
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:18.920]  a need to be recognized that's very deep in the human psyche no matter how evil and perverted
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:26.760]  the human psyche is and so criminals police uh detectives know perfectly well that criminals
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:33.560]  get caught because they leave clues saying recognize me recognize me even though they may not consciously
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:43.000]  want to be caught and in fact i believe that this may be the last remnant of humanity in psychopaths
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:50.440]  so insane that they can and i'm saying insane as a trained psychiatrist so insane that they can
[3:12:50.440 --> 3:13:00.760]  comfortably and laughingly contemplate with with great smugness the genocidal extermination of
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:10.840]  virtually everybody who doesn't personally serve them or their cohort this is fabulous craziness
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:17.000]  understand this is there's nothing normal about it and so i believe that the reason they have this
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:24.680]  rule which it appears that they do have is because it serves their their last shred of humanity this
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:32.200]  is not a conspiracy theory we all know at this point that a theory is an untested hypothesis
[3:13:32.200 --> 3:13:40.280]  we have the documentation this is a conspiracy reality to kill and i i want to point out that
[3:13:40.280 --> 3:13:46.920]  what's happening and what's being shared on the internet is the revelation of what we predicted
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:53.800]  and what you predicted alex which is that the swine flu vaccines are in themselves causing
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:14:00.040]  miscarriages and horrific neurological okay we're going to go over we're going to go over that right
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:04.680]  now and i'm going to sit back and give you both the floor to go over your lawsuit uh victories
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:09.880]  we're having but also the carnage being created by the vaccines that was predicted because of the
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:14.840]  medical evidence but i want to go back to the nature of our enemy i think there's one more
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:21.800]  reason that in white papers that they publish they admit their entire plan and then disdainfully
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:27.240]  tell the general public none of it exists while ban kai moon admits world government carbon tax to
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:33.880]  enslave us and then other publications owned by george soros say it doesn't exist while he
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:40.200]  goes on lair news hour and calls for world government and carbon tax to fund it his publications all
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:46.760]  six of them attack alex jones and say i'm crazy none of it exists i will explain why this is
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:50.040]  happening and i want general stubblebine and then you doctor lay about a comment on this
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:55.720]  then we'll go over your evidence and then take calls but they're also doing this to multiple
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:15:02.920]  audiences to the dumb down easily suggestible cowardly people who want to buy a lie who want to
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:09.240]  lay down who want to be slaves they just don't want to hear about it it's none of this exists
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:14.120]  but then to those of us that they know are not wicked and do have empathy and are tuned into
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:19.640]  our center and do love people and love creation it's a threat yeah we're going to kill you and
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:23.960]  there's nothing these dumb slaves are going to do they're never going to wake up so really it's a
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:30.360]  bravado it's an arrogant you know the devil roars to see who he may devour and to intimidate
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:35.480]  so it's also blowing their trumpet saying look we'll tell the world we're going to kill you
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:39.960]  and look at these slaves they won't even listen to you i've had elitist tell me that they go alex
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:45.320]  you notice you lay all this out the slaves don't care they want to be slaves so so it's also a
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:51.400]  type of not just bragging as you said but a type of intimidation general stubblebine incidentally
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:58.920]  i totally agree with you alex they uh there are a group of us that need to be intimidated there's
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:06.440]  a group of us that are sound asleep that uh won't even pay any attention but those who are
[3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:14.760]  pushing back need we just lost their line those of us pushing back need to be intimidated
[3:16:17.720 --> 3:16:19.880]  if we've got them on another backup line flip them over
[3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:24.520]  i don't think this is a conspiracy i think it's because they're in Panama
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:34.040]  i don't know where it is but it sure is uh frustrating well you know what with Ventura
[3:16:34.040 --> 3:16:37.880]  they may have been cutting him off okay you were saying there's a group of us who needs to be
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:45.000]  intimidated go ahead that needs to be intimidated their view and needs to be controlled and so
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:53.560]  if we publish all of this and we tell them they can say oh well you better pay attention
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:17:01.480]  uh young man if you don't you're gonna be blah blah blah blah so i believe that there is a
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:11.240]  pounding of chest a pat patting themselves on the back and letting us know that what is coming
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:19.160]  down the pike is not going to be good for us be a better shut up sit down and just take it well
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:24.680]  you know alex what you were saying and what i was saying are the same thing um this this
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:31.960]  kind of arrogant hilarity the feverish hilarity you might see in these in these pronouncements
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:40.760]  and then the denials um is very much both an aggressive demonstration of their power and at
[3:17:40.760 --> 3:17:45.720]  the same time you can see it as this need to be recognized and an intimidation but then again
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:51.640]  that our behavior as human beings is usually motivated by many things at the same time so
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:57.480]  this makes perfect sense it's not unitary it's several things moving us in the same direction
[3:17:57.480 --> 3:18:03.000]  whatever it is thank goodness that they feel the need to reveal their plans first so those of us
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:09.800]  who are awake and trumpeting can't let people know what's going on and while we have the internet
[3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:17.480]  we have the power to awaken and people have the power to make change we have a lawsuit the natural
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:23.960]  solutions foundation has a lawsuit that had a hearing on thursday november fifth which was
[3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:30.520]  after uh we spoke from the codex meeting and right now i'm sending out an urgent alert
[3:18:30.520 --> 3:18:38.200]  through your show alex for plaintiffs people who are willing to make a complaint to stop the um
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:43.160]  compulsory or the deadly vaccines even if they're voluntary they're still deadly
[3:18:43.160 --> 3:18:48.840]  they're still causing miscarriages they're still causing things to happen as such as happen to
[3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:57.640]  deseret change the uh uh cheerleader in training um we need parents in new jersey with children five
[3:18:57.640 --> 3:19:06.040]  years of age or young who are willing to say electronically i don't want my child vaccinated
[3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:12.120]  and this will cost no money for the parents they will not have to travel to washington dc to the
[3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:19.960]  federal court uh they will prepare a certification and sign it um that represents their situation
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:28.040]  if you are willing or if you are the custodial grandparent or parent and you are willing to
[3:19:28.040 --> 3:19:35.320]  participate in this stop the show okay we lost their line again we're going to come back to them
[3:19:35.320 --> 3:19:42.440]  after break they've got a program they've filed suit they need a class action to block the inoculation
[3:19:42.440 --> 3:19:47.640]  and it is forced they are injecting children all over the country when the parents find out they
[3:19:47.640 --> 3:19:53.480]  say oops we made a mistake they're telling medical workers they're going to be fired but then obama
[3:19:53.480 --> 3:19:59.480]  plays the good cop and says we're not making you take the shots we'll be right back stay with us

[3:24:56.440 --> 3:25:03.880]  no shots program and you're calling for plaintiffs specifically people well who needs to call you
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:11.720]  it is dirty with kids five years and younger because the mandate is very strong that they
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:18.760]  must be vaccinated with the flu vaccines uh recommended by the cdc and the judge here's
[3:25:18.760 --> 3:25:25.960]  the point when we went to the hearing on november 5th the judge said your case has new york
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:31.720]  plaintiffs and the new york mandate for health care workers has been called off therefore he
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:39.400]  said i want to come back in i want this case in my court but i want you to come back with new
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:45.480]  jersey plaintiffs who have children five years of age and i want to stop you i want to stop you
[3:25:45.480 --> 3:25:51.400]  this is huge you and burt are taking incredible action you're going into the belly of the beast
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:57.480]  you file suit and the new york judge says yeah they're pushing it but they're not forcing it now
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:04.680]  thanks to previous suits bring me new jersey plaintiffs and so in federal court you need new
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:10.360]  jersey plaintiffs people who've been pressured in public schools i know we have listeners in new
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:17.800]  jersey they need to go to healthfreedomusa.org and you can have them given the paperwork it's very
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:24.920]  easy because they're trying to set the precedent in new jersey for future staged events this is
[3:26:24.920 --> 3:26:30.200]  people want to have a victory against the globalist this is it i mean in general you guys are really
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:37.480]  taking action here well we're trying to uh alex and uh right at the moment we need the help of
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:47.080]  these new jersey uh residents to be plaintiffs in the case so we need again voices this is a
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:53.160]  federal case alex so that if the judge rules in our favor and this is an injunction it will keep
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:59.800]  the fda from releasing any of their deadly vaccines we let me give you an email and this
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:07.240]  will set a huge this will set a huge precedent too absolutely absolutely can stop the vaccine
[3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:14.760]  juggernaut in its tracks and let me tell you when the united states cannot proceed with its its
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:22.680]  vaccine program every other country in the world will come to a grinding screeching hall so this
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:29.800]  is a federal case but it has global implications now let me give you a web a an email if you want
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:43.480]  to be a new jersey plaintiff email us at ralph ralph dot fuca tola fu c e t o l a at usa dot net

[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:16.600]  people always talk about what we need to do something all we talk about is solutions this is
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:22.040]  a smart solution even if you guys don't succeed at least you fought but you're saying you have a
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:27.640]  judge it's clearly constitutional that they can't force you to take vaccines new jersey saying they're
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:31.880]  going to arrest you if you don't give your kids the shots so anybody being threatened with this
[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:38.920]  mandate anybody who's got children in new jersey can be a plaintiff correct correct well the child
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:45.000]  has to be five or under now it's very important to understand this will not cost you money this
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:51.720]  will not endanger you this will allow you to participate and the more the merrier will allow
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:29:00.920]  you to participate in stopping the vaccines from being even recommended because they are illegal
[3:29:00.920 --> 3:29:09.000]  they are untested they are unsafe so people would have done this with rick perry taking that deadly
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:12.920]  uh garthasil shot and forcing it on people there wouldn't have been all those deaths we just lay
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:19.160]  here and go rick perry's our god he says we got to take it we do we roll over and let him hit us
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:27.480]  and i want to know how many of the girls and women who have taken that god awful garthasil and now
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:36.520]  the new one serve a fact this is kind of dramatic how we keep losing him can we flip over the other
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:44.440]  line every time we go to break hannah montana says all the girls need their shots hannah montana says
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:51.160]  that uh we need to global carbon tax and hannah montana says we need to get rid of free speech

[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:06.600]  for example when seeds had the highest value of any barter item even silver or gold there's a war
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:11.240]  on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:16.600]  food supply by the way they got woody harrelson running around with these youtube videos to hype
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:22.920]  2012 where he goes man it's a conspiracy they got a seed vault that's an ap in Reuters let's see by
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:27.800]  making a joke out of it now when you tell people about that you get laughed at this movie's coming

[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:52.520]  you joining us i want to get to some calls to hear their wildcard questions that take us in
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:57.480]  different directions but you were finishing up with the email address for for people that
[3:36:57.480 --> 3:37:02.840]  are plaintiffs in new jersey and you were going to get into some other key issues about the damage
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:09.800]  we know the regular flute seasonal flu shot and the h1n1 are causing dr lebo and general stubble
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:22.920]  bind ralph ralph dot fusetola f is in frank u c is in charlie e t is in tom o l is in lima
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:29.880]  a fusetola at uc.net write to us and tell us if you're interested in becoming a plaintiff
[3:37:29.880 --> 3:37:38.680]  uh and we will help stop vaccines in the united states and therefore in the rest of the world
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:44.920]  it's close it's at hand the judge wants this case the judge was listening he wants the
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:51.720]  case as strong as possible that's why he asked us to resubmit what an opportunity now if you
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:58.040]  also want to support us to help us defray the cost great on our website that's freedom usa dot
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:07.240]  o r g there's a link that says don't donate do it but the point is we need the plaintiffs and we
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:15.480]  can stop the shot imagine what a tool the genocidalists will have lost if we take vaccines away from
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:31.000]  them imagine absolutely general principle of war mass that means we need that means we need to be
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:36.840]  able to stay connected with these folks it's kind of fun though wondering how long they're
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:44.680]  going to stay up each time we're here okay you sound great now principle of war mass general
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:52.920]  go ahead you've got it mass means we put the mass of our force on the enemy's weakness right now
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:59.880]  new jersey is the weakness we need all of the voices we can get to put our mass on their weakness
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:07.080]  principle of war that's the way you win general what's the principle of war just getting angry
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:12.120]  and deciding you're gonna fight that's the will to fight isn't it don't we need to get the initiative
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:19.880]  the will to fight back and grow up it's called the offense uh it is a principle of war it's called
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:27.480]  the offense you cannot win on the defense so in order to do anything you got to go on the offense
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:34.680]  and that's exactly what we're doing oh by the way the doctor who helped us array Jennings so so
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:41.000]  tremendously who is a colleague of mine who i've known for many years dr rushy boutar did the
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:47.960]  ordinary things that doctors like boutar and and myself do when we have patients who are in trouble
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:55.080]  that the ordinary kind of alpathic medicine has failed and yet we are the doctors who are under
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:03.160]  assault dr boutar has been seriously uh molested by the state of north carolina has had most of my
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:08.680]  colleagues so let me stop you let me stop you i mean i mean to be clear you're saying the doctor
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:13.000]  because she was highly publicized he was able to contact you you're saying the doctor who
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:19.800]  helped this lady uh stopped the bad vaccine reaction who was getting paralyzed you're saying
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:26.840]  he's in trouble uh we are all those of us who are chelating physicians some of us go to jail
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:33.560]  some of us lose our licenses for using our medical judgment when it's not pharmaceutical when it's not
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:40.600]  uh death dealing uh helping a patient curing cancer for instance uh if you're not an oncologist and
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:46.280]  of course oncologists never cure cancer curing cancer is the surest way to lose your license if
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:51.480]  you acknowledge well there have been oncologists who've cured cancer who lose their uh license they
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:57.320]  put undercover people and everything because if people start curing cancer and the word gets out
[3:40:57.320 --> 3:41:06.600]  then uh the uh establishment's uh huge profit center of genocide is over the cancer is the
[3:41:06.600 --> 3:41:15.400]  single most profitable medical activity disease that humankind has ever encountered dr lenard
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:21.240]  coldwell uh a dear friend and colleague of mine and it would be lovely to have him on the show alex
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:27.800]  uh he has a new book out called the only answer to cancer he says that all cancer is curable
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:34.280]  in two weeks dr coldwell had six cancer hospitals in germany that were checked down
[3:41:34.280 --> 3:41:40.840]  by the german government because he was so successful he migrated to the us and voila
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:50.040]  same story this is in fact a cabal and we need to speak out and we need to make our choices
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:57.240]  and put our effort where our truth is absolutely well we know they're suppressing life extension
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:42:01.640]  technologies that's why they want to bring in the world government not just to kill us
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:06.280]  but they say they need to get rid of us because they can't give life extension
[3:42:06.280 --> 3:42:11.480]  to seven billion people and that's the real reason they want to kill everybody not that
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:17.080]  there aren't enough resources correct because there won't be enough resources with the current
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:23.000]  technology if seven billion people start living to be a hundred and fifty uh i want to go to some
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.920]  phone calls here and i want to have you guys back soon because there's so much to cover but but
[3:42:26.920 --> 3:42:31.960]  doctor when when when you were doing your residency you made the point then when you were teaching as
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:37.480]  a doctor and i've talked to many other medical doctors here on air they said 20 30 40 years ago
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:43.640]  seeing a child with cancer what was in the ward was like come see this leprechaun come see this
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:53.240]  uh unicorn come see this this mermaid i mean it didn't exist it was it was fabled now i know 20
[3:42:53.240 --> 3:42:58.200]  year olds 25 year olds 30 year olds 2 year olds 10 year olds 9 year olds i mean it seems like
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:43:03.480]  everybody's got cancer everybody's dying from it and the and and and they just make it into a big
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:10.680]  pageant of yeah everybody's got cancer now we're all come together isn't it beautiful without asking
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:17.560]  why everybody's getting cancer uh doctor when i was in medical school and i did graduate within
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:24.120]  living memory it was in 1970 as a matter of fact when a child had cancer other than a wilms tumor
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:29.400]  of the kidney all of us were brought in to go off the child that was considered to be meant
[3:43:30.040 --> 3:43:35.480]  of education and it didn't do much for the child it really didn't teach us anything but that's all
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:44.360]  unusual any cancer in a child other than this one malignant tumor of the kidney was thought to be
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:54.040]  now the uh the statistics are that by the year 2020 any child who reaches the age of 18 will
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:44:01.640]  or whose birthday uh it's 18 years uh at that point will have either died from cancer or survived
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:09.720]  cancer in 50 percent of the cases that means one child in two is expected to get cancer that the
[3:44:09.720 --> 3:44:15.960]  ordinary immune system of a child is robust and vigorous and children are very good at healing
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:20.760]  themselves and if they're healthy and haven't been vaccinated and are eating decent food
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:27.480]  and they're in loving environments they have wonderful immune systems but no more no more
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:32.520]  codex is helping that the vaccines and allopathic because they've taken the vitamins out of the food
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:36.760]  they're drinking corn syrup filled with mercury all day which they add for some reason to brain
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:41.640]  damages they've been given all these shots to burn out their immune system and and the police
[3:44:41.640 --> 3:44:47.560]  and military and government people they'll just say you now die at 15 of cancer you know this is
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:44:53.640]  just how america is and if you don't like it you're a conspiracy theorist general how long can they
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:45:00.600]  carry this holocaust out until their own enforcers realize they're working for eugenicist psychopathic
[3:45:00.600 --> 3:45:09.400]  killers well as long as we keep the the voices going and we keep doing pushback uh uh and
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:17.640]  incidentally we've got to do that if we don't do that then they win so we need to continually
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:29.320]  find the weaknesses find the the place and i uh how long uh i think if we keep pushing back
[3:45:30.840 --> 3:45:38.760]  they lose and i think we can do it in uh what six months alex they're teetering this whole
[3:45:38.760 --> 3:45:44.520]  vaccine has a thing has them reeling and they are not in the position that they thought they'd be
[3:45:44.520 --> 3:45:50.920]  in they thought that they would have codex sewn up and globally implemented by december 31st 2009
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:58.120]  yet they at the codex meeting they were planning for codex uh uh forward movement with various
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:08.840]  strategies in 2011 2013 2015 they are behind schedule they are shaky and now is the time for us to
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:18.200]  seize our power now is the time for us to seize our power i totally agree folks i don't know about
[3:46:18.200 --> 3:46:24.200]  six months but they certainly are not invincible their vaccine program is blowing up in their face
[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:29.240]  people are finding out about world government so the establishment is now being forced to admit it
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:38.200]  but put their spin on it absolutely absolutely um new york pulled back already you know they
[3:46:38.200 --> 3:46:43.800]  they were doing mandatory and then suddenly they're not doing mandatory on october 5th arnold
[3:46:43.800 --> 3:46:49.160]  schwarzenegger said we will vaccinate every person in the state of california against
[3:46:49.160 --> 3:46:57.400]  stage one and one today is one month and six days later and to date there has been no forward
[3:46:57.400 --> 3:47:03.800]  movement with that uh attempt look at france look at france they said the law you have to take it
[3:47:03.800 --> 3:47:09.640]  and over 70 of refuse so you're right people are finally figuring out they're being lied to
[3:47:10.280 --> 3:47:16.920]  it's just key that we be there you and others who have the truth that everybody be there now
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:21.960]  that people are waking up that we be there to give them the truth instead of them stumbling
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:26.920]  through life taking another 10 years to find out what you know because it took us doing research
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:34.120]  you and burt and myself you know decades to figure all this out all working separately now we've gotten
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:39.560]  a high level of knowledge and and and people can come into this now and take advantage of all the
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:44.280]  research that people like yourselves have done and they should and that's why we make all our
[3:47:44.280 --> 3:47:50.520]  information available for free but i want to i want to mention that the german populace found out
[3:47:50.520 --> 3:47:58.200]  out through people like us alex the german people found out that the politicians and the military
[3:47:58.200 --> 3:48:03.640]  were going to get the h1n1 vaccine without squaling but they were going to get it with
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:11.160]  squaling and they went berserk they went berserk and now nobody is willing to take the vaccine
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:18.680]  in germany and in fact the german government is imposing fines the financial punishments
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:25.400]  on doctors when their patients don't take the vaccine so now having miscalculated again and
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:31.720]  they do miscalculate a lot the german doctors are opposing the vaccine yeah i saw the headline
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:39.080]  over 50 or refusing to give it now i agree uh general stubble bind is that a probe and military
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:46.120]  terminology that we go out confront them they overreact and show their true intention waking
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:53.080]  up people that weren't on our side now are by seeing the bullying of the enemy i think i would
[3:48:53.080 --> 3:48:59.480]  call that a secondary attack you know we know where the primary attack is going to go but if they put
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:07.640]  out a uh a probe like that it's uh it's more like a secondary attack to get you to commit
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:13.400]  and then they come around and hit you with their primary attack so we've got to be very alert to
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:22.520]  do these kinds of uh of uh uh tactics and be prepared to go on the offensive another principle
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:30.120]  of war in order to counteract them well no i agree with you on that point my point here is that by
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:37.160]  them trying to force people with fines to take the shot that caused more people to go why do you
[3:49:37.160 --> 3:49:43.560]  want me to take this so bad uh i'm saying they're they're pushing us seems to be blowing up in their
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:50.920]  face and as soon as we reconnect we'll talk to them i i've been intending to go to phone calls
[3:49:50.920 --> 3:49:55.400]  this is kind of fun though it's like we're talking to mars base or something hello this is houston
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:01.640]  mars base over general stubble bind major general stubble bind and dr leba
[3:50:01.640 --> 3:50:09.880]  arbaning the planet at maximum velocity we know the panama's uh communication system and its
[3:50:09.880 --> 3:50:15.720]  weakness is very well but this is exceptional we're right on target alex and they don't want
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:22.120]  this out and i say well thank you for the confirmation and that just tells us all how
[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:27.240]  very important what we're saying is yeah we we interview people down in panama and even
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:33.160]  paraglay and other places and it never does this this is uh this is crazy but i know that jesse
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:37.400]  ventura thing was suspicious somebody was disconnecting that line uh jesse somebody moved
[3:50:37.400 --> 3:50:42.120]  out of the governor's house that the phone company said it was all tapped and he got visited by the

[3:53:56.200 --> 3:54:04.520]  com right now you must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned you know it's
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:08.440]  been two days i've meant to break down and go over what i thought happened at ford hood
[3:54:08.440 --> 3:54:15.400]  you heard jesse ventura he thinks it's a mind control operation it looks like a provocative
[3:54:15.400 --> 3:54:19.960]  operation at the bare minimum and there's so much evidence just when you've studied this you know
[3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:25.560]  what you're looking at the very very suspicious side issue general stubble bind i know more is
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:31.720]  coming out you may not want to comment now but the fbi the cia watching him him he was a psychiatrist
[3:54:33.720 --> 3:54:40.280]  people reported two other shooters they said he was dead for six hours now he's now he's cognizant
[3:54:40.280 --> 3:54:46.280]  out of the coma it just fits all the past operations you've got him launching a new war
[3:54:46.280 --> 3:54:51.080]  expanding the war you've got all these other patsies they've just busted that we know we're
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:56.360]  patsies does this stink to you or do you just think this is some some crazy running around
[3:54:56.360 --> 3:55:03.560]  shooting people at ford hood no i don't think it's that crazy uh not at all i think uh um
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:12.600]  something has triggered him and who knows did the trigger come from harp did the trigger come from
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:23.160]  um uh one of the uh uh the things that have generated is is uh skin i don't know
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:33.480]  it's very suspicious though for somebody to suddenly go on a rampage just because he didn't
[3:55:33.480 --> 3:55:42.040]  like war he won a war that's what he did but he says he didn't like war it's also entirely possible
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:48.520]  we have to remember that as a psychiatrist he had virtually unlimited access any kind of
[3:55:48.520 --> 3:55:55.400]  uh prescription drug that you want and psychiatrification increases homosanity
[3:55:55.400 --> 3:56:03.160]  and so so what we're looking at forget about the model that may be part of it but what we're looking
[3:56:03.160 --> 3:56:13.880]  at just as easily be pure and simply the neurotoxicity of these these agents that cause the the capacity
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:21.160]  for blood to be suspended and cause aggression to be acted out against the suffer against us at
[3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:30.200]  phenomenal rates so we don't know how much of psychiatric mix was which brew was in his blood
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:35.080]  stream and to know that we cannot eliminate that possibility that's what i was going to say one of
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:43.960]  the big issues is minutes after it happened joe rogan was actually here in the office and i said
[3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:49.320]  joe if he turns out to be an arab or in mental health you know it's staged and then he was an
[3:56:49.320 --> 3:56:55.720]  arab and in mental health he fits the classic manchurian candidate we know they hunt for these guys
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:02.520]  in research programs at universities that's when they got theodorus kazinsky the unabomber la times
[3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:09.320]  mk ultra alexander cockburn i mean it's admitted that mcvay was under mind control it's admitted
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:15.960]  the unabomber was mind control this is mainstream news so we have to look at this guy when he fits
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:21.240]  all the earmarks and ask what was going on and why does this serve purposes he certainly could be a
[3:57:21.240 --> 3:57:25.720]  muslim extremist they do exist but this thing stinks to high heaven we don't have time for calls
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:30.840]  because of the audio problem the next time we can get a good line the next few weeks we will have
