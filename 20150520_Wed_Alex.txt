[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.800 --> 00:19.320]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:19.320 --> 00:26.680]  alex jones the story just went live just like we are on the radio just went

[00:33.640 --> 00:44.440]  ice is not receded since 1979 in the yearly aggregate it expands in the
[00:44.440 --> 00:53.360]  winter the fall and winter it retracts in the spring and summer but overall the
[00:53.360 --> 01:04.080]  mass has not contracted via satellite readings since 1979 we're gonna be
[01:04.080 --> 01:09.880]  breaking down those findings coming up today there is so much off the chart
[01:09.880 --> 01:15.560]  news look at this story out of London telegraph I don't want to just cover
[01:15.560 --> 01:20.720]  this article though I want the crew to just type in or you the listeners do
[01:20.720 --> 01:30.040]  this as well screen time lower IQ or doctors warn of children and screen time
[01:30.040 --> 01:38.760]  or Steve Jobs wouldn't let children play with iPad there's the headline
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.960]  psychology today too much screen time damages the brain this has been known
[01:43.960 --> 01:52.040]  since the monkey studies in the 50s with televisions and it screws up your
[01:52.040 --> 01:56.160]  brain big time to where a lot of people now there's new disorders where they
[01:56.160 --> 02:02.160]  don't know how to walk properly or judge distance and you talk to young people
[02:02.160 --> 02:07.200]  that are on iPhones and iPads all the time and Lord knows they're great baby
[02:07.200 --> 02:14.960]  centers because they're mind-control devices it is a fact that the fluctuation
[02:14.960 --> 02:22.040]  rate that has been picked there's a spectrum globally puts you into a
[02:22.040 --> 02:28.080]  mesmerized near-sleep trance state you can look at the studies and just start
[02:28.080 --> 02:31.960]  printing everything guys because I didn't see this story this morning saw
[02:31.960 --> 02:34.720]  right before I went live on air and I want a whole stack because I don't want
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.200]  people saying oh that's just one study not only is it ending our families not
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.320]  only is it ending communication with other fellow humans not only is it a
[02:45.320 --> 02:54.080]  conduit for brainwashing when you add the weaponization of what's actually put
[02:54.080 --> 03:01.240]  into the programming it is startling I don't watch a lot of television I do
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.640]  watch movies I do monitor on YouTube aggregated clips of propaganda to be
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.960]  able to track it but the whole time I'm pulled back I'm consciously analyzing
[03:12.960 --> 03:25.320]  everything and second by second second by second I'm able to catch the
[03:25.320 --> 03:31.200]  subliminals because it they make me nauseated because my brain making my
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.200]  conscious brain be accessing my subconscious brain is very hard focus
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.040]  and it's basically like motion sickness and then I'll say okay there's
[03:41.040 --> 03:44.520]  subliminal in that let's slow this video down let's find out what's in there and
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.320]  sure enough you find it it could be kill the babies or upside down pentagrams or
[03:48.320 --> 03:52.840]  kill your children kill your family eat your children and we've done reports on
[03:52.840 --> 03:58.240]  this you think I'm joking just just look into it death death you want to die
[03:58.240 --> 04:04.280]  it's time to die submit don't protest Ron Paul's a meth head Alex Jones is
[04:04.280 --> 04:12.040]  racist Alex Jones thinks space aliens are with Elvis I mean the stuff I'm
[04:12.040 --> 04:17.040]  telling you is all real things we found so I'll be watching it but constantly
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.240]  making myself be conscious and it's it's it'll give you a headache and in a
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.640]  matter of minutes in fact I've learned why I pull these videos up that have
[04:26.640 --> 04:34.000]  both subliminal quasi subliminal and then overt propaganda a lot of times I
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.840]  study these I give them to the crew to play and then I don't play them because
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.520]  I'm willing to get burned to watch it in a conscious state but then I don't want
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.440]  to relive it but we're gonna play one of these ads I saw yesterday coming up
[04:48.440 --> 04:59.120]  it's pretty sick we'll be back we're gonna break it all down the day for the
[04:59.120 --> 05:03.120]  second time in a year Washington DC gun control laws have been struck down in
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.840]  court as unconstitutional the first law made it a criminal offense to carry
[05:07.840 --> 05:11.440]  guns you could own them you just couldn't take them out of the closet
[05:11.440 --> 05:17.560]  well actually it had to be a gun safe unconstitutional the right to keep and
[05:17.560 --> 05:23.400]  bear arms okay said DC you can carry but only with a permit you'll have to ask
[05:23.400 --> 05:28.040]  the police chiefs Kathy Lanier for permission and you have to have a quote
[05:28.040 --> 05:34.600]  good reason unquote or we won't give you permission unconstitutional it's a
[05:34.600 --> 05:40.120]  right of the people not a privilege granted by police chiefs plaintiff's
[05:40.120 --> 05:44.200]  lawyers have said that they will take it to the Supreme Court if necessary good
[05:44.200 --> 05:48.920]  because when you turn a God-given right into a government granted privilege
[05:48.920 --> 05:55.400]  they just might refuse you that privilege for no good reason this is

[08:08.160 --> 08:16.760]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[08:16.760 --> 08:30.240]  television is completely weaponized the medium of television and screen time
[08:30.240 --> 08:41.320]  itself has been globally now standardized on a micro second flash rate
[08:41.320 --> 08:50.440]  that is perfectly picked out of the spectrum to put you into a trance-like
[08:50.600 --> 09:02.560]  edge of sleep dazed comportment and that is a fact and so much of this has now
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.160]  come out today after the show so I can really lavish the documentation on it
[09:09.160 --> 09:14.440]  I'm going to shoot a special report for the nightly news on this subject the
[09:14.440 --> 09:21.160]  monkey studies all of it because what's declassified is over the top by the
[09:21.160 --> 09:28.800]  fifties they could make black and white television cause the majority of people
[09:28.800 --> 09:36.120]  in a room to pass out they could augment the flicker rate and cause the
[09:36.120 --> 09:43.520]  majority of people to have epileptic seizures now just like using poison on
[09:43.520 --> 09:46.280]  crops there's always going to be a certain percentage that are immune or
[09:46.280 --> 09:51.720]  resistant and they admit a lot of the studies and I'm going to go over some of
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.280]  them that some people actually become agitated under the programming I am one
[09:57.280 --> 10:09.720]  of them it does not make me submit it makes me very angry I'm not a scientist
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.000]  I've just studied what the scientists are up to and it's incredible and the
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.880]  reason I start the broadcast with us today is because we're in a science
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.560]  fiction movie as I've said thousands of times for real and it's being run by
[10:23.560 --> 10:31.600]  dystopians who wish to set up a system of total domination and control because
[10:31.600 --> 10:38.040]  it's their nature remember the old African saying no good deed goes
[10:38.040 --> 10:45.880]  unpunished well there's another one and of course it's the parable of the frog
[10:45.880 --> 10:52.640]  and the scorpion and the friendly frog is sitting there by the bank on a lily pad
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.280]  and the scorpion comes over to the edge and says you mind coming over here and
[10:56.280 --> 11:01.480]  carrying me across the river so I don't drown the frog says you'll sting me and
[11:01.480 --> 11:06.160]  kill me he says no I want to be friendly I want to be your friend please take me
[11:06.160 --> 11:17.160]  across the river across the creek and so the frog says alright if you promise and
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.720]  the scorpion climbs on the frog swims across with the scorpion on his back
[11:21.720 --> 11:27.240]  they get to the other side the scorpion says thank you how hits him with a
[11:27.240 --> 11:32.000]  stinger and the frog rolls over an incredible pain and says why did you do
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.840]  that and the scorpion says because I'm a scorpion
[11:40.560 --> 11:48.360]  why did scores of young beautiful 20 year old women 22 year old women 18 year
[11:48.360 --> 11:56.600]  old women why did they get in the car with Ted Bundy
[11:58.360 --> 12:07.320]  because he was confident he was handsome he wore a gray suit he found those are
[12:07.320 --> 12:13.040]  the most effective and most importantly he drove a non-threatening
[12:13.040 --> 12:20.800]  yellow Volkswagen just like Warren Buffett wears gray suits and is almost
[12:20.800 --> 12:24.960]  always photographed eating ice cream cones and making little smiley faces he
[12:24.960 --> 12:32.360]  is a mob boss ruler laundering hundreds of billions of narcotics money a year
[12:32.360 --> 12:40.840]  publicly he's involved and invested in merc squads prison industries every form
[12:40.840 --> 12:49.800]  of evil you can imagine but he's a nice old man no we have all been
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.840]  incrementally inducted from birth in an incremental system of total
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.640]  enslavement dehumanization and soul-sucking control and that isn't
[13:01.640 --> 13:09.760]  rhetoric that's real those words don't even rise for the reality and what set
[13:09.760 --> 13:15.200]  me off before I had all this other news today was this article out of London
[13:15.200 --> 13:22.480]  Telegraph call of duty increases risk of Alzheimer's disease now this isn't just
[13:22.480 --> 13:30.640]  one study it's every major study on screen time remember back in the early
[13:30.640 --> 13:42.880]  90s it happened in the US and Japan it was a test remember thousands of
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.360]  children in Japan having convulsions falling down in some cases knocking their
[13:48.360 --> 14:03.200]  teeth out biting their tongues off when the eyes flashed red on Pokemon cartoon
[14:03.200 --> 14:09.120]  this isn't a game people and it's not child's play and you wonder why most
[14:09.120 --> 14:11.560]  people can't wake up or can't get involved or even if they know they're
[14:11.560 --> 14:15.800]  being lied to they can't seem to do anything they are caught to use the
[14:15.800 --> 14:24.840]  allegory of the snake in the jungle book when he's trying to hypnotize people
[14:25.960 --> 14:33.640]  well I'll say this I'm no sheer con I'm not a predator but the snakes mesmer
[14:33.640 --> 14:39.480]  doesn't work on me if you're a new listener we have the New York Times on
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.920]  screen with the children going into convulsions they say 700 that was the
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.440]  documented cases it was thousands same thing was then done in the United
[14:48.440 --> 15:01.080]  States with other Pokemon cartoons the television is a weapon system when we
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.600]  put our videos on YouTube or other platforms that are HD they can put
[15:05.600 --> 15:13.320]  carrier waves over it that's why they're arrogant and don't care if we're on
[15:13.320 --> 15:22.440]  air the carrier waves have been discovered the carrier waves are in the
[15:22.440 --> 15:27.240]  news if you're a radio listener while I'm speaking they're putting articles on
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.560]  screen I didn't rehearse this with them they just search whatever I say and they
[15:31.560 --> 15:38.120]  find it hidden in plain view your televisions watch and listen to you
[15:38.120 --> 15:46.160]  with AI computer and I know you can't help it you've given your children
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.680]  iPads iPhones they'll shut up so you can enjoy dinner with your wife when you go
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.720]  out or you can watch your adult movie while they sit in there and watch
[15:54.720 --> 16:00.160]  theirs you are literally sacrificing them to the globalist and hey listen I get
[16:00.160 --> 16:09.120]  it at least though get an old-fashioned Nintendo Game Boy or something when you
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.360]  go on a road trip and don't give it to them till the seventh hour on the road
[16:13.360 --> 16:19.920]  absolutely restrict it it's probably better just to completely remove it out
[16:19.920 --> 16:27.360]  of their lives and then the other kids will see your children as weirdo Amish
[16:27.360 --> 16:33.560]  but the truth is you're only trying to protect them from this weaponized system
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.760]  and hey we jack into the matrix to communicate with you the proto matrix
[16:38.760 --> 16:44.400]  that's what this is the beginning of the insertion of humans into machines and
[16:44.400 --> 16:55.320]  the end of free will in the globalist own words you understand that the movie
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.760]  the matrix and it's in my book set the tyranny it's out of print it's online
[16:59.760 --> 17:06.800]  at prisonplanet.tv is from a 1970s document from the Pentagon
[17:06.800 --> 17:12.720]  declassified in 2001 by the American Federation of Scientists and then
[17:12.720 --> 17:19.600]  reclassified of how they would incrementally get us addicted to television
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.320]  then give us handheld computers with high-def screens then glasses then
[17:24.320 --> 17:29.920]  contacts then brain ports then the false reality will be so powerful that
[17:29.920 --> 17:37.040]  people will want to be fully inserted into it and you'll have a SIM that goes
[17:37.040 --> 17:45.200]  out and is allowed to have street fights is allowed to go into city sectors where
[17:45.200 --> 17:51.040]  crime is authorized so for excitement they're going to seduce everyone into
[17:51.040 --> 18:03.440]  this SIM wars it's going to be so inviting you think the matrix is seductive
[18:03.440 --> 18:17.360]  now wait until the real matrix launches and by the way I know Keanu Reeves on
[18:17.360 --> 18:21.720]  record everybody knows that and I know the folks involved with the matrix and
[18:21.720 --> 18:28.160]  I'm just gonna stop right there you need to understand that movie is in your
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.800]  face what they're planning you could say all that science fiction will ever
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.640]  happen really jet airplanes won't happen really every book ever published can
[18:37.640 --> 18:41.720]  now be stored on the head of a pin and they said 30 years ago they would be
[18:41.720 --> 18:49.400]  able to do that someday they did it when they get 10 or 15 top engineers
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.240]  together in a room they don't even know how everything perfectly works together
[18:53.240 --> 18:58.280]  with these new computers we've already lost control ladies and gentlemen and
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.680]  if we can't even admit that we've aborted 50 plus million of our fellow
[19:02.680 --> 19:08.640]  Americans and what is it half a billion people worldwide or more have been
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.920]  aborted if we can't even value ourselves stick a fork in us because we're done
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.160]  because if you don't recognize people that are addicted to video games some
[19:18.160 --> 19:21.960]  of them are here in the office they're good people they'll bow up when I say
[19:21.960 --> 19:25.360]  you know those video games are inducting you into a false reality and
[19:25.360 --> 19:31.800]  they're taking your free will and damaging your cerebral cortex they'll say
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.920]  you can have whatever opinion you want it's one of the few times I've seen two
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.800]  different video game heads here in the office kind of get upset with me hey

[24:24.280 --> 24:30.760]  is our future and I'm gonna explain to you again video games were invented in
[24:30.760 --> 24:38.720]  the 60s by the Pentagon to create unthinking killers instinctive shooters
[24:38.720 --> 24:42.920]  it's why the police are so effective now they're given the same military
[24:42.920 --> 24:50.040]  training thoughtless instinctive shooting and so when they go up against
[24:50.040 --> 24:53.960]  gangs and other criminals they just shoot them to pieces if it's a seriously
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.240]  trained police department because they've been given killer training it's
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.280]  just training it's like you can be trained to break somebody's neck and if
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.720]  you have the will to do it and don't think you just break their neck
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.960]  that's special just kind of the force to do it you break somebody's neck just
[25:12.960 --> 25:20.160]  like that break somebody's arm just like that shoot somebody just like that you
[25:20.160 --> 25:28.520]  don't think you kill well guess what while you're in these simulations I mean
[25:28.520 --> 25:32.520]  I see the ads for these video games be somebody command the future build your
[25:32.520 --> 25:38.040]  empire from your mother's basement designed to take men out of the game
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.440]  where you watch other men play sports or you play simulation sports and with it
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.480]  they're tracking everything you do watching everything you do recording and
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.840]  videotaping what you do with the Kinect systems and others on record Samsung
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.400]  TVs all of it we told you when they were first coming out with those six seven
[25:57.400 --> 26:04.360]  years ago that it could look through your walls with the sound sonar system and
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.000]  even watch you in bed on the toilet record everything you're saying then
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.760]  hackers listen to me and they went and they hacked into people's Kinects and
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.760]  Xboxes and videotaped them through multiple walls playing with themselves
[26:19.760 --> 26:28.880]  remember that the news it's not a game people it's not a game these are all
[26:28.880 --> 26:38.240]  composite eyes of the AI supercomputer that is as conscious as the day is long

[27:05.800 --> 27:10.840]  stealth aircraft and they cut to their latest one that's secret and there's a

[27:23.920 --> 27:30.480]  you on spending tens of billions of dollars a month on these systems when
[27:30.480 --> 27:37.680]  those planes are 25 to 40 years old and the real spy planes they've got and the
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.240]  real bombers they've got don't have humans flying them and that's for at
[27:41.240 --> 27:47.520]  least 15 years so see they'll be simulations and they'll be vestigial and
[27:47.520 --> 27:56.320]  ceremonial pilots on the planes and ceremonial pilots in the squadrons
[27:56.320 --> 28:04.600]  they're already giving awards to the drone pilots and now awards to the

[34:12.560 --> 34:19.440]  now all admit 20 years after I told you you're under attack to just because you
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.040]  play the game that you're part of the establishment and that you're powerful
[34:24.040 --> 34:27.800]  and that you're gonna come out on top because you've decided to join with the
[34:27.800 --> 34:32.760]  globalist you need to understand that most of you I've studied you are in
[34:32.760 --> 34:39.080]  denial you actually believe none of this tyranny is happening so you can then
[34:39.080 --> 34:44.760]  try to discredit our resistance to it like when I had Al Jazeera that's set
[34:44.760 --> 34:47.880]  to air today by the way we should track that on their big nightly news show
[34:47.880 --> 34:53.800]  they're doing a special across the country demonizing the libertarian right
[34:53.800 --> 34:57.280]  wing and saying that we're insane and believers about to be an imminent
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.440]  military invasion of Texas Utah and Southern California which we didn't say
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.200]  we said they're training to condition the public and the military to accept it
[35:06.200 --> 35:12.040]  and he'd look at me in with a straight face and say there is no gun control no
[35:12.040 --> 35:16.360]  one's coming after your guns guns have not been banned anywhere and I would
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.520]  give him examples and he would say no they haven't and would smile at me and
[35:20.520 --> 35:26.640]  then laughed after the interview and knew that it was all pure bull and all a
[35:26.640 --> 35:33.000]  big joke on reality just like when I had the host of ABC Nightly News here for a
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.520]  nightline piece he was doing I forget his name we can look him up shows how
[35:36.520 --> 35:41.160]  much the mainstream media has died that one of the main hosts of ABC Nightly
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.800]  News I don't even know his name I forget his name and he said there is no world
[35:45.800 --> 35:48.680]  government there is no move towards a corporate world government so I showed
[35:48.680 --> 35:55.280]  him Ron Paul quotes very Goldwater quotes quotes by then-president George
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.600]  Herbert Walker Bush back in the 90s and then at the time Prime Minister of
[36:00.600 --> 36:04.840]  England Gordon Brown and I showed him video clips as well he looked at me in
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.240]  that control room and said they're talking about a different world
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.120]  government that than you're talking about and I went no they're not and he
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.560]  laughed and he said well that's your opinion it's a game they play here's the
[36:19.560 --> 36:23.720]  deal your children are being hit with fluoride to brain damage them and give
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.240]  them bone cancer your children are being brain damaged by television you're
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.800]  being brain damaged by it we are being bombarded by high-frequency radiation
[36:32.800 --> 36:41.580]  pollution and it's part of a strategic long-term soft kill program that the
[36:41.580 --> 36:49.440]  Nazis adopted from international business machines
[36:50.080 --> 36:55.200]  who developed the computers that were used in the work camps to track how much
[36:55.200 --> 37:06.120]  people were fed or when they were executed and IBM today runs the Watson
[37:06.120 --> 37:16.600]  computers that are controlling when you get health care what prices you pay when
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.720]  you're put on a death list on a no-treat list we're already under this
[37:21.720 --> 37:28.840]  system where the doctors are told what to give you as an anesthesiologist what
[37:28.840 --> 37:37.080]  to give you in terms of surgery or what medications we're already having our
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.280]  free will our judgment removed from the equation police are gonna be nothing
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.280]  more than robots told every order what to do with live cameras on them at all
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.240]  times being directed and they'll be allowed to kill maim whatever it won't
[37:51.240 --> 38:01.080]  be to reform them but to fully automate them IBM launches Watson health global
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.160]  analytics cloud it's in the cloud
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.960]  mobilize your world AT&T I'm about to break that down but here it is call of
[38:13.960 --> 38:18.280]  duty increases risk of Alzheimer's scientists say players navigate the
[38:18.280 --> 38:25.000]  screen using a key area of the brain called the caudate nucleus which leads
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.680]  to loss of gray matter in the hippocampus previous studies have shown
[38:30.680 --> 38:37.240]  reduced volume in the brain which controls memory learning and emotion it's
[38:37.240 --> 38:39.960]  associated with neurological and psychological disorders including
[38:39.960 --> 38:47.240]  dementia and depression and the main reason that this is happening is not
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.960]  because you're just sedentary it's putting you into a sleep mode at a time
[38:51.960 --> 38:56.560]  that the rest of the brain's not lined up for sleep and it's got your brain doing
[38:56.560 --> 39:03.600]  unnatural things it's not meant to be doing and you're making these movements
[39:03.600 --> 39:08.600]  in your mind without connecting it to your body so it's virtual reality and
[39:08.600 --> 39:18.600]  it's creating all sorts of motor neuron control disconnects to the middle ear to
[39:18.600 --> 39:23.720]  your balance to everything just like reading in the car is unnatural for most
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.720]  people and you'll get nauseous doing it even if you're not really a person that
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.120]  has motion sickness you'll still get grumpy I noticed when I was a kid my
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.000]  mom was driving and my dad was reading he claimed he didn't get motion sick but
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.760]  man let me tell you that's about two hours we stopped or something to get
[39:39.760 --> 39:43.160]  gas you didn't want he was usually pretty nice you didn't want to give him any
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.440]  lip because he'd get out you'd have a headache he'd look around he'd be angry
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.520]  he wouldn't know why
[39:51.720 --> 39:57.840]  because what he was doing you're not designed to do it's unnatural and I'm
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.360]  not people say well you just need to adapt this is not being done to make us
[40:02.360 --> 40:07.400]  adapt this is being done to end us the IQs are dropping the cancer rates are
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.840]  exploding everything good is down everything bad is up this is scientific
[40:13.840 --> 40:21.320]  and now they're moving towards the full-time goggles now continuing call
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.400]  of duty previous studies have shown reduced volume in the hippocampus which
[40:25.400 --> 40:28.640]  controls memory learning and emotion it's associated with neurological and
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.480]  psychological disorders including dementia and depression what's fluoride
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.480]  do in the new big government studies out of England causes depression causes
[40:37.480 --> 40:44.240]  anger causes dementia causes early onset of Alzheimer's yeah when you drink
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.600]  poison that's used as bug killer it's not very good for you there's the
[40:49.600 --> 40:53.280]  headline let in telegraph fluoride drinking water may trigger depression and
[40:53.280 --> 41:00.320]  weight gain warren scientist there's no may about it so if you want your brain
[41:00.320 --> 41:10.400]  to be damaged if you want to be in a brain fog if you want to not function and
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.160]  have your own life and and be taught to be dehumanized I mean I know people that
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.520]  go out I know people in my life that I've lost who I never see anymore and when
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.680]  I do their zombies and you know what they do they go home and they watch their
[41:24.680 --> 41:28.640]  favorite TV shows and then they play video games and folks let's get something
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.280]  straight I go out sometimes to a place called pinballs that's got a bunch of
[41:33.280 --> 41:41.000]  pinball machines and video games and then it's a special event and studies
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.480]  have shown it's actually good for the brain a rarity once a month you're
[41:45.480 --> 41:54.120]  standing up you're driving the race car you're shifting the gears overall it's
[41:54.120 --> 41:59.560]  not bad for you a little of something bad can be good but if you're doing this
[41:59.560 --> 42:07.240]  an hour a day you are being hurt and it's understand it's not on accident it's
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.040]  all perfectly geared again I was allowed to the University of Texas
[42:11.040 --> 42:20.520]  Psychology Department into areas that are restricted I'll just leave it at that
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.120]  and they have a monkey farm out in Bastrop with thousands of primates at
[42:25.120 --> 42:31.160]  any one time one of the biggest in the country and they had DARPA programs with
[42:31.160 --> 42:37.280]  the monkeys trapped in and they euthanize them after a week with their
[42:37.280 --> 42:53.560]  brains trapped in and just studying still flicker rates DARPA CIA run trying to
[42:53.560 --> 43:02.320]  find that perfect sweet spot to make you go into a trance and submit it so now
[43:02.320 --> 43:05.440]  do you think I care when they get on the news and call me a cuckoo and a nut when
[43:05.440 --> 43:12.680]  I know all this it's like your victims to morons you're under psychological
[43:12.680 --> 43:25.680]  warfare attack and you need to be aware of it look at these headlines Steve Jobs
[43:25.680 --> 43:30.600]  didn't let his kids use iPads great matter too much screen time damages the
[43:30.600 --> 43:36.840]  brain psychology today no any screen time does smartphones iPads hurt toddlers
[43:36.840 --> 43:42.040]  ability to learn socialize what your brain looks like after a Netflix binge
[43:42.040 --> 43:49.680]  hubbing in post and what's it look like lower brainwaves forever the idiot box
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.560]  how it's turning us all into zombies it's been called the idiot box since the
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.600]  50s you ever sat there and look at your children when they're watching TV and
[43:59.600 --> 44:08.160]  their mouths are open they're like like the body snatchers or something there's
[44:08.160 --> 44:14.000]  parks there's rivers there's mountains there's there's you go join a boxing
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.280]  club as you jitsu club there's you could go join clubs that go out and look for
[44:19.280 --> 44:22.920]  fossils I mean there's just such an incredible universe around us but the
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.440]  globalists want us looking into the little universe they control where they
[44:26.440 --> 44:32.480]  can feed us all these false narratives and prey on the population and it's not
[44:32.480 --> 44:37.280]  just electronic brainwashing it's not just the flicker rate once you're in the
[44:37.280 --> 44:44.000]  mesmerized field once you're under the trance the literal trance once you're
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.880]  under a spell
[44:46.880 --> 44:59.440]  once you're in the flicker fusion threshold once you're under its control
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.240]  what does it do it takes wholesome images just like a block of cheese a
[45:04.240 --> 45:13.520]  slice of cheese a delicious cheddar on the mousetrap but the mouse doesn't know
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.360]  that it's about to get its neck broken and it goes over and it starts eating the
[45:18.360 --> 45:27.920]  cheese and it steps on that lever whap dead mouse but see they kill you with
[45:27.920 --> 45:31.680]  poison in the cheese and you go off and die a month later you go off and die ten
[45:31.680 --> 45:35.440]  years later and you don't even know what hits you and the computers are all in
[45:35.440 --> 45:45.200]  place run by the company that ran the Nazis IBM is now in full control of the
[45:45.200 --> 45:50.880]  global health algorithm and can block diagnoses can hide what's happening can
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.560]  control can discover when doctors are finding out about something can shut
[45:54.560 --> 46:01.280]  off funding because the Nazis we're going to take over the planet with the
[46:01.280 --> 46:06.040]  eugenics technology learned from the u.s. and england they were told they were
[46:06.040 --> 46:08.680]  going to be allowed to and they were set up and brought down doesn't mean they
[46:08.680 --> 46:14.600]  were good they were just set up this is all mainline nuremberg trials fluoride
[46:14.600 --> 46:17.920]  in the water all of it they were going to go in and put fluoride in the water
[46:17.920 --> 46:22.640]  they were going to engineer food and lace food they were already working on
[46:22.640 --> 46:27.720]  finding the genome they've been given all the cold springs harbour data and
[46:27.720 --> 46:30.160]  they brought them to Kaiserville Institute and they were going to
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.280]  engineer food that dumbed down and phased out the sub races as they called them
[46:35.280 --> 46:41.160]  that entire program has then been readopted back into the United States
[46:41.160 --> 46:48.000]  when 36,000 Nazis were brought over here after World War two a lot of them were
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.640]  just coming back to where they'd already been trained and they were put in
[46:52.640 --> 46:57.400]  command of all the major universities almost everyone they were put in
[46:57.400 --> 47:04.600]  control of all of NASA they were put in control of the CIA they were put into the
[47:04.600 --> 47:14.880]  FBI they were put into every division and not because they were the body of the
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.120]  Hydra they were just a loving sweet little head coming back to mommy to get
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.680]  milk it was a hurt little little head that had been kind of squashed but was
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.440]  only used to bring in the larger globalist program of soft kill and the
[47:29.440 --> 47:33.480]  cartoon Nazis and their thug uniforms everything was just how they'd been
[47:33.480 --> 47:38.400]  trained and set up by Lord Milner and others and it was like it's okay now we
[47:38.400 --> 47:42.520]  crushed you we're going to bring you home
[47:45.960 --> 47:53.240]  call it Cobra call it Specter call it Hydra it is the shadow global criminal
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.880]  network that are eugenicists I'm going to skip this network break this
[47:59.880 --> 48:03.720]  information is too important but but no more day I promise
[48:03.720 --> 48:09.560]  thank you so that's just one little article out of about
[48:09.560 --> 48:15.160]  exaggerate probably 150 200 here I don't know in fact at the end of the show
[48:15.160 --> 48:19.160]  today guys I want you to come in and count these articles just to see if I'm
[48:19.160 --> 48:27.360]  exaggerating here this stack right here this stack right here I bet is about 30
[48:27.360 --> 48:42.200]  articles 30 50 80 100 yeah let's put about 130 each one of them just just as
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.920]  incredible just as over the top just as revealing just as much in your face
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.080]  because they can be in your face now because it's all wide open they've got
[48:49.080 --> 48:57.400]  most the public in a trance state now speaking of what happens once you're in
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.400]  a trance state I saw this yesterday we were we had a DVR here at the office when
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.680]  I got here and then Rob do found let's not exaggerate I think more than ten
[49:07.680 --> 49:16.680]  others and everyone's the same men are lazy idiots
[49:16.680 --> 49:25.560]  trendies non-threatening trendies hipsters their women are in command and
[49:25.560 --> 49:36.120]  the women use smart grid mobilize your future your world apps to watch their
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.080]  husbands on cameras to open the doors to turn on the alarms and the men are
[49:41.080 --> 49:45.320]  basically absolute idiots now in all the ads I saw their trendies except for
[49:45.320 --> 49:50.880]  this one he's more of a football player type cool jock dad what every woman you
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.080]  know think she wants and she's real loving and sweet she makes the decisions
[49:55.080 --> 50:01.480]  though in the house which 80% of purchases are decided by women and it's
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.200]  been like that in every culture back at the hut back at the cave the men go out
[50:05.200 --> 50:11.280]  fight die bring down the big animals you know do all that come back and then
[50:11.280 --> 50:16.200]  trust their women because it's all part of the family it's one unit to raise the
[50:16.200 --> 50:26.280]  children but see now he doesn't raise the children the AT&T NSA run grid with
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.640]  the woman teamed up with the house slave because the Romans did this wasn't just in
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.560]  the south here where the black woman was brought in learned to read and write put
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.600]  in charge of a lot of the house affairs and then she kept the men down and would
[50:38.600 --> 50:43.520]  spy on them who would literally sleep on the dirt or in or in haystraw and would
[50:43.520 --> 50:50.840]  bend down to her that's from Roman manuals over 2,000 years old with their
[50:51.320 --> 50:59.240]  German and in Gaulish French slaves and their Austrian slaves and their I'll
[50:59.240 --> 51:09.440]  be on the slaves their British slaves their their pit slaves they bring the
[51:09.440 --> 51:14.360]  women in and they watch the other men and this is how it is this is our bondage
[51:14.360 --> 51:18.880]  and women have been told women know they go I am now with the state it is my
[51:18.880 --> 51:22.960]  friend it tells me I win all the movies show me as a hero now the men are down
[51:22.960 --> 51:28.880]  the fall of men is here that's right the fall of humankind is here we're going
[51:28.880 --> 51:34.560]  down we're on fire we're hit hard we're killing our babies it's one unit men and
[51:34.560 --> 51:37.960]  women together are the species as a team men have been turned into arrested
[51:37.960 --> 51:44.120]  development snot noses and the women go out and get an arrest development snot
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.360]  noses and they're not happy and turn them loose and go well then I want a
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.040]  woman who's butch because I'm looking for a man and the only role where somebody
[51:52.040 --> 51:57.520]  can be manly is if they are a janet Reno and so then they go and live
[51:57.520 --> 52:03.760]  together and create a husband and wife scenario with their own sex
[52:11.440 --> 52:16.560]  when you want to take out fire ants you the different systems to develop but
[52:16.560 --> 52:21.160]  they've got some that hit the sexual procreation sterilize them and see we've
[52:21.160 --> 52:27.400]  just been hit just as much as an alien spacecraft landed and took over our
[52:27.400 --> 52:30.840]  society through AI and was running all this I mean it might as well be that as
[52:30.840 --> 52:35.480]  I've said a hundred times it's that over the top and I want to air this ad here as
[52:35.480 --> 52:39.640]  we skip our own this is not paid next thing people the fake story will be
[52:39.640 --> 52:47.560]  that I'm running AT&T ads the point is that this is the brainwashing that
[52:47.560 --> 52:50.160]  they're engaged in I just think it's interesting that we're skipping our ads
[52:50.160 --> 52:58.320]  to play one of their ads where in every ad that we pulled up there's a whole
[52:58.320 --> 53:05.120]  series of these they're on YouTube I saw this on the weather channel yesterday
[53:05.120 --> 53:12.280]  morning that the man is a complete bumbling idiot but don't worry mama's
[53:12.280 --> 53:16.600]  got the AI computer mama's got the system watching him you know dad forgets to
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.040]  open the door for the dog sitter don't worry the computer will do it dad
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.440]  forgets to arm the alarm don't worry mom do it don't worry dad dad fall asleep on
[53:24.440 --> 53:29.880]  the couch and the kids are up mom is gonna you know big brother talk to see
[53:29.880 --> 53:35.760]  big brother's nice big brother's helpful and then he forgets you know turn the
[53:35.760 --> 53:42.400]  lights off well she does that but she loves him she says I love you and that's
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.920]  what they would do you know they describe it translated out of Latin into
[53:45.920 --> 53:50.600]  French then English that half the blacks would die when they were shipped over in
[53:50.600 --> 53:55.800]  a coffin ship they crammed so many down the bottom a lot of times the sailors
[53:55.800 --> 54:00.440]  would die in fact every mission about 10% would die as well just horrible that's
[54:00.440 --> 54:03.640]  how cheap life was and when they got there they said pick out whoever the
[54:03.640 --> 54:09.640]  leader is or people are looking to and basically beat him to death and then take
[54:09.640 --> 54:15.940]  a boy five six seven years old and whip them and tell the women through the
[54:15.940 --> 54:18.440]  translators that you'll have on the ship this is right when they get to the
[54:18.440 --> 54:27.840]  slave block in New York or wherever or Virginia beat them right there in front
[54:27.840 --> 54:31.680]  of them within an inch of their life and you tell them you keep these men in
[54:31.680 --> 54:36.760]  line or we're gonna kill them all that's they tell women today you keep your
[54:36.760 --> 54:40.840]  men in line if you want to be safe you do what the state says now within a few
[54:40.840 --> 54:45.800]  generations of that the women just hate the men and pray on them and this is our
[54:45.800 --> 54:50.880]  journey into total slavery this is this is who we are now and it doesn't matter
[54:50.880 --> 54:58.000]  what sitcom or what drama it is dads are bad dads are stupid dads are lazy
[54:58.640 --> 55:05.480]  unless they've got gay friends or unless they've married a minority and again I'm
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.800]  not even demonizing these messages the point is they're unified messages of
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.440]  social engineering and when you see these messages you need to understand
[55:13.440 --> 55:20.200]  you're not in Kansas anymore imagine every message is that men are bad every
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.520]  message is that men are no good and it's there to hurt women the main target who
[55:25.520 --> 55:33.400]  are the species women are the species and they convince them to love their
[55:33.400 --> 55:41.400]  slavery just like the uncle Tom in Django that's what our women have been
[55:41.400 --> 55:45.720]  taught to fight to the death of the state to thank the state for everything
[55:45.720 --> 55:50.800]  it does to him let's go ahead and and to think all their frustrations and
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.800]  problems are in the failed men who were raised to be failures by their mothers
[55:55.800 --> 56:12.800]  who were told to impact them into submission and to make them weak
[56:12.800 --> 56:15.960]  I remember being six years old walking on the back door with a double barrel
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.560]  12-gauge shotgun and a pistol holstered on my side six seven years old and my
[56:20.560 --> 56:24.520]  grandmother looking at me while she was sitting there cooking food going be safe
[56:24.520 --> 56:28.320]  sweetheart and she just looked down when she was cooking with pride she wanted a
[56:28.320 --> 56:36.560]  man she went a strong tribe she wanted her progeny to go to the stars not fail
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.920]  she was a real woman not these things we've got running around today and not
[56:40.920 --> 56:46.360]  these men these aren't men either where is your pride to stand against this
[56:46.360 --> 56:51.320]  women when every ad has men being crap what does that tell you about this
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.080]  system what it wants to do to us
[56:58.200 --> 57:05.040]  let's now go to the evil ad from a key and take in with your egg and the omelet
[57:05.040 --> 57:08.600]  for the king okay babe you got this right yeah that's a piece of cake I got
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.560]  this right good luck he doesn't work she does all right everybody got the bags
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.640]  and lunches and how do we get to your school keeping things under control is
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.800]  now easier than ever AT&T digital life home security and automation lets you

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.440]  and I don't blame him the problem is the overall globalist program is a future
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.280]  that doesn't need us the globalist have captured the world through fraud they
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.080]  set up a scientific control grid they believe we're profane and unworthy
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.040]  because we can't even comprehend it and they're now moving ahead with their
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:12.120]  plan and so I'm going to say this to ABC CBS NBC Fox everybody else that attacks
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:19.720]  me do you understand I am not of your world you understand that I'm not in
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:26.120]  your paradigm I'm outside of it I'm in the world not of it and by that I don't
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.720]  mean I'm Mr. Goodie two shoes and I'm out of the flesh because that's what
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.600]  brought me here and that's what I am I'm speaking of the fact that I know how
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.040]  real this is I know that you're sad victims of peer pressure and sad
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.600]  victims of social climbing and didn't have the opportunities I had didn't
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:50.400]  come from the people that I came from so I pity you the point you need to
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.240]  understand is that you are losing and you're being destroyed by your masters
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:02.160]  you are a joke and that's sad I wish you'd have the epiphany like Saul of
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.160]  Tarsus on the road to Damascus and I pray God lift the scales from your eyes I
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:16.720]  know why you're afraid just like V says I wouldn't blame you but when you get to
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.840]  the end of the road and you realize that it's an attack on goodness and
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.320]  wholesomeness and the genetic code of humanity and the planet itself and that
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.360]  it is an alien takeover alien doesn't have to come from the distant stars or
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:39.680]  from some interdimensional vortex scientists and corporations mad
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:46.280]  scientists are creating new life forms new abominations that in almost every
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:52.600]  case fundamentally attack and scar and do not coexist in any form of harmony
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:59.560]  with this jewel of a globe and then we are tortured with endless fake
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.360]  environmentalism to distract us and feel the vacuum of legitimate concern for the
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.440]  earth that we can feel the damage that's happening we can see it it's
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:19.120]  affecting us just as we're sick the earth is sick and then we have to sit there
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:26.840]  and watch the counterfeits who are the authors and the progenitors and the
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:38.280]  drivers of this coach that's being pulled by a thousand hellhounds
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.480]  unbelievable I mean if you just understand all this is going on and is
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:55.120]  planned if you just realize that it's all coming to a head and that we could
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.400]  reverse a lot of this and have this crash landing be a lot less horrible and
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.520]  have a face-to-face debate with the globalist I'll never forget Gary Hart

[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.040]  that they fixed the gold and silver market using paper naked shorts to keep
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.560]  the price down and what the insiders told me a decade ago is true from the US
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.200]  vaults to other major vaults they've got tungsten coated with gold it weighs the
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.160]  same amount roughly and it's fake gold they're using fake gold that they then
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.200]  sell to each other never even leaves the vault back and forth is right on the
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:32.320]  price tungsten and they can buy up everything and sign us on to 2.2
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:39.160]  globally 2.2 quadrillion that's 2200 trillion that's not our debt they've
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:44.960]  signed the US on to half of that it was 1.5 billion in 2008 when they pulled
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.480]  their last game oh and we shouldn't be concerned about military drills all over
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.320]  and saying with tea parties their enemy and Christians of the enemy and
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  Fort Hood general commanding general telling the troops you'll be court
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.080]  marshal if you are evangelical Christian or part of the tea party ending free
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.000]  association in America oh no we shouldn't be concerned there's nothing
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.440]  going on the president is unilaterally open the borders and is paying to bring
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:16.360]  people in and the board patrol quote completes the smuggling process so with
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  all of that backdrop look at this New York City there's no inflation fights
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.840]  breakout over $30 hot dogs at ground zero it's now a sickening tourist
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:35.960]  attraction and again call of duty major study video games cause brain
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.960]  damage yeah I don't I don't need a study to know that these people that are
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.560]  video game heads just aren't there they're just into themselves they go
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.280]  with their little thing they go back and then and then you always hear about
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.840]  like some 35 year old guy that doesn't even smoke having an aneurysm because
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:16:00.200]  they played you know 10 hours of video games a day they're dead already now
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.760]  Jacarie Jackson tomorrow is going to be leading we're on our guest is going to be

[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:38.160]  speech rally Planned Parenthood has been caught trying to pass legislation
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:48.160]  different states restrict free speech they target on record black people 50 plus
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.520]  percent of blacks whenever born in this country it's as high as 70 percent in some
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:58.200]  major cities blacks are 30 percent of the population and so this is our black
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.880]  lives matter protest to take over the George Soros meme it's about getting
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.840]  racial division going and infighting to ignore the fact that we have double
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.880]  digit unemployment the black community we're gonna be out there and I'm gonna
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.360]  be covering it live tomorrow checking in with Jacarie please join him tomorrow I
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.320]  want to see a hundred people out there we're only spending a few days you know
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.280]  promoting this because we had the idea we're doing it take photos share it on
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.680]  Twitter share our YouTube videos this won't save the world but I guarantee it's
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.800]  gonna save some lives I guarantee us some women are gonna see us out there and
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.120]  are gonna know that they can in fact we should print off some of the charities
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.480]  that are out there that actually take care of one when they're pregnant even pay
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.040]  them to have the baby in fact I just thought of that we should print off some
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.240]  of those foundations I'm not associated with them they got Catholic and other
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.480]  Christian groups and we should hand those out and probably maybe save some
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.680]  lives tomorrow or at least let the women know hey they're not gonna tell you
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.260]  inside people pay to take care of that baby you can adopt it there are more
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.960]  people want to adopt babies every year than are aboard in this country and I
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.720]  always say this cliche nobody wants black babies that's a load of bulls then
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.040]  they got liberal groups arguing to make sure that white Christian families can
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.320]  adopt black babies yeah it's better to cut them up sell sell their body parts
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.480]  for Pepsi flavoring pretty sick pastor clenard children's with us the rest of

[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:32.920]  using I think it's a God given thing certainly it's not a pro-life marketing
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.960]  scheme but this is certainly connecting the dots in the African-American
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:44.200]  community the few times we've gone out with this the project itself it has
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:50.840]  opened up the eyes of so many students and so black life matters is a gift from
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.600]  God and I applaud what you're doing there in Austin. Well we didn't even know
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.240]  that it was you know our separate idea that came from one of the writers

[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.920]  pastors I mean you may know who they are might be you I was just being told

[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.240]  three or four guests on about the Second Amendment or three or four guests on

[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.680]  happening in that fight when I said get past your clenard children's son we've
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.880]  interviewed for films how many news probably been on this radio show ten
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:42.800]  times or more I just wanted to talk about abortion where the fight is get some
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.280]  updates talk about black lives matter I had Mark Crutcher of life dynamics news
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:54.400]  on yesterday and he was saying and then they mentioned earlier yeah I heard
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.120]  there's some other groups doing this black lives matter and I hadn't looked
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:06.840]  it up yet and then I just posited I said hey maybe you're involved to the
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.560]  pastor and sure enough because I was putting two and two together what state
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.440]  he's in sure enough he's the one doing it so it just shows how we all have these
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:19.120]  ideas separately and how that's the gift that God gives us that we're all on the
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.040]  same page it's really magic but I briefly wanted to bring in Mikhail failing
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.680]  just for 30 seconds Mikhail was about two weeks ago and I just wanted to ask
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.680]  you this was separately your idea about hey black lives matter we should talk
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.880]  about abortion and you wrote some articles about it not knowing that
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.480]  Reverend shoulders was already doing it that is so exciting briefly tell us
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.680]  about your idea yeah well I'm a big fan of his moth a 21 documentary it's really
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.880]  really powerful and so you know black lives matter has been in the news and
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.000]  it just came to me I thought man yeah black lives matter but you know abortion
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.080]  is such a thing that's targeted on their community with you know over 78% of
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.040]  abortion clinics in Borbac communities and of course the history of Margaret
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:04.920]  Sanger so it just seems something obvious to do absolutely now without further
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.320]  ado I'm gonna give pastor shoulders the floor during the short segment in the
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.000]  next segment coming up tell us about how you come up with this idea what you've
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.120]  done the success you've had and then let's break down the current black
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.480]  genocide program going on how that war is going for the globalist well right
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.320]  now your program does such an excellent job first of all I want to let you
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:32.160]  listeners know black life matters is something that some entity whether it be
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:38.800]  government or anarchists whoever they plan to market this to cause unrest in
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.480]  the African-American community especially in the inner cities I don't know a lot
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.840]  about it but in my travels I noticed that this was very orchestrated and
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.240]  seemingly these groups came out of nowhere carrying this mantra but of
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:58.880]  course we've been saying black life matters since I've been involved in the
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.560]  pro-life movement and others since 1973 and I knew it was something too that God
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:13.120]  would use these tragic situations with Eric Garner with Mike Brown and Trayvon
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.680]  Martin to bring about an awareness in the African-American community I was
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.600]  getting emotional a little bit listening to your testimony not knowing that I
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.840]  was attached to it and this young man because I told Greg Cunningham of Center
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.840]  for Biographical Reform who we who called me on the phone at the same time I'm
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.760]  saying somebody needs to take black life matters to on another level and market
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:45.360]  use guerrilla marketing use what they're using dollars to push when we went to the
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:51.840]  Fayetteville State College that month was April and what was on Time Magazine
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:58.560]  black life matters that was the front page of Time Magazine so the kids had
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.000]  already been saturated with this saying and so when we came out with black life
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:12.400]  matters and showed a baby next to aborted fetuses and saying all black life
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:19.120]  matters they connected with it and then we had other signs that basically kind
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:26.480]  of showed that abortion suppresses the black vote and that killed the
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:33.360]  administration's attack on us from being on campus that this wasn't trying to
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.140]  merchandise them or use them politically we were concerned about their
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:43.800]  empowerment and so it really caused the students to have absolutely great
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.840]  conversations I was I was so surprised that you were doing that rally when you
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:57.480]  called I I said to myself gosh others are running with this this is I was so
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.960]  excited learning that you were doing this before us it just meant that it was
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.080]  meant to happen and that people were connecting the dots to all this but look
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.080]  at the university trying to claim that you couldn't come on claiming you were
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.320]  promoting your ministry so what anybody if students invite you should be able to
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.040]  come on a university well Planned Parenthood showed up while we were there
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.920]  they are so systemically entrenched in the educational in academia and I learned
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.600]  later while on campus that Fayetteville State College pays for the first
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.760]  abortion for any young lady incredible stay there I'm gonna give you the
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.200]  forum we come back to break this down all black lives matter all lives matter

[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:25.120]  angry and elected Democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.480]  parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:35.680]  interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition of crazy is
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:41.160]  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results

[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.680]  today he's been with us Reverend Childress you got the floor to break down
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.280]  your black lives really do matter all black lives matter absolutely they're
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.160]  they're hijacking the crisis in a community to try to create political
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.760]  division you're just taking it back and and pointing it out so I do use the
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:29.920]  word that we're re-hijacking it away but break down currently what's happening
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.000]  again black genocide.org and let's get into the real black genocide the
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.840]  targeting by the Klan by the Nazis by Planned Parenthood by the Rockefellers
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.860]  of black people we're not just saying hey this is killing half of you this is
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:53.100]  really going on go ahead absolutely right here in the city of New York over
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:39:00.480]  65% of all African-American births in an abortion is more aborted than there is
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:08.680]  born alive nationally 1,786 a day and you're saying it's time to fight back
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:15.240]  we really try to incite the church to fight back when 52% nationally of all
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:21.040]  African-American births in an abortion the church has been far too silent the
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:27.440]  shedding of innocent blood pollutes the land every preacher should understand
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.280]  that if he's sowing seed and the land is polluted then he's not going to get the
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.160]  return and this is what's happening in America we are about to enter into a
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:43.440]  period of judgment directly from this the shedding of innocent blood and as you
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.280]  see how we were all connected on this black life matters it appears to me
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.800]  that God is not pleased with our efforts and I'm a self-included of really
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.600]  taking this to the level to get into the black community so this was a gift to
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.720]  us that they're marketing it and we're using guerrilla marketing and taking it
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.520]  over and it has been quite effective there's not a student on any college
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.520]  campus that hasn't heard black life matters especially if they're African
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.400]  Americans so we're going to the HSBCs the historically black colleges we're
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.000]  setting up we're going to connect them with Facebook we're going to connect
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.960]  them let them to know there's another chapter in other black colleges this has
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:36.480]  not been done it needed it needs to be done and African-American leadership it's
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.120]  not where it should be but it's beginning to wake up and recognize that
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:47.160]  basically that the perceived African-American leadership has victimized
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:53.480]  them it was great when in Ferguson where Jesse Jackson was booed out so he
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:58.320]  couldn't take up an offering this is something that the African-Americans are
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:05.400]  beginning to wake up on but we have to be more diligent and the statistics prove
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:12.160]  out that we haven't done our job as preachers especially so we plan to take
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:19.800]  this not only to HSBC but we plan to be at the NAACP in July in Philadelphia and
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:26.400]  we'll be there for three days with those signs and I am sure is going to cause
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:34.160]  quite a stir because basically they'll have seminars inside saying black life
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.120]  matters well we're going to have our signs outside all black life matters and
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.160]  if there's anyone who has been facilitating the destination of the
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.960]  African-American community by abortion it has been the NAACP and profiting from
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:55.480]  it and merchandising their own constituency so we're this is what I do is
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:01.360]  seemingly this is where God has me to labor in and we're excited that we're
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.000]  beginning to connect with other pastors actually this has this season this time
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.960]  has been a fruitful time to let them to see that indeed black leadership
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.520]  basically has sold them out you had Robin Kelly of the Congressional Black
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.760]  Caucus I think from Michigan actually partnering with Planned Parenthood and
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.880]  the seminar was about this is a congresswoman the seminar was about how to
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:36.320]  get Planned Parenthood into more African-American communities when the
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.000]  young man there on the program put out that there's a disproportionate amount
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  of them by design folks this is all systemic this is all by design we just
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.200]  have to recognize and acknowledge that but I was listening to your program
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:59.960]  previously the day they're running test runs on basically on okay causing chaos
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.600]  in the urban community and this was a part of that how it was going to all
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:12.360]  unfold I do not know but I this I do know that there is a concerted effort to
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.320]  begin to cause unrest in the African-American communities in the
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.880]  city possibly to bring about martial law possibly to bring about control I
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.440]  don't know well I'll tell you this I mean I mean just in a moment for just a
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:30.560]  moment with Reverend Childress here Alex Jones popping in if you just joined us
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.480]  obviously why we're launching this why you launched this back in February is we
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.840]  can take over this destructive White House George Soros funded
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:45.840]  Balkanization divide and conquer movement and we can then try to get other
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.080]  people around the country to have their own black lives you really do matter
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.520]  events to educate people and it's possible we could turn the tide and show
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:58.440]  people where the real problem is and explain that the mainstream media is
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.880]  trying to distract black Americans African-Americans from double
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:08.200]  unemployment since Obama got in to the open borders is placing their jobs to
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.960]  be targeted with abortion and show the MSNBC strategy is to keep blacks on the
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.680]  Democratic Party plantation sorry guys that without question and fortunately
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.400]  the younger generation is beginning to give an ear and that has been exciting
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:30.040]  and that has been something that has been motivating us and I believe this
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.680]  time next year or a year from now they will regret ever coming up with that
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:40.040]  mantra black life matters because we're going to expose them for who they are
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.920]  that all black life matters and congressional black caucus the one
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:50.040]  of the biggest problems that black people have the NAACP of the National
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:57.120]  Action Committee the Rainbow Coalition all are intertwined in this they're all
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.360]  in agreement of carrying on this deception in the black community but
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:08.920]  their biggest mistake will be having use this as a means of communicating their
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:16.400]  cause it is going to elevate our cause and expose the genocide systemic
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.080]  genocide in the african-american community the targeting of the african-american
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.880]  community I'm sure you basically realize it was like I believe it was once
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.960]  again a test run I think they're testing to see what they're doing but to
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:35.480]  actually nominate a Margaret Sanger to be on the $20 bill I believe they did
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.720]  that just to see the response and how it would be you know I've forgotten about
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.600]  that she's been time magazine woman of the year just a decade ago or something
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.160]  after she was dead she'd been time magazine when she was alive this is a
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.960]  literal hardcore racist who gave awards to Nazis got awards and they're saying
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:59.280]  put her on the dollar bill or the 20 under $20 bill you know I don't have
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.560]  the platform I would love to have but we were yelling and screaming and I was
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:08.640]  writing many of the black media saying that this is an outrage in the age of
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.800]  political correctness you know the this comments that this woman has made her
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:19.080]  own words and you're going to suggest her to be on the $20 bill it was
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.640]  outrageous but you know something the game is this if we if they can flood us
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:32.080]  at one time with so many different issues and problems we become desensitized
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:38.320]  to outrage and that's where the church has lost his power there is no outrage
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.280]  in the church any longer over these blatant atrocities these blatant
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:49.920]  deceptions these blatant criminal acts I'm saying and in my radio I do a little
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:54.520]  radio program and it went off I guess but I'm saying myself how in this day and
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:00.760]  age is Hillary Clinton a viable candidate with all of that is being
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.960]  exposed at one time if it's not the servers if it's not email if it's not
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:13.480]  Benghazi if it's not foreign diplomats giving to her foundation but yet this is
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.720]  the this is what this is a candidate basically especially the African
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:24.040]  Americans who 90 the 95% support Democrat candidates this is the person
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:31.560]  and yet she is defending accepting the Hillary of the Margaret Sanger award
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.680]  boldly accepting us and yet she's going to ask and court the black vote it's
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.480]  like I'm living in the twilight zone I don't understand but it's like we're
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.920]  just being totally it's like the frog in the in the water right Reverend
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:50.000]  black genocide.org let's expand on this for a moment because you're quite
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.920]  a historian on these facts for people that don't know break down I mean it's
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.560]  on record how the Rockefeller Foundation Margaret Sanger and others totally
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.440]  changed the black community went in bought off a bunch of preachers and
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.000]  because they said blacks don't you know trust us but they'll they'll trust black
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.120]  preachers I mean these are letters that she sent as you know to the Colgate
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.000]  Foundation and there's letters back and forth they were giving her money and it's
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.760]  her whole battle plan you look at it today and I'm not saying that the
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.040]  Republicans are great either but the Democrats were the party of the Klan
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.640]  when they couldn't get blacks to believe many more they flipped and said oh we
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.600]  love you look what's happened to the black community since they adopted
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.600]  everything with Democrats wanted it's just totally insane that they've gotten
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.960]  away with this it's just crazy talk some about that well you know the most
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.040]  diabolical part of that it was called a Negro project is that Margaret Sanger
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:50.200]  seems a very evil woman but she was very discerning and she said in order to
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:56.520]  control the black community we have to get the colored minister with with the
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:01.920]  high communicative skills in other words community organizers that we would buy
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:08.080]  out and it is no surprise you listeners to understand that Barack Obama did
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.160]  fundraising events for Planned Parenthood before he was president of the
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:19.280]  United States he was the prototypical person of the Negro project plan and
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.680]  that led her to Clarence Gamble of a proctoring gamble so we got to understand
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.920]  that she also recognized that if she can control the ministers she would be able
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.000]  to control the african-american community to accept abortion as a means
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.600]  basically of birth control and that was that was her goal and so and you
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.600]  mentioned this is a woman who tutored Adolf Hitler who had ties up
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.360]  Philip Stoddard was on her board constantly went back and forth from the
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.760]  third right communicating when they changed the name from the birth control
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:02.320]  league it was to Planned Parenthood nobody left the staff was the same the
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:07.240]  heads were the same they just changed the name and the ideology sure has not
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.720]  changed sure and I may have made a mistake earlier but I can flay things now
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.720]  I'm going back in memory I know it was proctoring gamble letters but then also
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.080]  Colgate Foundation was involved somehow correct me if I'm wrong I'm just going
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:30.480]  from memory no I very well very well may be I didn't check that out he was the
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.920]  heir of proctoring gambles there so it Colgate may have been involved also but
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.640]  I'm gonna check into it make sure my memory is not faulty I want to come
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.480]  back though as I mentioned this once almost embarrassed because it sounded
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.320]  like pure bull and you went of course I hear that all the time I want to talk
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.240]  about when I was going to pro-life rallies a lot 16 70 and 18 years ago on
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:55.120]  access TV the local black leaders had shows down there and they literally said
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.920]  the most amazing things to me I want to repeat when we come back communist China
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.920]  freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US politicians
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:07.800]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor does that sound right to you

[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:16.760]  so access TV was started in Austin Texas like 37 38 years ago they just had the
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:25.240]  anniversary few years ago and that's where I started out in 1995 but the
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:30.040]  black community was really using it and probably had half of the shows on there
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:34.840]  some of them really good some I'm really boring a lot of preachers you name it but
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:38.080]  they had a lot of the community organizer people in there that drove like
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:46.640]  very nice Mercedes Benz I mean late models newer models and nice suits
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.400]  everything and man they hated my guts and when I started really doing a lot of
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.560]  pro-life stuff a few years into it and talk about you know black genocide and
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:59.280]  things like that they would actually get in my face in the hallways these are
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.760]  guys you'd see on the news guys you'd see you know at the city council and
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.400]  stuff and then they would file complaints on me and say I'd called into
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.200]  their show and called in the n-word and I was pretty sure as I sort of watching
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:13.440]  the tapes of it they were having people call in and then say they were Alex Jones
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:18.000]  and one time one of the guys confronted me and there's like a gray-haired you
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  know black man he goes sharp breasts well-spoken whole nine yards he goes
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.720]  listen here we're sick of your crap me to get rid of these you know these poor
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.840]  scum black people I forget the words he used I think it was pretty nice this is
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.200]  a long time ago and then that happened to me a few other times where I'd be
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.160]  demonstrating at a Planned Parenthood or wherever covering it and black people
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.400]  walk over and say there's too many black people need to get rid of these people
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:47.040]  and then now we have videos of Asian abortionist black abortionist saying
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.800]  similar things and I would tell people those stories but it just sounded
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.720]  insane and now I learned from talking to other black leaders around the country
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.680]  that are pro-life that they get the same thing so these are people that knowingly
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:05.360]  are getting money to get rid of their people and they hate them and it's like
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:10.680]  bizarre it's like the most hardcore clan member but it's a black liberal on TV
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.440]  talking how much they love black people and behind the scenes they're like
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:20.680]  nobody wants these nappy head in words and you need to shut your mouth and you're
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:28.760]  just like what I mean how do you hate your people I mean if one of us being
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:34.320]  paid to get white people to kill I can hardly even talk about it because it's
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.720]  so insane it's so demonic I want to keep you five more minutes the next segment
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.600]  to cover other issues and I want to put on screen for TV viewers a famous photo
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.480]  of Margaret Sanger addressing the Ku Klux Klan we're gonna have big signs of
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.080]  these out tomorrow at the main Planned Parenthood in Austin's a huge facility
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.840]  exposing this this witch and I'm sorry I'm ranting Reverend Childress a black
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.320]  genocide.org it's just that bringing up those memories I was actually having
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.000]  flashbacks to all the horrible things these two guys pulled on me and how
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.360]  much they hated me because I didn't want to abort babies I mean it's crazy what
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:13.440]  do you say to those stories have you experienced similar things oh absolutely
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:19.600]  and not only that it's it becomes very much a part of their makeup and character
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:27.640]  because they're also monetarily being fed by the pro-woman pro-bort the Planned
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:36.120]  Parenthood as I stated in the plan for then it was black people well they've
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.920]  never said that but their actions would say that I mean they talk about the

[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.440]  too evil and it doesn't surprise me that these black ministers who were

[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.560]  I think I'm gonna send a tweet out here in a moment when we go to break top
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:22.840]  liberal caught meeting with the Klan and then say yeah here she is back in the
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:28.400]  40s Margaret Sanger we'll put that image back on screen see that's the way you
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.400]  got to get people to look at it because they just go all-time magazine says
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.280]  she's the great feminist no she was who Hitler admired and who he got his
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:38.640]  marching orders from on eugenics now we only got three to four minutes to break
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:41.760]  I'm gonna get Reverend Childress the floor to finish up I know I've been
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.680]  ranting but other key things folks should know about I want to encourage you
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.240]  sir to continue what you're doing for folks to support you for you to continue
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.720]  your radio show to do more YouTube videos and for other people to do it as
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.720]  well we've all got to fight people are ready to be awakened you have the floor
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.360]  of the last three minutes Reverend Childress yes and I just want to say
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:06.320]  again that your program you you gotta you know people should support people
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.000]  should get behind do whatever we can to support medium such as this because you
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.200]  mentioned groups like Rockefeller Carnegie and Mellon the Colgate Proctor
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:25.720]  and Gamble PBS is supported by these people and so if you want to have my
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:32.080]  offer 21 on PBS it'll never happen because there's they it exposes these
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:38.040]  foundations for the things of very eugenic present and past background so
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:42.280]  there's very few mediums that really want to talk about black genocide in
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:48.640]  eugenics and we'll do it objectively and so I thank God for your program I pray
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.800]  that you continue doing what you're doing and and just thankful for the
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.640]  spiritual connection that we've had and when it comes to black life matters if
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.280]  people want to support what we're doing you can go to the website our mailing
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:07.640]  addresses on there but everyone can do something you may not do what I do but
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:13.920]  there's something we can do to expose this darkness America needs to
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:21.200]  recognize that we have 56 million babies whose blood is crying out from the
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:27.920]  ground and after a while God visits innocent blood and he asked the
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.720]  question where is your brother and so we're going to be posed with that
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.920]  question sometime in the near future and our hearts need to be able to say
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:42.200]  we've done everything we can within the scope and within the resources that we
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:48.680]  have to stop this genocide to stop and yes all black life matters I believe I
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:55.560]  probably save more white babies and then then black but our focus is on the
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:00.120]  african-american community and the deception that has been carried by
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:04.280]  african-american leadership which has been disgraceful they are guilty of
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.520]  gross negligence of the worst kind and we're going to continue to expose it as
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:13.680]  much as we possibly can and I'll be praying for that rally on in Austin on
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:18.840]  tomorrow grateful for that effort and I pray that this is something as I've it
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  has proven it connects the dots especially with those students so
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:30.040]  please well thank you sir and it's a 201 East Bend white tomorrow 11 to 2 and

[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:08.680]  families I played a AT&T ad where the dad is a bumbling idiot and the mother
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.760]  watches him with surveillance cameras and automated locks he's basically a
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:17.720]  prisoner and all their ads we're gonna have a special report tomorrow I'm gonna

[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.360]  10 ads I saw 10 up on a screen and do showed me a few of them every one of
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:33.960]  them the men are bumbling idiots this is education this is reeducation kind of
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.160]  like Hillary's fun camps I was telling some family this weekend about Hillary
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:43.440]  giving a speech a few months ago saying we need to send men to fun camps and they
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.680]  said she didn't say that so I pulled the clip up yeah she said that crimes of the
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.800]  educators how utopians are using government schools to destroy Americans
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:10:00.720]  children Samuel Lumenfeld and Alex Newman and Alex Newman writes for the new

[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.240]  like Alex Newman who keeps breaking huge stories and helping fight the
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.760]  globalist and you get a book that you can donate to your library after you
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:41.800]  read it or give to the teachers at your local school because the average
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.000]  teacher doesn't understand why everything's failing well now they want
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.200]  to corporatize education and bring in quote the reform that's just globalist
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:52.600]  standardize as bad as the public schools are there's a larger plan behind that as
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:59.040]  well so crimes of the educators a compelling case in America's public
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.760]  education system must undergo radical change Ron Paul former congressman and
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:06.600]  presidential candidate had to say that that's on the cover show Alex Newman
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:12.840]  joins us but before we go any further obviously Alex the propaganda has gone
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:18.680]  from being a 10 to an 11 to quote spinal tap but why don't you just make the
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:22.200]  whole dial you know actually just go up to ten and it's higher but it goes to
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:27.480]  eleven they are at about a hundred and ten percent right now I think they're
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.800]  overheating I think it's causing a backlash and the globalist aren't that
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.760]  stupid but but still we said the bin Laden raid was fake and now siers has
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:40.760]  come out and said a bunch of it's not true and the CIA has been caught zero
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:48.800]  dark 30 is again total fiction it's truly over the top as I said and now they've
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.920]  just released a bunch of new fake bin Laden documents to counter all that
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:56.040]  right as they're trying to reauthorize the Patriot Act Senator Rand Paul I'm
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:01.720]  told has begun his filibuster so we'll look into that and monitor that as it
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:06.800]  unfolds but Rand Paul filibuster Patriot Act renewal this is going on right now
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:10.840]  he took the Senate Florida filibuster the renewal the Patriot Act a Bush
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.040]  administration error law enables it and again I was just told about this I knew
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.980]  he was gonna filibuster it did he already finish was it going on and no one
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:23.400]  covered it so I didn't know no this was just sent out okay he says I've just
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.880]  taken the Senate Florida begin to filibuster the Patriot Act renewal
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:33.160]  it's time to end the NSA spying and that was put out just a little while ago so
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:37.200]  we have C-span in there in the control room let's pipe some of that in here
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:44.720]  guys as quickly as possible I know it's in the other control room so we're gonna
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:50.520]  do that thank you let's go ahead and go to Alex Newman now Alex you kind of
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:54.040]  heard that intro rant there so much is happening in the world I want to get
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:59.480]  into your book but how it fits into the larger picture what do you think about
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.160]  just the rollout of yeah you're not gonna drive your car in the future we're
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:08.480]  gonna tax you yeah men are bad families are bad world government's good it just
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:13.200]  seems to all be over the top now question about it Alex and actually so
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.000]  much of the stuff that you're talking about right now is directly related to
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.280]  what we're covering in the book NSA spying to give you an example the
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.120]  Department of Education now under the guise of improving education is actually
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.840]  setting up massive dossiers on every student in the country in the government
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:32.800]  schools including information that parents wouldn't imagine in their wildest
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:38.040]  streams we're talking political beliefs attitudes values views and you know this
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:41.280]  is gonna get even more extreme as they continue rolling out this crazy
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:46.360]  technology facial symbol recognition cameras and this is all being funded by
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:49.720]  the Department of Education then before you were talking about Planned
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:54.160]  Parenthood and the eugenicists and their role in eugenics and actually we have
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.480]  two chapters in the book dedicated to the role of eugenicists in dumbing down
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.200]  and and really harming the black community and black people in this
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:07.120]  country and it all kind of ties together the propaganda is beginning in
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:10.440]  government schools now they're pushing for it earlier and earlier and the
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:14.160]  biggest crime that we talk about in the book they're actually preventing
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.520]  children from learning how to read so you won't even be able to bypass the
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:22.200]  propaganda get a book get a Bible get the Constitution get the Declaration
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.880]  of Independence and read it because they're teaching the children to read
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.400]  using faulty methods that have known have been known to be quackery since the
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:33.280]  1840s when they were developed this whole word method they're trying to get
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:36.800]  rid of phonics completely out of the government schools and replace it with
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:42.120]  this whole word looks a site method that literally creates a lifelong reading
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.400]  disability in children now before John Dewey had this introduced into all the
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:49.920]  teaching colleges and then into all the government schools America was the most
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.880]  literate society on the planet even going back to the days of the founding
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:56.640]  fathers everybody knew how to read it was essential because people needed to
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.560]  read their Constitution and their Bible and their history and all of that and
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:04.080]  John Dewey a socialist and a globalist and a humanist set out to destroy all
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:08.600]  that for the purpose of transforming America from a free market capitalist
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:13.640]  that free constitutional republic into a collectivist utopia and he said that's
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.240]  what he was doing so this is a gigantic criminal enterprise masquerading as a
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.800]  government school system and it's deliberately dumbing down the children
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.160]  and the numbers show this the federal government did a literacy survey in
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:31.360]  1993 they said 55% of Americans can barely read this is crazy my five-year-old
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:35.240]  can read after a few weeks of reading lessons using phonics so something is
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.120]  seriously rotten in the schools and it all comes together with the globalist
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:44.800]  and the big government scheming to enslave the American people
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.960]  investigative journalist educator Alex Newman joins us and if you go back to
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:55.240]  the different banking associations and groups in the 1890s and stuff that I've
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:57.640]  seen the documents I've covered them on air I've seen them in books on
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:02.320]  education they were saying we've got too many smart people and then the
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:05.880]  robber baron said we need to take over education and dumb these people down and
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.320]  boy have they done it no question about it and if you look at John Dewey he's
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:15.480]  the guy we really start the book with he received millions of dollars from the
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.680]  Rockefeller Philanthropies this was called the general education board he
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:23.080]  got millions of dollars to take over the teaching colleges and to spread this
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.920]  quacker he outlined his plan to dumb down the nation in 1898 essay where he
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:30.960]  said hey you know little kids don't need to know how to read that's just super
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:34.600]  fluid stuff but change has to come gradually because if you know parents
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:37.480]  realize what's going on there's gonna be a violent reaction and it's gonna
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.760]  jeopardize the final success of our scheming here and my grandmother was an
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:45.360]  elementary school teacher and then became the principal of a pretty big
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:49.720]  country school and she would pay with her own money and would just bring in
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.400]  the phonics cards and the flashcards and would just tell the teachers okay we
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.680]  get this curriculum to get the federal money but just do this and they would
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:03.640]  end up educating them just sneaking and doing it and that was in the 50 60 70s
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:09.400]  and age and that's it that's the same as we see today Alex actually there there
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:12.800]  are plenty of teachers in the system who are very good people who understand
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.640]  what's going on and we're defying the federal government and the common core
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.160]  and trying to teach students properly and what Sam and I argue in this book is
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.560]  that by and large teachers are just as much victims of this craziness as the
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:28.720]  students that are being dumbed down because now they're not over you know
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:31.840]  humans that are excited about learning and know how to read and now they're
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.960]  dealing with a bunch of spoiled rotten drugged up basically good kids behaving
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:42.360]  like a barrel of monkeys and it's all part of the plan I mean this has been
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:46.600]  engineered this way and another thing we focus on in the book to is the role of
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:51.240]  UNESCO in all of this so common core is not happening in a vacuum yeah Bill
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.920]  Gates and the globalists financed it and the Obama administration pushed it on
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.960]  to our states but you know this is happening at the global treaty and
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:03.320]  you're the expert on that explain how this is genuine 21 how it's a UN UNESCO
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.200]  treaty when we come back stay there Alex Newman the book is excellent crimes of
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.280]  the educators you want how it really has happened very well written very well
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:16.960]  documented in four war store.com or Amazon.com or other systems we
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:20.520]  suggest you get it from us that funds the entire operation we're gonna go out
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:24.880]  to break with a minute or two of Rand Paul the senator filibustering the
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.680]  reauthorization of the Patriot Act notice bin Laden's popped back up like a
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.920]  magic rabbit right on time and we'll go out with the senator and part of his
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:40.960]  filibuster and then we will come back from break and we will go to our guest
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:47.520]  I guess we don't have audio it's not a big deal we're gonna work though I promise
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:51.920]  everybody and we moved the new studio a few months ago and I guess I haven't asked
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.640]  for live feeds in here on TV studio but we're gonna get that set up and do that
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.680]  coming up I promise ladies and gentlemen but where does it all begin I mean
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:07.200]  does it go back to Plato's Republic the dumbing down of the population or where
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.360]  does it all go back to you know if you look back into ancient history you had
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:16.960]  every day every basically every tyrant in all of history has understood that to
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.640]  control and to enslave a nation you need to control the education system that's
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:24.920]  one of the things Sam and I did for this book we looked back at what the Soviets
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.320]  did what the communists did with the National Socialist in Germany and the
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:32.640]  pattern is very clear tyrants and authoritarians have always understood
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.760]  this but in the United States John Dewey was really the key figure here all
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.520]  right stay there we're gonna come back we get some clips of Rand Paul or play
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:46.000]  some live clips as well it's all coming up info wars dot com prison planet dot

[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:07.800]  listening to the Alex Jones show and Rand Paul is telebustering live let's go to
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:15.080]  that feed via c-span to one of the huge social communication companies and he
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:19.800]  told me that he thinks that we're missing some of the debate here because
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.680]  he says everybody's talking about bulk collection of your phone records he's
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:29.800]  convinced that there's ever so much more being collected through backdoor
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:36.800]  channels these backdoor channels can occur in two ways they can occur one way
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.520]  by going and looking at foreigners information and then coming through the
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:47.160]  backdoor back into our country and looking at Americans informations but
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.000]  then that American informations has tentacles and spreads and it becomes
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.640]  this enormous grouping of incidental information in fact some have said that
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.920]  it's nine out of ten pieces of data pulled in aren't about a terrorist
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:07.520]  they're just incidental stuff what the president's review commission said is we
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.280]  should delete that once we find it's not relevant to an investigation all right
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.400]  we'll have highlights of it mckell failings and they're watching we'll
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:20.600]  come back to more in the next segment but but listening to this the NSA was
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:26.380]  doing what they're telling you about in the 70s Samsung and everybody else is
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:29.920]  on record in their terms of service saying we're watching and listening to
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:35.080]  you and selling it for third-party marketing so watch what you say Google
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:40.320]  ten years ago hard to believe it was 2005 came out and said to shareholders
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:44.400]  hey we're listening to people and if we hear a dog barking we send dog food ads
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.320]  to the computer and we sell the data that there's a dog you know the dog food
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.240]  companies was the example so let's get that straight imagine if he was up there
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:26:00.680]  holding up Samsung's terms of service that I'm not picking on the South
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:06.360]  Korean company it's a bunch of them but they had the nerve to say watch what you
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:13.840]  say so see it's light years it's a trillion miles worse than what they're
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:19.720]  telling you and even when stuff is out in the open it's so over the top I don't
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.680]  know what you call that phenomenon it's so big people can't see it it's like
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:28.240]  saying do you see the sky it's like no because the whole thing's the sky do you
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:33.520]  see the whole sky no you can't even take in the whole sky it's too big you're
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.560]  just I see part of it I can't only to see the whole skies to pull back see the
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.840]  whole planet but then you only see part of the planet see I'm trying people to
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:49.560]  think here and understand how far down the rabbit hole we are I mean they're
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.240]  now talking about forced inoculation saying your kids don't belong to you
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:58.280]  they're coming Alex Newman investigative journalist educator expert on the
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:02.120]  globalist you were getting into the treaty the UN UNESCO treaties how they
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.880]  set our education that's why they're getting rid of the borders right now
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:08.040]  that's in treaties the TPP is what they're putting in the internet kill
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:12.000]  switch and all this it's why the FCC just power grab they're all in line with
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.160]  global treaties so we're going to break in three four minutes I want to give you
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:20.040]  the floor right now to talk about that history where we're going but let's do
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.080]  that the next segment let me ask you this where is it all going I mean I've
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:28.560]  got a good idea you studied it what is their master plan and how is it going
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:33.440]  for them you know the amazing thing is that we don't even have to speculate
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:37.360]  is they tell us upfront what they're doing they tell us they're creating a
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:41.960]  global government a global society a single world religion basically globalist
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.440]  everything on steroids and really what they're talking about is planetary
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:51.200]  totalitarianism and you know they they use nice words that kind of stuff but
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.960]  they're very upfront about what they're doing now the media won't report it but
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:58.960]  one of the things we did for the book was just spent you know hours and days and
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:03.160]  weeks looking at primary source documents from the United Nations from John
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.680]  Dewey from UNESCO from the common core people from Bill Gates and it's so
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.960]  clear where they're going with all of this it's a global totalitarian system
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:15.400]  and it ensnares everything but education is really at the heart of it
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.640]  because if you don't have a dumb down population if you don't have a
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:22.400]  population that's sufficiently indoctrinated into this nonsense it'll
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:26.720]  never fly and so education we consider is really at the heart of this globalist
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.600]  effort to really just to be blunt about it enslave the world without the
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.960]  education system it would never be possible without mass producing
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.440]  illiterates and collectivists they could never build something like this but
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:41.640]  their goal is very very clear the globalists themselves call it a new
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:45.480]  world order it's not a descriptive term but it is what they're building it's a
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.320]  global totalitarian system and they're almost ripping off the mask at this
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.440]  point they think they're so far along on the road that they're normal back and
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.640]  when I've talked to top globalist off-record obviously some of them on
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:02.600]  record they explain Alex the fact that you can see it means you ought to just
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.560]  join us the public would tear you apart and they're so illiterate we just set
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:14.000]  it up for them to fail they did the rest the fact that we're in control says
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.320]  that we should be in control and they start quoting social Darwinistic
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  screeds but when you talk about it they mass produce collectivist illiterates
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:28.760]  that are arrogant and evil and are globalist themselves spouting slogans so
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:34.400]  you can't help but hate them even though they're mental midgets and then you
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:37.960]  catch yourself in a globalist perspective of them because the hordes of
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:41.600]  these minions are dangerous and then you're almost forced into the arms of
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:45.760]  the globalist but I won't do that we'll be back we'll talk about this paradox
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:53.200]  stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:56.640]  GCN radio network
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:02.640]  for the second time in a year Washington DC gun control laws have been
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:06.720]  struck down in court as unconstitutional the first law made it a
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:10.920]  criminal offense to carry guns you could own them you just couldn't take them out
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:17.080]  of the closet well actually it had to be a gun safe unconstitutional the right
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:23.160]  to keep and bear arms okay said DC you can carry but only with a permit you
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:27.720]  have to ask the police chief Kathy linear for permission and you have to
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:33.960]  have a quote good reason unquote or we won't give you permission unconstitutional
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:39.480]  it's a right of the people not a privilege granted by police chiefs
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:42.960]  plaintiffs lawyers have said that they will take it to the Supreme Court if
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:48.240]  necessary good because when you turn a god-given right into a government
[02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:53.520]  granted privilege they just might refuse you that privilege for no good
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:31:03.000]  reason this is David Knight reporting for info wars dot com and it's that type
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:07.000]  of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:11.040]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:15.480]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:24.760]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:28.360]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:32.560]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with

[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:29.000]  we're gonna go back a little bit more senator Rand Paul he was saying some
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.160]  really good stuff during the break we've got it in the studio via c-span in
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:40.600]  there he was talking about the fact that we gave medals to the NSA and others
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:45.400]  who supposedly missed 9-11 but the truth is the communicates came through and
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:49.640]  they bare minimum stood down and then he broke down how they basically scrapped
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:53.040]  the entire Constitution and Bill of Rights and how many talks of the
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.080]  veterans who've been wounded they said they did it for the Bill of Rights and
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:02.040]  Constitution and they want the Republic restored I mean it's it's good you
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:05.040]  should see all the senators up there giving speeches against it but instead
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:09.880]  they lie and say oh it's just for al-Qaeda no that's all a fraud our
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:16.400]  government is protecting al-Qaeda and ISIS and that's a fact and all they're
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:21.160]  doing if you look at a map of Iraq then I've got some huge breaking gun news
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:31.200]  alert alert if you look at Ramadi that got taken over you can notice that right
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:41.600]  next door is Syria and so you've got part of Syria that's been taken over by
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:48.360]  the rebels and then you've got into here part of Iraq and that borders what is
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:55.160]  that border barters Saudi Arabia and it's huge porous border with Iraq that is
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:03.360]  openly arming ISIS that just flies the Saudi Wahhabist flag and then they in
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:13.200]  turn attack Syria and are creating Islamic State is out of part of Iraq and
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.680]  Syria which has been a Pentagon plan from the beginning since 1991 was to
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:26.920]  weaken the state and then finally break it up with Kurds in the north three
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:42.040]  parts al-Qaeda Wahhabist Sunnis and then Shiites in the southeast and Saudi
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:46.520]  Arabia basically ends up taking over this whole swath in the far south right up
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:52.880]  into the southwest and here's the new Islamic State fact of your TV viewer I'll
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:36:00.880]  just color it in one of states basically this whole area in yellow there's your
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:08.680]  new country right into Syria and then you've got the other states to the north
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:13.040]  and to the east and it's a proxy war and that's why they're saying oh we can't
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:17.560]  go fight them but when they get outside the lines when they come out of the
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:21.680]  areas where the cancer is supposed to stop then the US military will attack
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:24.440]  them when they go into the north because they don't totally control them they
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:27.840]  turn them loose when they go into the north like cookie monster killing
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.800]  people and I say that because he's like throwing cookies just about one cookie
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:37.000]  are just killing everybody it's like a devilish cookie monster and then if they
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:43.560]  get over here into the Shiites I ran back they'll kick them out so they just
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:46.040]  get this whole area and they get to take over Syria and murder everybody and
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.000]  then they'll be given part of Syria later and the UN will make the other part
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:55.720]  in the tourist areas a UN zone it'll be a UN held a snack for the UN so the UN
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:59.200]  gets a piece of the pie along with NATO to run drugs and control the oil and
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.080]  pipelines there on the Mediterranean they kick the Russians out so they get
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:10.000]  that coastal area over here so the UN the globalist get this area and so
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.480]  Arabia gets a piece of Iraq and of us Syria and again the Kurds get their
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:19.360]  little good area and then the Iran gets their little area all right let's go
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.240]  back to our guest Alex Newman before we do that let's get a minute or two more
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.480]  of Senator Rand Paul and his filibuster let's see if he's saying anything of
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:35.560]  import now give up who we are in the process has it been worth it are you
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:41.000]  really willing to give up your liberty for security what if the security you're
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.400]  getting is not even real they said the 52 people they caught to the bulk
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:51.480]  collection program the president's privacy his own privacy privacy group
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:57.200]  investigated and said not one person was captured one possibility of one but
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:04.040]  they already had information on him from some from some other source all right
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.400]  that's enough and what he's getting at there is look at how Hillary had this
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.960]  other server and these other emails the official business and then of course all
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:16.400]  these other intelligence agencies had the information and she just didn't care
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:22.640]  hell they're given China nuclear reactor technology to perfect their subs now I
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:27.680]  mean it's just total sell the country out and that's globalism Alex Newman has

[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:59.880]  huge breaking news house Democrat introduces gun registry bill you notice
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.840]  the Democrats walk and lock step like a cult so this is ordered bill allows
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:09.080]  just department to gather personal information on gun buyers and vendors
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:13.000]  outside of the Brady bill and to confiscate them representative Carol
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.400]  Maloney has spewed out a bunch of Maloney introducing a bill that would
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.560]  effectively create a firearms registry by forcing private sellers at gun shows
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:25.400]  to report sales to the Attorney General and by requiring gun show organizers
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:29.840]  or register for the Justice Department and that means you can't give a gun to
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:34.960]  your son or daughter either vice versa the bill HR 2380 would also force gun
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:39.640]  organizers to provide the identities of all their vendors to the Attorney General
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:44.400]  you like that the legislation would call the Bureau of Aqueduct and firearms
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:47.720]  explosives to hire investigators to inspect gun shows and examine records
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:51.680]  kept by gun show operators and vendors so it's it's a bunch of money to fund the
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:56.680]  harassment of gun shows that's already going on and to end private sales it's
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:42:02.720]  an end of private sales or transfers and basically creates a new FFL for
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:09.560]  anybody selling guns it just it co-ops you into their 1968 gun control act it's
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:14.280]  it's total nightmare info wars calm prison planet calm okay Alex a lot of
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:16.680]  breaking news today appreciate you holding while we go over this we're
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:22.200]  monitoring senator polls a filibuster please continue breaking down start at
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:26.200]  the beginning go through it and where we currently are it's just so pre-meditated
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:30.280]  absolutely it is Alex thank you very much for having me on and thank you for
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.240]  everything that you do basically what we think we've done with this book here is
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:38.920]  a tool to blow up the globalist scheme if this information were more widely known
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:44.440]  the entire edifice would collapse because it all of it rests on a dumb
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:48.720]  down public they can't read well they can't do math they can't understand
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.960]  anything that's pretty much a confession I mean it's all their own criminal
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:56.520]  admission sorry go ahead that's exactly what we did was we use primary sources
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.360]  because we you know we didn't want to deal with our opinion or anything like
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:03.080]  that what we did was we looked at the primary documents the writings of John
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:07.200]  Dewey the UNESCO manuals on how you need to teach children pornographic sex
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:10.840]  education starting at five years old how you need to teach kids all over the
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.200]  world using to read the using the whole word method which we know again doesn't
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:20.120]  work causes actual physical brain damage and we can show this now with modern
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.120]  brain scams you can take a look at the brain of a child and educated with this
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:29.560]  inquiry known as whole word and you can show that there's real brain damage
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.480]  there the connections between the two sides of the brain are not working
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:36.320]  properly a kid who learned how to read using phonics will not have that problem
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:40.840]  we'll be able to read anything and so the real goal here and then we show this
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:45.600]  again using their own words it all comes to agenda 21 and UNESCO and creating
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:49.120]  this new world order that they call it and actually the globalists are meeting
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.640]  right now at the UN summit for education in Korea where they're openly
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.840]  telling you education is going to be a tool to create global citizens green
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:01.440]  global citizens and Arne Duncan uses the same rhetoric as well he gave a speech
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:07.040]  to you about how the federal government was using the schools to turn
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:11.320]  Americans into green global citizens ready for their green jobs in the green
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:17.000]  world order and UNESCO he called them his global partner in all of this at Bill
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.880]  Gates the primary finance here of Common Core signed a deal with UNESCO in 2004
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:26.720]  to develop globalized education and it all converges at this point where
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:33.560]  humanity is totally dumbed down totally ignorant and very easy to control very
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:37.720]  easy to enslave and they can't even acquire information and knowledge
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.720]  independently because they were just orderly orderly euthanized by the big
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:47.120]  Watson computers just like the veterans are now on these don't treat list and
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  it's just a formality I mean you could see it it's all written it's a plan what
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:59.840]  is it like are you a parent I am yeah I mean I I've had children I'm planning to
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.000]  have more children I'm gonna as I've said double down bet on life be fully
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.120]  committed I'm not gonna give up my ancestors didn't they faced amazing
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:11.760]  adversity but they could see the adversity and deal with it the problem is
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:16.960]  is this velvet tyranny that's so creeping and wicked and sneaky and
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:23.680]  encompassing how do you get people already in a trance who are as blind and
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:29.480]  deaf to this as Helen Keller at first to come out of their shell and realize
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:32.800]  that you're not attacking them trying to explain that they've been caught in a
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:35.840]  trap you're trying to help them because once you realize it's really going on
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:42.200]  it's epic I mean I use that word because it is it's epic epic epic epic wild I'm
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:48.800]  in a fantastic dystopian movie but it's it's also utopian and there's so much
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:53.600]  good stuff it's not one way or the other there's these death spots that want to
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:57.320]  grapple everything I'm sorry that's what they're doing and then there's people who
[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:02.600]  want humanity to thrive and who would who love humanity and we're just in this
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:06.840]  death battle with these people I wish folks realized people ask how I have so
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.720]  much energy I mean when you really read their documents and read your book and
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.720]  it's just they're so bad and they're they're so creepy and there's they're
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.520]  gonna take our cars away where we can't even drive them they're gonna have forced
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:24.720]  abortion in the country under Obamacare with regulations just like China people
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:27.640]  say oh that won't happen yeah and everything else wasn't gonna happen either
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:33.160]  it's all going to happen unless we start saying no so what do we do to stop it
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:38.360]  where do you see all this going you're absolutely right Alex and I think you
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:42.120]  know you made some key points there about waking people up I think the facts
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.480]  you know people would read this book with an open mind again they can go to
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:48.880]  the bibliography they can read the primary source documents themselves and
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:52.640]  they've told us where this is all going UNESCO for example several decades
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:57.200]  developed what they call the world core curriculum this was developed by Robert
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:01.080]  Mueller a disciple of Alice Bailey the founder of you know the Lucifer publishing
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:06.040]  company who would invite these ascended master spirit can't make that up open
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:11.000]  Luciferians the UN dedicated to them they have a Lucifer Chapel at the New York
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.120]  UN I've been inside of it again you can't even make this stuff up that's
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:18.400]  exactly right hey I mean if people read Alice Bailey's book she had an
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:22.400]  education for the New Age for example she tells you we need to beat
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:26.480]  individualism out of the children we need to crush biblical religion so we can
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:30.360]  move for this one world wonderful religion where the UN is gonna dictate
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:36.640]  away from the archaic barbaric family structure exactly and I mean this has
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:41.160]  been clear from the very beginning of UNESCO Julian Huxley the first boss of
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:46.040]  UNESCO explained the purpose of UNESCO is to seize control of education create a
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.000]  world humanist religious society where we're all going to serve this world
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.200]  government and you know they couldn't be more clear about it and Bill Gates is
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.080]  on board he's one of the primary financiers of things like the UN
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.320]  population fund that participates in forced abortions in China this is on
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:05.640]  the congressional record also big financier of Planned Parenthood and
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.240]  again this comes back to the eugenesis too we have two chapters about how the
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:15.200]  eugenesis deliberately targeted blacks to dumb them down even more so than the
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.280]  rest of the population and of course the whole population has been done for the
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:22.480]  test subjects they were the guinea pigs and look what they've done to them
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:26.240]  exactly and you know we can see the fruits of this craziness all around us
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.560]  our society is falling apart government is out of control we have abortions and
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  shootings and murders and the globalists openly telling us we're moving
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:37.720]  toward a world government whether we like it or not and the only way to stop
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.560]  this is for people to get educated about the problem so that we can fix the
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:45.840]  problem and people need to realize that this is not some kind of big national
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.560]  accent the criminal group of educators backed by the Rockefellers led by John
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:54.180]  Dewey who went to the Soviet Union to study the Soviet schools and how they
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:57.520]  were mass producing atheists and collectives these people set out with
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:02.880]  an agenda to dumb down the American people of our liberties and we're now
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.520]  coming to the final phases of that well I don't want to romanticize Vladimir
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.280]  Putin because I trust him about as far as I could throw him but he they are
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:15.200]  getting together literal youth camps to get 18 year olds to get married to have
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.120]  kids they are they talk about eugenics his best buddy has a TV show on
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:26.480]  national state-run TV sounds like me they're telling the truth I think they
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:30.840]  went through all that hell they never really actually fell but I really think
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:35.560]  alexander shaltzenica and others had a big effect on them I know Putin said he
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:40.440]  was a fan of shaltzenica met with him a lot before he died I know liberty once
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:45.840]  you've gone to total tyranny will become very alluring again and so I know that
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:50.360]  we can reach out to people on the elite but when we see Russia going in the
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.760]  opposite of where we're going we know we're in trouble okay and you know I
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:00.240]  went to the first global home education conference in Berlin in 2012 and there
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:03.200]  was a lot of Russians there and they told me that homeschooling is totally
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:07.080]  free and wide open and Russia that was amazing for me because you know like you
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:10.800]  said I wouldn't trust Putin as far as I could throw him but but you gotta judge
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:14.640]  the tree by fruits he's promoting homeschooling yeah and I'm going to
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:18.720]  masculine men and men should be tough and like John Wayne I mean it's it's the
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:24.000]  opposite of men are good role models and fathers are good I mean it's yeah and in
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.120]  the United States we're moving toward crushing homeschooling the government is
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:31.800]  becoming extremely hostile and the talking heads you know an MSNBC telling us
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:35.080]  that the children belong to the community and Hillary Clinton with her
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:39.600]  village to raise a child homeschooling is one of the best options that parents
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:43.620]  could possibly seize upon right now you need to get your kids out of the
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:46.320]  government school you need to teach them to read using phonics you need to
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:49.840]  teach them real history you need to teach them the fact and that's how we're
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:54.880]  gonna stop this criminal enterprise amazing Alex Newman the book cons of

[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:06.200]  type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:14.640]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:23.920]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:27.480]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:31.600]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with

[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:28.080]  insulted that I wasn't put in bin Laden's fake reading lists this is
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:33.080]  clearly to demonize books they don't like though I did republish and reprint

[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:33.480]  David Redgraven's been I mean this is our guest where am I in here I mean
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:36.240]  usually when there's some cop killer they say they did it for me and then we
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:39.920]  learned the person was you know coming after me or wanted to kill me or hated
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.520]  me I mean this is just so or maybe the body double was reading this in his
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:49.080]  house arrest it was a body double you know half mile or less from the biggest
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:56.000]  military base in the country going back to Alex Newman Alex just crazy times
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  going on how do you think things are going for the elite they've dumbed down
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.040]  a lot of people but a lot of people are awake a lot of governments are awake a
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.320]  lot of individuals are awake the government's you know cutting fluoride
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:11.560]  out of the water now and many and hurts people glyphosates in trouble a lot of
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:15.080]  good stuff's happening the UN's discredited the Federal Reserve's in
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:20.960]  trouble I mean I don't see things being a bed of roses or a carpet of rose
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.760]  petals for the globalists what do you see happening I mean they're having some
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:31.000]  big wins as well if this was a football game what's the score that's a good
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:35.600]  question I think from what's going on the globalists are accelerating their
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:40.280]  plan and my inference from this is that they're getting nervous they know that
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:44.040]  they got to get this all done as quickly as possible because people are waking up
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:48.440]  right and left by the millions and once we reach a critical mass of people who
[02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:51.720]  are awake you know this whole thing is going to come crashing down they're
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:55.600]  gonna end up in prison and you know that's serious stuff so it looks to me
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:59.080]  like they're really dramatically accelerating their plans if you watch
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:02.600]  you know the mainstream media it's almost pathetic they're there blabbering
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:06.440]  and telling lies and they know everybody watching understands that it's a lie
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:10.080]  but they keep spewing it as if you know we didn't understand and they didn't
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:13.280]  understand that we understand so I think they're getting nervous I think that's
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.480]  why we're right they're just pretending so they get their paycheck hoping some
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:22.040]  of Redstone who goes around in public with his two hot young girlfriends you
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:25.920]  know 90 something years old totally evil they're just telling the old man
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:30.640]  everything's fine basically yeah it's what it seems like and I think as we
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:35.040]  move closer to them just totally ripping off the mask more and more people are
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:38.960]  gonna be waking up so it's important that people have the facts that people be
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:42.480]  educated that people be organized in their communities because we're gonna
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:47.760]  have a great opportunity here to put a stop to all this and if we miss it it's
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:52.040]  gonna be a disaster for humanity but if we seize it it would be you know
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:55.480]  absolutely wonderful and amazing so we need to be educating ourselves we need
[02:57:55.480 --> 02:57:59.280]  to be praying and we need to know the facts so that we can educate others and
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:03.000]  so that when the opportunity presents itself as we get closer as more people
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:06.520]  wake up we can put our foot down and say enough of this we're gonna keep our
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:09.720]  rights we're gonna keep our nation thank you very much we're gonna educate our
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:13.160]  children we're not gonna let you down them down and you know we're not gonna

[02:59:55.360 --> 03:00:06.480]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:14.080]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network people love to spend
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:19.760]  money buying thriller books and who done it science fiction books and that's fine
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:23.320]  I mean I've read a lot of that stuff myself but when I was a child I began
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:29.040]  reading history books and research books and just adult publications because
[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:33.080]  they were so much more interesting reality was so much more interesting but
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:38.040]  when you read a book like crimes of the educators I've only gotten 20 pages into
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:42.360]  and you're reading quotes by the globalist and in copies of documents
[03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:45.480]  where they said it about how they want to kill us and our families but first
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:50.080]  dumb us down and suck everything off of us and build a technocratic utopia on
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:59.840]  our bones do people take this personal I mean I know I do I guess a lot of people
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:06.680]  just want to socially climb and they'll do anything to join these people of course
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:11.680]  that's why you've not been asked to join them I mean they certainly don't want you
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:16.280]  and that's what's sick about this and I didn't finish that up with Newman talking
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:22.200]  to him earlier is that when I've been on the phone with the head of the Kissinger
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:28.480]  group or that's one people I can mention the name I've talked to people more
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:37.560]  high-level than Rothko he's like the minion of Kissinger when you're around
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:43.040]  these people major bank head you name it people I've run into they will just tell
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:47.880]  me one of two things I'll either say listen I'm in this too deep I can't get
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:51.400]  out it's worse than you think you're dead on you're gonna be getting very very
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:56.720]  famous let me just tell you get ready it's gonna be wild and just keep doing
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:59.800]  what you're doing because you are dead on I'm getting out of the country bye-bye
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:05.440]  you that they either tell you that first they say now I got your word this is off
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:08.640]  record because I follow the show and I know you don't burn people and that's
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:12.600]  that's your currency is that you don't get yes of course I'm not gonna tell
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:15.520]  anybody unless you tell me you got kids locked up in a basement they don't have
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:19.960]  to something something prima facie illegal I tell people you tell me
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:23.600]  something illegal that you're brewing methamphetamine I don't think you're
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.160]  actually cooking methamphetamine this is a speech I give you're somebody trying
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:33.440]  to set me up bringing me into a crime so anything illegal where you're
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:38.480]  committing the crime don't tell me about it but if you want to just give me
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:42.000]  general information or whatever that's you know please and don't give me any
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:47.960]  classified documents so that I'm trying to set me up with that they're like yes
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:51.920]  yes of course but then most of the time they're not scared or freaked out and
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:55.640]  say they don't want to be part of it they're just like you're really a piece
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:03:00.360]  of work you probably could have done pretty good working with us but you just
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:04.200]  don't understand these people you don't understand how stupid they are how weak
[03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:07.160]  they are the no amount of help's ever gonna get through to them look at how
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:12.280]  you've futilely sit there and warn them all day and they hate your guts we could
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:17.960]  buy them off for pennies they're going to evolve but not the way you think you
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:23.280]  think of adaptation is as resisting adapting overcoming like the Marines
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:32.640]  say that's not how it works Alex they're gonna adapt to be in slaves and the
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:39.240]  future is in the hands of the people that rightfully should have control really
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:44.200]  so you put fluoride in the water to make everybody mildly retarded so you can be
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:50.120]  the king of planet low IQ I mean what boy you're real gods let me tell you
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:55.200]  you're really powerful that a bunch of robber barons that got rich off the
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:00.840]  wealth of the West set up a long-term strategic plan to take over the
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:05.280]  universities and higher learning and corporations to then build this and then
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:08.640]  you took all the human invention and scrolled it away for yourselves and
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:15.280]  twisted it and perverted everything and then you sit there and say what you've
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:20.880]  done is so powerful I mean I guess it is like it takes powerful will to grab
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:23.960]  kids off the street and torture them for a month and kill them while they beg
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:27.960]  for mommy I mean I guess that is powerful in a way sickening and
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:33.160]  degenerate and horrible I mean okay okay you are powerful like a stinking dead
[03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:38.160]  animal as a powerful stanchion you are powerful and you have us on our knees
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:43.640]  okay great I'm gonna tell you this you'll never escape what you've done I
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:48.240]  know the higher-level ones know that just get off on it you're turned over to
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:52.560]  your father the devil but the good people are waking up and with God's help
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:58.040]  you will be brought to justice and we will survive we will defeat you
