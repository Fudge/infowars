[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:28.000]  to show the sick amount of influence that the kleptocratic dictatorship of Saudi
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.200]  Arabia the royal family has over this country it was a big controversy that
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.200]  the first lady Michelle Obama didn't cover her face when she met with the
[00:38.200 --> 00:44.400]  royal family that Obama constantly bows down to is that not truly sickening
[00:44.400 --> 00:50.360]  ladies and gentlemen that's the top of stories coming up today we also have the
[00:50.360 --> 00:53.560]  federal government coming out and warning of the Internet of Things and
[00:53.560 --> 01:00.200]  calling for safeguards for the quote smart grid that has been engineered at a
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.920]  global level for at least 30 years on record to track and control and tax
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.560]  everything we do the Internet of Things and the smart grid is the carbon tax
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.560]  micro management kill grid in fact I'm gonna get to that but I forgot the
[01:16.560 --> 01:19.520]  story from yesterday that came out at the end of the show you guys reprint me
[01:19.520 --> 01:23.880]  Watson's article I don't have it reposted the front of info wars calm because
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.520]  it broke at about 130 and got no attention I think that's the worst time
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.360]  to direct to break a story is around that time and we just break them as they
[01:33.360 --> 01:36.440]  come out announced by the British government they're gonna take control
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.880]  of your car basically remote control it tax it track it reduce the power you
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.480]  have just like they've announced smart meters are already you know controlling
[01:44.480 --> 01:50.600]  your thermostat and gouging you this is all being announced just like the new
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.600]  smart light bulbs are gonna interface with your television and other
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.960]  appliances and it began two weeks ago suddenly people are noticing that it's
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.440]  taking place the news is like isn't it fun and the company's just getting data
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.440]  why the television the new smart TV interfaces with your light bulbs and
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.280]  sends info back to the company I'm gonna say that again the televisions
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.800]  without asking is interfacing with the light bulbs you think all this just
[02:19.800 --> 02:28.920]  happened by accident that's more ridiculous than the purest evolutionist
[02:28.920 --> 02:32.720]  that believe that you know cells formed by their own that's like saying a fine
[02:32.720 --> 02:37.080]  wristwatch formed the middle of the desert with sand blowing together for
[02:37.080 --> 02:41.520]  enough time that's the old cliche to answer I don't believe in what the main
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.360]  line preachers extrapolate out of the Bible either so I don't believe in what
[02:45.360 --> 02:48.200]  they're saying and their interpretation and I don't believe the other
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.240]  religionist with their you know I came from a chimpanzee when all the top
[02:53.240 --> 02:57.320]  genetic engineers say that's clearly not what's going on there's giant leaps in
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.440]  development we're talking just suddenly whole new species okay we were
[03:02.440 --> 03:08.560]  engineered and you can debate all day long who did the engineering most elite
[03:08.560 --> 03:11.560]  scientists and I've read New York Times articles London Guardian articles here on
[03:11.560 --> 03:20.240]  air who were atheist are now not atheist they believe in seeding from
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.880]  space and my piece that's got millions of views on YouTube from the nightly news
[03:26.880 --> 03:32.920]  years ago a secret sub Prometheus revealed gets into that and so you see
[03:32.920 --> 03:40.880]  movie like Prometheus this is a Noah Bible story from the Illuminati this is
[03:40.880 --> 03:48.880]  what they really believe happened panspermia meaning all meaning seed is
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.080]  the hypothesis that life is just throughout the universe distributed by
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.000]  micro asteroids comets planetoids and also spacecraft the form of unintended
[03:57.000 --> 04:06.120]  contamination by microorganisms I know it's not unintended so I'm not going
[04:06.120 --> 04:13.720]  there I'm a Christian that's where I stand but if you sit there and you just
[04:13.720 --> 04:19.280]  think that all this just appeared out of nowhere you really are stupid I mean
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.760]  something's wrong with you and that's what the evolutionists say they say
[04:22.760 --> 04:31.760]  amino acids in hot water created cells the most primitive cell is thousands of
[04:31.760 --> 04:38.640]  times conservatively more complex than a fine Swiss rich watch a fine Swiss wrist
[04:38.640 --> 04:44.480]  watch a timepiece all right look look we've got huge news off the chart coming

[08:50.960 --> 08:55.720]  us to the first and probably greatest hacker of all time known as Captain
[08:55.720 --> 09:02.080]  Crunch he rarely does interviews he is a listener of the broadcast as a lot of
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.560]  eccentric people are and we're going to be honored to have him and talk about
[09:05.560 --> 09:11.760]  everything from the Sony hack to the NSA to all of these reporters and people
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.160]  being persecuted and put in prison for reporting on wiki leaks he was somebody
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.080]  thrown in prison for exposing what was happening in the Nixon administration
[09:22.080 --> 09:25.720]  you somebody able to hack into the telephones directly into the White
[09:25.720 --> 09:32.200]  House just using common sense but also he could train himself to whistle the
[09:32.200 --> 09:37.960]  tones which the CIA and FBI did not even believe he could do and then of course
[09:37.960 --> 09:40.840]  he was put in a government facility for years basically working for him
[09:40.840 --> 09:48.480]  during his prison sentence doing all sorts of clandestine operations so he's
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.120]  going to be joining us the one the only Captain Crunch here on the
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.360]  transmission you know it's kind of like I had Al Jorgensen a ministry you know
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.160]  who is a top you could say top 15 rock star I wouldn't say even top 10 maybe
[10:03.160 --> 10:06.600]  top 10 and sometimes he's been one of the top guys in the country I like the
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.080]  lyrics of the music I think he said a lot of really interesting things over the
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.280]  years obviously at this point he's kind of like the crazy uncle in the attic but
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.640]  aren't we all and sure he gets up on air and acts wild and crazy because he is
[10:18.640 --> 10:22.680]  wild and crazy and a minority of people said man what are you doing having
[10:22.680 --> 10:28.000]  somebody like this on your show well I like real people and eccentrics it
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.600]  doesn't mean that I endorse everything they believe or stand for but I don't
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.840]  like these fake executives in Congress and these fake executives in the British
[10:36.840 --> 10:41.280]  Parliament who are all uptight on the surface and who are molesting little
[10:41.280 --> 10:49.520]  boys and girls at night I'm sick of the most corrupt people on their high horse
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.680]  and to steal a line from apocalypse now Colonel Kirch is explaining why he's so
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.920]  sick of the system he goes you know we kill hundreds of thousands of people and
[10:59.920 --> 11:06.240]  we drop fiery napalm death on villages but then they court martial our airmen
[11:06.240 --> 11:11.520]  for putting cuss words on the sides of their airplanes and that's exactly what
[11:11.520 --> 11:14.400]  I'm talking about people freak out about the cuss words on the side of an
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.960]  airplane but they don't care if the veterans we now know for a year this is
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.240]  already going on we told you here over and over again I'm up bragging we should
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.160]  know the prayer time we know what we're talking about you got the enemies MO we
[11:28.160 --> 11:31.280]  got them dead got their number
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.320]  that they were putting troops on death lists not give them care they got
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.040]  plenty of money they got plenty of services they want to set the precedent
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.600]  to kill people and raise taxes all these idiot socialists think you know well
[11:45.600 --> 11:48.680]  we're killing people to save money we're collected no you're not you're not
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.160]  even a collectivist honeybee model or when a bees lived out as usefulness
[11:53.160 --> 11:58.520]  it's programmed to stop eating and just to go die that's not even what's going
[11:58.520 --> 12:01.880]  on here that's bad enough we're not honeybees we're not collective as hive
[12:01.880 --> 12:13.440]  insects the people don't get upset about that let me tell you folks ask how I
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.040]  know the things I know and how so many times I can just call something
[12:17.040 --> 12:22.880]  instantly by just looking at it it's because I just know who the players are
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.640]  I know what their plays are I know what their operations are and they don't
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.280]  really change their tricks they just do different permutations of the same
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.200]  tricks and a lot of globalists are on records you're saying why do you do the
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.680]  same operations over and over again because they work there's an old saying
[12:42.880 --> 12:51.480]  even a broke don't fix it and we are beating them at many levels in the
[12:51.480 --> 12:54.840]  info war so they've been changing up doing some tricks on that front there's
[12:54.840 --> 13:08.080]  a lot of new stuff going on but when it comes to screw jobs they run a couple
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.840]  dozen different tricks and if the public ever learned those tricks and ever
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.600]  learned the agenda of creating crisis destabilization and then the
[13:17.600 --> 13:21.320]  establishment posing as the saviors to gain more power and control and then to
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.800]  start the next crisis always consolidating power always waging war
[13:26.800 --> 13:33.120]  against independence if people understood that their power would be
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.440]  greatly diminished and probably broken now we've got a lot of news coming up
[13:40.440 --> 13:44.560]  and a lot of key intel but before I get any of that I want to cover our top
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.680]  story and I don't usually do this but I'm today I'm gonna walk you through my
[13:48.680 --> 13:53.160]  thought processes as I saw this story develop
[13:53.800 --> 14:00.520]  Davos economists elite are afraid of Ferguson style riots wealth inequity
[14:00.520 --> 14:09.520]  threatens to spur civil unrest now I saw this story this morning and then when I
[14:09.520 --> 14:16.080]  read that it was Robert Johnson at Davos the official economist of Davos
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.800]  which is basically Bilderberg public I instantly knew that their answer would
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.600]  be 90 to 100 trillion all horses 90 trillion other Davos is 100 trillion
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.600]  you can pull those headlines up going back five years ago they just keep saying
[14:30.600 --> 14:35.520]  the same thing every year to quote help the poor oh poor you're in pain give the
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.640]  IMF and World Bank 90 to 100 trillion if George Soros 5 trillion to fix Ukraine
[14:40.640 --> 14:44.880]  when they spent 5 billion US taxpayer money to overthrow it see they break it
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.680]  then they want more money to fix it Soros a month ago said give me 5 billion
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.440]  and we'll have a Marshall plan
[14:56.240 --> 15:00.280]  that pull up the exact number I think it was even more done that was just they
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.120]  spent 5 billion to overthrow the State Department admitted that and then they
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.240]  he wanted Soros says give money to fix Ukraine look that up you think it's
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.720]  London Telegraph BBC but what I'm getting at here is I see that headline and I
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.800]  instantly know what they're gonna call for next because it's just they do the
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.560]  same thing over and over again this is not hard to figure out then I come into
[15:26.560 --> 15:34.680]  the studio and we're queuing up the video clip of the economist and Buckley
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.320]  walks in and says did you see the article last Friday out of the London
[15:39.320 --> 15:44.360]  Guardian where they're talking about the elite are all running to the hills and
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.120]  buying secret airstrips and command bases in the middle of nowhere around
[15:48.120 --> 15:51.240]  the world I said yeah I did see that article and he said yeah that might tie
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.080]  into this and he came and handed me the article and lo and behold it's Robert
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.600]  Johnson the same economist and then I went where have I heard that name before
[15:59.600 --> 16:07.400]  so I started reading the article and he is one of George Soros's top people and
[16:07.400 --> 16:14.080]  was the managing director at the Soros group I'm reading from the London
[16:14.080 --> 16:20.200]  Guardian show you've got George Soros that is funding the Ferguson riots on
[16:20.200 --> 16:26.920]  record funding the Ukraine overthrow and is on record bragging that he was
[16:26.920 --> 16:31.120]  behind that you just type in Soros brags he was behind Ukraine overthrow
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.800]  she and Ian Fareed Zarkaria the whole date Soros admits responsibly for coup
[16:36.800 --> 16:41.240]  and mass murder in Ukraine call a revolution collaboration began soon
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.520]  after endangered fall of Soviet Union and guys I wanted this yesterday you may
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.400]  have pulled it up it's the US ambassador admits that US funded 5 billion to
[16:50.400 --> 16:53.520]  overthrow Ukraine you can pull up I want to play that clip it's not enough for me
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.240]  to just say that let's find that clip and play it thank you I don't want to
[16:57.240 --> 17:03.920]  just say it we have new listeners I want them to hear it so they're trying to
[17:03.920 --> 17:08.280]  start civil war here they're trying to start it over there and then Buckley
[17:08.280 --> 17:12.560]  walks in and says hey this this article ties into it and lo and behold it's the
[17:12.560 --> 17:20.440]  same guy but acting like Jeepers creepers we don't like wealth inequity we
[17:20.440 --> 17:26.720]  want to redistribute give us 90 to 100 trillion over the next decade in carbon
[17:26.720 --> 17:30.720]  taxes and things and then who makes the money George Soros is in carbon taxes
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.080]  Al Gore Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the
[17:35.080 --> 17:39.880]  Rothschilds run the biggest exchange in London Al Gore has his own called Gore
[17:39.880 --> 17:46.560]  and blood not blood and Gore Gore and blood I'm not joking his partners Lord
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.040]  blood I thought that thought that was counter-accurate but you can't make up
[17:51.040 --> 17:58.920]  these bugs so all of this is going on it's just a giant screw job and I know
[17:58.920 --> 18:06.960]  you know that but here he is warning everyone oh the elite are very afraid of
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.800]  Ferguson they're running for the hills they're hiding the truth is they want
[18:12.800 --> 18:15.920]  to bring in this engineering collapse buy everything up for pennies on the
[18:15.920 --> 18:19.480]  dollar during the crisis act like the guys that want to distribute the wealth
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.760]  to fix the problem after the riots when it'll just be a bigger level of
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.040]  swindling I mean if George Soros helped round up hundreds of Jewish families and
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.320]  rob all their money and rags about it on 60 minutes and says he's not ashamed of
[18:33.320 --> 18:40.160]  it because quote he survived what do you think I'll do to your family oh but the
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.560]  average person sees all over the news the economist oh we're so we've got to
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.320]  redistribute wealth right now to the poor people but they don't even redistribute
[18:48.320 --> 18:52.680]  it to the poor because at least they've spend it on restaurants and cars and you
[18:52.680 --> 18:57.200]  know renting things or buying houses that would cause inflation and laziness
[18:57.200 --> 19:03.040]  but it's better than giving it to George Soros and the elite so we're gonna go
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.920]  to break and come back with this economist as I mean this is such a
[19:07.920 --> 19:14.040]  clear example because I immediately was saying to Buckley I bet George Soros is
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.000]  involved in this you know it's out of Davos I'm gonna talk about on air how
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.960]  Soros is behind the riots in Ukraine and here and how now they've got their
[19:22.960 --> 19:25.920]  Davos henchmen out there acting like they're trying to stop it when they're
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.240]  behind it and it turns out it's the former head of the Soros group saying
[19:30.240 --> 19:36.320]  it people ask well how do you just know it's Soros I said months before it was
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.600]  Soros because I went and looked at the groups that were sponsoring the kill the
[19:40.600 --> 19:44.840]  cop statements and handing out the signs and it was Soros backed groups and let
[19:44.840 --> 19:48.520]  me tell you what liars they are I've had media matters director of media call me
[19:48.520 --> 19:52.600]  before what to do a quote journalist interview about a hit piece and I said
[19:52.600 --> 19:55.240]  you got three million dollars from George Soros he goes no he didn't no he
[19:55.240 --> 19:58.320]  didn't I pulled up the federal filing swallows on the phone with him it's
[19:58.320 --> 20:03.080]  just incredible what's the best way to keep secrets for somebody why don't you
[20:03.080 --> 20:06.360]  give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're

[24:13.440 --> 24:21.280]  in the street I've already spent some time getting into the fact that here's
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.040]  George Soros the spokesman in the media saying we're gonna have riots it's
[24:26.040 --> 24:29.880]  horrible you better give a hundred trillion Al Gore only wants 90 trillion
[24:29.880 --> 24:37.200]  I'm not joking Al Gore called this week at Davos for 90 I'll say that again 90
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.200]  trillion for global government over the next few years previously it was a
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.240]  hundred trillion and that's what Soros wants or there's gonna be riots all
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.240]  over the world and then who was behind the Arab Spring and bragged about it
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.440]  George Soros who was behind global derivatives manipulations driving up
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.760]  food prices George Soros who was behind the Ferguson rioting and stirring it up
[24:58.760 --> 25:03.400]  and spending 33 million to get that going on record major investigation with
[25:03.400 --> 25:07.400]  the Washington Times Soros groups admits it George Soros who was behind
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.920]  overthrowing Ukraine in his own words George Soros who was behind Bill
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.880]  Clinton to a great extent George Soros who's behind Barack Obama George Soros
[25:16.880 --> 25:22.920]  I mean he's just an active demon in all this a top general a star player in
[25:22.920 --> 25:32.600]  Satan's army a Rothschild agent totally wicked and who's one of the top funders
[25:32.600 --> 25:41.760]  to get your guns you guessed it George Soros George Soros and now his chief
[25:41.760 --> 25:49.680]  economist and the former head of the Soros group in that just special Robert
[25:49.680 --> 25:53.240]  Johnson who quote heads the Institute of New Economic Thinking and was
[25:53.240 --> 25:59.040]  previously managing director at Soros said societies can tolerate income
[25:59.040 --> 26:02.920]  inequity if the income floor is high enough but with an existing system
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.640]  encouraging chief executives to take decisions solely on profitability even
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.080]  in the richest countries inequity is increasing inequities increasing because
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.920]  they're destroying the middle class under Obama on record here's another
[26:15.920 --> 26:20.320]  headline breaking that down I've got here in my stack that we're gonna be
[26:20.320 --> 26:26.400]  going over the middle class has gone down the greatest extent since the end of
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.720]  World War two when it began to grow under Obama Obama was instrumental in
[26:30.720 --> 26:36.800]  killing it and who is he a Soros man so here's Robert Johnson warning everyone
[26:36.800 --> 26:42.760]  that the elite are so scared here at Davos of the poor people so give us a
[26:42.760 --> 26:46.240]  hundred trillion and we'll give it to you kind of like they said five years ago
[26:46.240 --> 26:51.640]  at the Copenhagen World Carbon Tax Summit oh we won't let you see the
[26:51.640 --> 26:56.480]  treaty but it's gonna give money to poor people the treaty got leaked and they
[26:56.480 --> 26:59.200]  said yeah that's the treaty we're gonna arrest who leaked it because you're not
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.440]  supposed to know what we're voting on because we're so free and open and it
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.320]  basically double taxes on poor people worldwide through the carbon tax I mean
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.480]  you'll never know why gas and electricity and food so much just like
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.720]  Obamacare only raised seven taxes that you can see on people at the poverty
[27:19.720 --> 27:26.000]  line or below but a whole bunch of other ones like Obama's free community
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.160]  college that'll be paid for basically with a bunch of taxes that'll be passed
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.360]  on to you know you don't see it on the paycheck you don't see a line they're
[27:33.360 --> 27:38.760]  saying it but it's cuz they love you so let's go ahead and go to that clip here
[27:38.760 --> 27:45.760]  is the Soros Minion his head ringwraith the witch king telling us how much he
[27:45.760 --> 27:52.080]  loves us there is an urgency I believe because of social instability all over
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.440]  the world to address inequality this is a powerful group of people at some
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.240]  level are they gonna recognize it I think the answer is yes a lot of very
[28:02.240 --> 28:05.640]  wealthy and powerful people are quite afraid right now they see us on an
[28:05.640 --> 28:10.240]  unstable trajectory they don't see our political institutions being what you
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.440]  might call representative responsive and pulling things together powerful
[28:14.440 --> 28:18.960]  people can escape the clutches of the government meaning their company or they
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.600]  themselves don't have to bear the burden they don't have to pay more taxes or
[28:22.600 --> 28:28.480]  whatever but as the system doesn't have proper resources as it doesn't
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.200]  represent people things are getting more and more dangerous as the Ferguson
[28:32.200 --> 28:38.680]  Missouri brings to bear which you spend 33 million dollars or your boss did to
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.400]  destabilize and fan the flames as a beta test for the future for the big one I
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.240]  mean we have you red-handed and you're not even trying to create jobs in
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.680]  industry in a stable currency that can create 10 plus percent growth numbers and
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.240]  make us fabulously rich you are squatting and perching and your whole
[28:56.240 --> 29:02.520]  agenda 21 UN clowered and pivot strategy is to bankrupt the system to bring in a
[29:02.520 --> 29:07.520]  total hell which the elite will then sit offshore and exempt themselves from in
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.800]  the next consolidation phase and then after 10 years of consolidation they'll
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.720]  come back owning everything with a socially engineered population ready to
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.960]  submit now you didn't just hear me state their master battle plan today you've
[29:20.960 --> 29:24.280]  been hearing it for at least 15 of my 20 years I didn't fully understand this the
[29:24.280 --> 29:28.240]  first five years on here when we come back they're now rolling it out in all
[29:28.240 --> 29:31.280]  the big newspapers from the New York Times the Financial Times of the
[29:31.280 --> 29:35.680]  Guardian because they're getting ready to do a worldwide Arab Spring but this
[29:35.680 --> 29:39.760]  time a socialist spring that Al Gore called for two years ago we're gonna
[29:39.760 --> 29:44.000]  break down the elite moving to their bunkers as we speak they could be

[33:34.520 --> 33:39.400]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. between p.m. central we're live also
[33:39.400 --> 33:44.920]  rebroadcast on stations across the country yes we cover a lot of epic
[33:44.920 --> 33:51.080]  issues here on the air it's because reality is epic reality is over the top
[33:51.080 --> 33:59.240]  reality as it's been said many times is stranger than fiction so you've got the
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.120]  chief minion of George Soros Robert Johnson and before that name even
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.000]  clicked I went well this is all just Davos propaganda they're all in unison
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  the CEOs pre-line up their presentations it's always give us hundreds of
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.800]  trillions of dollars back up our derivatives thousands of trillions I'm
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.920]  not joking it's to quadrillion worldwide that's two thousand trillion and
[34:22.920 --> 34:29.800]  growing just five years ago it was 1.6 quadrille and it it's the same message
[34:29.800 --> 34:33.280]  because then that money goes through the UN through the IMF through the World
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.440]  Bank through all these other globalist subsidiaries and is given in contracts to
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.120]  them to develop the countries they want and that's why they like to move
[34:43.120 --> 34:46.960]  everything to India or Mexico or China because those are corrupt countries that
[34:46.960 --> 34:53.000]  will 100% do whatever they say and then none of the money gets to the people so
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.720]  these are the most cutthroat nasty merciless anti-human BS artist the
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.520]  world have ever seen but they sit up there in that nice CEO talk in an MPR
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.360]  voice going oh the elite are very scared right now of Ferguson and other
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.600]  things in all over the world or there's an inequity as their globalist system
[35:15.600 --> 35:22.760]  takes over Warren Buffett I got hundreds of billions I control and I'm
[35:22.760 --> 35:27.800]  worth 50 billion I gave 50 billion or more over the years to charity and a
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.000]  tax exempt foundation that runs companies that are exempt and then he gets
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.840]  the money back I mean do you understand that folks he gets up you know on on ABC
[35:38.840 --> 35:44.840]  this week and you know we just need to raise taxes on rich people because I
[35:44.840 --> 35:48.560]  don't hardly pay any and then the rich people are 125,000 a year according to
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.680]  him and then turns out he's exempt and what he wants is the middle class's
[35:52.680 --> 35:57.840]  money he was the biggest receiver of the banker bailout that's McClatchy
[35:57.840 --> 36:04.560]  newspaper not Alex Jones or McClatchy news service Warren Buffett biggest
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.640]  recipient of bailout and of course he's lobbying for higher taxes and going
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.360]  poor people deserve something free just like they deserve free Obamacare and
[36:14.360 --> 36:18.520]  they deserve to be safe you know he gives money to anti-gun groups but
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.080]  nobody attacks him just like Bill Gates is one of the biggest funders of
[36:22.080 --> 36:28.440]  anti-gun garbage it's like oh well he's Bill Gates he's nonpartisan he's the
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.400]  most flaming eugenics hardcore commie you could imagine like what do you mean
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.520]  he's a billionaire or the rich man the world well that's who always funds
[36:36.520 --> 36:40.080]  communism because they set off shore take your money they're exempt and you
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.840]  work in a FEMA camp he hadn't figured that out yet these are super alpha males
[36:44.840 --> 36:48.760]  that are ready to crush you and your family if they can they're working as
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.560]  hard as they can to dumb you down and take your kids away socially and
[36:52.560 --> 36:57.000]  culturally and break women off from men and they're doing a great devastating
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.840]  job and he's working around the clock both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.160]  make inoculation the law like it is in India when those women get those shots
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.840]  a lot of times they roll out and die other times they just are paralyzed for
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.240]  life or they have all sorts of horrible neurological disorders and boy that's a
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.720]  hot shot they got for you over here the soft kills not quite as noticeable but
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.520]  they're turning the heat up studying seeing if we squirm seeing how to handle
[37:24.520 --> 37:28.280]  it get everybody used to the neurological disorders and cancer off the
[37:28.280 --> 37:32.080]  chart and people getting their shots and going paralyzed the next day and just
[37:32.080 --> 37:36.960]  just processing and all seeing of the doctors and nurses notice the media doesn't
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.000]  really cover it's everything's just just quietly the ambient temperatures being
[37:41.000 --> 37:51.000]  turned up by these loving people meanwhile the very same Soros chief is
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.840]  Field Marshal former hedge fund director Robert Johnson that's why they all sort
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.720]  of getting out of a few years ago so they could then criticize it all while
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.080]  they're not really out of it reveal that worried hedge fund managers were
[38:05.080 --> 38:08.840]  already planning their escapes I know hedge fund managers all over the world
[38:08.840 --> 38:12.200]  who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.880]  think they need to get away how many times you heard this from me
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.520]  or about six years ago I told you that I ran into a billionaire who's very well
[38:20.520 --> 38:24.240]  known I'll just leave it that and they said they said are you ready to be one
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.200]  of the top media people in the world and I said well why is that they said
[38:27.200 --> 38:34.320]  because what you're saying is absolutely true and it's all gonna happen in
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.400]  worse than you know and they said in five or six years the United States as we
[38:38.400 --> 38:41.960]  know it will not exist remember that statement well we're now five six years
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.960]  later I'm not saying it's all about to happen right now but this is this is
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.080]  but see now they're suddenly announcing it it's not Alex Jones telling you he
[38:52.080 --> 38:59.960]  ran into a billionaire in an office complex at a law office a few years
[38:59.960 --> 39:04.840]  ago it's in the London Guardian it's in the Financial Times it's in the New York
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.380]  Times it's in the Wall Street Journal it's in a bunch of other newspapers this
[39:08.380 --> 39:17.480]  week that the elite are running to the hills and they're saying oh and what's
[39:17.480 --> 39:20.680]  common's gonna be terrible Jeepers creepers we didn't know it was coming
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.480]  you better fund world government with a hundred trillion dollars to redistribute
[39:24.480 --> 39:30.080]  wealth so they can pose as a savior as the good billionaires Warren Buffett
[39:30.080 --> 39:41.120]  Bill Gates George Soros the good demons isn't that just cupcake sweet as an
[39:41.120 --> 39:45.080]  equity source the nervous super rich are already planning their escapes head fund
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.360]  managers are preparing getaways by buying airstrips and farms and they're
[39:50.360 --> 39:56.840]  buying islands building bunkers hiring permanent mercenaries that live with them
[39:56.840 --> 40:02.120]  trying to buy off local constabulary former hedge fund partner tells Davos
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.120]  during session of inequity oh they're having a whole session on inequity they
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.520]  the ones that engineered it all the ones that wanted to lift the ladder up so
[40:12.520 --> 40:15.920]  there'd be no free market the ones that wanted to take the world over bankrupt it
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.520]  poses savers and come back in with a worldwide Marshall plan to fix the
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.720]  global depression just like George Soros had a Marshall plan for Greece four years
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.200]  ago and he's got a Marshall plan last year and this year if they'll just give
[40:29.200 --> 40:35.040]  him billions of dollars he'll fix everything and he'll bring the money in
[40:35.040 --> 40:44.380]  did you guys ever find that George Soros wants Marshall plan for Ukraine so we
[40:44.380 --> 40:51.360]  do have ambassador yeah you're on air right now right yes sir oh great great
[40:51.360 --> 40:54.320]  very newland used to they wouldn't be on air when they're talking to people how
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.200]  I was talking to myself that's good yeah do we have that clip yes sir okay while
[40:58.200 --> 41:02.400]  you're doing that just search Soros wants Marshall plan for Ukraine I mean if
[41:02.400 --> 41:04.760]  we can't find that I'm I don't know what's going on you guys are doing a
[41:04.760 --> 41:07.600]  great job but I mean I remember that exact headline so it should be there
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.560]  let's go ahead and play her admitting they got 5 billion to overthrow Ukraine
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.720]  and then again Soros said the same thing on CNN here it is since Ukraine's
[41:16.720 --> 41:21.400]  independence in 1991 the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build
[41:21.400 --> 41:26.480]  democratic skills and institutions as they promote civic participation in good
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.600]  governance all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.480]  European aspirations we've invested over five billion dollars to assist Ukraine
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.800]  in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and
[41:39.800 --> 41:46.200]  democratic Ukraine that's another one there's another one where she specifically
[41:46.200 --> 41:51.360]  says in the last four years we've spent five billion but there you go and it
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.000]  again we can pull up the clip of him on CNN admitting that he was instrumental
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.760]  behind Ukraine starting it remember the police being firebombed buildings being
[42:00.760 --> 42:03.920]  burned down our media saying their freedom fighters just like the Muslim
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.560]  Brotherhood were freedom fighters taking over in Egypt and blowing up charges
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.960]  and crucifying Christians and murdering everybody and CIA Anderson Cooper since
[42:13.960 --> 42:18.120]  there were straight faces is a great thing the reason I get into this for
[42:18.120 --> 42:20.720]  40 something minutes instead of all the other news and I'm about to get into that
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.920]  is that if you understand this you understand everything there is a
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.760]  global destabilization program and when they destabilize Ireland or destabilize
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.920]  Greece or destabilize Ukraine or destabilize Mexico in fact they shipped
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.520]  hundreds of thousands of guns in started a drug war down there we told you ten
[42:39.520 --> 42:42.960]  years ago a giant drug war was about to begin in Mexico that was meant to break
[42:42.960 --> 42:46.080]  the country down and being run by the West that Los Zetas was being trained
[42:46.080 --> 42:51.560]  outside the King Ranch in South Texas a D agent told us this and was set up and
[42:51.560 --> 42:57.600]  arrested about a month after Celica still fact that was in the news Marshall
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.560]  planned for Mexico ten billion proposed to stabilize and then again that ten
[43:02.560 --> 43:10.320]  billion is then pumped through directly to the key players who basically just
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.080]  take the money they create the crisis loot the country then have a bailout
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.760]  which they then keep I know I keep just repeating different examples of this
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.500]  there it is Mexico a country in crisis needs a fix the size of the Marshall
[43:23.500 --> 43:33.400]  plan see boom what is that daily beast yes sir so it's the same story over and
[43:33.400 --> 43:37.000]  over again see they found that one it's always the same Marshall plan Marshall
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.240]  plan Marshall plan that's after they funded Hitler turned him loose he didn't
[43:41.240 --> 43:44.060]  work for the West he was put in power by British intelligence in the US
[43:44.060 --> 43:48.640]  government on record time magazine time of the year twice my grandfather used to
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.000]  hear him on Dallas radio they would translate his speeches and say what a
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.680]  hero he was and then they turned on him once he started invading countries he'd
[43:57.680 --> 44:01.360]  made a deal had a secret treaty that's been declassified that's why they kept
[44:01.360 --> 44:06.200]  Albert spear and others locked up so long to cover it up that's why they
[44:06.200 --> 44:11.400]  never let the deputy for Rudolph hess out of the tower was because he
[44:11.400 --> 44:16.920]  parachuted in with the treaty and was going to make a big deal out of it that
[44:16.920 --> 44:22.120]  we had a treaty to secretly launch a war take over all these countries that's
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.640]  why at Dunkirk they didn't bomb the British expeditionary force when it was
[44:26.640 --> 44:31.640]  stuck on the beach for five days even though Heinrich Himmler that was
[44:31.640 --> 44:34.560]  Herman Göring the head of the Luftwaffe could have taken them all out
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.080]  because they had a deal folks it was all a stage to then just like they had a
[44:39.080 --> 44:42.440]  deal with the French for the French military to stand down and then to give
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.200]  the beachy fascist control which they did the French collaborators just got
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.040]  the car keys to France they stood down the Blitzkrieg didn't do anything it
[44:52.040 --> 44:57.200]  just rolled over the marginal line almost every general stood down the
[44:57.200 --> 45:02.200]  French were betrayed he'll make these jokes that the French don't fight and
[45:02.200 --> 45:07.120]  can't fight the French lost millions of people in World War one the French were
[45:07.120 --> 45:11.040]  the most warlike country in Europe for hundreds of years dominating
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.760]  everything Napoleon ran around killing millions the point is is they just stood
[45:16.760 --> 45:20.840]  down just like the Iraqis not once but twice because they've been working for
[45:20.840 --> 45:25.840]  the CIA previously where allies had been paid off in some cases 50 million
[45:25.840 --> 45:35.200]  dollars this has now been declassified as well per general to stand down so then
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.360]  they had a Marshall plan for private interest with the Bilderberg group to
[45:39.360 --> 45:43.720]  come in and take over all of Europe and they did it so that's how you get the
[45:43.720 --> 45:46.980]  infrastructure of a country you trick it into a war then you have the country
[45:46.980 --> 45:51.520]  lose the war you take it over or you just infiltrate cause riots have a
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.000]  political party you fund to destabilize bring things down you then double
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.920]  cross them bring in your new party that supposedly is gonna fix everything this
[45:58.920 --> 46:02.080]  is why we don't just want mindless revolutions in this country because
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.480]  most the time their hijacked or already controlled we want a restoration to
[46:07.480 --> 46:13.160]  transparency and a constitutional republic but yes the elites are
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.960]  preparing and digging in for a long global depression which they will then
[46:16.960 --> 46:22.040]  emerge from as the saviors with a global socialist communist carbon tax
[46:22.040 --> 46:28.720]  redistribution worldwide Marshall plan which Davos is calling for of wealth
[46:28.720 --> 46:33.840]  redistribution and free health care that means you pay more of what you earn
[46:33.840 --> 46:36.940]  into private corporations to run government-controlled health care that
[46:36.940 --> 46:41.840]  gives you death panels oh you'll get free health care you just won't get the
[46:41.840 --> 46:47.680]  surgery ever maybe one percent will get surgeries and they'll be on the news
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.280]  thanking the government for their surgery and saying how great the national
[46:51.280 --> 46:57.280]  health services this is a plan you want to be slaves folks this is it and George
[46:57.280 --> 47:05.640]  Soros was willing at 15 16 17 years old to know how the Jews were hiding to be
[47:05.640 --> 47:09.160]  able to infiltrate the Jews they'll find out where they were at and to be able to
[47:09.160 --> 47:15.520]  then rob them of their family's wealth he'd promise them safe passage out he'd
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.400]  shut them up take their money and laugh at him and he's gonna laugh at you and
[47:19.400 --> 47:28.560]  your family because he's liberal he loves you in your family you know how
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.280]  dangerous it is to get a pair to actually attack him I don't care just
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.520]  expect him to pull some stuff and I'm ready for it because somebody's got to
[47:36.520 --> 47:41.240]  stand up against these sacks so you know what and maybe we are done maybe we
[47:41.240 --> 47:48.160]  should be conquered by some 87 year old bag of pus some pus flap maybe that is
[47:48.160 --> 47:54.000]  who we are maybe that's who we want to be maybe we should just you know hey Alex
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.200]  well what's your problem you why do you like the cops abusing us I'm against the
[47:58.200 --> 48:01.640]  police state I fought the police state I tried to reform the police before the
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.120]  globalist took them over now they got them ready for civil war and the cops
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.760]  are having that moment of thought going man this stuff's really happening Alex
[48:09.760 --> 48:14.760]  Jones was right other people were right Ron Paul was right do we want to have a
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.640]  civil war just because George Soros says so we need to have that debate right now
[48:18.640 --> 48:24.280]  we know the enemy program we know the entire enemy operation we just have to
[48:24.280 --> 48:28.520]  sit here and watch them win while they're digging in in Luxembourg and
[48:28.520 --> 48:38.120]  Grand Cayman while they're digging in in Monte Carlo while they're digging in in
[48:38.120 --> 48:44.520]  most the elite as I said I got really criticized for this in mainstream media
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.120]  whenever bunch of big directors and the guy that made aliens and made the
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.960]  Titanic what's his name he made James Cameron James Cameron thank you you
[48:54.960 --> 49:00.440]  know he ran to New Zealand I mean I know a bunch of Hollywood people as
[49:00.440 --> 49:03.600]  everyone knows whatever reason a lot of most of the show because there's a sick
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.520]  of left-right garbage I know people that know James Cameron just leave it at
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.920]  that James Cameron was given the word to leave the United States I said that
[49:13.920 --> 49:20.240]  four years ago before he left the United States and they're mainly going to
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.120]  New Zealand which is obviously showing the globalists are going to leave that
[49:24.120 --> 49:31.200]  alone I tell you every gut level fleshly worldly evil instinct I've got is take
[49:31.200 --> 49:37.240]  my family get to New Zealand take my family get to New Zealand take my
[49:37.240 --> 49:40.720]  family get to New Zealand but you know what I'm going to put my kids on the
[49:40.720 --> 49:45.280]  table I'm going to put them I'm going to put everything on the roulette wheel
[49:45.280 --> 49:50.440]  I'm about everything I got on black to steal something from an excellent movie
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.400]  the gambler a remake with Mark Wahlberg and I you know what I'm not a gambler
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.080]  but I don't have a choice I'm just putting it all on America just like my
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.080]  ancestors did coming over in those leaky boats and all the rest of it just like
[50:02.080 --> 50:05.680]  they did fighting Santa Ana and a bunch of them dying I'm putting everything on
[50:05.680 --> 50:12.760]  black boom baby which means truth and justice and prosperity and freedom not
[50:12.760 --> 50:16.960]  in the red blood of revolution and world government I believe we can beat
[50:16.960 --> 50:22.600]  these people ladies and gentlemen but I'm putting everything I got against this
[50:22.600 --> 50:29.600]  my name my life my treasure my children my soul my will my commitment
[50:29.600 --> 50:35.640]  everything my will most importantly my spirit that's what your will is my
[50:35.640 --> 50:42.480]  spirit I place my spirit animated by God's light directly in the way of the
[50:42.480 --> 50:45.480]  enemy and if and if I'm run over destroyed that's God's plan I don't
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.920]  blame God I thank God if God just took me and just threw me right up against the
[50:49.920 --> 50:54.440]  new old order and broke every bone in my body I thank God forever that is a
[50:54.440 --> 50:59.120]  blessing we'll be right back stay with us we've got a lot of news coming up
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.160]  this is Sharon Hunt before using hard and body extract my energy level was very

[54:25.360 --> 54:29.720]  could you not get excited with a bunch of crooks setting up world government
[54:29.720 --> 54:32.760]  that make their money out of getting government contracts and banker bailouts
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.160]  and have created 2,000 plus trillion of garbage derivatives counterfeit and
[54:39.160 --> 54:42.720]  have signed us on to it and the former head of the Federal Reserve goes on
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.240]  Lair News Hour and says we're above the law Congress cannot affect us and we
[54:46.240 --> 54:50.240]  run America I mean I can play that clip by the way they found the CNN head
[54:50.240 --> 54:57.480]  line where George Soros says we need a Marshall plan there it is Soros Ukraine
[54:57.480 --> 55:07.200]  needs US Marshall plan or Soros Ukraine needs EU Marshall plan thank you I was
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.600]  going for memory there it is on screen so my point is they wreck it then they
[55:11.600 --> 55:18.880]  bring in their takeover plan as a solution and can George Soros start a
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.040]  civil war in America they threw everything they could the Democrats and
[55:23.040 --> 55:27.720]  MSNBC behind stirring up race riots in this country they effectively got
[55:27.720 --> 55:34.960]  misguided mindless hateful criminals to target white people just like if you
[55:34.960 --> 55:38.640]  hyped up kill black people you might get some horrible misguided white
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.920]  people to go out and do it and it's still going on but they didn't get the
[55:43.920 --> 55:48.480]  mass resistance they wanted only cops are getting shot at everywhere and a few
[55:48.480 --> 55:52.800]  have been killed here and there but it hasn't started the big civil war like
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.760]  they got in Egypt or like they got in Ukraine or like they got in other areas
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.120]  and it's because we still have a lot of wealth in this country they're trying to
[56:01.120 --> 56:06.040]  suck it all out as fast as they can all are clowered and piven which is one of
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.920]  their admitted plans to bankrupt the society so there's riots nationwide so
[56:10.920 --> 56:14.760]  they have a pretext to take over and by the way I don't just know this

[56:35.160 --> 56:40.560]  Greg Paulist but let me get Greg Paulist on about this soon and Greg Paulist came
[56:40.560 --> 56:46.320]  on and released the documents and in the plan was how to create social unrest to
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.040]  cause riots a war with the police that will further devalue the currency and
[56:51.040 --> 56:56.000]  the country so the globalist can come in with a Marshall plan to take over same
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.680]  deal that's what they're trying to get ready while they build their armored

[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.040]  went into an hour-long rant but I don't apologize for it because the master plan
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.120]  is a global destabilization program and global civil war where the police and

[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.720]  because that's what helps the poor people and unfortunately the average poor

[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:35.240]  what is actually unfolding and it is extremely sad to say the least ladies

[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.880]  brain so again a lot of this is just the media announcing something that's
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.520]  already there but they had robo rats robo roaches 25 years ago they could
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.360]  remote control biological androids a rat turned into a cyborg system could
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.800]  deliver optical signals and drugs directly into the brain could lead to
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.360]  devices for treatment of conditions such as Parkinson's yes it has a lot of
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.680]  great great applications the problem is Trojan horse systems are being built

[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.600]  warning of wealth inequity when they're the very robber barons engineered this
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:38.360]  on record oh the feds are worried that your toaster could get hacked or your
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.640]  TV could be watching you even though they have the international meetings
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.840]  years ago to have this all added ubiquitously in an integrated standardized
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:54.360]  system worldwide now they're gonna warn us about it and charge you with felonies
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.560]  if you hack into your neighbor's camera but the feds they're they're not hacked
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.560]  in why they're just jacked in think about how incredible that is and that Sam
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.680]  sung two months ago came out and said yeah your camera and your and your
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.560]  microphone all our new TVs third parties recorded we sell the data and even said
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.800]  so watch what you say they said so watch what you say here not you buy our
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:25.960]  $3,000 TV buddy you watch what you say because we're such a free society see
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.400]  they're going so over the top they just think you'll go into a learned helplessness
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.640]  catatonic state now John Draper hacked into the CIA phones called up Richard
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.440]  Nixon famously was put in prison for it he's helped an enormous list of
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.320]  individuals mostly in tech and hacking world he invented a lot of stuff that
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.160]  Apple uses I got no money for it contributing to the foundation of many
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.000]  gadgets we have today also called president Nixon to tell him Los Angeles
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.960]  is running on a bullet paper so you like he has such a humor no need we've got
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.760]  to have that you go crazy you got to be crazy or you'll go nuts as all of us who
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.280]  are crazy no known as captain crunch for his legendary phone freaking Draper has
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.480]  always been driven by passion and not money now the point was not just to make
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.040]  free calls but to explore and learn from the phone companies rich and
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.320]  sophisticated system complicated system despite his many contributions to
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.160]  companies is Apple where he wrote the first word processor called easy writer
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.240]  for Apple to crunch is not a wealthy man and you know you the listeners help
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.640]  getting from collapse level and medical level could even died to now being back
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.320]  on his feet quite literally so captain crunch I want to spend the whole
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.560]  interview thanking folks we want to thank you but give folks an update on where
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.280]  you are you look a lot better look a lot healthier and then let's get into what's
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.440]  happening around the world with the first hacker go ahead thank you very
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.000]  much Alex first off I want to thank you for having me on last October because
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.800]  it turns out that one of your viewers dr. D heard my interview on your last show
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:07.840]  and is now offering me free stem cell treatments here in Bangkok Thailand
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.720]  which is where I'm at now it's like 1.14 a.m. in the morning here well thank you
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.360]  for coming on and of course you also wanted to thank the listeners yeah and
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.800]  also want to thank all those people who contributed to my to my healing fund
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:31.800]  unfortunately PayPal has basically withheld more than half of the money owed
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:38.440]  to me because a lot of my donors have not yet confirmed their pledge to my fund
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:45.080]  so if you've made a pledge to my fund and have not received an email message
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.600]  more than likely you will have received it by now please respond to that email
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.480]  message by clicking on a link I think it's going to have an embedded link in
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.160]  there that will take you to your PayPal and all you have to do is just confirm
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.400]  everything and that's all you really have to do and PayPal would release some of
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.160]  that money to me which would be greatly appreciated right now you bet I know
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.000]  you're famous for never asking for anything and then you ended up basically
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.400]  with nothing in the end you need to write a tell-all book and get it published
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.360]  or you'll be part of a documentary and hopefully the documentary filmmakers
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.040]  would cut you on the profits because either so many iconic famous people who
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.840]  end up penniless I mean you could use Van Gogh as an example Alex he never had
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.040]  anything that's exactly what I'm working on right here in Thailand I'm working
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.360]  with my friend Aaron getting who's a longtime friend of mine been around for
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.840]  many many years and he is probably knows me more than any of my other friends he
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.960]  lives here in Bangkok and I have an opportunity to work with him while I'm
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.880]  here very exciting maybe we can get you out on the street somebody to a Skype
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.240]  interview from a busy pedestrian area that'd be a powerful image shifting
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.840]  gotta remember though Alex it's one in the morning here oh I know I'm saying
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.600]  sometime we ought to actually get you out on the street with a live Skype fee
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.960]  we're already got some photos of you in Thailand that we're showing viewers right
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.760]  now looks like a very very rich culture it is indeed there are street bears right
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.640]  right near where I'm I'm actually in this in the CELOM district and I have a
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.640]  flat here and I just have to walk a short distance down an alleyway and I get
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.720]  all these little street vendors and the food is insanely inexpensive here it's
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.160]  amazing how's your back there's really nice too because it hasn't rained at all
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.240]  and being in the tropics you could expect a lot of rain but every day has been
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.480]  clear and sunny and warm and tropical how's your back doing it's a little
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.040]  painful at times but the stem cells are are working I have to give it some time
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.360]  it's I feel kind of up and down it depends on you know how I feel and what
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.680]  my stress level is I'm doing my best to try to keep things under control all right
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.040]  I've got a bunch of news I want to go over NSA brain ships I want to break it
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.040]  all down with you today but first off looking at the panopticonic system the
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.960]  premeditated rollout of these big corporations and government they announced
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.400]  in England yesterday we'll put that article up on screen for viewers that
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.360]  they're going to use the new boxes in the cars the tax folks by the mile and to
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.920]  take control of their engines to quote you know cut back on greenhouse gas how
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.040]  nice of them see they're going to survey loss to save the earth the head of the
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.760]  CIA said your washing machine is watching you now US watchdog urges
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.480]  safeguards for Internet of Things French news agency a US government
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.400]  consumer watchdog agency called Tuesday for better privacy and security to be
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.920]  built into the myriad of connected devices for fitness smart homes or other
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:53.200]  uses what do you make of that I mean it's totally insane I can't believe it
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.560]  you know next thing you know you're not watching your TV the TV watching you well
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:04.200]  that's now happening did you see where Samsung told people in in the purchase
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.480]  ticket they had a contract people read it and it said we are going to be watching
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.000]  and listening to you yeah I haven't actually seen the specific thing you
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.320]  know just like this new NSA revelation came out this query this QWERTY what
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.440]  was it a Trojan it smells and it looks just like the Trojan that the hackers
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:32.920]  released earlier and it's amazing and I wonder where they got that Trojan from
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:40.320]  hmm sure sure so most of the time a lot of the nasty black hat worms and and
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.560]  Trojans out there it's come out come from our loving friends at the NSA or FBI
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.960]  well yeah I'm talking about the RE the region Trojan the region Trojan smells
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.520]  just like the QWERTY Trojan and the QWERTY Trojan was one of the Trojans
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.280]  that was released in one of the Snowden documents sure exactly that's what I'm
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.760]  saying I mean I read the news every day and it actually comes out that most the
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.760]  really nasty Trojans and things are produced by our loving government yeah
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.160]  and of course the hackers have been contributing and doing most of the heavy
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.840]  lifting by writing the Trojans themselves and the NSA just repurposes them
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.960]  for their own use isn't that loving we're about to go to break Captain Crunch
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.400]  tell us what you want to cover first when we come back okay what are some of the
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.680]  things that are on your mind right now I do want to talk a little bit about

[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:23.040]  usually in there a month or two months a year before it's in the financial times
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.120]  of London or the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times malicious rain
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.800]  malware created by NSA researchers believe and then you look at the science
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.400]  they've got all the data in here it's extremely clear that that's exactly
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:43.840]  what's going on and that's what Captain Crunch the first and top hacker computer
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:48.920]  hacking whistling into telephones and vending the science of taking them over
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:55.960]  by basically voice command I mean just truly a savant at every level when it
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:00.160]  came to that this is a short segment long segment coming up he'd love to hear
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.240]  from you and take your calls questions or comments for Captain Crunch you can
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.880]  also tweet them at us at real Alex Jones just to send your tweets over there
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:19.800]  they'll bring some of those into me as well 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 your
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.200]  chance to talk to the first and undisputed greatest hacker in history
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:31.760]  they could argue that some of the other people have are notorious as well but
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:37.560]  certainly not as notorious as Captain Crunch and nothing he did was nefarious
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.000]  as well but going back to Captain Crunch your take on the Sony hack let's
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.480]  spend some time on that well yeah according to reports I've been getting
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:54.000]  there's a really good article in deadline comm which has a very good
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.600]  timeline for the Sony hack and according to this timeline Sony's
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:07.560]  computers were pretty much capped out for seven days and even longer and this
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:13.080]  allegation that North Korea had something to do with it well I kind of
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:18.560]  suspected that that might be the case but I wouldn't say it was directly hacked
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:25.120]  from North Korea it was probably hacked from some agent working for Kim Joon
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:31.360]  or whatever his name is you know what I mean as far as releasing that
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.280]  information go you're saying physically they don't have the components to do it
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.040]  if it was Kim Jong-un he'd have to hire a mercenary contractor he'd have to he'd
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.960]  have to he'd have to go outside the country because their internet
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:50.080]  infrastructure sucks I mean literally yeah I mean they can't even keep their
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.960]  automobiles operating on their computers are about 30 years old yeah and
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.200]  yeah and their connection I believe they're getting most of their connections
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.200]  from China which is just across the river so you know who knows right well
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.960]  that's right what do you make of them using the hack as most evidence shows
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.600]  it was an inside job using the hack as a pretext to pass things like sopa and
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:22.480]  syspa yeah that's that's definitely true you know who knows really really how it
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.280]  all happened I'm sure they're gonna keep that pretty secret but but the fact
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:33.600]  that it's an inside job doesn't surprise me in the least I mean I I lived and
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.320]  worked near Hollywood for the greater portion of the last seven years and
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.200]  working for companies that that today would put you to that a business had we
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.520]  had our investors not backed out but we were about ready to turn Hollywood on
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.080]  its side and and I understand how these movie movie companies work up until
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.880]  recently that the movie companies have been like military bases you know you
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.040]  can't get on these on these lots anymore I mean used to have tour go through
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.320]  there not anymore because they're all really paranoid about their movies
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:15.720]  getting leaked out well that's right even working at Sony that their blue
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.360]  right DVD plants they body scan the employees up in Chicago to get in and
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.880]  out oh it doesn't surprise me in the least I suspect pretty much anybody that
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.720]  works for any of the movie companies Warner Brothers Fox or whatever they
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.800]  are they're all going to be very very highly scrutinized and a lot of these
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.640]  movie companies they'll often share resources with other movie companies as
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:43.080]  well like Walt Disney might you know might work with work with NBC or with
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:48.120]  Universal Studios and a lot of these studios have cross-pollination between
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.960]  them so if one studio doesn't have the equipment then another studio will pitch
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.880]  in and get right interlocking corporate directorates absolutely that's
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.200]  probably what it's all about yeah sure well that's what Davos the Bilderberg
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:08.120]  group the New World Order is all about a tiny cabal of really anti-free market
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.560]  people posing as capitalist trying to consolidate the world market under their
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:18.000]  control when we come back in this next long segment Captain Crunch I want to

[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.280]  brain be hacked or has it already been hacked by propaganda but will it be
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:34.760]  digitally hacked that and more is coming up here's the headline real life

[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:41.560]  over a cliff on his lectern you know basically pointing at the sky I guess
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:50.120]  they just updated it and then it shows the population on the other end and if
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:55.000]  they simply step off the plank he's going to fall over the edge a great way to
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.480]  reach out to people is to basically start a YouTube channel start a local web

[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.320]  done this is the only brand we know of because we went out and had it developed
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:12.160]  that is from crystal deep earth pure real iodine not processed stuff out of
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.560]  seaweed that they claim is nason iodine and isn't nason iodine turns bright blue
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.800]  on paper not black or red no one else's that we've seen believe me we were
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.000]  selling out of it we were trying to find another distributor another place to
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.920]  get it we finally found another with even more deep earth crystals and that's
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.960]  what we've got here I mean this is hard to get ladies and gentlemen the raw stuff
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.240]  before it goes into the organic palm oil gases it a little crystal a little
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.760]  blue purple crystal turns into purple gas I mean that's that's what this stuff
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.040]  does in your body is it just races through grabbing the bad halogens binding
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:56.520]  to them and taking them out now you will detox I mean I recommend you take a
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.120]  low dose of this when you first take it or talk to your physician whatever you
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.680]  do because this is not a game okay this is not a game this is something you'll
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:09.880]  die without and then the forms of item we have are just not the truly pure
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:16.600]  forms so that's why info wars x2 is so special info wars life calm you can get

[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.960]  that said I want to go to calls captain crunch able Julio Jacob Patton and many
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:04.000]  others that have called in 800 259 92 31 but I want to get into your latest
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.400]  project but first those those big gestalts those big questions you're a
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.760]  trailblazer we can spend three hours talking about all the wild stuff you've
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.960]  done the amazing stuff things the Pentagon thought was impossible things you
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.720]  showed them things they then employed against the Russians and other folks a
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:24.480]  lot of it classified we can't obviously probably can't get into a lot of it or
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.320]  you wouldn't maybe get in trouble but before we go any further where does your
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.200]  gut tell you humanities going what do you think of the NSA takeover what do
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.120]  you think of the global elite where do you see humanity going well that's a
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.640]  good question it's really hard to tell I was really so surprised when the
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.600]  Snowden revolutions came out actually I really wasn't that surprised I kind of
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.760]  suspected that they had access to the ability of decrypting like PGP and
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.680]  things like that I mean if you use a ridiculously small key yeah they're
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.320]  going to they're going to crack your PGP code for sure but if you use OTR like
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:07.160]  wicker WICKR for Android in the iPad or iPhone that's that's really great well
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.040]  I want to just mention something that I'm working on here which really goes in
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.080]  line with protecting your privacy and Glenn Greenwald listen to this because
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.880]  you're going to love this we've designed and successfully created an amazing
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.360]  security product that we're very excited to share more details with the general
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.760]  public we're still in stealth mode currently conducting real-world testing
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.920]  with small companies in non-disposed cities evaluating results refining and
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.440]  making tweaks to accommodate a much larger audience very soon we're focusing
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:44.800]  on a public launch on the 4th of July 2015 internet independence day starting
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.880]  this summer you will be able to use Thunder cloud in the comfort of your own
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.840]  home or business with any existing software operating system or device
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:58.320]  we've created our own cryptographic language that is completely independent
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.800]  of any existing security technology our strength is built within our proprietary
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.960]  design of the public and private cryptographic keys these use a 1
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.880]  billion-bit key that rotates randomly every five seconds these keys are
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.720]  controlled entirely by the user no information is ever stored the size of
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.800]  our standard encryption key is an excessive of a terabyte data block
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.800]  however this is also key factor what makes our technology so exciting since
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.880]  it's transmitted in the space of 200 kilobytes and will confirm any existing
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:36.280]  method of data storage or communication without any overhead most security keys
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.680]  range from 128 bit to 40 96 bits and these are easily transmittable and
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.320]  transmitted and fairly small since these keys are so small cracking security
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:51.120]  keys in the size is fairly easy with enough computational power existing
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.800]  security and cryptographic technology that is in use is no longer safe in
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.480]  recent events even RSA crypto was discovered to have back doors and our
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.480]  system is designed from the ground up to be impossible to breach or forcibly to
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:12.120]  decode using every super computer in the world in tandem it is estimated that
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.880]  the process take over 30 million years or five seconds for five seconds worth
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.400]  of transmitted or stored information our website will officially soft launch
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:28.560]  February 13th 2015 my Thunder cloud comm at this time there will be a sign-up
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.120]  page available we will be inviting users to sign up for our closed public beta
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.680]  invitations will be limited to only 1,000 users so first come first serve
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.600]  mark it on your calendar this is a date you don't want to miss we will never
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:47.280]  keep track of our users or attempt to monetize our their privacy by design
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.400]  there is no tracking elements built in and to add them would be technically
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.280]  impossible our product is designed by the necessary to keep our freedom free
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.520]  and the nice thing about it is you can travel across international borders and
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.720]  they're not going to be able to examine your data at all it's so cool that's
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.840]  what I want well pop in for a 10-15 minute interview the day you launch that
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:17.080]  I know you're working with some top folks on that and that's very very exciting
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:23.680]  captain crunch you bet brother captain crunch is our guest captain crunch I
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.240]  want to go to some of these Twitter questions and phone calls now if there
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.080]  isn't anything else you want to get to first oh no I'm pretty much cool about
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:38.120]  that go ahead what does captain crunch think xzac to mount ass and on at
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.960]  Twitter that's a mouthful these handles what does captain crunch think about AI
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.560]  how does he see technology going in the next five to ten years I guess that ties
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.800]  into my question about these wirehead interfaces will people recede into the
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.800]  matrix I mean what's your gut about technology what's your view on AI well
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.760]  it sounds like it's kind of going that way doesn't it it does faithful
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:11.360]  recognition speech recognition and with drones of course and all these other
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.880]  technologies that are out there I mean I was at the CES show in Las Vegas just
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.560]  people are coming out here to Bangkok and I was very impressed with what they
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.680]  what they've got out there you know what I mean at the CES show you know the
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:28.720]  and all these different products out there you know like 3d printers you
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.000]  know could ever thought right that you could print your own favorite little
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.840]  item yeah there's amazing applications for good humanity but I look at the
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.240]  establishment that craves power and nothing more and craves monopoly they're
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.880]  just already creating hellish stuff autonomous drones the British named
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:55.120]  theirs BAE systems named it tyranny I mean also I might want to add that there's
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:02.440]  also a drone bot out now that can that can basically Trojan into your AR drone
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:08.600]  that's the made by parrot a company in in France use your iPhone to control a
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:15.960]  quadcopter and and I saw a video of a demonstration of somebody planting a
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:21.440]  Trojan into a drone we are aware of that what do you make of the of the
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.560]  Internet of Things in this article by Paul Watson that's up on info worst calm
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.000]  where the British government is announcing that they're going to be
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.360]  hacking into all the smart cars and and taxing you and also controlling your
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.960]  speed you name it I mean that they are really flaunting this oh that's crazy
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.760]  that's totally that's totally nuts I can't believe they're doing that that's
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:52.240]  just nuts I mean you know here you I actually saw a demonstration of a hack
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.560]  into a car into a car system I think it was a Chevy I'm not sure what it was but
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.760]  they actually hacked into the car and they were able to they were able to do
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:08.400]  basically take out the braking system and I've seen this demonstrated on
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.920]  YouTube so this there are hacks out there for cars right now and you know
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.720]  where it's going well we know what happened on 9-11 there's a lot of
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.640]  evidence those jet aircraft were actually hacked nerve gas was released and
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.760]  then they could get rid of the patsy's the question is who did the hacking and
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.840]  those planes were fitted with those systems here's another question will
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:35.080]  there be a time when humanity wishes for an EMP electromagnetic pulse reset of
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:42.160]  technology well that I don't know that's kind of wishful thinking but I do want to
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.600]  have this I do have to say something in my years experience in the US Air Force
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:53.760]  64-68 I was definitely briefed on the effects of nuclear explosions and in
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.880]  fact I personally have I have actually won one of very few people that have
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.800]  actually witnessed the fireball explosion of a nuke going up in Nevada in
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:09.720]  1962 one of the tests in Nevada and I know firsthand what one of those nukes
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:15.160]  can do to to your electronics and this remember this I was driving I was in a
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:20.680]  car that had a 12-volt system it had a tube radio and the radio was totally
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:24.920]  toast the ignition system was totally toast and we weren't that far away from
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.720]  ground zero we somehow managed to slip through the checkpoints and got about as
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.080]  close as we can get to ground zero before that sucker went off and I was in
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.840]  the driver's side of the car and I can remember I had my hand and I'm hanging
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.600]  out the window when that fireball went off and you know I noticed I got a nasty
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.960]  blistering on my arm afterwards and then then when a shockwave hit we'd
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.200]  luckily we had to position the car in such a way that wouldn't knock us off the
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.960]  road because you could see this big wall of dust coming toward us toward our car
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:59.480]  and this is crazy man I mean we it took us we we never did get the radio fix it
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.160]  was just totally toast we had to rewire our ignition wires of our car because of
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:10.400]  the MP effects I mean it's crazy and I want to have an EP absolutely absolutely
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:15.480]  let's go let's go to some phone calls here for captain crutch who's on the line
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.080]  with us right now we've got more Twitter questions coming up able then we'll go
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.880]  to Patton and then Julio and others able you're on the air hello yes hi Alex
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.520]  Jones first up I just want to give you kudos I know you hate to be think there
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.800]  or whatever the shit is but you are the man I'm watching right now in prison
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.960]  planet and I just want to give this I've been watching this and it's like man I
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:45.480]  was an honor to be on this show you know John it's awesome I am I am a noob but
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:49.120]  what I can say since I've been watching I got into you through Alex Jones and I
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.080]  am thankful to God I give thanks to God that you know you're on your shoulders
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.000]  on that you're able to reach people I tell my family about you anyways um I'm
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.880]  interested in like communication I want to be able let's say that the stuff it's
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.880]  the fan right I want to be able to keep in touch with my family I want to be
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.280]  able to to be independent to have my own my own story that's awesome able the
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.600]  first big part of communication is turn off your radio when you call and talk
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.520]  radio because then we can hear you and not the echo so turn your radio off and
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.640]  then go ahead and ask a question
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  basically I would okay theoretically I would just I love the idea of having my
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.760]  own cell phone my own independent cell phone just me like like you know what I'm
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.000]  saying I more and more there are private networks and groups setting up
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.240]  communities via Skype and things I'm one of our IT guys like six seven eight
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:47.280]  years ago that works mesh networks able that's a great idea and it's being done
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.920]  let's let's get Captain crunches take on that what do you think of Abel's
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:56.440]  question or comment yeah I think people need to have better communication you
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.320]  know one of the apps I use is wicker WICKR it uses a perfect part security
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:07.120]  it's OTR off the record no record of the conversation is being made 256 AES
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:13.600]  no great encryption and it's very easy to use well that's what's great all these
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.200]  wonderful apps are coming out that have so many layers built in and notice the
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.240]  NSA and others want encryption stopped Obama has been saying oh because of
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.160]  Charlie Hebdo we need to get rid of encryption for the public those guys
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.040]  were public about what they were gonna do you can't take our right to privacy
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:35.000]  away never happen because you know what's gonna happen
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:42.120]  all crooks will have encryption and the John Q public won't but exactly the
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:47.200]  government has no right to keep encryption away from us you know just
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.960]  like guns absolutely is that what you just said yeah exactly I mean and what's

[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:17.000]  couple of ways I want to fire a broadside volley straight at the face of the
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.520]  new world order and I thought two ideas that I can maybe do that maybe you'll
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:27.520]  agree with me I want to appeal for my republic I'm not above begging I want
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.320]  to appeal to Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu they have to be best
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.560]  intelligence gathering services of the world I know they have the information
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:46.000]  we need to bring down the criminals Barack Obama and John Bainard I know
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.520]  they have the information we need to bring those two down if we can get real
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.920]  Americans back into our government we can stop those sanctions as crippled
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.760]  rushes economy and we can move together move forward together in peace there's
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:07.360]  no need for another world for another world war just because a few globalists
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:12.840]  thinks they can profit from I agree with you Patton and undoubtedly you're gonna
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.960]  have problems in government always but we have people running our government
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:20.080]  bipartisan Lee that premeditated Lee want to wreck the country to take it over
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.440]  and want to turn us into a totalitarian system it's very dangerous thank you for
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.480]  the call captain crunch that's an important call I'm not lionizing as I've
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.720]  said a thousand times probably 500 times exaggerate a thousand but I've said
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:40.520]  hundreds of times I'm not lionizing Putin but the West is starting to fight
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.160]  with Russia and why for special interest what do you think about the state of
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.080]  the world and what America has turned into you know I don't think we should be
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:56.240]  picking on Russia right now really I mean you know I mean they've got things
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.200]  that are very helpful to us and we should help them and they should help us I
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.920]  don't understand why we should engage in commerce and trade with them not try to
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.760]  steal their oil and gas lines and cut them off I mean what is the point of
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:13.400]  that yeah I mean I met some really amazingly amazingly great people in
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.440]  Russia I was there in Russia I went there twice you know and they're they're
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  normal people just like us and you know I mean their government is different than
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:28.600]  ours and we just have to accept that well I know this we have George Soros and
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:32.680]  others offensively trying to start a war with them we got US mercs fighting and
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:39.080]  killing and dying against Spitznets this is dangerous and agree with their and I
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:43.040]  look back at past presidents like Kennedy or Reagan or others who weren't
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.520]  perfect but they weren't doing stuff like this I mean this isn't dangerous to be
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.240]  on Russia's doorstep punching them in the nose and then through our media tell
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.000]  the public that you know nothing's happening I want to five more minutes

[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.840]  morning mr. Draper an interesting document I just came across the FBI's
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.360]  information sharing document of 2011 it's quite interesting it goes into the
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:21.680]  biometric center of excellence at stores face voice recognition DNA
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.520]  recognition and fingerprint technologies it's quite interesting if people
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:31.440]  want to look that up mr. Draper my question to you is about peer-to-peer
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:38.080]  and torrenting I since I moved to Wyoming from Chicago I decided to ditch TV I
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.440]  torrent stream all you know anything I watch I'm a big advocate of porn and
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:47.000]  peer-to-peer technology want to get your thoughts on what the future of that is
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.840]  and do you have any recommendations on private secure peer-to-peer type type
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.600]  ways that people can communicate or share information yeah I have some things to
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:05.680]  say about torrenting for sure torrenting of course is is the ability of being
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:12.640]  able to share information across multiple servers and so one no one server
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:17.800]  actually has the actual movie that you're interested in downloading if you are
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:25.400]  using some of these ISPs in America like Comcraft I mean Comcast or Cox
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:31.040]  especially Cox and if you're using torrenting they are watching you the
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:40.200]  best thing you can do to get around torrenting is to get on a VPN or a or a
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:47.920]  yeah VPN or some way to mask your IP address and also offer encryption you
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:55.600]  can also get on by sending a SSH and SSH pipe into it and from that all of your
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.920]  data will be encrypted so your ISP can't really tell whether or not you're
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:03.200]  actually running a torrent thank you Julio and the media tries to act like
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.080]  this is because you're a criminal no it's because they have no business what
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.200]  video whether it's an Alex Jones video or some open source video or whatever it
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:16.000]  is it's not their business to preemptively be surveilling you let's go
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.960]  ahead and talk to Alan Marilyn thanks for calling you're only able to cap and
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.400]  crunch yeah thanks guys hey don't you think it's time for people to start
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:27.680]  creating their own individual servers and get rid of the government novel
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.480]  which is Google so that we can start a tax revolt in this country posh plummet
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.120]  style a swarm and get this place back on track and out of the hands of the
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:45.320]  Soros Nazis sounds like a good plan to me anything else now well I just think
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.480]  if we don't congratulate and blow it on the streets and I'm not talking about
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.240]  violence I'm talking about physical beings having our own servers where we
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:58.360]  can communicate without these dogs barking at our ankles all day long we're
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.240]  going to be able to get something done because the other way it's all blockage
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:06.720]  and it's all extortion and it's got to happen now I know this you know these
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.720]  bankers have created a system where they put pressure on us while they're
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.480]  robbing us and then they use the crisis to get more power they've got all the
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:18.920]  angles figured out except us figuring out that it's all a game all a scam and
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:24.360]  their crooks that's why Davos captain crunch sorry yeah you can get hosting

[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.480]  report this is Rob do reporting for info wars.com info wars nightly news and
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:21.760]  this report is an update on two reports that I've filed this month basically in
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.680]  the one I actually filed just over the weekend the first one is about the
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.680]  little girl who died of the flu after taking the flu shot well now there's
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.920]  another little girl that died and addition to the numerous other cases
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:35.280]  that are out there somebody sent me this this morning and said you have to look
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.440]  at this one here's the headline from the Daily Mail girl 5 dies from strain of
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:44.400]  flu she was vaccinated against as deadly epidemic continues to sweep across the
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.520]  US and this is something we're seeing everywhere and the CDC comes out with
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:52.160]  this song and dance I'm about to show you or they say well we guess the wrong
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.760]  strain of flu they didn't guess anything wrong they're deliberately putting
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.280]  this stuff in there so people get the flu but we'll get more more into that in
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.640]  a second a five-year-old girl has died in hospital three days after developing a
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.560]  strain of flu that she was vaccinated against as the deadly outbreak of the
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.160]  virus continues to sweep across the country and once again this article is
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.200]  filled with pictures of this beautiful little girl she loved frozen she loved
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.880]  playing with her friends she liked the color purple they always put this stuff
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:20.480]  in there and it really just tears at my heart reading these stories of parents
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.600]  who are trying to protect their kids from flu and they think they're doing the
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.040]  right thing by getting the vaccine here's more the youngsters the fourth
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:30.560]  child in the Nevada based County in the 56 nationwide to have died in the flu in
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:34.480]  the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective Kara's death
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:38.720]  also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three-quarters of
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:42.360]  people who had the injection which contains strains of influenza a this
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.080]  year will get the virus anyway but even with all the hype about getting your
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.360]  flu vaccine how it's everywhere in the media everywhere in the news you go to
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.640]  every drugstore they're trying to get you to do your flu shot yes 7-eleven
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:59.240]  promoting workers to get their floofy shots it's the worst performing ever
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.640]  since they've been recording this 10 years 10 years now that we're into this
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:07.600]  flu vaccine hysteria and tracking the results so are you gonna get the flu
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.360]  shot are you gonna give it to your kids I'm gonna share with you a little story
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:14.240]  this happened just this past weekend playing football out in the street with
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:19.400]  a bunch of my neighbors and earlier was a week before that my kids weren't allowed
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:23.360]  to play with their kids because they all had the flu it's one family and in
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.520]  talking they said oh yeah well we got all our flu shot injections and we still
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.680]  got it then another neighbor from across the street says they all had their
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.600]  flu shots and three out of the four got the flu and now let's turn to the
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:39.120]  measles outbreak I just put out a report over the weekend
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:44.960]  Disneyland measles outbreak caused by the vaccine question mark and I went
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.440]  through the statistics in the LA Times article saying that five people had
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.480]  gotten it that were vaccinated two out of the five workers that were vaccinated
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:58.280]  got the disease and that's only the ones that they tested well now we got one
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.880]  more measles outbreak traced to Disneyland continues to grow at least
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:07.000]  85 cases are now confirmed in seven states Alaska Health officials are
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.600]  closely monitoring one-year-old Rivki Webb after she tested positive for
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:13.840]  measles this week our mother Emily said the family had just returned from a
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:18.160]  visit to Southern California Rivki had also just received the measles vaccine
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:23.480]  and then you get to the end of this CBS news article and you got a quote from
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:28.000]  the mother who says I want people to be aware and to vaccinate their kids at
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.160]  Emily Webb because the whole reason that she got sick in the first place was
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:35.320]  because people don't vaccinate well if you vaccinate your kid then she should
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:38.840]  be protected from the virus right and in that the whole reason they tell you to
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.920]  get these and that they're safe and effective one then your daughter gets
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:46.560]  it after she'd been vaccinated and I read in the insert in three different
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.280]  spots it says you could get measles are a measles like rash in the insert as one
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:54.640]  of the side effects if people still continue to do it because they don't
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:59.200]  ask for these inserts it's amazing totally amazing but here's wired magazine
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.000]  why did vaccinated people get measles at Disneyland blame the unvaccinated and
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.320]  this is medical error arrogance at its finest right here they they claim
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.000]  because people aren't getting the vaccine that they're making the vaccinated
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  people sick which just defies logic because supposedly if you're vaccinated
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.400]  you're protected from the disease but that's not the case and we find that
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:22.600]  time and time again and it's hard to find these and that's why we really make a
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:25.920]  big deal out of it when we do see it when we see people admitted that hey they
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.000]  were vaccinated but they still got the disease we need to make note of this
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.280]  because they tell you time and time again that you should inject these foreign
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.200]  substances into your bodies and it's going to protect you we have to keep
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:39.080]  these people honest because the CDC that's their job is to get more people
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:43.640]  vaccinated that's the program because most of these CDC heads are former big
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.640]  pharma employees and this is the whole thing when I interviewed Dr. Sherry
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.320]  Tenpenny years ago went up to her office and she said you know Rob this is what
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.440]  I think it is I think that the reason they push these vaccines especially on
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.320]  these young kids is so they become lifelong customers because they're
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.000]  going to see these other problems crop up they may not get have a serious
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.360]  adverse reaction but they'll get something like allergies or they'll get
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.520]  earaches or they'll get tonsillitis something that keeps them coming back
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:16.320]  for more medical care over a hundred years ago
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:20.520]  eugenicist social planners said that they'd use mind-altering drugs to
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:28.080]  control the population by 2007 more than 20% of the US population were on some
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:35.200]  type of prescription antidepressant but in the case of foster children a sector
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.480]  where the state has total control at least two-thirds are forced to take a
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:46.640]  cocktail made up of on average seven psychotropic drugs chairman of the
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:51.200]  Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians Joe Burkett testified before the
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.920]  state house select committee hearing on psychotropic drugs in foster care and
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.320]  shocked the public when he said that two-thirds of foster children in Texas
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:05.560]  had been placed on psychiatric drugs because they were very very sick from a
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:11.560]  bad gene pool a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:16.240]  stable parents making good decisions besides the gene pools they've been
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:18.800]  traumatized by abuse and neglect and problems and then they've been
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:22.160]  traumatized by separation all those things predisposed to mental illness one
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.680]  thing that I really like and I'm amazed by when I put out these vaccine
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:30.640]  reports is the number of people that get on the message board and actually add
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.760]  other clues and links to things that other people can read because I don't
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:38.480]  have time to put it all in one report there's just not enough time in the day
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:41.200]  so I really do appreciate when people put their links down there and let's
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:44.840]  have a debate I'm all for an open honest debate you know a lot of people sent
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:48.360]  this pen and teller thing where they had them throwing bowling balls at little
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:53.560]  targets made up of children and the ones that were vaccinated were protected
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.200]  from the bowling balls and the other ones weren't so they were getting mowed
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.280]  down and a lot of the statistics that they're reporting yeah all these
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.480]  diseases were coming down and but they were coming down before the vaccines
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:06.760]  were ever introduced they never show the beginning of these graphs like when you
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:09.560]  see polio coming down to here and then the vaccines introduced and it drops
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:14.880]  down to here who was already on its way out that's because of modern hygiene
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.200]  techniques modern plumbing people not sleeping in their clothes over and over
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.920]  again days on end it's a whole lot of things that caused these diseases to go
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:28.640]  down so let's end here with this one article from vac truth that I encourage
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:31.600]  you to go and look at the other source articles that they put in here because
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.440]  it's amazing studies prove without a doubt that unvaccinated children are far
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:41.000]  healthier than their vaccinated peers a 1992 immunization awareness study IAS
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.400]  conducted a survey to examine the health of New Zealand's children unsurprisingly
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.560]  the results of their study indicate that unvaccinated children were far
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.720]  healthier than vaccinated children so they interviewed about 245 families
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:58.640]  nearly 500 children participated in this survey here's what they found 92% of
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:02.560]  the children requiring tonsillectomy operation had received the measles
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:06.240]  vaccination indicating that vaccination for measles may have made some of the
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.840]  children susceptible to tonsillitis but then it goes into another study that was
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.800]  even more in-depth back in 2011 in Germany in September 2011 German
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.200]  researchers carried out a long-range study surveyed a total of 8,000
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.600]  unvaccinated children from the ages of zero to 19 so the kids that were
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.680]  vaccinated 4.7 suffer from asthma percent 10.7 suffer from hay fever 13.2
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:32.720]  suffer from neuro dermatitis with the unvaccinated children you had asthma at
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:36.840]  2.5% hay fever 3% and neuro dermatitis at 7%
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:42.600]  nearly half compared to the vaccinated children and these aren't big health
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:46.560]  conditions but these are things that determine quality of life I wonder if
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:51.960]  the CDC has conducted or facilitated study comparing vaccinated children with
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:57.160]  unvaccinated children yet have you done that we have not studied vaccinated

[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:45.440]  comes Chris Chris Coverson I was a sailor after Zuckerberg said we are all
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:51.320]  Charlie Facebook sensors Muhammad images I noticed that that's a Breitbart
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:55.840]  article that's up on drugsreport.com Kurt Nemo had one also out this morning
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:02.440]  same thing in infowars.com Facebook blocks images of Muhammad social media
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.720]  giant buckles of pressure from Turkish government and that's a good article by
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:11.160]  Nemo but maybe we probably want to add to this that Zuckerberg you know claims
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:14.520]  he's for free speech but he also calls us users dumb efforts for trusting him
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:25.120]  you dumb efforts you trust me with your info see they enjoy like Gruber laughing
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:29.080]  at their prisoners see hardcore criminals most of them don't do it to
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.720]  survive there's some starving family gets caught breaking into a sword to get
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:36.840]  food how you gonna even charge them with something they're starving in some
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:43.120]  terrible country but the big crimes you know why does a bank robbers sometimes
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.440]  just shoot the clerk when they leave or or shoot a liquor store clerk after
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:52.640]  they've given you the cash because they're scum well the successful criminals
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.640]  their modus operandi their their mindset their profile is basically the same
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.600]  they don't enjoy being honorable they enjoy cheating people and that's the
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:06.240]  type of folks you see at Davos and at Bilderberg that this twits been to both
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.680]  of them with his little Harvard front company he's a total front I mean the
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:14.800]  Facebook's admittedly CIA just like Google it is truly disgusting with its
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.200]  pump and dump and the rest of it now let's continue because this ties into
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:25.280]  that US watchdog are just safeguards for Internet of Things and says that oh my
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:28.560]  gosh all these chips built into everything means it can be hacked and
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:31.760]  taken over yet it's meant to be taken over by the smart meters and government
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:37.080]  hubs and Google cars oh so now they need more surveillance to to stop people
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:43.480]  getting into all your systems meanwhile that ties into this UK government
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:47.760]  announces plan to remotely control vehicles remember that story yesterday and
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:52.520]  and I actually went yesterday and again today because even I can't believe how
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:57.920]  bold they are moving this quick in this article UK government announces plan you

[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:59.240]  lower car about $5,000 wouldn't it is all the spy tech this is from the
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:04.440]  government website in the UK M2M sensors in cars and on roads monitor the
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.480]  buildup of congestion is just magically this has been put in all the cars
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.200]  worldwide now it's all big accident just there's no conspiracy well that matter

[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:53.600]  all-time highs the public just doesn't like to be bullied they just submit to it
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:58.440]  M2M sensors and cars on roads monitor the buildup of congestion and wirelessly
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.240]  send this information to traffic control system which automatically impose a
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:07.000]  variable speed limits that smooth the flow of traffic states OFCOM this system
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.160]  could also communicate directly with cars ah directing them along diverted
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:15.560]  routes which will serve value didn't follow your order to avoid the

[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:37.200]  about 12 years old Dallas to go up there in the scene but I don't usually
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:41.040]  travel for stuff like that but you know what all work and no play makes Jack
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:34:01.040]  crazy crank it up with a rebel yeah
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:16.800]  this is a key part of the song right here
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:26.400]  she doesn't like slavery oh yeah
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:36.960]  rocks it to me what says you free I need to hear by me
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:41.040]  for the reason I agree on air is so people don't have it too seriously and
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:45.680]  so you don't take yourself too seriously we all need to be able to make a joke
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.840]  about ourselves from time to time but we should take serious people trying to
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:54.240]  enslave us people trying to make us their their chattel because there's only
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:58.120]  one thing worse than somebody that takes themselves too seriously is some
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:02.560]  control freak narcissist that wants to run our lives and thinks they're better
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:06.920]  than us and gets together in a big nasty gang of scum to come try to die
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.360]  dominate us and if you don't have an instinct to want to resist that something's
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:14.160]  wrong with you
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:20.160]  all right you know a bunch of this I've covered most of it I haven't we're gonna
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.720]  attempt it one more time I've never succeeded since I was first on talk
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:25.800]  radio first few years on talk radio I think I was almost better than I am now
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:30.360]  because I would get a huge stack of news stack it this way not all spread out and
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:35.000]  I would just go through it I would run through it ranting it would take sometimes
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.520]  two hours and that just the ratings poured in people loved it and I just
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.880]  can't seem to do it because I want to elaborate on each thing like this stack
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.800]  over here like a dog returning to its vomit I want to go back into the
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:52.800]  Internet of Things stack because it's so important but I've already covered it
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:56.480]  I mean look the feds are a watchdog they want to save us but meanwhile they're
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:58.840]  coming out all over the world with remote control cars the government
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:01.560]  watches everything you do and taxes the daylights out of you and magically the
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:04.520]  tracker hubs the tax you're already in all the cars I mean my gosh that's over
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:09.680]  the top here's another one info wars.com Daniel Taylor NSA cyber war will
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.080]  use Internet of Things as weapons platform your home is the battlefield
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:19.360]  and has them announcing it in the article and we got Marshall McLuhan
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:22.480]  saying World War three is a guerrilla information war with no division
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.680]  between military and civilian participation and that's in culture is
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:32.120]  our business Marshall McLuhan and boy was he right that's why Vic Vreeland the
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:37.000]  former Air Force intelligence officer and deputy fire chief of Austin came up
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.320]  with the idea for info wars.com and by the way I keep forgetting I'm sure Vic
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:45.440]  still alive I looked it up I know he and his wife and it was parrot P.D. till he
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:51.120]  died when he retired he moved to Bastrop get me Vic Vreeland pay for a limo to
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.280]  take him in here I remember like 10 years ago I tried to get Vic Vreeland on
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:59.360]  air he goes I don't need to Alex they don't want to be free I'm just gonna
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:06.080]  retire I'm retired I enjoy myself he said I tried I tried he didn't talk radio
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.640]  for a long time he used to fill in for Tom Valentine who has huge syndicated
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:17.880]  show I want Vic Vreeland in here and I want him now and I will punish you with
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:23.040]  bigger bonuses if you get him anyways there's really only carrots around this
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.440]  office I'm I spoil everybody but I have a great crew all right let's get well
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.360]  there is I do flip out occasionally so actually there are some sticks around
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:39.120]  here NSA cyber war so there's that article US signs $2 billion loan
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:45.680]  agreement with Ukraine offers to increase pressure on Russia it was Vic
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.680]  Vreeland came up with the because there's a war on for your mind thing to
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:55.600]  continuing no I'm not a plagiarist ladies and gentlemen I revel in giving
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:59.440]  people the credit they're due because I love humanity and I get off on
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.960]  collaboration with good people I just love it that's why you always try to
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:08.440]  work with all these talk show hosts and build up other people and stuff and I
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:12.720]  learned very quickly that a lot of people out there take that as weakness
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.680]  and then try to destroy you we try to help them but if you transcend that and
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:20.720]  just keep helping people you'll find who the good folks are and it's that
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:27.560]  process that's part of life already sorry I'm pontificating US signs $2
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:31.440]  billion loan agreement with Ukraine that'll all be siphoned into George
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.400]  Soros and others pockets to increase pressure on Russia we will continue to
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:40.160]  work with our allies to increase the pressure on Russia Reuters isn't that
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:45.080]  nice to stir up all that trouble on Russia's doorstep what are you like
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.640]  Vladimir Putin oh I don't like World War three and I don't like messing with
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:55.280]  people I guess so I guess if I don't want World War three I secretly secretly
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:01.040]  massage Putin's bunions I already mentioned this it's just insane Zuckerberg
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:08.200]  let's move on from there let's move to this nice stack we will cut your head
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.280]  we will cut off your head in the White House ISIS threatens to behead Obama
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:19.560]  and turn the US into a Muslim province and new execution video well Obama's
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.240]  already tried to turn us into a radical Muslim province this is pure red meat
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:27.880]  propaganda written by a Western intelligence agency ISIS is al-Qaeda is
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:31.920]  being funded by Saudi Arabia is being funded by NATO it's all on record and
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:38.040]  this is to give Obama cover to make him look good for Americans like Hillary
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:42.960]  gets up down to patients and goes I don't think we don't border she actually
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:49.200]  comes to Texas and goes I'm here to kill you something boy I don't live on borders
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.600]  and I don't like gun control I'm not kidding I saw that on the news like a
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:56.400]  month ago I meant to tell you guys to get it we do have her Kentucky going I
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.720]  don't feel no ways tired
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:08.640]  from where I started from nobody told me that the road would be easy that's in
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:12.680]  Kentucky I don't believe he brought me this car
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:15.760]  turn around listen I remember Rick Perry did this we ought to find the clip
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.360]  because they've been playing on 590 making fun of years ago when he was
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:22.560]  running for president like two or three years ago he went and spoke to me was
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:29.800]  Lulac it's it's yet it's Rick Perry Lulac or la Raza that lady goes hello good to
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:36.200]  be with you to talk he knew you I mean oh my I've got relatives of the stuff
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:40.080]  you'll be a Mexican food restaurant and they'll come over go hey wait how you
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:47.240]  know what you like to eat you're like I like a taco bean I mean I mean this is
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:52.520]  this condescending thing that when these politicians are in the south they go
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:41:00.160]  how you doing but then when they're talking to what they think this you
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:03.400]  know Hispanic audience like they can't understand the English it's amazing it's
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.560]  like if it was an audience that speak English in Mexico speak Spanish don't
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:12.320]  sit there and like make up some weird language would you oh my gosh if you
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:17.440]  want to get politically correct the one thing I see white people do is is do
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.280]  that I cannot stand it I'll start making fun of people in my family when they
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:24.800]  start doing it if I'm in a restaurant go that's where I go and do you have
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.840]  because I cannot stand it if you were talking about one of my pet peeves I
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.320]  said when I'm in England I talk like this when I'm in New York I talk this is
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:37.520]  what I sound like when I'm in LA is what I sound like they hang around folks
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.120]  enough you'll start picking up their accent and stuff but this just shows
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:44.000]  the pure manipulation by the way I don't know how you guys find found Hillary
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.920]  doing that that fast I did not we did not plan that where I was just making fun
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:52.440]  of her and you did that so I said I'd cover the news and obviously I'm not
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:59.240]  I'm ranting we'll cut your head off in the one house well actually the leader of
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:03.200]  ISIS is in the White House so Obama might decide to commit suicide by guillotine
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:08.380]  he could pull the rope and trigger it and it may be true it is possible that
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:12.840]  ISIS could chop off the president's head in the White House and it won't be a
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:19.880]  drone with a remote control guillotine with a cigar cutter flying I don't know
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:26.640]  if you get the big head but like drones with maybe that's the new feminist law
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.400]  so men don't pee standing up as you go into the bathroom they got a decapitation
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.040]  drone waiting in there drones don't have guillotines just train cars that's
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:40.240]  exactly well we're all drones now aren't we that's what our cars are remote
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:44.240]  controlled drone vehicles so that's totally fake to make him look good
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:50.920]  Michelle Obama navigates limits on women in Saudi Arabia AP and they she
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:55.840]  quote refused to wear a hood over her head and so that's very shocking and
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:00.640]  Obama of course bowed everyone as usual and he loves dictatorships he wants to
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:04.120]  be a dictator he is becoming a dictator so he's kind of there learning from the
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:09.800]  guys that know how to do it a bunch of corrupt freaks oh just since I just look
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:14.880]  at Kim Jong-un the Queen of England any form of royalty and it makes me want to
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:19.080]  just throw up and that is what Kim Jong is is a hereditary dictator meanwhile
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:23.000]  again Michelle Obama's face blurred by Saudi State television although claim
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.640]  disputed that's right no no one makes women wear hoods over their heads or
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:31.320]  puts them in prison if they drive cars in Saudi Arabia that's a conspiracy theory
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:35.080]  and China doesn't sell political dissidents organs like the State
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:37.960]  Department under Clinton claimed even though it's admitted and they run ads
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:46.240]  advertising in English we have quote fresh organs fresh Davos economist
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:50.640]  already spent a whole first hour on this you listen to that retransmission the
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:54.400]  Davos economist warning of riots in the US and Europe if we don't give them a
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:58.520]  hundred trillion dollars at the Davos group is George Soros is basically chief
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:03.600]  of staff and is warning of things that they're actually funding you can't make
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.280]  that up I shouldn't laugh it's really sick oh my gosh White House drone crash
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:14.120]  described as a US workers drunken lark yes it was 42 degrees and raining
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.240]  lightly about 3 a.m. on Monday when an inebriated off-duty employee for a
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:22.640]  government intelligence agency decided it was a good time to fly his friend's
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:27.440]  drone a two-foot by two-foot quadcopter and if it is one of the primitive ones
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:31.320]  just a few years ago were more primitive they can get away from me when you get
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.280]  out of radio range and they just fall that sells for hundreds of dollars and
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:39.160]  so he was drunk and then they're not gonna charge him you know if you weren't
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:46.640]  a god man a fed are you a god like they ask in ghostbusters he says well yes I
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:51.360]  am a fed they go then you your license plate will not be scanned your vehicle
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:55.640]  will not be remote access to remote controlled and you can crash drones on
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:45:06.880]  the lawn but if you say are you a god and they say no then die are you a
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.760]  producer again if you haven't seen ghostbusters you don't know what I'm
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:21.720]  talking about they look like Hillary on there and anyways continuing Obama
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.160]  approval rating at 50% as Republicans abandoned immigration campaign
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:29.080]  promises so he's gotten more popular with some of the liberals now and it's
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:32.360]  in his approval rating up because they're gonna gut the country entirely and
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:35.800]  offer everybody free goodies as the government builds armored bunkers and
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.200]  buys tanks and trains to take home the gun owners have a huge civil war the
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:43.760]  George Soros is funding what a wonderful idea why not why not he's gonna shut
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:49.360]  down more power plants border surge likely again in 2015 data shows out of
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.240]  the daily caller the feds are predicting a new giant surgery legals pouring
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:56.640]  across there's another article here Cuban refugees are flooding in at record
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:46:00.160]  levels because they think immigration rules may change if Cubos normalize
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.200]  and they won't get all the free goodies so that's some of the news and that
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:09.480]  stack trouble in GOP ranks kills votes on border and abortion bills it's all
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:14.640]  that trade or ship last week trade or ship a new word I've invented they are
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:18.280]  having degrees at college full scholarship and trade or ship how to be a
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:23.280]  parasitic piece of filth it walks around going liberal reasonable don't be racist
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:26.720]  let me run your life or you're racist two plus two equals five and you're not
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:33.320]  trendy I'm sorry let's continue here Americans hate the federal government now
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:39.160]  more than ever market watch article 73% the other percentage are ones that are
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:49.560]  scared that's just I'm just going through the stacks here let's get to these
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:56.400]  other stacks now the 19 ingredients and McDonald's fries including a form of
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:01.200]  silicone found in silly putty along with petrol based chemical well I mean who
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:04.880]  doesn't need petrol chemicals that have been in the ground for God knows how long
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:08.520]  and who knows what they're really made of no they can't really prove there is a
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:15.760]  lot of oil that is based on dead life forms but there's also a lot of what
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.880]  do they call it a biotic oil there's also a lot of oil that they've proven that
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:22.920]  they don't and the oil wells are replenishing they don't know what's
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:28.960]  going on and and and you notice the peak oil arguments gone now there's so much
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:35.280]  oil we're drowning in it let's go over this new American article which is very
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:38.880]  conservative that's a John Burt society just like Chuck Norris exposing poison
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:46.080]  food and GMO this is not just a liberal issue this is an issue that's real and
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:52.200]  McDonald's goes over all the wonderful things that are in their foods over 70
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:58.880]  ingredients just in the McRib alone that they call food technology and then it
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:02.480]  goes into all the delicious petrochemicals that no don't run your
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:07.080]  car's engine but run you and again poisons are very addictive that's a
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:12.480]  little secret so when you just poisons in small amounts your body then begins
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:16.000]  to metabolize them and learn to deal with them and then wants them if you're
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:23.680]  on it enough let's continue now getting into the other news reports here that I
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:30.200]  have this is very important poll large majority of Americans oppose Obama's
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:37.040]  immigration actions a record number 58 percent of registered voters are
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:40.560]  completely against that you add them all together it's basically up in the 70s
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.920]  the percentages that are against it including a majority of Hispanics
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:51.560]  Jordan agrees the prisoner swap with ISIS in deal that could free pilot and
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:56.520]  Japanese journalist and these are just more excuses to give the CIA globalist
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:02.640]  force more weapons but of course our borders are wide open and again don't
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:06.440]  forget though that they'll let ISIS and others recruit on Facebook but you can't
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:10.360]  even post an image of Muhammad because Islamic law says even showing an image
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:14.800]  is bad and so now in America you can't show that but info wars comm is
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.160]  censored pretty much constantly expert TSA plan to scrutinize social media post
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.200]  of travelers disturbing federal agencies measure could lead to fly or
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.320]  self-censoring Paul Joseph Watson info wars comm well it's bigger than that they
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:32.240]  are to be the domestic spy force just as big and just as strong as our military
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:35.960]  that Obama talked about and they're rolling out on the streets everywhere and
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:40.200]  you will have to go through them to be able to get a special card to have a
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:44.720]  job even working at McDonald's and you notice people thought I was crazy 14
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:49.400]  years ago I talked about that now it's starting they they set these things up
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:56.600]  and then they expand them forever air passenger bank details to be handed to
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:02.640]  police under anti-terror plan see and that's out of the London Telegraph
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.640]  then as well as vice president is head of drug cartel claims security chief
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:13.360]  epoch times very powerful article yeah in Latin America the the it's not like
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:17.000]  where the CIA runs the drugs but a consortium of banks launder it and make
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.640]  the money and then subsidiaries make money off of it and then the dummies
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.320]  that will dumb enough to use it or street pushers 20 levels down they get
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.520]  thrown in private prisons openly owned by the drug cartels themselves in Latin
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.960]  America they'll have people like Manuel Maury eager whoever who actually are the
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:37.960]  kingpin LFA getting most of it you know and buying five 50 bedroom mansions in
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:42.160]  Switzerland so the CIA and others have been a little better about hiding all
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:45.960]  the goodies but now they don't so much hot they're kind of like yeah you're

[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.760]  know give us a hundred trillionner we'll stir up the inner cities to burn
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:38.160]  everything down that's the translation of the Soros had that will cover in the
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:42.240]  retransmission I covered in the first hour well now billionaire Bill Gates has
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:48.320]  called for a quote a kind of a global government billionaire claims world
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:54.480]  government badly needed to save the earth and one of our most efficient and
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:00.160]  in focus investigative journalist a kill failing I drug him in here just during
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:02.680]  the break when he brought me this article he's going to be adding to the
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:05.480]  article it's already a long article he said it could be 30 pages it's only about
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:08.880]  two pages now but he's going to really add to this because this is such a big
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:12.800]  interview he did in Deutsch I guess thinking we wouldn't translate it
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:18.520]  Mikhail the stories on info wars calm right now let's red link this baby yes
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:20.960]  definitely interesting given all the things you brought up today about George
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:25.000]  Soros and all these calls you know for this kind of global system and then we
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:28.120]  have Bill Gates coming out parroting the same I mean basically it translated
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:30.720]  pass a hundred trillion or we'll pay the black people to burn your city down
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.960]  exactly I mean that's it I mean it's just horrible demon yeah and so of course
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:37.880]  they're calling for carbon taxes they want all this money to create this
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:40.840]  global system which of course they claim will save the earth when they're the
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:44.360]  very ones destroying it so and I bring up everything in the article I bring up
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:48.680]  all the money Gates is investing in in companies like McDonald's and major oil
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:52.960]  companies and and weather modification exactly geoengineering and so for that
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:56.760]  he is a doctor evil yeah I mean him and Soros and these guys are worse than
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:00.960]  James Bond villains and then you realize Fleming based his villains on the real
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:07.040]  deal yeah sorry I'm no no yeah and so for again so the very people that are
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:10.080]  really destroying everything our society they're the ones that want the
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:12.640]  casual societies get Daniels wrote in his article about Bill Gates the other
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:16.960]  day so it's really incredible that so they can say we're gonna control the
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:21.320]  speed of your car exactly it's in your car we and we're gonna take over yeah
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:26.400]  and your TV is watching you so shut up yeah I mean it's beyond 1984 so it
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:29.840]  really seems they're mopping everything up here with this Davos they're really
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:33.400]  really pushing this idea now and as you said early with a George Soros and his
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:36.600]  group all claiming that the elites are running and hiding getting ready it
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:39.800]  seems pretty apparent that they're moving things in the final I'm telling you
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.920]  that I just that they could release a bio weapon that kills a million people to
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:47.000]  bring in their world government I mean they've geared up got everything set up
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.080]  for something big everything else has been beta tested they could nuke five
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:54.440]  cities and say patriots dead I'm telling you folks I I get up here and joke around
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:57.960]  because I do this three hours it gets exhausting it's gallows humor this is
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:03.520]  not a joke this is I mean these people are they're just pure evil absolutely so
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:07.600]  I'm not surprised that he's out saying this and with global warming hysteria at
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.400]  an all-time high as usual of course they'll be pushing for the carbon taxes
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:16.480]  well we need the police and military that are awake to really watch all this
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.280]  when each citizens everywhere with human intelligence with your cameras your
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:25.080]  microphones get the data get it out basically start blogging everything use
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:28.280]  their system against them they're trying to bring in management systems to
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:31.800]  manage the panopticon where it doesn't blow back on them that's not gonna work
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.480]  we could actually bring them down they've they've they've overreached I'm
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:39.360]  not just saying this to be positive we have a very good chance of beating them
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:43.920]  they have a very low chance of winning unless they blow the planet up and they
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:47.440]  may see that as winning effect of some of the writings they say they would and
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:50.000]  they have weapons that will blow the planet up folks they've got any matter
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.440]  weapons that was in Air Force documents released 12 years ago and then in a
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:57.440]  speech a colonel was asked about he said he can't speak about the weapons but
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:00.400]  they have them so that's why they're on power trips well the ability to blow up
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:04.040]  the planet and it would look just like in the Star Trek where the planet sucks
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:08.840]  all in and implodes so what I mean so you guys can blow the planet up I mean I
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:13.320]  mean the mere fact that you're like this does not mean you rule everything yeah
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:16.200]  and so these are the same people that tried to blow up the stratosphere I'm
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:18.720]  sure as you've talked about the atmosphere on fire yeah they're not very
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:23.960]  nice so yeah just can't sit what's wrong with trying to blow a hole and try to
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:27.520]  catch the atmosphere on fire kill everybody I mean they had to test it
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:31.000]  didn't they I mean that's normal right I mean Bill Gates isn't psychopathic or
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.800]  anything is he well I mean we're in a race as you said the whole point is stay

[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:53.440]  to our own devices here for the most part and occasionally you'll ask you know
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.000]  hey someone should cover this but otherwise you know there's a lot of
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.320]  world government going on out there yeah of course it doesn't exist I've had the
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:03.800]  anchor for ABC nightly news here showing like five clips people calling for world
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:06.720]  government world leaders he goes well that's a different world government you're
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:10.640]  talking about and then here comes nightline he claims they're shutting up a
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:14.080]  corporate world government and wouldn't put any of the clips in and here's bill
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:18.240]  gates again calling for it exactly so they said it didn't exist and then when
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:20.640]  they come out and say yes it doesn't just they say well it's not the one you were
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:25.120]  talking about so and I said they're gonna put all these boxes in the cars and
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:28.400]  remote taxes and trackish and then control our speeds just like we said
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:31.760]  with the smart meters because they said they do it but they go no we're not
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:37.880]  yes we are and then no we're not yes we are and then it all happens well it's
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:40.400]  really what we need to do is try to either stop this but like as you said
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:43.600]  for so many years we need to let people know who's responsible for these things
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:47.440]  before they happen so if they do happen people it's the psycho eugenicists his
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:51.160]  dad was army intelligence ran Planned Parenthood I mean Bill Gates is beyond
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:54.840]  that all Fetler yeah I mean there was life last year in Germany threatened her
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:57.960]  when she said those of you trying to stop our projects you better watch her even
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:01.480]  moral die it was very cryptic yeah I mean everything he's involved in from
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:07.280]  geoengineering to Monsanto to you name it to you know USA ID overseas pushing
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:12.560]  these crops who do you think's more evil we should have a video contest or
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:15.800]  something people would put together montage is showing evidence who's more
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:21.200]  evil George Soros or Bill Gates I might have to say Gates but who is the most
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:27.840]  evil man in the world contest maybe Kissinger yeah but there's spiders even
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:31.320]  more wicked that we don't even see behind them hanging out the Bohemian
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:40.080]  Grove what do you think man I just it's the same names you know Kissinger
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:46.040]  Rockefeller just all those old little demons and then meanwhile it all comes
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:49.640]  out that the British Parliament our government is a bunch of pedophiles we're
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:52.000]  not talking about just raping kids we're talking about running over with cars
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:55.880]  torturing him you know that was one of the things that really woke me up was
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:03:59.160]  your interview with Senator John DeCamp in about 2004 about the kids in
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:02.600]  Bohemian Grove and so it's funny because you know you've been talking about this
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:05.320]  for years and now it's mainstream news and everyone's acting all surprised that
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:09.320]  people run well I mean you know chopping a five-year-old set off every torture
[03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:15.280]  and that's what you do if you're not a commie good guys and again they said
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:18.600]  what do you send our government did that no criminals have gotten control they
[03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:22.480]  have made it the government secret and now they want to destroy everything to
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:25.680]  secure their power because they don't like seeing you with a happy wife and
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:28.800]  children they don't like seeing you and fly over country with swimming pools and
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:31.760]  money in the bank they want to run your life and to do that they got to make you
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:38.600]  poor exactly a big giant stinking world government a big giant stinking pile of
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:42.360]  Bill Gates from now on whenever I say something's BS I'm gonna go it's Bill
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:51.560]  Gates BG that is a load of Bill Gates like when Elizabeth the second is a
[03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:54.520]  number two you have to learn to change all the words over hey they take
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:57.720]  themselves so seriously is why we expose them hey I appreciate you good job on
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:25.280]  the article
