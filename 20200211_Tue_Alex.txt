[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Please welcome to the program, the always interesting dynamic, Donald Trump. Donald!
[00:06.000 --> 00:32.000]  You are like everybody's dream of America. You live like the rags, well you didn't really have rags,
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  but I mean all the riches and everything that America can offer, you got it.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  Well I've had a good time, I've enjoyed myself, I've enjoyed my life.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  So you've sort of become like a folk hero. I mean people, there's someone in this audience,
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  I was reading the audience list, some man who's a businessman, you can tell me who you are later,
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  who went to New York and just wanted to stand by your building hoping some of the luck would run off.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Is that true? Is he in this audience?
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.000]  He's in this audience.
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.000]  We have to find him.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  Yeah, and so how do you explain that? Or is there an explanation?
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  You know, I believe that you make your own luck to a large extent.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  The word luck is a very important word, very important. There's no more important word than luck.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  Sadly, the American dream is dead.
[01:19.000 --> 01:29.000]  But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  than ever before and we will make America great again. Thank you, thank you very much.
[01:36.000 --> 01:46.000]  Critics often say that Donald Trump is a shallow showman, an egomaniac who wanted to be president just for the sake of it.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  They say he only got into politics to serve himself and his businesses and that he lacks the experience
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  and knowledge required to perform the role of president of the United States.
[01:59.000 --> 02:08.000]  He's inconsistent, they'll say, with the only consistency being that he's out for numero uno, Trump.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  But is this true? Why did Trump run for president? And how can we know for sure?
[02:14.000 --> 02:25.000]  Well, if you listen to his own words, the man speaks for himself and says exactly why he wants to make America great again.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  Trump likes the attention he gets from crowds, from the establishment and from the press, but he is very sensitive about the press.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  I don't think they portrayed what I'm really all about, necessarily.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  I've never seen press reporting as I have with regard to me.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  I hope the general public understands how inherently dishonest the press in this country is.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  I think a lot of the press is very dishonest. The news gets away with murder, the news media.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  I find the press is extremely dishonest, okay? Very dishonest.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  There's tremendous dishonesty in the media.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  These are very, very dishonest people.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  We are fighting the fake news. It's fake, phony, fake.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  The news about me is largely phony. It's false.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Does that get under your skin?
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  No, because you see, I think I'm right. And when I think I'm right, nothing bothers me.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  When I see a total rip-off of this country by Japan, where they literally have no defense budget,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  where we have to borrow money from them in order to get them oil and defend the Persian Gulf,
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  where most of the oil goes to Japan and other countries, not us. We get 4% of oil.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  When I see Kuwait, a total rip-off, we're bringing in the Bridgeton.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  You remember the Bridgeton? Their oil minister sat back and he laughed at how much money he's going to make.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  Why are we getting some of that money? Why are we getting it?
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  They're taking in billions and billions of dollars, and we can't even land a helicopter in Kuwaiti soil.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  You tell me that's right. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Saudi Arabia, they wouldn't even be there except for us.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  And in Saudi Arabia, we couldn't even use their minesweepers, so you know it.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  We defend Saudi Arabia. They wouldn't even be there.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  Saudi Arabia, without us, is gone.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  So we defend Saudi Arabia. Every time there's a problem, we send our ships, we go crazy, right?
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  We spend a fortune. We get paid peanuts for this.
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  This is a five-minute version of a 20-minute version that's up on band.video, titled Trump Then and Now.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  And it is very, very powerful because it shows the consistency of him saying things 35 years ago, 20 years ago,
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  and then saying them today and actually getting it done.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  And that's why they hate Trump so much, is you may disagree with him on some things,
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  but he actually says what he means and then tries to carry it out, and in most cases succeeds.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's like M-Full Wars. We deliver. Straight shooting.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  We're here only because you spread the word and support us. You are the M-Full War, and I salute you.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity,
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  and I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the M-Full War,
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at M-Full Wars,
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the M-Full War, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  You have made history. We have made history together.
[05:51.000 --> 06:20.000]  M-Full Wars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[06:21.000 --> 06:32.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  Well, my friends, it's torch Washington's birthday, February 11th.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  The year is 2000. I am your host Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours,
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  and I do intend to open the phones up and take a ton of your calls. Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  Always informative. Joe Scowzen is going to join us to talk about politics, the world,
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  and all these even mainline analysts saying the cities are going to collapse.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  They're untenable, especially the blue cities.
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  He is the leading expert when it comes to strategic relocation,
[07:11.000 --> 07:20.000]  and I've just been very honest with the audience that as soon as I can move the headquarters of M-Full Wars to some rural area
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  that is safer, I'm going to do it, but certainly not for a few years.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  I don't have the capital to do it. I don't want to make the crew move,
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  but I am ambibatting ship out of Austin, Texas.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  It has just been completely overrun by the Democrats with the needles, with the feces,
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  with the devil worshipers, with all the stupid trendies everywhere.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  And I just do not want to live in San Francisco right in the middle of the heart of Texas.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  But that's a side issue.
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  There is so much to get to here, obviously, with the Democrat primary starting to kick off
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  with some of the first early voting happening there in New Hampshire, the Granite State,
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  and already early signs of corruption, fraud, and fiasco behavior,
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  just like we saw in Iowa last week, just total criminal activity.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  This is your electronic voting machines run by Democrats.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  This is what you get.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  It's just a free-for-all bunch of piranhas trying to cheat each other.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  And that's why Trump could easily lose the 2020 election in 265 days,
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  because we don't have free and fair elections in this country.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  I've had all the top analysts, all the top experts on, I've done my own research.
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  I know that you've witnessed it yourself down the streets, but at the grassroots level,
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  a massive landslide can defeat Democrats, because they don't have every jurisdiction under their control.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  And the Republicans I know, and the conservatives I know, and the Christians I know,
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  just won't even speed, won't do anything corrupt at any level,
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  or neurotic about it.
[09:05.000 --> 09:13.000]  I know I am, except the speeding part, but you get my drift.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  And what do you do up against Democrats who are out competing each other
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  to see who can be the most criminal?
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  And by out competing, I mean, it's just reach cuckoo level situation.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  It's always some shadowy, weird, multinational company with Soros connections
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  and Deep State connections, and weird apps that are hooked up to all the machines
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  and then put out this info and they don't match the local numbers.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And of course, it screws whoever the establishment doesn't want,
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  Bernie Sanders, and promotes who they want,
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  the judge of the booty.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Booty judge.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  So we're going to get into all of that.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  We're going to open the phones up.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  We've got huge developments on the coronavirus front.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  Senator Cotton has come out again at this time, been specific,
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  and said Beijing needs to prove coronavirus isn't a man made by a weapon.
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.000]  Of course, it is.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  The question is, why did it get out?
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  What were they doing making a vaccine?
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  Who the hell knows?
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  They're covering up.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  They're lying about the number of deaths, obviously.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  And a big story up on infowars.com.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  Department of Defense announces expansion of emergency quarantine centers
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  across the United States.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  Coronavirus toll officially surpasses 1,000.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  China says it could be over 43,000 infected.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  A lot of folks are asking why in the world is Trump praising Xi Jinping?
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  Some experts worry as a germphobic Trump confronts growing epidemic.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  They even criticize him when he didn't want Ebola patients in the U.S.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  when he wasn't president.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  Nobody takes Ebola patients into their country.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  But again, they make that xenophobic and mad and there's just no end to it.
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  Also, there's a big article in AP about the hero citizen on the ground journalist
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  who didn't want to be journalists but are that have proven the Chinese
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  government's covering up just how bad it is and how they're heroes
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  are questioning the official story.
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  At the same time, if you question the official story here,
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  you get banned on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  You get called horrible names even though info wars.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  And our guest has been the absolute vanguard the last three weeks
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  on target with the projections right online.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  What is announced two, three weeks later that they've got secret quarantine centers
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.000]  ready, that it's man-made, that it's got the HIV delivery system.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  All of that has now been confirmed.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  But notice you don't see anybody celebrating in full wars.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  Oh, no.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  But they'll celebrate Chinese citizens that expose the fraud.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  But the very same corporate media then cheerleads to shut down anybody that asks questions.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  So they're just like the censors in Beijing.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  Simply amazing.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  We'll be getting into a lot of that today as well.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  Here's the good news.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  People see through this hypocrisy.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  And folks don't buy the official stories anymore.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  Sometimes the official story is true, but as your default, you have to question
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  everything nowadays including info wars.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  In fact, a lot of times I question what I already am believing and thinking
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  with the best knowledge I have, but then I get more knowledge and I go,
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  that was probably wrong.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  And most of the time it turns out I was wrong.
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.000]  I was partially right.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  I was going in the right direction.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  I was learning more.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  But this idea of just having one set idea about something that you're told by
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  somebody else and then you just defend that forever is stupid.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  But more importantly, it's dangerous.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  So we'll be looking at all of that today as well.
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  And then mainline science, private institutes, private groups are confirming
[13:06.000 --> 13:16.000]  that there is a what looks like not naturally occurring transmission being sent.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  The earth is picking up.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  Could this be first contact?
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  We'll look at that and so much more.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  Bloomberg's gotten a lot of trouble because old audio has surfaced of him
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  defending his stop and frisk situation and then saying, hey, we profile some
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  minorities because some groups have higher rates of crime.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Well, that is the truth.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  I mean, we all know men commit about 95% of murders, right?
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  Is that being mean to men?
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  No, men commit most murders.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  There are some things that criminology women do more often, but men do that.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  And yes, black men out of all groups of men in the United States top the charts for
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  that because of what's been set up in the culture and society and what's going on
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  and what's happened.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  That's just a statistic and it's a very strong statistic.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  So I'm not defending Bloomberg, but watching Trump tweet against him on stop and frisk.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  You notice Trump had to withdraw that because Trump had defended it back when he was mayor.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  So we did catch Trump in a flip flop right there.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  I'm not a cult.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  I'll expose Trump when he does things that are wrong.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  I expose myself when I'm wrong.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  But I'll say this stop and frisk randomly when you don't have any evidence.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  It violates due process or probable cause and I don't support it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:44.000]  Now, if you're wearing a blood shirts flashing blood signs in a gang area and you just had
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  somebody shot down the road.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  Yeah, pull over.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  You've got probable cause to ask questions is gang activity.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  But to just say you're black, so I'm going to pull up and I'm going to frisk you.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  That's wrong.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  And the Democrats have used that and exacerbated it.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  Cause a race war, try to say all police are bad.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  When it's Democrat cities that nine times out of 10 are violating African-Americans
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  rights and what's happening in their communities.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  And then it just creates a downward spiral because the people don't call the police.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  There's not trust and things fall apart.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  Most of the police I know and what I've witnessed and I've gone out years ago on
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  ride-alongs and I've done my own research and most police are care and they're
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  working hard and they're exhausted and they don't want to go out and be mean to
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  black people.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  I'm not just outrageous, but the media tries to seize on that and exacerbate it.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  And Bloomberg is a big Democrat now.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  He's been pushing race-based narrative crap when of course it's him that has that
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  entire background.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  So we've got that audio as well, which on the crime statistics is true.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  I don't know why he's running from it, but now he's experiencing cancer culture.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  But stopping frisk is wrong.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  ever hear.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  off the grid.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars,
[18:03.000 --> 18:10.000]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive,
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  they fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from Infowars.
[19:02.000 --> 19:09.000]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny,
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide,
[19:13.000 --> 19:20.000]  and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China,
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that
[19:35.000 --> 19:44.000]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way,
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them,
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[19:52.000 --> 20:01.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[20:23.000 --> 20:28.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:28.000 --> 20:35.000]  So I mentioned a lot of the news we're going to be covering and breaking down here today,
[20:35.000 --> 20:49.000]  but the first thing I want to get into in depth is something I meant to get to yesterday after the Oscars Sunday evening.
[20:49.000 --> 20:53.000]  I remember growing up and the Oscars would come on, and my mom would watch it,
[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  and some of her lady friends would come over, and I just thought it was so disgusting and so boring and so stupid
[21:00.000 --> 21:11.000]  to watch a bunch of people in tuxedos and a bunch of women in sequined dresses preening like peacocks
[21:11.000 --> 21:21.000]  and praising themselves for what amazing actors they are. The pomposity was truly disgusting,
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.000]  but now you've seen Ricky Graves and so many others come out and say your pedophiles, your degenerates,
[21:27.000 --> 21:36.000]  you suck, and they get ten times the viewers conservatively for just that clip than the entire Golden Globes.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  Reruns of soap operas have more viewers than these shows do because no one's watching it, including old people.
[21:45.000 --> 21:53.000]  It's disgusting. Yeah, folks are watching more Hollywood garbage than ever, but Hollywood's making less money.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  So is the NFL. So we're all these leftist establishment institutions.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  And so their answer is to promote censorship of their competition, of free thought,
[22:09.000 --> 22:18.000]  while they use the free speech they have to spew pure venom at the American people and lecture the planet
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  about how we shouldn't fly on jet airplanes, but nobody flies on them more than them.
[22:23.000 --> 22:34.000]  Everything they do is a sick joke because these are teleprompter readers. These are script readers.
[22:34.000 --> 22:45.000]  And America was founded, many a historian wrote accurately like Alexander de Tocqueville is the most often quoted,
[22:45.000 --> 22:52.000]  on hating the establishment and hating titles and hating royalty and hating people that were given everything
[22:52.000 --> 23:02.000]  they had. America was about inventors and it was about sharpshooters and it was about engineers
[23:02.000 --> 23:12.000]  and it was about Lewis and Clark and explorers and trailblazers and people admired reality and the genuine.
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.000]  They'd always admired that in other cultures, but here in America finally you had a chance at least to a certain extent.
[23:19.000 --> 23:27.000]  It wasn't perfect, but compared to any other nation to let your metal stand forth.
[23:27.000 --> 23:35.000]  And that's why people wanted to come here. And there is nothing better than reading these headlines that are dead on.
[23:35.000 --> 23:45.000]  The age of celebrity is dead. It really is. In fact, people just don't not care about celebrities.
[23:45.000 --> 23:56.000]  It's obnoxious. It's disgusting.
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  Dressing up all fancy and stuffs about going to a dance and finding your mate.
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  It's not about watching people on a screen and a bunch of weird directors and people worship themselves
[24:11.000 --> 24:27.000]  and tell us how great they are and tell us how good they are and just ooze and sticky sweet drool over the things they've done.
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  People don't want artificial. They want real.
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  And the rejection of Hollywood and the rejection of the leftist system is so healthy.
[24:39.000 --> 24:50.000]  It's like the rejection of AI, the rejection of virtual reality, the rejection of rubber blow-up dolls, the rejection of it all.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  This system is trying to seduce us because it doesn't have a soul.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  And it needs those of us that have a soul. It hopes to give it a soul.
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  The answer is exodus out of the system and let it completely die. Do not be part of it.
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.000]  Come out of the leftist cities. Don't be bullied. Don't appease. Don't adopt their political correctness.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  Don't bow down to them. You don't even get rewarded for doing it.
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  It's totally empty. The people that follow leftist ideology are slaves.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  If we come back, we're going to have some comic fun, but it's actually scary.
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  The actual bat boy has been discovered.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  That's coming up next segment, but let's get serious right now.
[25:43.000 --> 25:52.000]  Brad Pitt getting up there and lecturing us.
[25:52.000 --> 26:01.000]  Walking Phoenix was smart enough to get up there and to say, we're all a bunch of parasites.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  Everybody hates us. Forgive me that I'm scum.
[26:04.000 --> 26:16.000]  He gets it. He didn't go as far as Ricky Graves, but that's the spirit.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  They know we hate them. They know they're not cool. They know they're not real.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  And everyone is sick and tired of them. And this is so good.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  This is the breaking of the power of the jewel on the crown of this satanic world government system
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  that they thought, oh, thousands of channels and all this would put more of their crap out.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  And they thought, well, we'll censor our competition. That'll make people love us again.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  So everyone hates you.
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  Almost no one I know is enamored with any of this crap anymore.
[26:54.000 --> 27:08.000]  The spell, the trance, the mesmer, the dream that's really a nightmare has been broken.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  And there's no coming back.
[27:10.000 --> 27:20.000]  That's a very, very healthy thing. Here's Joaquin Phoenix doing his delicate genius act, falling on the sword.
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.000]  We fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious.
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles,
[27:40.000 --> 27:48.000]  we can create, develop, and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Now, I've been...
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  You have the Rothschilds controlled everything? Yes. Just let us run this.
[27:53.000 --> 28:01.000]  I've been a scoundrel in my life. I've been selfish. I've been cruel at times, hard to work with, and ungrateful.
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  But so many of you in this room have given me a second chance.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  And I think that's when we're at our best when we support each other.
[28:11.000 --> 28:19.000]  Not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow, when we educate each other, when we guide each other towards redemption.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  Then he thrives out of cancel culture.
[28:22.000 --> 28:32.000]  So again, but isn't he disingenuous? I mean, the whole act he puts on, like he's hesitant and he's so real and everything.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  Give me a break, man. You're as funny as a bowl of plastic fruit. Everybody knows it.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'll tell you what's real. I'll tell you what's real, okay? There's this knife right here.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  Everyone watching knows I'm real walking. They know they're real and they don't like you.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  Mr. Scarey Joker.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:24.000 --> 29:35.000]  Non-security IPO or note, lot chain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[29:35.000 --> 29:43.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  800-600-3388.
[29:50.000 --> 29:58.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[29:58.000 --> 30:04.000]  Don't be a victim. If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[30:04.000 --> 30:14.000]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down. Get plenty of hydration. Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier. Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it. That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[30:20.000 --> 30:29.000]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle that has the nano-silver that Pat did and documented and even admitted and documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family.
[30:29.000 --> 30:37.000]  A virus. We're almost sold out of the 1-ounce spray bottles. That'll be sold out a couple days and we're in about a week and a half or so of the super-silver 3-ounce bottles.
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  Great to have, period. Really good for your gums. Really great for your teeth.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  We also have the super-silver in our whitening toothpaste. Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  That's in all these homeless security documents and everything because we get the best stuff. There's a lot of patriots.
[30:52.000 --> 30:58.000]  There's not just bad guys coming after us. There's the flip side of all the good guys and good gals. It's very exciting.
[30:58.000 --> 31:06.000]  I wanted to talk about super-silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex.
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people.
[31:12.000 --> 31:24.000]  So here I am telling people super-silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[31:24.000 --> 31:36.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[31:36.000 --> 31:58.000]  It feels so good. It feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[32:06.000 --> 32:20.000]  As the answer, and we've got massive, huge censorship taking place, it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[32:20.000 --> 32:30.000]  Wow. Yes, now we know we're right. The New World Order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[32:30.000 --> 32:38.000]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas. We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[32:38.000 --> 32:45.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[32:45.000 --> 32:57.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved, but just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of M4Shore.com is critical.
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  So please take action.
[33:01.000 --> 33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.000 --> 33:32.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. All right, I want to get serious here and open the phones up and cover all the news and get into what's happening in Iowa and Democrats fight President Trump's anti human trafficking efforts.
[33:32.000 --> 33:46.000]  I'm not kidding. That is all coming up. I want to open the phones at 877789 Alex for first time callers again on any subject, any topic you want to discuss.
[33:46.000 --> 34:01.000]  Absolutely free fall free fall of your phone calls free for all 8777892539877789 Alex here on this live Tuesday transmission.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  But getting back to Hollywood.
[34:07.000 --> 34:16.000]  It really is ridiculous that we were caught by it like mods to flame but if you go back to the 20s.
[34:16.000 --> 34:38.000]  All they have a silent movies and then the talkies got developed and set up and then you had radio that proliferated and then by the 19 late 1940s TV began to become popular and it expanded and it was this box in our home.
[34:38.000 --> 34:47.000]  And now we don't eat around the table and talk about what happened in town or what happened at work or what happened at church or what happened in the backyard or talk about grandma.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  We talk about what's on that box.
[34:50.000 --> 35:03.000]  And at first it's putting out trusted messages and loving messages and, you know, nice things to get our trust like a worm on a hook looks delicious to a bass or a perch or a croppy or a catfish.
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  Or some other little form of swimming creature.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  But once they get us on the hook we find out it's cold steel.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  It is a cultural takeover.
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  And so yes our grandparents our parents to a certain extent some of them got mesmerized by it.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  But young people know that big deal you're on TV big deal you're on a screen that doesn't make you special.
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  Exactly it isn't special.
[35:30.000 --> 35:39.000]  Yes that person is saving people from a burning house or shooting intruders or climbing a mountain or the breaking record at the Olympics.
[35:39.000 --> 35:52.000]  Yes that human endeavor of crossing a threshold of landing on the moon of going deeper than anyone ever has in a submarine that is documented and that is important.
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  But not just because it's on a screen but because it happened.
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.000]  I believe Hollywood is the most effective and disastrous propaganda factory that has ever been the history of human beings.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  That's absolutely true.
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  So it has taken our families away from us.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  It has taken our culture it has taken our soul it has taken the outdoors away it has taken even when I was a young person.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  Maybe somebody watched TV a couple times a week or you watch the news but man you were in the backyard cooking almost every night or you were over the neighbor's house cooking.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  You were playing pool.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  You were arm wrestling.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  You were playing board games.
[36:36.000 --> 36:49.000]  You were playing baseball or football touch football until 10 at night and I'd show up bloody and you know dirty and my dad say it's 10 o'clock.
[36:49.000 --> 37:00.000]  Get your butt in there and take a shower and go to bed but he'd give me a high five and laugh at me and sometimes we'd get back up and be playing baseball at 6 a.m. on the backyard throwing baseballs at each other.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  That was normal and man when I laid down I was exhausted.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  You drive around these neighborhoods there's almost nothing going on maybe a bike here a kid there.
[37:13.000 --> 37:21.000]  You kids run around with some Nerf guns or something thank God but you don't see it going on.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  When I was a kid everybody was out at night going to this person's house going to that person's house going to church.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  Where did all that go let's bring that back and whoever can bring that back.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  He's going to save the species and they're not just going to do that they're going to make a ton of money because everybody's into money.
[37:43.000 --> 37:53.000]  Well let me tell you going back to retro which isn't retro it's just human activity that is going to be the complete future getting off the phones getting out of the system getting out in rural areas getting out in the woods.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  That's where everything is.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  Why do we admire the military.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Well it's the warrior class and they're out there on the cutting edge sometimes the mission is bad sometimes the war is illegal.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  The point is though that they're real people on the edge of things and all of us need to be real people on the edge of things.
[38:16.000 --> 38:22.000]  But the edge of things is making sure our children don't take fentanyl and die.
[38:22.000 --> 38:36.000]  Being involved being informed being interfaced not where oh I got to take care of my kids I want to go watch Netflix taking care of your children is going to empower you making them dinner going for a nighttime bike ride or hike.
[38:36.000 --> 38:46.000]  That's going to empower you and your children not going in together and watching Netflix and I'm not judging people if you know last night.
[38:46.000 --> 38:54.000]  My youngest daughter is almost three she won't go to sleep and I said well you know what let's watch some TV.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  So I said she's in her own room now so you don't go to your room you can stay with mommy and daddy tonight sleep with us in the bed.
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  And we turned on it like nine at night World War two in color two hours later to live my wife's like you got to let her go to sleep.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  She was sitting there watching it like this.
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.000]  Now no one would think a three year old would want to watch that but no that's my daughter she wants to watch it but she knew it was real she was really interested.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  She was I like those mean tractors she thought tanks were.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  She's kind of a tomboy she likes things like that but I'm not going to digress about this all day.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  It's just that reality.
[39:34.000 --> 39:43.000]  She's a baby but she knew that's reality something happened she saw Hitler on the screen was like and went to Churchill she kind of sat up like who's that.
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  I mean she knows archetypally that's an important person that's a bad person that's an interesting person.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  And.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  It's the reality we need to show people.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  If it's reality on the screen it's good does he call it reality TV when it's the fakest thing out there.
[40:05.000 --> 40:18.000]  Watch the battle of Britain like we did last night the second hour we watched that was real and that was empowering and she got like there's men in planes they're fighting there's a she got it because she already had all the art types.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  I'm going to stop babbling here and just get to this clip but it's true.
[40:24.000 --> 40:33.000]  The age of celebrity is dead ding dong the which is dead the which which which the which show which ding dong the wicked which is dead.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  This is a good thing.
[40:35.000 --> 40:45.000]  Now that said I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this but everybody saw this Trump event in San Francisco I guess drag queens for.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  Trump and I got to say these drag queens actually look like women and we're dressed nicely.
[40:50.000 --> 41:00.000]  The Democrat drag queens like giant obese fat men in clown outfits going after children in San Francisco though you've got a I guess a group for Trump.
[41:00.000 --> 41:16.000]  And the left to see this and become totally unhinged and then there is a probably a woman biologically but actual bat child people wonder since the 80s where the bat child was the bat child has been discovered and it's totally triggered.
[41:16.000 --> 41:22.000]  I guess by gay dudes that support Trump so let's roll that audio here it is.
[41:46.000 --> 41:56.000]  Well you can clap I promise you.
[41:56.000 --> 42:08.000]  Because it doesn't compute because they're the liberal trendies and the religion is if you're gay you're God well here's gay dudes who let their makeup on better than her and she doesn't know what to do.
[42:08.000 --> 42:20.000]  You're not cute you're fat and you're fat.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  Is that Rachel Maddow without the wig?
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  Is that Anderson Cougar without his toupee?
[42:28.000 --> 42:35.000]  She doesn't even go here.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  And the screaming just goes on from there.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  But hey bat boy has been discovered in San Francisco.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  This is a big deal.
[42:46.000 --> 42:57.000]  Bat boy lives.

[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[45:35.000 --> 45:51.000]  I was so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[45:59.000 --> 46:08.000]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food but I know for a fact from sources they're telling people, oh we've got it, get your order in, two weeks for delivery.
[46:08.000 --> 46:18.000]  We follow this pattern over and over again. I've been on radio for 25 years, I've had storeable food for a long time and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.000]  But during a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[46:23.000 --> 46:33.000]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time.
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.000]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  Now they were saying seven to ten days before shipping because they've got the food but they've got a package at record level orders.
[46:43.000 --> 46:55.000]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus. So get your orders at infowarsore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the M4 as well.
[46:55.000 --> 47:14.000]  So get prepared, infowarsore.com with SwarbleFix.
[47:25.000 --> 47:39.000]  You know, I've got a bunch of serious news to cover but I want to get back to Batboy here and put some bookends on this.
[47:39.000 --> 47:52.000]  Let's go back to the raw footage and play one more time. This was shot two nights ago, three nights ago, I guess Saturday night in San Francisco at a drag queen pro-Trump event.
[47:52.000 --> 48:01.000]  And the left came out to protest it as the people came out and the leftist began to attack like piranhas.
[48:01.000 --> 48:17.000]  But notice this is a woman you're about to see with a shaved head under fourth wave feminism who's given up for femininity who believes they say killing their babies is a sacrament and that giving up their very humanity is a good thing.
[48:17.000 --> 48:27.000]  This isn't powering women, this isn't slaving them and then she's completely triggered by men who are dressed like women who have stolen her identity.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  And so she begins to hiss like a king cobra that has been injected directly in these three world cortex with PCP.
[48:36.000 --> 48:55.000]  So we can joke all day long about everyone always wanted to find out what happened to Batboy who supposedly in weekly world news got found in Central Park and did Batboy actually cause the coronavirus outbreak.
[48:55.000 --> 49:06.000]  But that's a joke. This is serious. This is what happens to women in San Francisco under the brainwashing where women give up their femininity.
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  They're supposed to. You don't see any starlets anymore in Hollywood, any of it, and then men become the new glamour with wigs on.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  Now I've got to say that the Trump drag queens do actually look like women.
[49:17.000 --> 49:26.000]  The leftist ones, I'm like Harrier, Fatter, Bigger, you know, another thing is Fat Dudes or anything, but come on man, Fat Dudes and Clown make up coming after our kids.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  They have a name for that. That's still, it's all still hideous though. Let's go ahead and that's just my opinion.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  I'm allowed to think that dudes and dresses are creepy. I've never done it on air.
[49:37.000 --> 49:48.000]  I've done a lot of comedy. You would get huge views. I just kind of like the police academy though. They got their dressed up on the stake out going after the hookers and you know, the sergeants got a beard, he's got a wig on.
[49:48.000 --> 49:57.000]  There is some comedic value to it, but except I'm not trying to go to drag queen story time or anything. Let's go ahead and play this video unedited so you can see it for yourself.
[49:57.000 --> 50:10.000]  And again, radio listeners, you're lucky you don't have to see this. This is Bat Boy freaking out.
[50:10.000 --> 50:20.000]  We joke about it. This is what leftists do everywhere. This is like standard now. It's like a two year old tantrumming.
[50:20.000 --> 50:27.000]  They want to run the campuses. They want to run your wife. They want to access to your children.
[50:50.000 --> 51:15.000]  So this is what happens when kryptonite is discovered. Leftists come out to protest the Trump drag queen event and they just don't know what to do.
[51:15.000 --> 51:38.000]  It's like the left endorsing Islam and it wants to kill gay people. They don't know what to do.
[51:38.000 --> 51:45.000]  This is the mass mental illness. Of course, you know, there's piles of poop everywhere. This is San Francisco.
[51:45.000 --> 52:11.000]  Maybe buzzard begging for food. We can make jokes about this, but this is the spirit of these people.
[52:11.000 --> 52:30.000]  It's like Nosferatu. This is what they've done to women. Look what they've done to these people.
[52:30.000 --> 52:45.000]  She probably started up normal in the Midwest. Parents, Senator College, turn into this.
[52:45.000 --> 53:00.000]  Okay, that's enough. All right, I'll give the number out. The phones are loaded. We'll start the next hour and get very, very serious, but I'll be honest.
[53:00.000 --> 53:08.000]  Sometimes I got to screw around a little bit. So that's a very disturbing video, actually. Michael Bloomberg saying black people commit more crimes than white people.
[53:08.000 --> 53:18.000]  That audio is coming up so much more in the second hour, but I will go directly to your phone calls. The good news is the age of celebrities debt.
[53:18.000 --> 53:30.000]  But the age of bat boy is really a woman has just begun. I shouldn't laugh. God help us.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  I mean, you go to these Democrat events like a good third of them are like that.
[53:34.000 --> 53:43.000]  So you think it's funny when you're watching it on TV, but when you you're like, there's armies of these people. What the hell happened to them?
[53:43.000 --> 53:55.000]  How do you end up getting your head shaving going? I mean, how do you end up being a dude and having long fingernails and a blonde wig on?
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  I don't know what happened to these people. All I know is thank God I'm not with them.
[54:00.000 --> 54:06.000]  And I'm not trying to put anybody down. It makes me feel weak that there's all these people like this.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  Let me just stop there.
[54:08.000 --> 54:13.000]  I had our office manager in force manager Tim Frosier come over and talk to me earlier.
[54:13.000 --> 54:21.000]  He said, hey, listen, in about a week or two, if you keep super silver tooth whitening toothpaste at 50% off, it's going to sell out.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  We don't get more for about a month and a half.
[54:24.000 --> 54:32.000]  We should go back to basically full price plus it has the patented nano silver in it that's been proven to take out this whole virus family and the rest of it.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  And I said, you know what, we're just going to sell out of it at 50% off.
[54:36.000 --> 54:44.000]  And I said, but don't worry. We also have the nano silver in super blue for adults and children.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  And he goes, yeah, that's selling out to probably in about two weeks and that's not coming in for two months.
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  Unless we're talking about the children's, which we do have plenty of naturally bubblegum flavor.
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  It has the nano silver. It has the iodine. It has the tea tree oil has it all.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  This has the whitening of the so good, but this is really good as a frontline of defense.
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  And despite the fact that it's selling out, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until these products sell out.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  And, you know, I told you, like last week, I said, oh, the 16 ounce immune gargle of nano silver, it's about to sell out.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  It did. It was already sold out by the time I was saying, I didn't know it.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  The one ounce will sell out by Wednesday or Thursday.
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  The three ounce will sell out by next week and it's the greatest deal you're going to find out there on this nano silver.
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  This is the patent and stuff I could show you help me to show you from Homeland Security right here.
[55:41.000 --> 55:50.000]  This is from 13 years ago, Texas A&M Health Science Center with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
[55:50.000 --> 55:59.000]  Tom Ridge, the Department of the Army headquarters finding it in their own test that it was taking out the SARS that is the Corona family.
[55:59.000 --> 56:08.000]  And that is from American biotech labs out of Colorado that allows us to private label their products.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  Some of these are proprietary products. So those are selling out as well.
[56:13.000 --> 56:20.000]  The nano silver is in the super blue and it is in the super silver whitening.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  I'm going to keep the toothpaste at 50% off till it shows out, but it is selling out.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  I need to reorder the 16 ounce, the three ounce, the one ounce.
[56:30.000 --> 56:39.000]  So starting Thursday morning, these are going to go back to full price because I was going to just keep it 40% off till it's sold out.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  They're like, hey, you need the money to buy more of it dummy.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  I'm like, oh, actually, do we have the money for that?
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  They're like, no, because we're making 25% of that cell rate.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  So you've got to go back to full price or we can't buy more dumb dumb.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  And I told them to finally explain things to me and they did and I understand it.
[56:54.000 --> 57:02.000]  So in fact, you know what? I'm going back to regular price tomorrow because they're right.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  We need to be able to sell the last few thousand bottles of each to buy more of it, which actually makes sense.
[57:07.000 --> 57:14.000]  So m4store.com, if you want 40% off on the immune gargles that are left and if you want 50% off the toothpaste,
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  the immune gargle sale will end tomorrow.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  So by Thursday, yeah, it'll be the regular price.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  But I'm going to honor that commitment on the toothpaste.
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.000]  I'm about to tie 50% off because we've got that coming and I've already paid for more of it to come, so it's coming.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  m4store.com or AAA-233-139.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  Also, we've got the highest quality swarble foods ready to ship.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  Most folks don't.
[57:38.000 --> 57:45.000]  We've got the four week, the three month, all of it right now powered by my Patriot and Ready Hour at m4store.com.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  But get your orders in now to guarantee delivery.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  The demand for food has not let up.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  Everybody else is basically already sold out or they have a giant wait list.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken seven to ten days to deliver because, again, they have to package it.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  So I wouldn't crash tonight.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  We wanted it to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  So get your storable food at m4store.com.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  That helps fund our operation.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  It's insurance.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at m4store.com.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  Get your order in.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  It's locked in.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  Guaranteed seven to ten days in m4store.com.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  We also have the immune guard with 40% off.
[58:42.000 --> 58:47.000]  We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price m4store.com.
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[59:51.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  You know, the Satanists sell the worship of the devil.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Like those bumper stickers you see on the backs of cars, like the devil cheerleader.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Big old juicy curves, looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  What's got that devil tail?
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  You associate that with the devil.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  The devil's locust eating your crops down, starving children.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Bones sticking out, your ribs showing.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  God gave us women and men and families and life and pleasure and enjoyment.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  God gave us ice cold beer and cheese enchiladas.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  And look it up in the night sky, not Satan.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  And God gave us fish fights and smelling the newly cut grass in the spring.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  And you look at people under the devil's control in San Francisco and other areas and man, they're rabid.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  It's like they've had their souls sucked out.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  There was an old Cronenberg film back in, I guess, 1980, 81, wherever it was called rabid.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Old zombie movie, but you look at how the left behaves.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  We can joke about it, and I joke about it too.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Because it's better than crying about it, but they're rabid.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Here's that old trailer of rabid put to the future.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  What?
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Therapists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Donald Trump anxiety disorder.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Trump anxiety disorder.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Trump derangement syndrome.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  One minute, they're perfectly normal. The next, rabid.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  You can't trust your mother.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  Get the hell out of here!
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Get the fuck out of here!
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Your best friend.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  I'll get that camera out of my face.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  The labor next door.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients, it started the morning after the election.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call post-traumatic stress disorder.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Pray, it doesn't happen to you.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  We're not dead!
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Revit.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  White males.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  The full answer is gone with this one.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  All right, so we're going to go to break in T-minus one minute, 18 seconds.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  When I come back, Patrick in Britain, Brian in Kansas, Thomas in Arkansas, Teddy in Indiana, Gabrielle in California, Scott in Vermont,
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Annabelle in Washington, Keon in St. Louis, Missouri, Randall in Florida, Rex in Florida, and Angeline in Pennsylvania.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  We're going in, through, and beyond.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  We're not supposed to exist.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  We're not supposed to be on air.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  We're not supposed to be here discussing all of this together, but we are.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  And it's that simple college of people.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  They're a race, color, and creed being able to speak to each other.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  It's that town square that the system wants to end so they can just give us the delivered corporate knowledge.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  But guess what?
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  When the rubber meets the road, when the rubber meets the road, when the bullet hits the bone,
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  when all the jokes have been pulled aside, it's human activity that rules this planet and it always will be.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  It's 2 AM.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  to go after this whole Corona SARS family.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  A virus.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Great to have, period.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Really good for your gums.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Really great for your teeth.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  that's in all these homeless security documents and everything because we get the best stuff.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  There's a lot of patriots.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  It's very exciting.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  You've got it.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  That gas mask is coming to you.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  There's nothing more uncool than Hollywood.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  On corruption.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  There's nothing more uncool than CNN.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  And we all know that.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  I'm not just making a statement here like I'm gone.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  I'm pointing out, hey, the screen behind me is blue.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  A little accent of pink.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I'm wearing a brown shirt.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  If I wasn't, you'd say, you think I'm dumb?
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  You got it.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  You're not dumb.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  You're smart.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  You understand.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  It's like electricity.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  People think of info wars as the top of the pyramid in this fight.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  We're not the top of the pyramid.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  We are the pyramid.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Just like you.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  We're the top.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  We're the middle.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  We're the bottom.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  We're the outside.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  We're deep inside.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  We're everything.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  I love that line in 1984.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  They're taking Winston in.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Ministry of Truth.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  The door opens and O'Brien walks in.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And he says they got you.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  He says they got me a long time ago.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  You got it.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Let's cruise fast.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  They did that in five seconds to pull that up.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  No, I'm not saying I'm the secret police.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  I'm the establishment.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  No.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  The opposite.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  I'm saying that we built this country on this planet.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  And people always say, look at how we're influencing things.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  People are listening to us.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  Yeah, of course they are.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Because the fact that we're on air resisting, that itself is a revolutionary act.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  The fact that this even exists and is here is in defiance to everything the system wants.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  When I tell you that you're the info war and that your action, your word of mouth,
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  your prayer, your financial support is incredible, it is.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Because I don't ever push propaganda and disinformation.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  But I do have a clip I want to play.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  I think Senator Tom Cotton from when I've been in Senate committees watching him speak,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  when I've seen on C-SPAN, means well.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  And I understand the science of vaccines is real.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  I mean, you can take something artificially that's been attenuated.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  In a way, there is a smaller amount of it and learn how to defeat it.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Like that's how the universe works.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  You get confronted with an obstacle and you learn how to overcome it.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  But there's so many side effects and so many other issues.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Don't lie to people about it.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  So he's come out and said, we need a vaccine for the coronavirus.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Well, yeah, it's killing a bunch of people and you find a vaccine for it.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Give it to me.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  The problem is there's this whole background of secret testing with vaccines
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  and vaccines having other tainted additives in it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  And then when we talk about it, we're not supposed to be able to.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Well, the Chinese or heroes questioning Xi Jinping, the news tells us.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And Senator Cotton tells us.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  So that said, before I go to your calls, he's come out on national television.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  We'll play the clip right now.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Senator Cotton demands Beijing prove coronavirus isn't a bio weapon.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Last week he said that, but now he said it again.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Well, we've got major institutes in Switzerland and in India and in Brazil
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  and others that have now scanned the virus.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And they said, man, this thing is a joke.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  What's that Johnny Cash song where he works at the plant,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  the Ford plant, the Chevy plant.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  He I got it one piece of a time.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  I didn't cost me a dime.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  What's the Johnny Cash song about stealing the car parts that that'll get Johnny Cash song about stealing car parts.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  The point is, is that when the car rolls out, it's all these different pieces of different cars.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  This damn thing is as funny as $3 bill.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  So what does that mean?
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Because I'd love to see a government response that's a bunch of hype so I could ignore it.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  That's usually our default is this is a bunch of hype like SARS.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  They're running around really freaked out like chickens with their heads cut off.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  And then you look at this man made, you go, OK, why would your man made something that doesn't work?
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  So it looks bad.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Yeah, one piece of the time is the name of the song.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Maybe we can come back the next segment with Johnny Cash one piece of the time.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  This virus is a whole bunch of pieces.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Well, what is that car?
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Well, it's a 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 59 automobile.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I mean, this damn thing, I got it one piece of time.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  It didn't cost me a dime.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So we're going to talk about all that right now.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  But let's play Senator Cotton.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Another Arkansasian like Johnny Cash talking about this thing right now.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Here it is.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Although as you suggest, I'm afraid that the coronavirus could actually be the single biggest threat to both global and U.S. growth in this year.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Senator, I just want to go back to the comments from the Chinese ambassador to the United States over the weekend.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  He said it's very harmful.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  It's very dangerous to stir up suspicion rumors and spread them among the people for one thing.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  This creates panic.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Another thing is that it will fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia and all these things that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Obviously on the Intelligence Committee, you know more about what's happening.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  How how firm are you in your concerns about this?
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  So I have two responses to the Chinese ambassador.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  One, the thing that really is harmful that really spreads fear is China lying about the origins of this disease and about the number of people who have it and excluding American and other western scientists from China to try to get to the bottom of it.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Second, in terms of the claims of racism, the Chinese people are the first and the worst victims of the Chinese Communist Party.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  We should all hold them in our prayers and hope that we can get a vaccine because they are the people who are most harmed by the Chinese government's incompetence and duplicity.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  By the way, I'm really glad that the producer came in and gave me this text or this tweet.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Because I got a few phone calls the last few days, you can probably imagine. We're pretty close to Roger Stone, as you can probably imagine.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  And they've said they want nine years in jail for Roger.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  In fact, guys, can you pull from Yes Face Stack? I never got to it.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  The judge wanted me arrested and the prosecutors wanted me arrested because I was going to talk about it yesterday and I got so busy with calls I didn't get to it.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Then I had some phone calls last night this morning and there it is, seven to nine year prison sentence for Roger Stone.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  Trump's now calling that excessive. In fact, guys, I forgot, I actually sent some text messages to you guys overnight.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  At 5 a.m. when I woke up, I need Trump's tweets about this because Trump put a bunch of tweets out as well about this.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take calls, but I want those Trump tweets and then I want to get those articles together with what the prosecutors said about myself and Roger.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  But they're saying he deserves more jail time than bank robbers for something he didn't even do.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And then they're saying because I talked about he should be pardoned that that's breaking a gag order and so he deserves even more time in prison.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  But I do have exclusive information about Roger Stone and what the White House is planning to do.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  And here's the thing, I'm not going to go off half cocked right now and cover this.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  I'm glad they reminded me about this. So I just need Trump's tweets I sent this morning about Roger and how it's wrong.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Now it's excessive and how it's out of control and who he was linking to.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  I need that whole stack of news that we printed yesterday or Sunday and I didn't cover Monday either where they're attacking me and the rest of because this is a big story.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  It's bigger than Roger Stone. The fact that they could demonize him and then say your associates said you should be pardoned.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  So now your jail sentence will be longer. It's just absolutely insane.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Yeah, no, I know about the Chuck Ross tweet guys. It's hell. I'm going to rebroadcast my afternoon. It's not a big deal.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  It's it's it's it's Trump tweets last night about it.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  So we'll see if we're able to do that. We'll see what happens.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And if I can get your shoes.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Stack of news on that that they could tell maybe I just won't cover it. Maybe that's maybe I'm not supposed to cover it.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Maybe that's what's supposed to happen here.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  I just don't cover it like give up give up give up give up give up.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  You're not going to get the tweets. You're not going to get the articles. You're not going to cover it.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain. The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax. Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments. Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help? Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112. 800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food, but I know for a fact from sources they're telling people, oh, we've got to get your order in two weeks for delivery. We follow this pattern over and over again. I've been on radio for 25 years.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  I've had storeable food for a long time, and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're getting to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Now, they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they've got to package it record-level orders.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  Now, it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus, so get your orders at an infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well, so get prepared, infowarstore.com with storeable foods.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Well, it's here, the year 2020, world governments out in the open, we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer, and we've got massive, huge censorship taking place, it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Wow. Yes, now we know we're right, the new world order's real, Satanism's real, the pedophile leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas, we have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through, so it's an incredible town to be alive, and I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved, but just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at infowarstore.com is critical, so please take action.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Well, I lived in Kentucky back in 49 and went to Detroit working on assembly lines, the first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by and sometimes I'd hang my head and cry, cause I always wanted to be one that was long and black.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  One day I'd advise myself a plan that should be the envy of most any man, I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Now getting caught meant getting fired, but I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired, I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  I'd get it one piece at a time, and it wouldn't cost me a dime, you'd know it's me when I come through your town.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Don't stop Johnny Cash.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  I'm on the drive of everybody wild.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls, nothing to be pontificating.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Patrick in her Britannic Majesties England, media not reporting on Trump supporters being attacked, please tell us what you're talking about.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Hello Alex, it's a great pleasure to speak to you, and that woman screaming sounded a little bit like Abaddon had opened the gate.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Yes.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Just on a point here, I'm really confused about what Roger Stone's trial was really about, I mean, after all it was like a kangaroo caught spun from the Russian collusion hoax.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  I mean, he is guilty obviously, he's guilty of supporting your protest, you know, Donald Trump.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  Well that's it, I mean he's guilty of getting the president elected, and they're just sending a message, you support the president, we're going to throw your ass in prison.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Yeah, absolutely, I mean, he said it best, didn't he Donald Trump?
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  The world is laughing at us, but who's laughing now? I mean, it's a travesty of justice, but that wasn't my main point Alex.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  My main point really was, do you not think that the mainstream media, and a lot of this is to do worldwide, is now becoming complicit in random acts of violence,
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  especially against Trump supporters, by not reporting or condoning them when they happen, like on Saturday for example in Florida.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Oh, I totally agree with the car plowed over six people, almost no coverage, and then you've got all these people getting shot and stabbed and attacked,
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  and look what happened to Scalise years ago, CNN, I played the clip, says the guy was not a monster, he was a hero.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Absolutely, and just on a final note, because I have been waiting for about 20 minutes.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  No, no sir, you've got the floor, you're awesome, please continue.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  I want to say, a lot of people don't realize this, when they're on YouTube, for example, they think they're having a chat, right, Alex?
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  They think they're having a chat, but I suggest that they actually check with the moderator that they're actually, their words are being seen.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  I think a lot of people on YouTube don't realize that when they're chatting, they're not actually being seen.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  I've done a tweet about Roger Stone on, I've got nearly 20,000 followers. Do you know how many retweets I've got in two hours?
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Two retweets, three years ago, I would have got 200 retweets on that.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Yes sir, that's called shadow banning, and we have an undercover video from Project Veritas like two years ago, where only someone right on your page that looks for a confided, it doesn't go out.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  People subscribe to you, they want to hear from Patrick in Britain, but they don't.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And again, that is the great deception, it's the false advertising, it's the fraud of these corporations.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Could I ask a favor, Alex? I'd like you to ask Robert Barnes if there's a legal case to take against them to find out whether either they're curators or publishers, because they can't be both.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  At the end of the day, they're causing a lot of mental disorder to a lot of people.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Imagine if you've got 20,000 followers and for absolutely no reason, they decide they want to ban you there and then.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Can you imagine how much mental trauma someone would go through?
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  I suspect there's a lot of people who are feeling very depressed in this world who might go over the edge with something like that.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  No, I totally agree.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  The only source of getting out to the world.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Hold on Patrick, go back 5, 10 years ago.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Everyone was using their own radio show or TV show or the side of their house or ads they place to promote Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all those things.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  We built all that up and then we invest in it and they just go, oh, now we have rules.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Now that we're the only thing, they've totally abused their power out of the gates and it's outrageous.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Thank you, Patrick, great points.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Please don't apologize or have more points.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  You're amazing.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  I talk to each caller all day long.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  That's why we're taking more calls.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Okay, let's talk to Gabriel in California on coronavirus and Air Force Base quarantines that are now confirmed.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Gabriel, what's on your mind?
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Hey, Alex, first time caller, long time listener.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  But so I've been following this coronavirus in California pretty closely and at first they said that the first confirmed case out here was in Santa Clara and that there was no way that it would affect anybody else.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  But a couple of days later, they announced that there was another case in Santa Clara as well.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  And then tonight, well, last night, they declared a health emergency for Santa Clara and they're saying that it's not, it hasn't spread, but it's just that they can have the resources that they need.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I mean, undoubtedly, this is bigger than they're saying and we have news articles right here where the US has been releasing people that haven't and they didn't know they had or they thought they no longer had it.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  So they're releasing coronavirus carriers from bases in the US.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  What do you think is happening?
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Well, I think that, one, it is a bio weapon that was either released on purpose or an accident because if you see the videos, I mean, they're fumigating entire cities in China.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And believe me, the Chai comms aren't doing that for no reason. They're scared.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  I mean, I've seen videos where people are falling dead in the street and you can see them hemorrhaging from their face, their eyes, their ears, their mouth.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  You know, they're just bleeding out.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Yeah, that doesn't just sound like a lot of folks are saying is the coronavirus freak out a cover for something else that happened in China?
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Yeah, I mean, like it, I mean, the pot with, with, with, you know, communist China, the possibilities are endless.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Well, they can also use this as a cover for grabbing their political dissidents.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  And then as everybody else sees somebody being dragged away, they didn't do what they were supposed to do.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Well, you just think, oh, that's because they have coronavirus, but it's really another reason.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Exactly. And also, I wanted to talk about, so about 10 years ago, my, my first son was born and I started giving him nursery water.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Oh, my God, it's got the fluoride in it. Yeah.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  Yeah. And, and then now that he's in school, he's been diagnosed with ADHD, dyslexia and all these other learning disabilities.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, nursery water is sold stores everywhere has high levels of fluoride in it, which even the federal government says you shouldn't give children.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  So why are their companies targeting children with fluoride?
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  It's incredible because they can tricky to pay for your own destruction metaphysically that they believe they're spiritually covered.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  And, and, and see, there's the comparison is, is, is outstanding. It's like it's ridiculous.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  My, I have four children and my oldest was the one that was the only one to receive the nursery water because then I started buying your iodine.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  First, it was a survival shield one and then survival shield two. And my other children, I gave it to my wife while she was pregnant.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  I gave it to my children still. And I mean, it is, you know, it's unbelievable the effects. It, it's totally different night and day.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  You know, Gabriel, stay there. I want to hear your story about what happened with nursery water.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  You know, it's fluoride water for babies and what happened straight ahead and more calls. Stay with us.

[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  There are a lot of different ideologies out there.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  But I have followed the ideology of just science and history,
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  and I've been governed by my Christian faith as the light in these tunnels through which we traverse.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Fluoride in its hydrofluorescy acid base in thousands and thousands of studies is one of the most studied chemicals or elements out there.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  And it's so bad for the brain. It's so bad for the body.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  It's like saying cyanide is known to be bad for your body.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  It's so bad for your lungs. This is not something that's debatable.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  And there's all the Harvard studies and all of it.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  And then you see the countries that fluoridates, IQ is going straight down.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  So the caller, Gabriel, has multiple children.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  He was saying, yeah, I mean, I've got four children.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  One of my most child's 17 years old.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  I remember when I went to the store, it was like, oh, the fluoride water for babies.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  Even back then, the federal government said, don't give fluoridated water to babies.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  But there it is. So the caller finished up your story.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  It's a very sad experiment to have to describe. You weren't conscious when you did it.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  But the first child gets the fluoride versus the other children who get the good halogen, the X2, pure iodine,
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  describe what it was like, how that happened when you woke up,
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  and then the process of actually watching in real time with your own children.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  Okay, so what happened is the doctors when my first child was born kept telling me that,
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  because we did do both.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  We breastfed and gave formula, and they told us to use the nursery water
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  because it would help their bones and their brain growth and all these good things
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  that I thought would help keep them comfortable.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  And when I finally gave it to them, we gave it to them for about a year.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  And I mean, the amount of damage that I believe it did was, it almost makes me feel guilty.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  No, it's not your fault. You didn't know. Think of the evil, though, that they knew.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Exactly. You know, because this stuff isn't new.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  I watched a documentary from 1945 called Concentration Camp.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Nazi Concentration Camp on Netflix by George Stevens.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And it basically mentioned in there that in the Concentration Camp, they were using fluorinated water.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  And my kids, the three youngest, their development is above the board.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Think about that. Pulled surprise winning books like Rise and Fall III and famous documentaries from the time say Hitler put fluoride and water to dumb people down.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  It's a fact. And then at World War II, our own elites go here. It's for you.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  And then all these years later, 70 something years later, we put up with this crap.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  Yeah, I mean, I think that they should pull that stuff off the shelves immediately.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  No, they have something. You know what? Files suit against them. You know, they're not going to pay attention till that happens because it's all part of a eugenics sick joke.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Look, they used to use fluoride as cockroach poison. You just put it out on the floor.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  Roaches don't know what it is. They walk through it when they lick their feet later. Bye-bye.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  And so why are they putting roach poison in the water? It doesn't make your teeth clean.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Now, somebody can type fast in there. This is getting scary. They're typing in what I'm saying. They're pulling it up as fast as I'm saying it.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  Sweeney's sodium fluoride roach killer kills roaches, crickets, and water bugs, and sulfur spesh.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Don't ingest yourself or bye-bye. And that's sodium fluoride. That's the weak stuff.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  God bless you, brother. I appreciate your call. Sorry I put it into your firstborn.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  They're jerks, man. Hey, those that support fluorination, I say, what happens if folks say that you support leadination
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and people start letting your blood? Because you're hitting us with a chemical weapon.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Well, what happens if we hit you with them? We're like, oh, you didn't know?
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Leading of the blood is good as well. Here, I'm giving you vitamins.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Shoot you with a 12-gauge shotgun. I mean, I'm not saying do that. In fact, don't.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  I'm just saying, this is how they blast holes in our brains. You wonder how the eugenicists carry this out?
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  They do it in the name of health, and the average doctor doesn't even know.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  My dad's a dentist. Retired now, but he apologized to me like 15 years, 20 years ago, whatever it was.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  He's like, son, we need some calcium fluoride. I thought that was what was in the toothpaste.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  He goes, they're putting toxic waste. He saw the head Canadian scientist that had been for fluoridation come out against it.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  He's like, I didn't know they were putting hydrofluorosalicylic in. I mean, my God, that's insane.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  He would never think like that. It's like, really? But this is what's going on.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Angeline in Pennsylvania on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Hi.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  What I wanted to talk about was Mr. Roger Stone. My understanding is that they are Trump's Justice Department wants to sentence him to prison for seven to nine years.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Yeah, I mean, to say it's Trump's Justice Department is a true statement, but he's not in control of it.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  Yeah, I've got the big data dump on that next segment.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Well, you know, I've been looking at Trump a whole new way lately, and I don't like what I'm seeing.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  You know, he seems to need to be the other half of an abusive couple with children where the father is physically abusive to his children.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  And the mother is this great mother, you know, she cooks nice dinners and packs lunches and helps the kids with their homework and keeps the house nice and neat.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  But when the father comes home because he had a bad day at work and he abuses his kids, he doesn't do anything about it.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  You know, he just kind of let him beat the kids and be physically abusive. That's how I look at Trump.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  You know, he's doing all this.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  That's a really good. People ask why Matt Rudge is mad at him. I know why. I mean, I can see what Rudge is saying through what he posts.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  He let him screw us on Jover. He's letting the press get persecuted.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  And, you know, I'm so glad to have Trump rather than Hillary.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  But I'll say this, Trump gets reelected in 265 days.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  If he does, if he doesn't take real action, I'm going to make it a full time job to go after Trump politically.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  And we can already do that with our listeners and stuff.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  In fact, now is the time to have listeners go to those rallies and say, we support you, Mr. President, but you've got to defend free speech.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I mean, that's absolutely true.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  You know, also, he has freedom of speech. He can still tweet, but he's not doing anything for everyone else that's getting screwed with it.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  You know, I mean, he can tweet. He can go on TV and everything else he does.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  He can say whatever he wants, but people are being shadow banned on Twitter and on YouTube and Facebook.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Why do you think, because it's beyond free speech, it's racketeering.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  They're doing this in concerted action to violate huge classes of people's rights.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Why has he done nothing? Why did he tell Sange release it?
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And then if Sange did, he lets him stay in prison.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Do you really want to know what I think?
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  Yeah, tell me. You're on air. We're not censoring you.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  I really don't think he is the real deal, Mr. Jones.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  I don't, I understand that he's done a lot for the country. I understand he's done a lot for the economy.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  No, no, no, you don't have to provide so. Tell us what, how do you think Trump's bad?
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  I think he is a different version of the ones that are, you know, you can see all the ugliness of Nancy Pelosi and Hillary and everything like that.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  You can see their ugliness, but he is just a, a ver, he is a globalist.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  You know, don't forget his children played with Nancy, with Hillary. They went to each other's weddings.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  You know, they've been friends for a long time and, you know, Hillary's still walking in the woods with her rapist husband.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  And, you know, Mr. Rossange is suffering greatly. Mr. Stone is suffering. He didn't do anything wrong.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  We follow this pattern over and over again. I've been on radio for 25 years. I've had storable food for a long time.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis,
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory. They'll still take your orders.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there,
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  They actually give it delivered to you on time. They do what they're going to say they're going to do
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they've got to package it record level orders.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  So get your orders at infowarstore.com. Get the best deals, get it delivered first.

[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Hug the cobra. Love the cobra. Kiss the cobra.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  But never, never go to infowars.com or infowarsstore.com. Do not order those products. Silence Jones.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people and Alex Jones of Info Wars.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have brought control of your media.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken. That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war,
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Rex in Florida, you want to comment on coronavirus. Thanks for calling. You're on air. Thank you.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Yes, sir. Hey, Mr. Jones, I would like to blow the whistle on what's actually going on in the healthcare system right now.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Please.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  Basically what's happening is that there is a directive that's coming from our healthcare administrators down to the director of nursing, down to the charge nurses.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  What is happening is that they are threatening us as everything from CNA, patient care techs, level one through three, EMT, paramedic, up to LPN and RNs,
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  not to disclose anyone who is currently in quarantine or who is being underneath evaluation.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  We can't even tell the people who are in adjoining rooms under threat of violating HIPAA, the Health Insurance Personal Protection Act, for violating privacy.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  Even if we don't say exactly who it is, their name or age, which is normally covered underneath the act, they're saying it's a violation of HIPAA.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Sure. That sounds like an abuse of the act to engage in a cover up.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Yes, it is. Now, the other thing is too, what is happening through HPA, for instance, through the HPA healthcare system, through the hospitals, they own what's called rehabilitation centers.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  So once they actually get someone admitted and they see that they're not going to get any better within 48 to 72 hours, they then transfer them over to a rehabilitation center.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Rehabilitation center is for people who normally have surgery, but these rehabilitation centers have negative pressure rooms.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  They put precautions on the doors, what we consider precautions, which is your gowns, gloves, mask, goggles, feet protectors, etc.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  They don't even tell us as healthcare workers exactly how, I guess you want to say how infected or how serious the person is infected.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Let me guess, you've never seen anything like this happen before.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  We actually have a few years ago during the pneumonia outbreak, they actually had it, also we had a C-diff outbreak, which is a bowel-based illness, which never goes away, which can actually kill you eventually.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  So this has happened before.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Well, that's good news.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  People don't know about it.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  I mean, not in a good way, you know what I mean?
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  No, sir. Now, the other thing is, is that after they go into the rehabilitation centers for 12 to 14 days, they then transfer them over to a nursing home.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  What people don't realize is that nursing homes have contracts with the hospitals, but they're nursing homes, which is considered long-term care, and then they have what's called short-term care.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Short-term care is your rehabilitation side.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  So that's where a lot of these people are going, and then they are at those nursing homes, the CNA, who go in there and do vital check every 30 minutes.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  In some cases, all the way up to every three hours to do vital check, temperature, respiration, also checking to see if the person can be cleaned up.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  I'm not an expert like you.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  What are you thinking is going on?
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  I'm thinking that this is already going on, and healthcare professionals, like myself, they can't talk.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Not just underneath threat of losing their job, but also going to federal prison for violating GIPA.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Sure. So when I see these federal headlines from the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, the military has mass quarantine camps set up in the U.S.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  They're expanding them. You're saying that that is what's going on, and they're telling you, don't talk.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  They're telling us, don't talk underneath HIPAA.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  So let's say if you're in a room and you got out of heart surgery and you're admitted and you notice that there's precautions hanging on a door on a door hanger with mask.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  And you see these guys going in and out like myself, going in and out of a room for someone that supposedly has the flu, full precaution.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Of course, you're adjoining room.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  You ask us when we actually come to check on you.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Hey, let's check your vital since you had heart surgery and you asked, hey, sir.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  What's going on with the patient next door? Should I be worried? We can't tell you anything.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  And it's not just we can't even say remotely. Hey, yeah, they have a flu or anything.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Can't say anything, not even to the patients in adjoining rooms who may have concerns.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  And it's to the point where even other CNAs, other nurses, other LPN who may not be working on a particular hall.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  They're not being told either. So if they ask a charge nurse or they ask someone else, basically they're told, don't worry about it.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  You know, we can't say anything.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  Well, I know this.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Normally, GGP arrest people for videotaping stuff in public.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Everybody's doing it in public and they're being encouraged to do so.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Usually they censor everybody and so they're clearly trying to promote the fear of it.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  But while telling us, though, everything's okay, kind of a mix of propaganda.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  What do you think is going on?
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  I honestly think it's almost along those lines because if we take any pictures, if we make any phone calls, if I was to disclose right now the exact location of what hospital or nursing home facility or rehabilitation facility, I would go to jail.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  I would go to federal prison.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  I will have my license revoked. It will be revoked. It will be taken away from me.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Then what will happen is, is that they will actually send what's called a state survey team in to do an investigation.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  I will be quieted and what will happen is, is that these healthcare workers will be first fired from the facility to take away their legitimacy and also their, I guess you want to say their,
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  the weight of their word will be taken away because the way that it actually will work is the person will be fired from the facility, the state survey team will do the investigation.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  They'll pull their license and then they'll be charged with violation of HIPAA, which takes away all the credibility.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  No, I understand.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  What are you, what do you think is really going on then?
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  I think that everything, I think it's already here.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  I think that it's been here.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  I think that that's the reason why we're seeing things like, and hearing things like don't take up the mask, don't buy masks, don't buy gloves, don't buy a food because healthcare workers need it.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  That's why, because it's already here.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  We're just not going to hear about it because I think what the turning point is going to be is when more people like myself who comes out and they, and you could do your own investigation.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  You can actually look into it, Mr. Jones, you could look into it and how the HIPAA law actually is clamping down on disclosure of anything and everything.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  And it's not just, just particular coronavirus.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  It could be the flu, the diff.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  It could be a number of different things to understand the whole system is geared towards covering up these outbreaks.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  And it sets a very dangerous precedent.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  All right, Rex.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  God bless you.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Be safe and please call back in.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Powerful call.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Let's go to another caller.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  Let's go ahead and he's been holding the longest here.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Let's talk to Scott in Vermont about Bloomberg and the bribing scandal.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Scott, go ahead.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  I got a conspiracy theory and a theory because I can't really prove it about Mr. Bloomberg and Franconi, not New Hampshire.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  You know how that little tiny little town crevice in the white mountains of New Hampshire of only a handful of people was always the first to vote in the nation until Iowa got the first.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  But then with the Iowa fiasco, the media was again looking at, like they used to, the year after year, they were in, I heard it at 1am last night that they may sound like only five or six people voted.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  One for Bernie.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  But they all voted for Bloomberg.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Three, three writing votes for Bloomberg and one of those three writing votes was a Republican.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Now, the NPR did a program about Franconia notch this weekend.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Interesting.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And a whole hour program and talked about how, you know, the powers that be a deep state want to control the, you know, bring the vote would grease the right palms and to get people to vote, you know, and maybe pay him some money and they can took over a little in in the town there and ran that for years.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  So it would be the headquarters for whoever, you know, getting their people in.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  But maybe maybe Bloomberg grease the right palms of those three, two or three of those people.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  So he could have the propaganda on the media that oh, New Hampshire is going for Bloomberg.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Well, there's no doubt they've been trying to steal it from Sanders, which again, Sanders is a horrible person.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  But that's what the Democrats have become.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  That's who their basis.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  So in the process, they've created a monster like Sanders, their constituents believe that BS.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And now they've got to steal it from him again to just hand it over to other Democrats.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  They're just as bad.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  It is a disaster.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Obama didn't back Biden, his own VP, but Bloomberg.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  By the way, Alex, talk more, do a whole investigation on Jeffrey Epstein was a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and the trial level commission for years.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  I can prove that in my own.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  That's admitted.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Yeah.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  And who was the chairman emeritus of the CFR and he started the trial level commission to David Rockefeller and Rockefeller money and eugenics for years and years.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Yeah, do an investigation into the CFR trial level commission, which Epstein was a member of both and the eugenics connection with the Rockefellers.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Because we know that scientists were blackmail, not just politicians, but scientists were blackmailed by a method agent Epstein and there's not about it.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  No, not about it, Scott.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  Thank you.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  All right, we're going to come back.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  We're going to take more phone calls from Keon and Randall and many others like Brian and Tyler.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  And we've got Joel Scousen, who's a top expert on emergency relocation. I've got these articles that have come out with folks saying America's done.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  It's over evacuate to the hills.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  Is that really the case? Stay with us.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Right now, humanity's awakening is explosive.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  It's powerful.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  It's incredible.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on him for worse, his tip of the spear is your financial support.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  We make it really easy.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  And then for short.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  I'm blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, seven days a week.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  During this election year, that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and fight for your own future.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  Infowarslife.com. Infowarslife.com. Infowarslife.com.
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  You go to that URL.

[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  It's incredible.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  So do yourself a favor.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.

[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.

[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  So this looks like it was probably meant to all be uploaded to social media.
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  Of course, they're not going to go through his social media and find out what YouTube videos he was watching or who was tweeting at, because of course the story has all but disappeared already.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  If it had been the opposite way around, this would have been a national hysterical panic for at least a couple of weeks.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  Story says the suspect who drove a vehicle through a voter registration tent occupied by Trump supporters in Jacksonville admitted to police.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  They had an anti-Trump mounted and told authorities, quote, someone had to take a stand.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  They have the redacted, partially redacted police arrest report that's come out in the past couple of hours.
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  27 year old Gregory Tim drove his van into a pro-Trump Republican voter registration drive tent to Jacksonville Wal-Mart on Saturday and was subsequently arrested and charged with aggravated assault criminal mischief and driving with a suspended license.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  According to the arrest report, Tim told police he drove his van through the tent because, quote, someone had to take a stand.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  It was a political attack. Interesting that they did later find his Facebook page.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  No posts on his Facebook page since 2014 or at least none that can be seen from the outside if you're not friends on Facebook with this individual.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  So very, very strange how he's so radicalized to commit with literal terror attack against Trump supporters and yet his Facebook page has nothing whatsoever political on it since before Trump even ran for president.
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  Very odd that, isn't it? You'd think that if he was that much of a hysterical out of his gawd Trump hater that he would be relentlessly posting on social media about how much he hated Trump and hated Trump supporters, didn't appear to be the case.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  Doesn't appear to have a Twitter account. In fact, his social media presence is minimal or nonexistent. Very interesting that, isn't it? Nobody's showing a lot of enthusiasm to go and find it, so we'll never know, I guess.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  Article continues. He also showed police a video he made of himself driving towards the tent as the victim stood in front of it. The video ended before Tim actually drove into the tent the moment he described to police as the good part.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  So he was really upset that he didn't capture this attempted mass murder of Trump supporters on video. He was very upset about that.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  Tim also told police he made a video of himself prior to driving through the tent, but this video has not been made public. So he made some kind of statement to himself before embarking on this attempted terror attack according to the arrest report, but again details of that have not been released.
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  Quote, the suspect advised that he does not like President Trump, according to the police report. As Tim did not show any emotion recorded the aftermath of the incident and gave an obscene gesture, which of course is when he flipped off the Trump supporters after attempting this attack.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  According to Mayor Lenny Curry, what is clear is this individual drove up to a tent and was clearly registering voters with Donald Trump's name and a tie around them, so he knew exactly what it was, drove a vehicle at volunteers, that's what we know looks pretty political to me.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  As I ask in this article, will the media now dig through Tim's social media history to discover who radicalized him into attempting this act of terror, as they do whenever anyone on the right goes postal whenever there's an example of right wing extremism.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  The first thing they immediately do is try to exploit it to blame anybody whose YouTube video he liked or anybody he retweeted, we've seen that time and time again. Doesn't really happen on the flip side of the equation, does it? The media tries to shut down the story or basically ignores it and it disappears very quickly.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  I saw a CNN report on this when it happened after that, I didn't see anything after that, I don't think NBC reports on it, didn't see a lot of reports from big news networks, because of course the narrative is not very much in their favor.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  So the police report is out, it is redacted, there are some details in now which look very interesting, which has been blacked out for what reason we don't know, but again he's got no social media presence, but again it's been confirmed that this was, let's call it for what it is, it was an attempted terror attack on Trump supporters and by the end of the week it will have completely disappeared from the news.
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  Meanwhile Trump calls Bloomberg a total racist for saying minorities commit the most crimes. Of course this was a tweet that was deleted very quickly and I'll tell you why it was deleted, because Trump basically said the exact same thing both in 2013 and in 2016 during the presidential campaign.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  Of course this audio tape of Mike Bloomberg giving a speech in 2015 where he was talking about stop and frisk, he was talking about minorities being over represented in crime stats in New York and across the country, which if you look at the FBI crime stats and the crime stats from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  This is of course completely accurate, the reason Trump deleted the tweet was because in 2013 Trump tweeted, and he hasn't deleted this tweet as far as I know yet, quote, sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and Hispanics, a tough subject must be discussed.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  It doesn't look like Trump or his supporters want to discuss it today because they of course joined on the dog pile onto Bloomberg despite the fact that Trump is literally in a debate with Hillary Clinton in 2016 saying that stop and frisk worked, New York had massive problems with violent crime.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  This policy which was continued by Bloomberg had a massive impact in reducing those statistics. And of course you saw the same thing in London, another big city which outpaced New York for stabbings last year during one month, whereby we had massive restriction in stop and frisk in profiling.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  And then in the in the years after that we had a massive increase in violent crime in London. So Bloomberg was right. This is not racist. It's based on FBI Justice Department statistics.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  He was a little hyperbolic saying it was 95% for what he said was generally true. And Trump said the same thing in 2013 and 2016. So it's somewhat strange that his supporters are now piling on Bloomberg for saying essentially what Trump ran on in 2016.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  Don't go away. We'll be back.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:51.000]  Its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One. The United States of Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon Books.

[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  Headline up on Summit News. Bloomberg gets cancelled for old speech saying minorities are overrepresented in crime statistics. This of course was from 2015. It resurfaced again last night via a Bernie Sanders supporter from CNN. Their main concern about it was that it was a political attack put out by a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  It's not that Bloomberg was essentially right. And in fact, Trump, they did not go after Trump for his hypocrisy on this, which tells you a great deal.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  Article says presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is facing accusations of racism saying minorities are overrepresented in crime statistics, despite official numbers proving him correct.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  The Times are showing Bloomberg up in second behind Joe Biden, who apparently has already left and gone home because he's that confident of winning. A clip resurfaced from a talk Bloomberg gave to the Aspen Institute in 2015, where he discussed stop and frisk, which as I said before the break, pretty much worked in New York to reduce violent crime.
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:32.000]  It was touted at the time as a success. He said in this audio clip, which is again, it's nothing new. It's five years old, quote, 95% of murders murderers and murder victims fit one M.
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  Now, you can just take a description, Xerox didn't pass it out to all the cops. Their male minority, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed.
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  It immediately prompted the hashtag Bloomberg is racist to trend on Twitter, but it wasn't just Bernie Sanders supporters that were piling on Michael Bloomberg. It was Trump supporters, including Trump himself, who tweeted while Bloomberg is a total racist.
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  And Donald Trump Jr, who tweeted. Oh, my God, leaked audio of Michael Bloomberg talking about the high crime rates among urban minorities. Trump president Trump deleted his tweet. Donald Trump Jr didn't.
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  It's pretty odd because I said before the break, Trump literally ran on this same platform as the law and order candidate in 2016. In fact, in this article, I think I have indeed embedded the video from the 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton, where
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  Trump is talking about how stop and frisk was a great success, how he supports it and how he believes Hillary Clinton supports it. But she can't say she supports it for political reasons. There's also a Trump tweet from 2013 where he says quote sadly the overwhelming
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:23:09.000]  amount of violent crime now major cities is committed by blacks and Hispanics. The tough subject must be discussed. And people were discussing it, but only in the context of Oh, my God, this proves that Michael Bloomberg is a racist.
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  The stats don't tend to suggest that that's the case. They suggest that he's right. Now he was obviously being hyperbolic in claiming that 95% of murders are committed by minorities. But if you look at the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  we had all these debates, by the way, six years ago, during the whole Black Lives Matter 2014 to 2016, where Black Lives Matter was this huge movement, massive protests, and indeed in some cases, Black Lives Matter supporters gunning
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  down cops on the streets. That happened several times because they were radicalized by this rhetoric. They see white liberals kissing the feet of black Israeli black power movement members, literally going down the line, kissing the boots of
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  what is called an extremist hate group. Now I'm not going to say that because I get called an extremist, but members affiliated with that group have been linked with actual crimes and shooting police officers dead.
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  Going back to the article though, Bureau of Justice Statistics, again, we had all these debates six years ago during the rise of Black Lives Matter. The stats were readily available, not so readily available now.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  In fact, I looked for these on Google earlier, didn't come up, didn't come up on the first page, didn't come up on the second page. It's not like I'm searching for some right wing racist website.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  These stats were listed with the links to the Bureau of Justice official website, with the link to the official FBI website on Channel4.com. Channel4 is the most left wing news organization in Great Britain that you can get.
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  They were talking about it back in 2015, 2016 because this debate was being had in the context of Black Lives Matter and all black people were represented when it comes to being killed by police.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  So these stats were being online, have been talked about for the past six years. Now it's very hard to find them on Google.com because they gain their algorithm to relegate certain search results because of their partisan bias.
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  But they are on Yahoo! Search, and that's where I found them. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black offenders commit 52% of homicides recorded in data between 1980 and 2008.
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  Of course, this has become such common knowledge that it's basically a meme at this point.
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  And I've put the link to the actual screenshot which shows you that black people make up roughly 13% of the US population since black men and not black women commit vast majority of homicides.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  That means 52% of the homicides, according to these statistics, are being committed by roughly 6.5% of the population.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  FBI figures also show 38.5% of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black, again mostly black males, meaning that 38.5% of such crimes are being committed by roughly 6.5% of the population.
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  93% of black homicide victims were also killed by other black people, which again was not a narrative that black lives matter, was very keen on discussing between the years of 2014 and 2016.
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  So was Bloomberg slightly hyperbolic in claiming that 95% of murders were committed by minorities? Maybe you could claim that, but his general point is completely dead on accurate and it's proven by FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics.
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  And then there's another clip which is also flagged up over the past 24 hours in the midst of this controversy, where Bloomberg makes the point that these numbers are derived from victim reporting, which debunks the notion that police officers are unfairly framing black people as a result of institutional racism.
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  And then as some people pointed out on Twitter, including here, Matt Walsh, many prominent pro-Trump personalities joined the attack on Bloomberg despite him being correct on the quote, statistical realities of violent crime.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  So again, Matt Walsh tweeted, conservative jumping on the Bloomberg is racist bandwagon and now agreeing with the left that it's racist to discuss the statistical realities of violent crime, and all for the sake of bringing down a guy who wasn't going to win anyway, dubious strategy guys.
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  So again, you've got a bunch of, in some cases, quite prominent pro-Trump personalities trying to counter signal trying to attack Bloomberg, again trying to pander to this narrative that Trump is not racist.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  They're never going to stop calling you or Trump a racist. There's no point in trying to counter signal it, get over it. In fact, there was a poll a couple of weeks ago, which found that something like 93% of black people think that Trump's racist.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  So, you know, from what I recall, he did get a few more black votes than Mitt Romney from 2012 to 2016 in comparison. But this narrative is not really going to prove to be a success electorally.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  So why a bunch of pro-Trump prominent media personalities are jumping on it? Is anyone's guess, again, given that Trump as the law and order candidate ran partly on this very same platform, the fact that minorities are overrepresented in crime statistics?
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  You can argue, is it IQ? Is it upbringing? Is it socio-economics? That's a separate debate. There's no debate that they are overrepresented because the FBI crimes that prove that in trickle-tip.
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:25.000]  Blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:51.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  Don't be a victim. If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system. Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down.
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  Get plenty of hydration, prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier. Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3 which is fish oil. Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep. We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown to go after this whole corona SARS family.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:31.000]  A virus. We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles. That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.

[3:31:52.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:29.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:46.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:55.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:32:55.000 --> 3:33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:06.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  London Mayor City has revealed the winner of an award for diversity in advertising and this ad, this commercial, this billboard for underwear is so diverse, so diverse that it features absolutely zero white people.
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  That's how diverse it is.
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  London Mayor City has revealed the winner of an award for diversity in advertising, which featured, you guessed it, zero white people.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  He tweeted, London's greatest strength is our diversity, and it's record stabbings and by the crime.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  So he challenged advertisers to produce ads that better represented our pain communities.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  The poster features six scantily clad brown and black people advertising Nubian, a company that sells underwears people with darker skin tones, conserved the ad was empowering, inclusive, just not very inclusive of white people because there wasn't even one token white person on there.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  Zuby, the rapper, who is black tweeted, how is making everybody black diversity.
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  The judging panel praised Nubian skin for their bold and empowering campaigns celebrating different body types and skin tones which are underrepresented in advertising said calm body types.
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  He literally banned an ad from appearing in London that celebrated a certain body type.
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  What body type was that a thin, attractive, healthy woman, because as respondents to the tweet pointed out, another body type and skin tone that is underrepresented in advertising attractive white people.
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  Since Khan has banned such advertisements from being seen and they see the beach body ready ad, which of course wasn't back in 2015.
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  I think it was a long time ago now, which was banned from appearing throughout London and probably throughout the country from what I'm aware of, because it body shamed fat people.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  So as long as you're fat and overweight and out of shape and lazy, you can appear semi naked on advertising. If you're in shape healthy, if you're promoting a positive example for young women to get in shape, that is not allowed and that will be banned.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  Of course, aside from Khan himself, we have a advertising standards authority in the UK, which now bans advertisements that feature traditional gender roles. They banned a Volkswagen commercial in the UK last year for violating gender stereotypes because it showed a woman caring for a baby.
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  She was also white by the way.
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  Another ad seen on the London Underground was allowed that was allowed featured a white character and lectured male commuters not to manspread. There was no advertisement telling women not to bagspread.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  Meanwhile, by the way, they also banned another ad which featured a sexy female mechanic fixing a car because that violates a gender stereotypes, apparently, or because she was just attractive and not overweight and obese. Meanwhile, the only ads featuring all white characters in London appear to be those encouraging white people to sterilize themselves.
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  As you can see from this billboard, which is posted here at the bottom of the article. So that's your new award winning diversity ad features absolutely no white people.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  Meanwhile, another headline here.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  London Times says embracing traditional gender roles is a form of ISIS style extremism.
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  This was an article written by Julia Ebner in the London Times, who by the way, she works for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, ISD, a think tank that partners with national governments, Google and others to counter hate and extremism in the UK.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  What's the new form of hate and extremism wanting to be a trad wife.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  The article states, trad wives meet the women radicalized into complete subservience to men. There's a growing online community of women are rejecting feminism, God forbid, in favor of submission to men.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  The techniques used to radicalize them are similar to those used to groom ISIS brides. They're literally comparing women who want to stay at home and adopt traditional gender roles and God forbid take care of their husbands, comparing them to ISIS brides.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  People like Shamai Mbagan, who is banned from the UK.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  Article continues, apparently women who choose to be subservient to men and framework of a traditional marriage now represent an extremist movement. And this is not the first time they've come out with this narrative.
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  A couple of weeks ago, of course, we had self proclaimed anti fascist researcher, Becca Lewis, who tries to get YouTube to ban everyone she doesn't like.
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  She reacted to a BBC piece about trad wives by labeling it literal white supremacist propaganda.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  Because of course, in no other country across the world, not in Mexico, not in China, not in any African country, do we see traditional gender roles being embraced by anyone that never happens, right?
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  Only in white countries, even though ironically in white countries, those are the countries in which traditional gender roles are increasingly being embraced or not being embraced at all, specifically because of this kind of propaganda.
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  The New York Times also published an article asserting that mommy vlogging is a virulent strain of white nationalism.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  So now I guess if you post YouTube videos with your baby in the kitchen as you're cooking dinner for your husband, that's now white nationalism. That's extremism.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  While young people are being encouraged to chase a lifetime of vacuous promiscuous sex, mothers are being publicly shamed on national television, and this brings me to the clip.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  While they're telling people that it's an extremist form of white supremacy to want to adopt traditional gender roles, get married, have kids, they're publicly shaming mothers on morning television shows on major networks in major countries for taking care of their husbands.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  We have a clip here from the Today Show in Australia where they're doing exactly that. Let's roll the clip.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  I want to take you back to the 1950s, or at least that's what I thought when I read this Brisbane Mum's Facebook post.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  Brooke Smith shared her routine online. Here's what she said.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  I always make sure I don't go to bed until everyone's lunches are packed, their clothes are set out for the next day, including my husband's, and the house is clean, dishwasher is on, and a load of washing is on.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  I always get up early, 4.30, with my husband to make his breakfast and coffee.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  Go, Brooke, whatever.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  I tell you what though, Christy, a lot of people online are saying well done, praising her.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  Who? Who are these people? Has he hypnotised her or something? Who does this stuff?
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  Making his breakfast and then putting his clothes out of a night? Is he disabled or something like seriously?
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  Get a grip, get off your bum and do stuff yourself.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  My only theory is that she might actually like her husband and she might actually like to get up at 4.30 and spend time with him.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  I like my husband, make your own bloody breakfast and coffee.
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  Apparently this couple run an MMA fighting gym.
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Mixed martial arts.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  Mixed martial arts and they also breed bulldogs, so they can do whatever they want.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  Hey, you know what, if it makes her happy, but nothing in that list of things there.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  And she's got four children under the age of six.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  But did you see her photos too? She's still time to make her hair look beautiful and put her makeup on.
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  She looks gorgeous.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  Making the rest of us look bad.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  Oh my God, she gets up in the morning to make her husband breakfast.
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  She takes care of her four children.
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  She should be publicly shamed. Who on earth would do that? Who has ever heard of anything like that?
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  That's ridiculous, right?
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  That's bad enough to publicly shame someone for that on national television.
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  And you heard them scoffing.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  But now they're literally saying it's a form of extremism.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  This is how far down the road we are.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  So we've literally got young people trapped in this hellscape of modernity of degeneration.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  To the point where we've got record high depression rates, record high suicide rates amongst young people.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  People are getting married later and later.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  They're engaging in this hedonistic lifestyle, which by all judgment is making them miserable and depressed.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  Now they're being told that if they want to get away from that,
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  if they actually want to go back to traditional lifestyles, which may make them happy,
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  they're on a par with ISIS brides.
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  Meanwhile, UK celebrates man coming out as gay after 27 years of marriage with blanket media coverage.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  This is a TV host called called Phillips Cofield, who I think he's got three or four kids.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  He was married for 27 years before announcing on Instagram and on national television that he was gay.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  So he's basically been deceiving his family for 27 years.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  He was immediately hailed, celebrated, applauded. You can't stop progress.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  So getting up early in the morning to make breakfast for your husband and taking care of your children.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  That's bad. That's extremist.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  Coming out as gay after lying to your family for 27 years, that's stunning and brave.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  Don't go lying. We'll be back.
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:21.000]  Yes, now we know we're right. The New World Order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader is real.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  So it's an incredible town to be alive.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  It's an incredible town for being aware and being involved.
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of mp4store.com is critical.
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  So please take action.
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  We've got three big sales going right now.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:43:57.000]  And one of them has to end within a week.
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  It's amazing. Go check it out for yourself.
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:11.000]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good halogen.
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  That is the building block to everything in the body.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  So just check it out for yourself.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  40% off m4store.com and it funds the m4.
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  Super high quality, winter sun.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  That's why people get so sick.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  That's the main reason.
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  It's amazing.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at m4store.com.
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  Protect yourself and fund the m4.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  360 win.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  So right now, humanity's awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road.
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:27.000]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game like m4.
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  This is the tip of the spear.
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  If you're finding support, we make it really easy at m4store.com.
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:41.000]  Because they volunteered to do it.
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  During this election year, that's so critical.
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:49.000]  But they need the financing to put them in the field.
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  Go to m4store.com and fight for your own future.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  The demand for food has not let up.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Everybody else has basically already sold out.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  Or they have a giant wait list.
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver.
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  Because again, they have to package it.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  So I wouldn't crash the name.
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  Looks like it is really, really bad.
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  And it is man-made.
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out.
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  So get your storable food at m4store.com.
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  That helps find your operation.
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:31.000]  It's insurance.
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at m4store.com.
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  Get your order in.
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  Get your order in. It's locked in.
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  Guaranteed 7 to 10 days at m4store.com.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:45.000]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  We also have the immune guard with 40% off.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  We are going to sell out of that.
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:47:14.000]  We're keeping it at that sales price m4store.com.
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  We're going to get into the latest coronavirus news here in a second.
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  Big developments there.
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  First, I want to draw your attention to m4store.com,
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  where we still have available the m4store.com.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  Live select storeable food at massive discounts.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:30.000]  We have the one year supply.
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  We've got a whole bunch of different options.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  You can get the one year supply.
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:37.000]  Six months, three months, four weeks, two weeks,
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  depending on your budget.
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  This is in the case of the one year supply.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  3,456 servings of healthy, delicious,
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  storeable food, drinks and snacks for 365 days,
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  up to 2,000 calories a day.
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  Got a 25 year shelf life.
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  Just add water.
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  And again, if nothing happens, just eat the food
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:00.000]  and save a bunch of money.
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:02.000]  Anyway, support this network.
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  The five star reviews are rolling in in triplicate.
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  It's got 4.7, 96% recommended on the independent reviews.
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  We're under the biggest demand due to the surrounding
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  world events with each passing minute.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  Orders will get more delayed in delivery.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  So secure your order today.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  m4 was live select storeable food.
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  Delicious, easy to cook.
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  And again, 25 years shelf life support this network.
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  It's running out quick.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  It's available right now at m4store.com.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  As is the super blue silver immune goggle.
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  That's available at discount.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  You've got the super blue fluoride free toothpaste
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  available again at half price.
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  Who doesn't use toothpaste?
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  You might as well get it from us.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  We also have the ultimate fish oil bodies,
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  the immune support, the joint support product,
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  as well as ultra 12 and a bunch of other products,
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  including info was life knockout sweep age,
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  which is also available at discount.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  Bunch of great specials available at m4store.com.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  Please support this network by stocking up
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  on those products today.
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  With a particular focus on the storeable food,
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  because again of world events,
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  which get crazier by the minute.
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  And on that very subject,
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  the latest with the coronavirus outbreak
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  is that the World Health Organization is once again
[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  on the front lines of stopping the spread
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  of this potential global pandemic
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  by cracking down on people who might offend other people.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  Yes, they've declared war, not so much on the virus,
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  but on people being offensive about the coronavirus headline.
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:48.000]  WHO gives coronavirus a new name to prevent stigmatization.
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Now they've literally said this about four times now.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  It's like, yes, we get it in their original statement
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  when they declared coronavirus to be a global health emergency.
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  Within that statement about four different times,
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  they said that one of the primary concerns
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  was to not be xenophobic and to not stigmatize people.
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  Despite, of course, the fact that this is coming
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  from one particular area on the planet,
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  they put that in the original statement four times.
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  That's not enough.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  They said it again last week, and now they've said it again,
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  and they've renamed the virus to COVID-19.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  Despite the fact that coronavirus doesn't really
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  have any connotations with Chinese people,
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  as in the actual grammatical use of the term itself,
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  but they've renamed it to COVID-19
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  because apparently that's going to protect some people's fee fees.
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  The World Health Organization has given coronavirus
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  a new name in order to prevent people feeling stigmatized
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:50.000]  because the first thing the global health authority tasked
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  with preventing a mass deadly virus outbreak
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  should be concerned about is political correctness.
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  It's officially been renamed COVID-19
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  because according to the WHO, as they tweeted earlier today,
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  quote, we had to find a name that did not refer
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  to a geographical location, an animal,
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  an individual, or a group of people.
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:12.000]  Despite the fact that they've done that numerous times before,
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  what was it, the Middle Eastern respiratory illness
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  was one of them, but now in 2020,
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  political correctness rules supreme.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  They said having a name matters to prevent the use
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:28.000]  of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing
[3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  so they're on the front lines of that.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  Respondents on Twitter had some fun with this.
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  One of them said, quote, damn,
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  I was going to name it China Man Nasty Virus 20.
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  Another one asked what weight,
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:46.000]  so avoiding stigma is more important than saving lives.
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:51:48.000]  Another user remarked, quote,
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:50.000]  at this age, people are just going to refer to it
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  as the coronavirus or that virus from China
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:56.000]  because they kept eating the effing bats.
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  Yeah, seems like it's going to stick, doesn't it?
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  Meanwhile, Chinese propaganda video shows
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:06.000]  coronavirus victims in detainment facility dancing.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:10.000]  You remember the scene out of 1984
[3:52:10.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  with the mandatory exercise, Winston Smith?
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  It looks kind of like that.
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  A lot of the people dancing around,
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:21.000]  being choreographed by medics in hazmat suits
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:24.000]  don't seem to be overly enthusiastic about it,
[3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:26.000]  probably because some of them have been kidnapped
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  from their families, as we've seen in other videos.
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  Apparently keen to offset video footage
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:34.000]  of screaming Chinese people being abducted from their homes
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:36.000]  and taken to detention camps.
[3:52:36.000 --> 3:52:38.000]  The ruling Communist Party put out a video
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  showing mild coronavirus victims housed
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  in a temporary hospital being directed to dance
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  by workers in hazmat suits.
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  It was published by the People's Daily,
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:52.000]  which is the official news organ of the Central Committee
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  of the Communist Party of China.
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:56.000]  So this is the Communist government.
[3:52:56.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  So basically they're being ordered to dance around
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:02.000]  like in an internment camp, Winston Smith style.
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:06.000]  The tweet says, virus can't put out the passion for life.
[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  Tends to be contradicted by the other videos
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  that we've seen over the past few days.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:16.000]  One of which showed authorities beating up a woman
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  for not wearing her surgical face mask.
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  Another showed alleged coronavirus victims
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  being chased down by authorities
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:26.000]  and dragged kicking and screaming to internment camps.
[3:53:26.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  Another video showed a woman trying to scale down a building
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:30.000]  to escape a quarantine.
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  She loses her grip and falls to her death.
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  That video got deleted by Twitter.
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  Now again, if you want to claim that this is a massive
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  medical emergency, you could make the argument
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:44.000]  that they need to enforce authoritarian measures.
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  But people have asked the question,
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  are these measures really conducive?
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  Are they really corresponding with the notion
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  that this is just the flu?
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:53:56.000]  And what are we now?
[3:53:56.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  A thousand people have died.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:00.000]  They just had a record number of people dying today.
[3:54:00.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  And one day it was over 100.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  People are asking the question, are these kind of measures,
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  would these kind of measures be imposed if this was?
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  In line with the numbers that we've seen
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  in terms of people being infected and people dying,
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  the official numbers released by the communist Chinese.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:22.000]  Of course, you can't question the official story
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:24.000]  because you get banned by Twitter and Facebook.
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:28.000]  They're imposing the exact same terms of service,
[3:54:28.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  the exact same measures that the Chinese government
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  is imposing on their people.
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  They've said 15 years in prison for sharing disinformation
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:38.000]  about the coronavirus.
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  They've said the death penalty for anyone who infects somebody
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:44.000]  else deliberately with the coronavirus,
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  which of course means it could mean somebody escaping
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  from a quarantine internment camp.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  We have this headline out of the nationalfile.com.
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:58.000]  Chinese authorities disinfect Wuhan with fleets of trucks
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:00.000]  spraying chemicals in the air.
[3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:02.000]  It looks absolutely apocalyptic.
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:06.000]  Again, is that overkill or is that an illustration
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  of the fact that the numbers we've been hearing
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  are in fact far worse than the official pronouncements?
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  Meanwhile, border patrol officers at Dulles Airport
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  find a bag full of dead birds in passenger baggage from China
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  and claim it's pet food.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  at Washington Dulles International Airport
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:30.000]  seized a bag full of dead birds from the baggage
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  of passenger arriving from China.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:36.000]  First of all, who on earth would be stupid enough
[3:55:36.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  to bring a bag full of dead animals from China
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  into the United States at the height of a potential
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  global flu pandemic?
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  Second of all, they claim it's pet food.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  We've seen the dietary habits of Chinese people
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  in light of this coronavirus outbreak.
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  Quite eclectic, to say the least, aren't they?
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  Quite eclectic.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  So they seized this bag of dead birds.
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  It's apparently pet food.
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:06.000]  It's been marketed in China as pet food.
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  Again, why not just beat them pedigree chum?
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  But again, how stupid do you have to be
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  to try and bring this through an airport?
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:18.000]  So that's taking place.
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:22.000]  Zero-Head reports does a sudden surge in SO2 levels
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  that sulfur dioxide suggests a huge surge
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:28.000]  in cremations across China.
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  They're registering record surges in sulfur dioxide
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  burns in both Wuhan and Chongqing.
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  Asking the question, are they burning bodies
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  in huge numbers?
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  But again, you can't ask those questions
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  because you get banned by social media.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.000]  Just like you'll get hunted down by the authorities in China
[3:56:48.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  if you ask similar questions.
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  Zero-Head reports again in this headline.
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  By the way, we're not going to get time for the clip,
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  but Senator Cotton was on NBC
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  or I think it was CBS this morning,
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  asking these same questions.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  Are they lying about the severity?
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  Are they lying about the source of the coronavirus outbreak
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  given that there was that bioweapons
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:12.000]  or a bioresearch facility in Wuhan?
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  I guess Twitter will now have to ban Senator Cotton.
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  Zero-Head reports, Beijing hunts down Chinese citizens
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  challenging official coronavirus narrative.
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  This was another guy who was putting out information
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  that contradicted the official numbers
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  from the Communist Party.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  He was disappeared and now is probably
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  in a government camp.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:36.000]  I guess Twitter and Facebook have fallen in line
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  with the Chinese government and banned him on social media too.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:58:03.000]  War Room is coming up next. Don't go away.
