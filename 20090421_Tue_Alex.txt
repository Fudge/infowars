[01:15.120 --> 01:19.600]  least a million views in the last five or six days since he just did a little
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.280]  testimonial on YouTube about being pulled over one of these internal
[01:25.280 --> 01:28.680]  checkpoints that are sometimes a hundred miles deep into the country what
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.000]  they call constitution-free zones and more and more of these videos are
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.160]  getting posted on the web of Americans retired school teachers police
[01:38.160 --> 01:44.760]  officers firemen pastors and they get tired you know driving around their
[01:44.760 --> 01:49.560]  area where they live going through these checkpoints every day and they pull
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.520]  you over they search you it's not on the border and they will beat you they will
[01:54.520 --> 02:00.720]  attack you but then meanwhile CNN reported two days ago I never even got
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.400]  to this report guys it's somewhere in this stack of news because the stacks
[02:06.400 --> 02:09.640]  kind of pile up here I got clean this desk off got about a week and a half of
[02:09.640 --> 02:15.200]  news here it's like a devastating mess will you Google Homeland Security let
[02:15.200 --> 02:21.080]  illegals go or immigrants go because that article if you read it it admits
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.280]  what we already knew they in the few stage raids they do on the news they do
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.840]  about four or five a year we'll go to a meat packing plant or a farm instead of
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.760]  just prosecuting the owners by the thousands that would end all this over
[02:34.760 --> 02:38.920]  night if they prosecuted the company owners they go pick up the illegals
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.760]  and then take them to enroll them for green cards and let them go and then
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.000]  CNN every day runs these these these heart string pieces about and then they
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.400]  made the illegals go home and they made their children leave with them that
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.960]  were born in the US and it's just so terrible yeah you try going to Mexico
[02:55.960 --> 03:00.240]  or other countries illegally and then having a bunch of kids over there they'll
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.840]  throw you out but only after they put you in jail run a credit check on you
[03:04.840 --> 03:10.680]  find out who your family is and suck every dime your family's got Mexico won't
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.680]  feed you in your jails they'll let you make a phone call when you've lost 20
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.240]  pounds in two weeks begging for money then they take you and take Tabasco

[03:24.880 --> 03:32.840]  oh you don't give them everything you've got bank statements everything and now
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.480]  the Mexican police are so corrupt they kill the American gringos they killed

[03:44.360 --> 03:49.760]  illegal and homeland security hires them to build a little shoddy border fences
[03:49.760 --> 03:59.200]  that's been invented it's all totally fake and here's the headline I guess
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.520]  world that daily did a one on the CNN story homeland security bill that's

[10:17.720 --> 10:28.920]  defense of freedom against tyranny 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time this is the
[10:28.920 --> 10:32.760]  real world my guys found the article during the break in the first of all
[10:32.760 --> 10:38.520]  segment I mentioned that the federal government has been proposing and
[10:38.520 --> 10:42.000]  preparing and doing studies where if you haven't paid all the taxes they say you
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  owe they are not going to allow you to have a job and this has been openly
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.080]  announced citizens will be run through a background check to have any job you'll
[10:54.080 --> 11:01.680]  have to have an in standing good standing national ID card slash real ID to be
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.320]  able to have a job they've already done this with many of the professional
[11:05.320 --> 11:12.560]  professions and the illegal aliens have an exemption and they have an exemption
[11:12.560 --> 11:17.040]  in the 787 million dollar federal takeover federalization bill known as the
[11:17.040 --> 11:25.160]  787 billion dollar stimulus package and again the illegal aliens are exempt they
[11:25.160 --> 11:30.920]  are allowed to receive this is mainstream news contracts from the federal
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.160]  government illegally and do not have to go through the homeland security
[11:35.160 --> 11:40.040]  Patriot Act compliance that a citizen does when they get on a plane a bus
[11:40.040 --> 11:46.000]  rent a car get a job total control total federal takeover it's self run by
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.200]  offshore banks the government's been hijacked by offshore banks they do
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.560]  whatever they want with the rules they are above the law and get it straight I
[11:56.560 --> 12:04.880]  don't hate the dear sweet illegal aliens but I'm sick of citizens having no
[12:04.880 --> 12:09.080]  rights no liberties and the criminals in government not following their own rules
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.880]  and then making the illegal aliens above the law because they want to swamp the
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.400]  nation bankrupt the states drive down the wages
[12:16.400 --> 12:22.240]  balkanize the nation they want everybody at each other's throats the
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.840]  United States cannot coexist with that police state cesspit known as Mexico
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.240]  and it's a fact you get arrested by the Mexican police they'll keep you in there
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.320]  for months they won't even feed you until you give all your credit card
[12:36.320 --> 12:42.440]  info all your bank accounts your family's money to them I know probably more
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.280]  than a hundred people in high school and college and as an adult and today more
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.440]  than a hundred friends family neighbors who've been robbed and raped sometimes
[12:52.440 --> 12:57.360]  physically by the Mexican police and then we have these whining simpering
[12:57.360 --> 13:03.600]  CNN specials every day every time I'm in the coffee break room literally in the
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.640]  last week I see pieces making people feel sorry and playing sad music for the
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.360]  illegal aliens with the few stunt arrest homeland security does every month
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.400]  though that's a few dozen here a few hundred there when there's at least three
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.920]  million illegals a year coming in a million legals and then they have these
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.120]  whining stories about all the children are u.s. citizens but they have to go
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.320]  back to Mexico or or the illegal alien was married to you know somebody who'd
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.360]  gotten a green card so the kid has to stay here go to Mexico hey they're not
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.520]  taking you a dirt floored Mexican jail and pouring Tabasco sauce up your nose
[13:39.520 --> 13:48.960]  till you sign on the dotted line giving them every boot of cash you got I'm sick
[13:48.960 --> 13:59.920]  of it it's a disgusting joke it's the facts of life 40% of Mexico was taken
[13:59.920 --> 14:10.920]  by the United States Mexico doesn't like it they ate this country now 91% of
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.400]  America's including 80% and Gallup polls of Hispanics who are Americans want the
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.080]  borders shut because they know it's destroying their wages their future
[14:19.080 --> 14:22.600]  their country and bankrupting everything and they know when the globalists are
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.400]  done the entire United States will be like Mexico city and then there's nowhere
[14:26.400 --> 14:32.920]  to run you think I blame those poor peasants down there in Mexico you've
[14:32.920 --> 14:36.760]  been driven off their ancestral lands herded up to Mexico City 35 million
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.020]  people as a staging ground for the maquiladoras along the Texas New
[14:41.020 --> 14:47.320]  Mexico Arizona Nevada California borders no I don't blame those people but
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.360]  letting them flood over and bring down the United States is it going to help
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.480]  them making them stay down there and have a real rebellion is the only chance
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.000]  they've got a freedom that place has got triple the natural resources the
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.320]  United States has and those people are just as smart and just as hard-working
[15:05.320 --> 15:10.600]  maybe more so than the average American but they never had founding fathers the
[15:10.600 --> 15:15.840]  most incredible people in history every one of them geniuses every one of them
[15:15.840 --> 15:21.700]  heroes who did something new you know twice on record George Washington's
[15:21.700 --> 15:26.560]  generals wanted to have a coup d'etat right when it looked like they were
[15:26.560 --> 15:32.160]  winning after seven years of battle and to make him dictator in Mexico that
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.880]  happened against Spain and the general said I will be your dictator and
[15:35.880 --> 15:38.880]  everywhere else it happened it happened with Napoleon it happened
[15:38.880 --> 15:44.640]  everywhere else only one place did it happen where he said no and then he
[15:44.640 --> 15:48.960]  served his two terms they wanted to be king and he wouldn't stand for that and
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.440]  he left back to his farm because they understood something larger something
[15:54.440 --> 16:01.640]  bigger they believed in the idea that was their treasure and that is why they
[16:01.640 --> 16:08.040]  are in bondage in Mexico because they didn't have George Washington that's
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.520]  why why do you think the media likes to tear down the founding fathers and bad
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.080]  mouth them and try to make them look you know less than what they were because
[16:15.080 --> 16:21.640]  they hate them all parasites all control freaks the wicked upper echelons the
[16:21.640 --> 16:28.360]  New World Order hate the founders you have all this liberty all this wealth
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.320]  you have second amendment you know how precious it is to be underarms to be
[16:34.320 --> 16:45.200]  armed no one in history has ever had it and we didn't have it purely but the
[16:45.200 --> 16:51.720]  idea of liberty spread it's always an eternal struggle against your liberties
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.240]  and against your freedoms and then I read this illegal immigrants detained
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.200]  then freed to work and it talks about in the CNN story just google it Patrick
[17:00.200 --> 17:05.680]  Oppenman illegal immigrants detained and freed you google that you get hundreds
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.640]  of articles where they're doing it but the top of CNN and they stage these
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.560]  fake raids and then they take them and fill out and give them all green cards
[17:16.560 --> 17:28.640]  ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah alright I'm done talking about it
[17:30.280 --> 17:36.120]  meanwhile the NSA is spying on the congress without warrants go back to
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.680]  the last six months I kept pointing out how they caught in my 5m I 6 spying on
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.240]  the British Parliament of course they're spying on Congress I've always told you
[17:45.240 --> 17:50.760]  you. They're not listening to people in caves in Afghanistan. They are. They're only making
[17:50.760 --> 17:55.240]  sure U.S. Special Forces don't ever figure out who they're really working for and they
[17:55.240 --> 17:59.040]  use that intel on the military to keep people in the dark and make sure the compartmentalization
[17:59.040 --> 18:05.080]  is working. They use the NSA to make sure their cocaine and heroin shipments don't
[18:05.080 --> 18:12.880]  get interdicted by the local PD. They use the NSA to spy on inventors to steal your
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.480]  invention or to make sure you don't get it to market or to spy on university professors
[18:18.480 --> 18:26.400]  doing research that can revolutionize things. They use the NSA to track trends of what you
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.760]  want to buy and what you want to sell and what the new trends are that are coming so
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.000]  they can get a hold of those trends and head them off at the pass like Fox News is doing
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.240]  now saying they want to fight the world government after all these years saying it didn't exist.
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.520]  They tried to stall you, tried to fool you. They lost that fight for the mind. Now they're
[18:45.520 --> 18:51.680]  trying to co-opt. The left who always claimed they were against torture and police state
[18:51.680 --> 18:56.320]  and secret arrest, suddenly they love it. See, when they're out of power, they can claim
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.560]  they're fighting the man. When they're in power, they become the man. When the Republicans
[19:00.560 --> 19:06.080]  are out of power, they act like they're fighting the system. As soon as they're back in, they'll
[19:06.080 --> 19:11.400]  go right back to what they always do. And as soon as the public figures out this elementary
[19:11.400 --> 19:19.760]  trick, it is elementary, my dear Watson. As soon as we figure that out, we can start
[19:19.760 --> 19:23.720]  about getting back some real liberty. And then, ladies and gentlemen, we're off to Alpha
[19:23.720 --> 19:35.600]  Centuries. We're off to the next level of human development. And let it not be said
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.160]  that we did not at this key crossroads in human development, that there weren't those
[19:40.160 --> 19:45.720]  of us that didn't understand the true fight we're in here, the eugenics wars that we're
[19:45.720 --> 19:51.160]  now living in as the elite try to dominate and control the future by controlling the
[19:51.160 --> 19:57.680]  present. Massive news blitz of key information straight ahead, your phone calls, and a lot

[21:20.880 --> 21:26.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[21:26.080 --> 21:31.040]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[21:31.040 --> 21:37.880]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about
[21:37.880 --> 21:44.040]  left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the

[24:20.880 --> 24:46.880]  2-500-9. 9-231. I've seen trouble all my days. 1-800-259-9331. Too old Kentucky. The place where I was born and prayed.
[24:46.880 --> 24:59.440]  Okay, enough of the good music. Here is the stack of vital news and information I have
[24:59.440 --> 25:07.880]  in front of me as I'm sealing with rebellion against the tyranny. If you get that spirit
[25:07.880 --> 25:16.720]  of liberty, that spirit of resistance to tyrants, our troubles will be over very, very quickly.
[25:16.720 --> 25:22.960]  Washington Post highlights agenda for Bank of the World. Another big article, Steve Watson
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.800]  did a detailed analysis tying it together. A bigger, bolder role is imagined for the
[25:28.800 --> 25:36.080]  IMF. That's up on prisonplanet.com. And then I have the actual article from the Washington
[25:36.080 --> 25:43.080]  Post. A bigger, bolder role is imagined for the IMF. Changes suggest shift in how global
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.600]  economy is run. And then you read the article and it says the new global bank of the world
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.520]  will run every facet of our lives. And I'm going to get to that after I take some calls
[25:53.520 --> 26:01.560]  in the next hour in detail. Because when I get up here on air and I tell you that bureaucrats
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.960]  are going to micromanage and inspect your home, your children, your school, every facet
[26:06.960 --> 26:15.120]  of your life, you can have a taco shop, you can have a hot dog, wagon parked on the street
[26:15.120 --> 26:21.120]  corner. Everything is going to be micromanaged. You see, it's not enough for the big bankers
[26:21.120 --> 26:26.120]  with their socialist, communist, wealth redistribution system. They take it from the general public
[26:26.120 --> 26:31.960]  and give it to themselves and call it workers' paradise at machine gun point. They always
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.360]  have little control-freaking forces hopping around in black uniforms, loving the petty
[26:36.360 --> 26:42.320]  power carrying it out for them. And the elites always purge them as well, but they love it.
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.200]  They only want their little moment in the sun as a thug, people who would have done
[26:47.200 --> 26:56.440]  nothing or been nothing. Too they are, fundamentally. But it's not enough to just tax you and take
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.200]  your money. They want to run you. They want to run me. They want to be over every facet
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.280]  of your life. And they're now announcing every day all over the news. They want a one
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.440]  child policy in the United States that is taxes on having more than one child. They
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.400]  want you shunned. They want colleges to give preferential treatment to people that only
[27:14.400 --> 27:23.800]  have one child. And that's how China started the 7500 U.S. treaty agreements with the State
[27:23.800 --> 27:32.200]  Department of Random 200. And it became law in 81. They're now saying no fireplaces, everything,
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.800]  plastics, your car, your home, your windows, everything with taxes, everything with inspections,
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.080]  everything selectively enforced to shut down more select industries. And yes, there will
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.680]  be taxes on being overweight. Now, there's certainly a lot of self-propelled stomachs
[27:46.680 --> 27:52.080]  out there, and I've probably been one of them. But the issue here is that if you look at
[27:52.080 --> 27:58.280]  their fat body weight size index, they are calling people who are as skinny as a rail
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.720]  overweight and people that are just a bit husky obese. There's three different body
[28:02.720 --> 28:08.120]  types they don't take that into consideration. But regardless, they say they are going to
[28:08.120 --> 28:13.840]  tax you for being overweight. That's now mainstream news. They're going to tax every
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.080]  form of meat. They're going to tax as carbon footprint. Now, they're saying a water footprint.
[28:20.080 --> 28:24.000]  My dad called or called last week about it. My dad showed up Saturday morning. He said,
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.800]  he gave me the economists that's at my house, but I was reading the article. This month's
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.520]  economist said, well, we know there's actually plenty of water, but you've just been wasteful.
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.160]  So we're going to have a water tax because the water, a lot of it doesn't make it to
[28:37.160 --> 28:44.280]  the ocean. And so the oceans are going to dry up. I'm not kidding. As if, how dumb,
[28:44.280 --> 28:49.240]  this is supposedly an intellectual, hoity-toity magazine for the other people that are big
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.560]  brains, folks, the water evaporates and forms clouds and goes out to the ocean and rains
[28:56.560 --> 29:02.880]  into the ocean and then vice versa. It means nothing if a lot of big rivers are trickles
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.680]  by the time they hit the sea. It means nothing. I thought the seas were rising from global
[29:08.680 --> 29:14.120]  warming. They simultaneously have the same articles say that the seas are rising from
[29:14.120 --> 29:25.960]  global warming and they've got to put a water footprint cap like a carbon footprint cap
[29:25.960 --> 29:32.920]  because the water isn't getting to the ocean. I mean, this is incredible. They want it to
[29:32.920 --> 29:36.680]  sound ridiculous on the face of it. They want to just wear you out where you just accept
[29:36.680 --> 29:41.200]  anything. All right, we'll get into your calls, 1-800-259-231, when we get back. And a ton
[29:41.200 --> 29:46.160]  of other news I haven't even had. I am fired up for liberty. I hope you are as well. Prison

[31:01.320 --> 31:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.400 --> 31:11.960]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[31:11.960 --> 31:17.640]  us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[31:17.640 --> 31:22.200]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[31:22.200 --> 31:26.920]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[31:26.920 --> 31:32.920]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[31:32.920 --> 31:39.320]  finance all the bucks, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about
[31:39.320 --> 31:45.960]  a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and

[32:00.480 --> 32:05.280]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered
[32:05.280 --> 32:09.640]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs. It's called protogrow and
[32:09.640 --> 32:13.360]  it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.600]  to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions. Now here's the best
[32:17.600 --> 32:22.000]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.680]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in
[32:26.680 --> 32:30.800]  minimum time. Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.700]  unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants. Protogrow's full spectrum plant
[32:34.700 --> 32:38.040]  fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the
[32:38.040 --> 32:42.000]  nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass,
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.320]  you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[32:46.320 --> 32:51.520]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfoods should visit the protogrow website at growlikecrazy.com.
[32:51.520 --> 32:59.680]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[33:21.520 --> 33:41.400]  The rustic chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun. I walk roads, horizons change,
[33:41.400 --> 33:53.920]  the tournaments begun. The purple pipe uploses tune, the choir softly sing. We lullabies in
[33:53.920 --> 34:12.440]  an ancient tongue for the court of the crimson king. A lot of you out there love death. You
[34:12.440 --> 34:17.600]  think it's sectioned. You think it's cool. But it's your moment of truth. Will you be
[34:17.600 --> 34:25.840]  laughing like you are now? Because you are. We are in the court of the crimson king.
[34:25.840 --> 34:36.880]  The keeper of the city keys put shutters on the dreams. I wait outside the pilgrim's door
[34:36.880 --> 34:45.560]  with insufficient schemes. The black queen chats the funeral march. The crack brass bells
[34:45.560 --> 35:04.960]  will ring to summon back the fire witch to the court of the crimson king.
[35:04.960 --> 35:22.400]  The science of charity is war. They are the priests of power, of dehumanization. This
[35:22.400 --> 35:23.400]  is the eugenics war.
[35:23.400 --> 35:27.400]  All right, your phone calls are coming up momentarily. Here's the headlines Washington
[35:27.400 --> 35:33.520]  Post highlights agenda for Bank of the World that will rule with an iron fist through the
[35:33.520 --> 35:40.680]  new environmental tyranny, the green tyranny, the carbon tyranny over the entire cycle of
[35:40.680 --> 35:50.600]  life on earth. Life itself now listed as a carcinogen, as a toxic waste, as a poison.
[35:50.600 --> 36:12.920]  Trump proposes U.S. loan $100 billion to international monetary fund. It continues a bigger, bolder
[36:12.920 --> 36:25.760]  role as imagined for the IMF. That is such a big deal how they just roll that out in
[36:25.760 --> 36:33.480]  front of everybody like it's no big deal. Oil falls in their $45 as stock markets sink.
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.880]  Remember about nine months ago now, Lindsay Williams said, in the next four or five months
[36:36.880 --> 36:43.280]  oil will start dropping down to below 50, and then it went down to as low as $32 a barrel
[36:43.280 --> 36:46.800]  shot back up to 50, but then went right back down. Everybody's like, oh, see, Lindsay's
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.160]  going to be wrong. Lindsay's going to be wrong. And then boom, it goes right back down to
[36:51.160 --> 36:59.680]  $45 a barrel. That's got Hugo Chavez running up and groveling to Obama, just as George
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.680]  Soros said it would.
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.180]  I also got an AP article here that actually tells the truth. It says, saving federal money
[37:07.180 --> 37:12.680]  the easy way, cut a latte or two out of your annual budget, and you've just done as much
[37:12.680 --> 37:19.480]  belt tightening as President Obama asked his cabinet to do on Monday. In a quote, he said
[37:19.480 --> 37:27.600]  that they will cut $100 million out of federal spending in the next 90 days, folks. They are
[37:27.600 --> 37:33.400]  spending over a trillion and a half dollars. This is the private banks a month. Obama in
[37:33.400 --> 37:42.560]  two months in office, two months and 20 something days, 100 days, 101 days has spent more money.
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.920]  You can Google this number and then there's big news article sites that document it. He's
[37:46.920 --> 37:54.200]  spent more money than all presidents before him. George Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush
[37:54.200 --> 38:06.320]  Senior, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, LBJ, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
[38:06.320 --> 38:15.120]  and on and on and on. Harry Truman, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, right back through Woodrow,
[38:15.120 --> 38:22.160]  Wilson and Taft and right back into John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson,
[38:22.160 --> 38:29.120]  George Washington, more than all the money the federal government ever spent in all its
[38:29.120 --> 38:49.800]  history of 200 and 34 years in 100 days. Now, you wonder why they're building FEMA camps.
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.080]  You wonder why the police are brainwashed. You wonder why they're walking around in
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.360]  black uniforms with machine guns. You wonder why governors say you can't run Army checkpoints
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.240]  in Tennessee and they just do it anyways or why the Marines are out running checkpoints
[39:01.240 --> 39:06.200]  around the nation from California to Michigan. You wonder why all of this is going on. It's
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.840]  because we have been completely robbed. They've already shot enough financial bullets into
[39:11.840 --> 39:21.320]  us to kill us 100,000 times over. They just haven't let us fall over yet to fully bleed
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.880]  out. And when the public figures this out, they're probably not going to riot, some will.
[39:27.880 --> 39:32.600]  They're probably going to run groveling and lick the boots of the government even more,
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.240]  prostrating themselves. You know, that's what the public thinks, groveling and sucking
[39:37.240 --> 39:53.000]  up and being delusional and buying into what Gerald Salente calls the optimism opium. I
[39:53.000 --> 40:05.040]  mean, that is what is going on. That is what's happening here. And I know a lot of yuppies
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.920]  are giggling and laughing right now on a lot of Obama supporters, a lot of neocons. That's
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.920]  fine. Keep laughing. But at least when there's absolutely no doubting the things we've broken
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.440]  down here, I mean, exactly what we said World Bank, you pay your taxes to openly being announced
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.920]  what I told you 12, 13 years ago, what old timers told you 40 years ago because they
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.720]  had IMF World Bank documents then. And you sit around laughing at us and now we're finally
[40:31.720 --> 40:39.320]  here. The Christmas hog fattened up and ready. Got a nice little, nice little red bow on
[40:39.320 --> 40:44.480]  its head, smiling up at its master and its master just takes a big old butcher and just
[40:44.480 --> 40:52.200]  jams it right into its throat and just slashes its jugglers and carotid arteries and the
[40:52.200 --> 41:01.720]  black blood just spews and gushes and squealing. The squealing has just begun. So it's a line
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.080]  of Christmas pigs lined up and the Christmas pigs see one of the big fat hogs in the front
[41:06.080 --> 41:11.360]  line and a few hundred others piled up him now hung up by their legs to be fully butchered
[41:11.360 --> 41:16.240]  and bled out and they're squealing and the person jabbing the butcher knives into their
[41:16.240 --> 41:22.160]  throats is saying come on piggies, I love you. I'm your government, I'm going to take good
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.880]  care of you. And some of the piggies are jumping up and down and kind of clicking their heels
[41:25.880 --> 41:30.360]  together happily. They can't wait to get up to the head of the line. Obama's going to
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.320]  pay their mortgage. Obama's going to pay for their car payment. Obama's going to give
[41:35.320 --> 41:42.320]  them free HPV shots, oh goodie. And then as they get to the head of the line and find
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.200]  out it's not as fun as they were told it was, they get this little like a dog looking up
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.160]  at its owner when the owner takes a 45 and shoots it right between the eyes. Why? Why
[41:53.160 --> 41:58.360]  are you doing this to me? And the new loader says because we're psychopathic sadists and
[41:58.360 --> 42:15.120]  we enjoy it and we see you as dumb cattle. Now, die. Yeah, that's dark but you know Stalin
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.120]  killing 50 million, Mao killing 60 plus million, Hitler killing 20 something million, U.S.
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.600]  government finance and Pol Pot to kill 3 million. I mean the government is so illegitimate,
[42:26.600 --> 42:36.680]  no criminal that in the late 70s Zabigny Brzezinski writes two books. Just Google it. Brzezinski
[42:36.680 --> 42:41.200]  Google Brzezinski brags about funding Pol Pot and the son of a bitch and I had to use
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.080]  that term. That's what he is. He sits there and brags about it. I mean he writes books
[42:46.080 --> 43:00.080]  bragging about killing 3 million, 35% of the population. And you got all these shmucks,
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.880]  all these people in denial. Oh, the government's not going to hurt me. Why? The government
[43:04.880 --> 43:11.400]  likes me. The only reason we haven't all been completely imploded and gutted and reeducated
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.560]  those of us that live like the bankers have done all over the world is because we got
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.960]  guns and they've just been trying to figure out how to create a crisis where they can
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.640]  get the public to go along with turning most of them in and they finally figured out their
[43:26.640 --> 43:32.440]  plan. They plan to start a revolution in this country by pushing tyranny and get the police
[43:32.440 --> 43:38.200]  and military shoot up and killed. I'm talking tens of thousands of them conservatively in
[43:38.200 --> 43:43.600]  the first wave to harden them, to then form into death squads and fully go out against
[43:43.600 --> 43:48.400]  the American people and advertise through psyops, the slaughter and killing of patriot
[43:48.400 --> 43:53.840]  after patriot, hold up in their mountain retreats and their homes and everywhere else and through
[43:53.840 --> 43:59.440]  propaganda. They'll put out stuff about patriots killing children and all sorts of other hardcore
[43:59.440 --> 44:06.160]  black propaganda as they call it, meaning just lies. And that isn't going to work either.
[44:06.160 --> 44:10.880]  It's just they've decided to tear this place from one end to the other. They've decided
[44:10.880 --> 44:21.160]  to go into full tilt buggy. And if you don't wake up and understand it can happen here,
[44:21.160 --> 44:28.440]  it is happening here. If you don't grow up and get focused and get serious and I'm talking
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.680]  to police and military, especially veterans who've been out there in the muck who know
[44:33.680 --> 44:39.920]  history and who know how real the world is and how gelded and how castrated the public
[44:39.920 --> 44:48.840]  is in your gut, you know I'm telling the truth, in your gut, in your instincts, in your soul,
[44:48.840 --> 44:52.400]  you know I'm telling you the truth and you've been denying it to yourself and then you can
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.400]  intellectually, scientifically study the facts I lay out and there's no other conclusion.
[44:58.400 --> 45:04.520]  But if you won't do the research, at least look in the mirror and do a gut check. Tonight
[45:04.520 --> 45:12.320]  when you get home, turn off the TV, turn off everything, go into a dark room, sit down
[45:12.320 --> 45:21.400]  in a chair, lean back and ask yourselves where all this is headed. Ask yourselves what the
[45:21.400 --> 45:28.240]  feds are building up around us. Ask yourselves what the architecture of government is setting
[45:28.240 --> 45:37.480]  up right now. We've seen it before, but I've never seen it so lovingly crafted, plumb
[45:37.480 --> 45:53.240]  bobbed out, oiled and pampered. So you get ready. All right, let's go to your phone
[45:53.240 --> 45:56.840]  calls as promised and again, like I said, I'm going to get into the what living in the
[45:56.840 --> 46:01.120]  slave grid will be like. I want to update folks on that and get in a bunch of news. Let's
[46:01.120 --> 46:07.480]  talk to Kevin in Canada. Kevin, you're on the air. Hello there, Alex. How's it going?
[46:07.480 --> 46:12.280]  Good, sir. Man, I got to tell you know, there's around here in North Bay, Ontario, there's
[46:12.280 --> 46:16.800]  a, I talked to everybody about the new order agenda and quite frankly, there's not many
[46:16.800 --> 46:20.600]  people here that are pretty, that are very much asleep. But what I've been seeing around
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.480]  here is pretty much of a defeatist attitude is what I've been noticing around here. Some
[46:25.480 --> 46:29.560]  people, they know about the new order. They know that we're moving towards the fascist
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.760]  world government, but a lot of people with some of the attitude I've been getting is
[46:32.760 --> 46:37.920]  what do you want us to do? So same thing in Europe. They have again, 50th anniversary
[46:37.920 --> 46:44.840]  of the EU, literally like five people. You watch the films. I was watching it on cable,
[46:44.840 --> 46:48.280]  European news. No one showed up and the news wasn't saying that. They're like, everyone
[46:48.280 --> 46:52.680]  loves the EU. Look at them and it would be big parades with no one there. But yes, they've
[46:52.680 --> 46:59.080]  capitulated. They have given in. But that is a form of resistance as well.
[46:59.080 --> 47:05.200]  Well, one thing I've been telling people, just not showing up, not liking it, hating
[47:05.200 --> 47:11.760]  it, but it's not the time of type of resistance we need. We need the fury of liberty. Go ahead.
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.200]  Absolutely. And I've been trying to get a weird change that chapter going on in this
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.720]  area, North Bay, Suburban, Ontario, Northern Ontario for that matter. And I've been getting
[47:20.720 --> 47:23.960]  a quite a bit of a positive response. I've been getting on with the Facebook people I
[47:23.960 --> 47:28.600]  know who I know, where Facebook comes from. That's it. People are looking for leadership
[47:28.600 --> 47:33.880]  and you're at Kevin. That's what I'm explaining. They're looking for leaders. Lead them.
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.760]  Oh, that's what I'm trying to do. And that's why I took a radio broadcast. I just finished
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.880]  my first year, actually. And I just want to get out there, get the word out there to
[47:41.880 --> 47:45.040]  people that I'm getting on the face. Well, that's great that you're taking RTF, but
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.720]  I wouldn't wait. I'd start your podcast. There's hundreds of sites that let you post it, post
[47:49.720 --> 47:56.360]  it to all of them. I would start your reports now. Do not wait. Don't wait. Don't wait.
[47:56.360 --> 47:59.400]  Don't wait. Don't wait and go to the Academy next year. You know, like they're telling
[47:59.400 --> 48:04.760]  Luke Skywalker, okay, go get in the fight right now. The fight's going on right now. Don't
[48:04.760 --> 48:09.360]  wait. Don't go to, don't go to the Academy next year. Get in the fight now.
[48:09.360 --> 48:18.080]  Well, that's exactly what I'm doing. And let me tell you, it feels good getting the truth
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.520]  out to people that I'm telling you. Look, history's happening now. We need people to
[48:22.520 --> 48:26.640]  not procrastinate, to not wait, to not feel like, oh, I got to go to school or I got to
[48:26.640 --> 48:31.320]  get it right. Get in the fight, folks. That's how you get better. You get in the arena.
[48:31.320 --> 48:36.080]  God bless you. Good to hear from you, Kevin. Isaac, you're on the air from Denver, Colorado.
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.760]  Go ahead. Yes, sir.
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.840]  Welcome. Good to have a good comment. Hey, I don't know if you've already covered this,
[48:43.840 --> 48:51.200]  but on July 27th to 31st, they're doing the NLE09, the FEMA is. Yeah, they're doing a
[48:51.200 --> 48:57.160]  drill. Yeah. Well, they've released, you know, on their FEMA site, they've released all
[48:57.160 --> 49:01.640]  the details of it. And I don't know if you were aware of it or if you were.
[49:01.640 --> 49:05.240]  I know a little bit. Why don't you tell me, I mean, they're doing drills everywhere, how
[49:05.240 --> 49:08.960]  to take over towns, how to take over cities, how to put people in the sports stadiums. And
[49:08.960 --> 49:12.520]  then they say, oh, there's no, no, there's no camps. Here's just every AP Reuters about
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.600]  them training to put us in sports stadiums. We go ahead.
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.000]  Well, they're, they're, uh, they've kind of detailed a little bit of what they're going
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.880]  to do there. And basically it's based on a terrorist event happening outside the United
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.280]  States and the exercise will center on preventing subsequent efforts by terrorists to enter
[49:29.280 --> 49:35.200]  the United States and carry out additional attacks. Um, it's for FEMA region six, which
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.800]  includes Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
[49:39.800 --> 49:43.880]  Yeah. So it looks like it's down along the border areas that they're going to be concentrating
[49:43.880 --> 49:49.600]  on, um, which would kind of play in with what's going on with the Mexican drug cartels and
[49:49.600 --> 49:50.760]  everything else right now.
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.080]  Um, if we just turn our guns in and can, you know, don't get rid of the drug war that's
[49:56.080 --> 49:59.600]  caused all this, just take our guns. That will fix it.
[49:59.600 --> 50:03.440]  But the only reason I'm bringing this up was because as you know, and you've detailed
[50:03.440 --> 50:10.960]  in your films, um, these usually coincide with a real event like 77, they do, they do,
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.400]  they do hundreds of these, but, but yes, they always are running a drill when they do it,
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.160]  when they stage an attack that whether they're releasing foot and mouth or whether they're
[50:19.160 --> 50:25.360]  releasing, uh, you know, horse flu or whether they're attacking on 9 11 or 7 7 or Madrid,
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.120]  uh, or, or Oklahoma city. Yes.
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.120]  They always run a drill in case other parts of government catch the government operative
[50:32.120 --> 50:35.160]  staging the attack. They can say, Oh, it's just a drill. Yeah.
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.840]  When the Russians got caught in 99 doing that, that happened, but it doesn't mean every time
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.720]  there's a drill, they stage an attack. And anything else you want to add, sir?
[50:42.720 --> 50:43.720]  Yeah, this year.
[50:43.720 --> 50:48.040]  Stay there. Let me come right back to you after the break. I'm Alex Jones. The websites
[50:48.040 --> 50:53.960]  are in a full wars.com prison planet dot TV. By the way, prison planet dot TV has been

[51:02.880 --> 51:08.560]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[51:08.560 --> 51:13.280]  Are you safe when you walk to your car? Are your kids safe when they go out? Everyone
[51:13.280 --> 51:18.640]  needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack. You need DPS pepper spray
[51:18.640 --> 51:24.160]  from MrDefense.com. DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.200]  spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world. Need something

[52:01.120 --> 52:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the temple of the spear. We've
[52:07.000 --> 52:13.200]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[52:13.200 --> 52:19.320]  as well. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[52:19.320 --> 52:28.320]  interest of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[52:28.320 --> 52:34.280]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.680]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world
[52:39.680 --> 52:46.280]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[52:46.280 --> 52:53.120]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super

[54:06.120 --> 54:23.120]  My soul cries out. A rally for people against the tyranny.
[54:23.120 --> 54:41.480]  Yeah, the only thing I wanted to add was one blurb in there is that this year the United
[54:41.480 --> 54:47.200]  States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the U.K. in this exercise.
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.400]  Oh wow. I mean I've been to other exercises where they use foreign troops and admit it's
[54:52.400 --> 54:57.720]  for the U.S. But you're saying now they're admitting in the drill. Give me the URL. Email
[54:57.720 --> 54:59.400]  that right now to robd.
[54:59.400 --> 55:06.560]  It's on the FEMA website. You just go to FEMA and you punch in NLE09. I mean it says
[55:06.560 --> 55:12.560]  right there it's scheduled July 27th to 31st. It's formally a top off exercise. Now they're
[55:12.560 --> 55:19.240]  calling it national level exercise. You know it's all right there. It's just conditionally
[55:19.240 --> 55:22.960]  mandated exercise participation in Australia and Canada. I know it's top off. I mean if
[55:22.960 --> 55:26.440]  you look at all the top offs they've done, this is where they practice putting people
[55:26.440 --> 55:31.000]  in sports stadiums and shutting down cities and then when that goes, I don't know anything
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.280]  about putting people in camps. Now I know they got camps to help people. There's those
[55:36.280 --> 55:42.080]  but there's not scary camps. See the lawyer tricky place? Oh there's not camps. There's
[55:42.080 --> 55:44.520]  only helper camps.
[55:44.520 --> 55:50.760]  That's what this scenario says that it will begin in the aftermath of a national terrorist
[55:50.760 --> 55:52.440]  event outside the United States.
[55:52.440 --> 55:55.840]  And then we've got to have foreign troops here saving us?
[55:55.840 --> 56:01.000]  Yeah. Well it might be something, you know, something happens in Mexico and all of a sudden
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.760]  we have to declare martial law here because oh my goodness the terrorists are going to
[56:04.760 --> 56:06.040]  come into this country now.
[56:06.040 --> 56:07.040]  Oh no.
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.080]  Yeah. So I mean it's all spelled right out there. And the thing is, but I'm just glad
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.240]  that Homeland Security's internal documents say the number one threat is veterans and
[56:16.240 --> 56:19.680]  gun owners. Meanwhile they tell the veterans take all the people's liberty to protect
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.800]  them. It's al-Qaeda and then meanwhile watch the men. Watch the men. They're the terrorists.
[56:24.800 --> 56:25.800]  Watch the troops.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.800]  Oh true.
[56:26.800 --> 56:28.840]  So we're fighting al-Qaeda. We're building these female camps for al-Qaeda. Build it
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.280]  for the troops. Build it for the troops. Oh freedom. Oh hi. Let me see how sickening
[56:33.280 --> 56:35.280]  and obvious it is.
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.000]  Now I knew FEMA had a big drill coming up in July but specifically what are they calling
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.480]  this particular drill?
[56:41.480 --> 56:50.880]  Now E09, national level exercise 09. The thing is all these pieces are becoming glaringly
[56:50.880 --> 56:51.880]  obvious.
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.840]  Oh no. They've signed public deals to use Mexican and Canadian troops here during emergencies.
[56:55.840 --> 56:58.600]  But you're saying they have other nations involved? Who else?
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.840]  Yes. Yes. Yes. United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the UK.
[57:02.840 --> 57:06.520]  Yeah. That's who I've seen. Have you seen my film, Police State 2000?
[57:06.520 --> 57:07.520]  Yes.
[57:07.520 --> 57:08.520]  Yes. I did.
[57:08.520 --> 57:11.160]  I mean you notice that it's those foreign troops, those very groups you just mentioned.
[57:11.160 --> 57:13.240]  Thank you for the call.
[57:13.240 --> 57:18.480]  And that was 10 years ago in 1999 that I went and videotaped it and they're training to
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.080]  take your guns because remember we have the internal documents. Who's the number one threat?
[57:23.080 --> 57:26.840]  God owners. Who are the foreign troops going to be used on? Us.
[57:26.840 --> 57:31.760]  Meanwhile, they set it up and play in view claiming it's for guys with beards hiding
[57:31.760 --> 57:32.760]  in caves.
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.520]  I want to tell you about a sponsor before we end this show. Our Home Game. Let me tell

[58:50.840 --> 58:54.600]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[58:54.600 --> 58:58.840]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[58:58.840 --> 59:02.480]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[59:02.480 --> 59:06.320]  own bread. You'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.360]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[59:10.360 --> 59:14.840]  family in the final equation with you. You know E-FoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.600]  horrible food that's safe from E-C-O-L-I salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and

[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:35.920]  Okay, tons of your phone calls coming up throughout the broadcast today. Then coming up in the
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:41.200]  final hour, Pastor Stephen L. Anderson got beat up by the Border Patrol many, many miles
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:44.680]  away from the border for not letting him search him basically without a warrant. This is happening
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:49.880]  to everybody, but the illegal aliens are above the law. I'm also going to get into carbon
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:54.680]  taxes on eating any meats, carbon taxes if you're overweight, carbon taxes on having
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:59.880]  more than one child. It's all being announced as we said it was. It was all in government
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:03.280]  documents before. Now it's being announced to the slaves as the government documents
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:08.120]  said they would do. So that is coming up in your phone calls in the next segment. But
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:13.760]  I always love having solutions. And that's why Marty Schachter, World War II vet, started
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:18.480]  the company with his dad in 47 when he got back from Japan. He'd been in the chemical
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:23.000]  corps in the Army. He knew chemical weapons and he said, my God, you can't buy regular
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.520]  soap anymore. It's made out of, you know, good things. They call it soap, but it's toxic
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:32.320]  detergent. So he and his father set it up. And then until 2002 or so, they only sold
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:37.280]  to government and nice hotels and other people because you always pay less for the nice things.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:42.280]  It's a weird little trick they play. The government does. You pay for the toxic chemicals a lot
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:47.760]  more. But the smart folks knew how to get this. So Genesis got him to become a sponsor
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:54.440]  directly to the consumer. That's why you get 85% off and get one of the longest continually
[1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:59.080]  operating organic soap companies in the nation. They weren't even calling an organic back
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:02.920]  in his day, but they're totally organic. And I want to get Marty Schachter up for this
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:07.640]  segment a little bit of the next. Marty joining us from Oakland, California. Good to have
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:08.640]  you on with us, sir.
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:13.880]  Good morning, Alex. Always a pleasure talking to you and your listeners. It's just another
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:14.880]  exciting day.
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:18.680]  You know, I hope you can stay in business with the new carbon taxes that are only to
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:24.200]  be on the United States and the Western world. Breathing is now a toxic waste. And if your
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:29.600]  factory has any carbon dioxide or any other gases coming out of it, you won't be allowed
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:31.920]  to basically operate. So how does that sound?
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:38.040]  Well, folks don't have gases. They're made from vegetable oils and coconut oil blended
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:45.240]  together, but you are breathing in that well.
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:51.120]  Breathing is bad, Marty. Well, we've got to take care of the plants also. They require
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:57.440]  the carbon dioxide. I mean, sir, the FDA is I'm not kidding, they are now announcing
[1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:03.320]  carbon dioxide as a poison. You worked in the chemical core. It's carbon dioxide poison.
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:09.040]  Probably not. We're breathing it out every second of our lives. The plants are breathing
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:11.440]  it out. They require it.
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:17.480]  But notice, but notice there, your eyes water when you walk through the chemical aisle known
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.480]  as the detergent aisle, the soap aisle, but they're going to make sure that continues,
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:22.480]  right, Marty?
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:29.120]  But all the detergents are so bad. They're so toxic. They've got so many chemicals and
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:35.320]  ingredients in them. They don't take much to pick up a ball of zest or dial or doubt
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:43.160]  or Irish spring and read the side panel where it has anywhere from 20 to 25 toxic chemicals
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:50.960]  in it. And people are getting ripped off buying it. And we don't go into that type of philosophy.
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:59.080]  Our soaps are pure. They're non toxic. They're made from vegetables and oils that are compatible
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:05.600]  with the human being. And we've been doing this since 1947. We're still alive. We're
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:10.600]  still anxious to please. And actually, you know, when you're talking about it, it's
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:16.000]  like a gift, a gift. Why? Why don't you give a gift to yourself and your family?
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.540]  Well, they don't, but I mean, they don't want to do that. They want to believe Barack
[1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:23.280]  Obama and have a carbon footprint and a water footprint and only by toxic stuff from China,
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:27.520]  where they'll have no carbon tax. So that'll further deindustrialize. Stay there, Marty.
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.160]  You know, folks are insane if they don't save 85%. I mean, really, it's insane. Get
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:37.640]  organic soaps, save 85% factor direct, stop buying the toxic waste they call Procter and
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:41.640]  Gamble and the rest of it. Let's tell folks what's in the perfumes, what's into the detergents
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:45.040]  when you get back versus your products, Marty. Marty Schachter joining us from Oakland,
[1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:49.040]  California. And I'm not kidding. The energy he's going to pay for to run a little factory
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:54.480]  is going to cost at least 50% more. Everything's going up. They're passing the carbon taxes
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:05:05.720]  and I want you to know every one of you is going to be hit by it. This is feudalism.
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:10.440]  Times are tough right now and people are unsure about our future. The economy is hurting even
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:14.360]  though there are powers that would make us believe differently. Banks are failing and
[1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:19.840]  the gold buyers are buying question with all the chemicals being put into our air. How
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:26.800]  do you use gold when you're very sick or dead? Investing precious metals is smart. Investing
[1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:32.640]  in your health could be smarter. Life change tea changes your life just by drinking our

[1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:07.160]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:13.360]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:19.040]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:23.720]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:28.440]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:34.440]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:39.840]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world
[1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:46.440]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real

[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:05.280]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:10.480]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:14.520]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:19.760]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:25.760]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:31.120]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:37.240]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with

[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:28.580]  Alex Jodes. About a week ago we heard from Professor Griff's people at Public Enemy
[1:08:28.580 --> 1:08:32.760]  and they said, Professor Griff will soon be able to come on your show. And I said, well,
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:37.480]  that's great. We first heard from his folks months ago and we got a footage and he's
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:41.800]  in the Obama deception. Then the LA Times comes out yesterday and a bunch of other music
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.920]  blogs that Professor Griff over and over again was saying, watch the Obama deception,
[1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:52.640]  kind of like Muse gets up on International BBC wearing a shirt that says Terror Storm
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:58.920]  and he says, watch Terror Storm. We had Bellamy on the show after that. But I can't wait
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:02.280]  to get Professor Griff on because that guy knows all about the New World Order for like
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:10.840]  20 something years. Their last album was New Swirl Order. So they are certainly with tracks
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:17.000]  on it like 666 and really exposing the man. So I'm going to tell you about that a little
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.280]  bit later, a bunch of other news in your phone calls. I'm going to go back to Marty Schachter
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:26.200]  in World War II, that in the Chemical Corps. Marty, I want to explain to people, 85% off,
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:33.120]  what's in your soap, real soap versus what they call soap and why is this tied in admittedly
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:40.080]  to so many different respiratory problems, all these kids, first things doctors tell
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:47.240]  them is get on organic soap when they can't breathe and they've got. Oh, what's it called
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:50.320]  when the kids can't breathe asthma? Go ahead, Marty Schachter.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:57.000]  Well, you've got a situation of perfumes by itself, which are not breathable. They're
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:03.600]  supposed to make everything smell better. But the perfumes are toxic. We don't use perfumes.
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:11.040]  We use juices of oranges, juices of lemons, juices of strawberry, and juices of coconut
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:18.320]  oils. We use honey. We use lemons. And all those are items to make the products have
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:25.000]  a little smell, a little, but it doesn't hurt. It doesn't stay on the skin. It doesn't stay
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.520]  on the towels. It doesn't stay in the air, but it makes the products smell like you almost
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:36.800]  want to eat them. So this is one of the breakthroughs that we've been doing for so many decades.
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:42.760]  I lost count of all these years, but we make our products from vegetable oils, coconut
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:49.440]  oils, all USP grade, which means United States pure, and we believe in it. We've been doing
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:54.880]  it with stubborn, old fashioned, and we're conservative, and we've been doing it since
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:02.120]  1947. Well, I've seen your organic, you'll say to California organic pure level. So that's
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:07.080]  one of the highest levels of organic purity certifications as well. I remember seeing that
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:13.960]  years ago. Just amazing stuff. We use it in our home. A bunch of my office uses it. And
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.920]  it's just excellent. Tell folks about little tote bag and some of the other things people
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:23.240]  can try out from your company. No, number one, they get a free catalog. But just thinking
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:33.760]  of a free phone call to 1-800-340-7091, or they could see us at five-star-soap.com, five
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:38.840]  the number or five the letter. They could get the catalog. They could get the small package
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:44.480]  of our product to try it. We call it a one month tote bag, but it would last a family

[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:57.880]  all pure soap. It's got 18 ounces of our granulated laundry soap. Nothing like it in the country.

[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:44.240]  This is a very old one from the country of England. I'll show you column Great Britain.
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:48.880]  There was a young fellow, there was a young fellow of lime who lived with three wives
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:58.880]  at a time and they asked why the third, he replied one's absurd and diggamy sir is a crime.
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:04.280]  Marty Schachter, they don't make him like you anymore. You're a real character and we
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:07.680]  appreciate you. Take care of my friend. Thank you very much.
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:12.280]  All right folks, there goes Marty Schachter. I'd love to have that guy in studio sometime.
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.520]  He's been a sponsor for many years while we have him up once a month. Calvin Pure Soap,
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:24.000]  five-star soap.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Let me go ahead and cover
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:31.840]  this article because I said I would and then we will go to Kevin, Shadow, Jonathan, Ian,
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:47.960]  Tony and others. Pop and Hiss, the LA Times music blog and it has an article here about
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:56.080]  this huge music festival. It says before launching into its 80s smash rebel without a pause,
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:03.280]  public enemies front man Chuck D became conscious of a certain ageism in the air, cautioning
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:10.280]  that the crowd then is 87 1987 before some of you were born before launching into the
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:17.360]  song, though he thought better of it adding, but you were here for Paul McCartney who is
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:24.840]  before everybody was born. And it goes in to say with acts such as McCartney, Morrissey
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:33.560]  and the cure and Leonard Cohen accounting for this year's event dad rock at the festival.
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:41.680]  It fell to the strong island firebrands, a public enemy to be the token dad wrap booking
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:49.760]  of this event. And it goes on from there. I'm trying to find it here in the blog. This
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  is such tiny type the way this was printed. It says Professor Griff may have repeated
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:03.120]  references to the Obama deception. Hype man flavor flay appeared buoyant in gestures
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:09.000]  had in signature giant clock necklace. He executed no fear than four stage dives to
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:16.920]  the chagrin of fans, no doubt by going in feet first. Oh my goodness, you know, those
[1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:22.480]  guys flavor flay wearing the Vikings hat and clock around his neck. I mean, that's
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:28.760]  one of the icons and we're awaiting and we got contacted by him. We've talked to him
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:36.080]  and he's called us back. Professor Griff to say he wants to come on soon, but we appreciate
[1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:39.880]  him plugging and I'm getting emails that he that at other events they do. He's plugging
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:47.320]  the Obama deception, which is the number one viral video on the internet. Again, I it's
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:52.800]  been out for five weeks and I counted it up about a week and a half ago that we released
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:59.200]  it early. We released it on March 11th and it's now April 21st. So it's been out about
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:10.360]  five weeks or longer. And last time I counted it up three weeks after it was out 15 million
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:14.120]  views. Now it takes hours to do that because I got to go to YouTube and Google and live
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:19.280]  leak and the pirate bay and all these places and try to count up the views. And I spent
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:25.560]  two or three hours doing it and stopped at 15 million million here, 800,000 there, 500,000
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:31.480]  here, a million and a half there, 2 million here on and on and on 15 million. Man, that
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:39.520]  is exciting. Usually takes me six, seven months to get one of my films up to 15 mil. Didn't
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:46.200]  make a dime off that though and I don't care. It isn't about the money. So we have our sponsors
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:51.680]  be able to fund the films and fund my operation. And we a lot of my films don't even end up
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:56.960]  making a profit. Endgame certainly did and Obama deception is and that's good. So I can
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:01.680]  finance flying my crews all over so we can make even more films. And when I make this
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:04.520]  chemtrail film, I'm probably not going to go out to California and all those other places
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:08.440]  to talk to the experts. I'm going to dispatch my crew. My problem is my crew isn't big enough.
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:18.120]  So I got to hire a few more people. But it is exciting to know the Obama deception is
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:24.800]  so viral. So I know most of the listeners of this show have seen it, most of you for
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:29.720]  free, but please keep spreading the link to everybody you know. Just Google the Obama
[1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:35.160]  deception in high quality and the best one out there's got a million and a half views.
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.560]  It's a YouTube person that has a director's account. So the whole video is on one page.
[1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:44.080]  It's not broken up in pieces. Change the channel. We've had him on Burmese's show nine to midnight
[1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:49.480]  before. Great guy. Very interesting. He's got it posted there. And we like to link to
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:52.160]  lots of different YouTube accounts. That's why we do it. Because they can shut down
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:56.120]  or suspend one account or two accounts. But if I spread out who we link to and who we
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:02.400]  promote to hundreds of accounts, it makes them a lot harder for them to censor what
[1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.440]  we're doing. And we go to YouTube, even though they are censoring and manipulating and trying
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:16.960]  to kind of back burner user videos now for mainstream TV shows and movies. That's where
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:20.920]  the war is going on. That's where the people are at. So we go there and then we virally
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:25.040]  put it out from there everywhere else. But you know, the main port that it all comes
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:33.680]  out of is prisonplanet.tv. And we had something like 90 terabytes of serving the film and
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:37.200]  super high quality out to people when it came out. Everybody's sharing their passcode at
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:42.520]  prisonplanet.tv. So get a prisonplanet.tv membership, $5.95 a month to support us.
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:47.000]  Buy the high quality DVD of the Obama Deception with all the extras who support the filmmaker
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.920]  and make copies and get it out to people because it's having a huge effect. And I appreciate
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:55.080]  all of you out there spreading the word. But keep spreading it. This sucker has hit the
[1:19:55.080 --> 1:20:00.400]  trifecta. We'll be right back with your phone calls and a lot more. This is the Info War.
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:05.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:10.000]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:13.800]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.280]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:21.840]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:28.000]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.600]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:36.720]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:44.120]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:55.360]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[1:20:55.360 --> 1:21:01.720]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:07.840]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:12.520]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:18.000]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.560]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:27.280]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:33.280]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:40.280]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world
[1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:46.880]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:53.720]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in Super

[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.440]  Shadow and Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:37.880]  Alex, how are you doing? Long time. This is their first time calling.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:38.880]  Fine, sir. Go ahead.
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:43.600]  A couple of things. First of all, my girlfriend, Mary, listens to you at work. My 14-year-old
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:50.120]  son gets you over his PSP and he, because of you and my constant nagging, I am divorced.
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:54.160]  He had a dentist appointment and refused the fluoride treatment on his own.
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:25:00.840]  Oh, he refused his IQ reduction? Yes, and he stuck up for his nine-year-old brother
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:04.400]  as well, and they both refused their fluoride treatments.
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.480]  By the way, I'm looking at a photo of myself. My dad was digging through his desk and he
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:16.400]  found a picture of me in 10 years old getting a fluoride treatment. So later when we go
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:21.280]  live at prismplanet.tv, I'm going to show people this photo. I'm getting my IQ reduction.
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:22.280]  Go ahead.
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:26.440]  I wanted to ask if you were aware of, or if you even know if this works, I came across
[1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:31.360]  something called screwgle.org, which allows you to surf Google anonymously.
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.600]  Yeah, you've got to watch the other screwgle because it's a porn site. But yeah, no, it's
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:40.640]  a good system. It goes through there. What proxy servers, I think?
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:43.400]  Yeah, that's how they claim it works.
[1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:46.520]  That's good. Okay, so it does work?
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:50.320]  Yeah, we've got links, I think, to screwgle on prismplanet.
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.320]  Okay, all right. Also, I don't know if you're aware or your listeners are aware that Ron
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:01.680]  Paul's bill to audit the Federal Reserve, HR 1207, has garnered 55 co-sponsors and is
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:04.600]  now being referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:11.960]  Yes, and last Congress, his bill to abolish the Fed got up to over 70, and then he has
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:17.960]  to start over again, you know, each new legislative session. But that is very, very exciting.
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:23.320]  I mean, how dare us try to audit the Private Federal Reserve? And then the big neoconsite
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:29.800]  front-page magazine did a hit piece saying that the liberals with Ron Paul want to hijack
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.960]  the Fed and use it for communism, literally saying that so that it won't be independent
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:41.680]  and free market. Now, again, how is that conservative to let the Private Federal Reserve not be
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:47.600]  audited and be above the government? And then you're called a commie racist. That's what
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:53.040]  it literally says, if you want to audit it. I mean, it's getting so ridiculous. And then
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:58.160]  Garofalo on the fake left says, if you're part of a tea party, you hate black people,
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:02.120]  period. That's all they've got now is, oh, you want to audit the private Fed, you hate
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:05.720]  blacks. Oh, you hate Jews. We're like, what is this about blacks and Jews? Why are you
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:11.160]  bringing that up? Oh, I see you're a racist. They are the racist. They peddle this stuff.
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:18.080]  They use it. They pimp it out to neutralize their political foes and it doesn't work anymore.
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:22.760]  They've destroyed the taboo of people shaking in their boots when they're called this now
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:27.800]  because it's a load of bull. I appreciate your call, shadow. Glad you updated us on
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:30.960]  that. Yes, I, it's getting a lot of, uh, I can confirm for people that it's getting
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:35.840]  a lot of sponsors. One day closer to victory against the pieces of filth that are the Federal
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:42.560]  Reserve, Jonathan in Texas, you're on the air. Hey, Alex, how you doing? Hey, I'm doing
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.840]  fine, man. Um, I was giving you a call, but, uh, first of all, I get to my story. I just
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:51.600]  want to say I've always listened to you. I've listened to you for over 12 to 13 years. I
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:58.720]  am African-American and I've watched you, uh, since you were arrested at the, the DPS
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  center down there on the market. I used to live in, in Austin, so, um, and I paid attention
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.240]  to you over the years and I've tried to turn my friends onto you and tell them about you
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:13.400]  and stuff, but you know, they're still kind of, kind of out there, but the real, the real
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:17.560]  reason why I was calling, I was down there this weekend because one of my friends, uh,
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:23.240]  he lost his daughter and I don't know. It's very emotional for me. So how old are they?
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:28.520]  Uh, how old was the daughter? She was, she was 15 years old. It was a big story down
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:36.560]  there. How did she die? Well, she was, um, she was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:44.000]  in her brain. Um, the last time I saw her, she was so vibrant, so full of life and just
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:50.360]  the most wonderful person that I, that I know, but just, just bear with me for a minute,
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:55.800]  but they shoot her up with that, with the HPV. Well, that's why I was calling because
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:00.600]  I know I heard today that you, that you were having a show on that today, or at least I
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:08.560]  was supposed to have someone on about vaccinations. And so I was calling because, uh, when I talked
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:13.160]  to my friend this weekend and, you know, we were trying to go back on, you know, what
[1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:17.160]  had happened and what had occurred and, you know, I was asking them, you know, well,
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:21.800]  how could all this happen? Or what, you know, he didn't have any answers and I was asking
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:25.880]  them about the doctor and stuff and they were like, they didn't have any answers. So we
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:30.600]  were just talking about it. And so it came up and it was like, she had, uh, the school
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:36.000]  had forced her to take these two shots back in September. And so I don't know if all
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:41.480]  this links together or, of course it does. Of course it does. Stay there. Hey, uh, what,
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:47.080]  what's her name? You say it's in the news. I'll pull the article up. Yes. Haley Brandt.
[1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:55.560]  Haley Brandt. Stay there. Stay there. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex

[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:08.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show. Because there's
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:20.840]  a war on for your mind.
[1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:28.560]  Did you guys find that article about that girl during the break? You're saying it was
[1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:31.960]  in the news. Regardless, the HPV shot, the reason I guessed it would be that one, it's
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:38.720]  a three-round shot. In the trials with just a few thousand girls, it killed, was it more
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:44.120]  than 15? And that's just where they admit it. With a new drug, they say they catch about
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:49.040]  one out of a hundred bad reactions or deaths. With a drug that's well-known or vaccine,
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:54.960]  they say they catch one out of 10, or 10%. And so we were talking about 15 dead and it's
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:59.640]  a hundred times that. And then they've given it to hundreds of thousands. Now it costs
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:04.960]  800-something bucks for three shots, sometimes a little bit cheaper, sometimes more. And
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:11.400]  then they say, oh, well, it's a welfare thing. The schools will pay for it. And they give
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:14.800]  them these shots, and people are just dying everywhere. I mean, they give their kids the
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.040]  shots. They're dead a month later. I mean, they'll give them the shot. They'll die.
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:24.320]  They give baby shots at the doctor. They'll die in the car. And it's not enough for the
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:29.040]  police and the government after they've murdered your child. They're now going to arrest you
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:32.800]  because there's bleeding on the brain. They have these violent, I've had top surgeons
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:37.000]  and scientists and brain surgeons on. They'll tell you, they'll have this autoimmune response.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.240]  Blood vessels break in the brain. They break all the body. Blood starts coming out every
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:45.560]  orifice out of their pores. They have violent autoimmune responses, especially from HPV.
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:50.640]  The MMR does it too. The child starts having a convulsion and they take you up for a grand
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:55.720]  jury and say, this mother must have shaken her child. The grand jury says, indict. Mother
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:04.200]  goes right into prison or death row. And they high five. Yeah. Good job. Eugenics wars.
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:08.680]  Death continues. And it's all compartmentalized. Everybody feels good about themselves and
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:13.760]  the carnage and death just continues. You know, just 30 years ago, finding a cancer
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:21.720]  with a child with cancer was like finding a needle in a haystack. Very, very rare. Now
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:28.400]  it's just death and destruction everywhere. GMO foods, injectors, vaccines, all, all just
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:33.200]  Google, uh, fluoride bone cancer. They had met all over the world. Boys are dying of
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:39.000]  bone cancer because genetically it hits them worse. So are girls. Absolutely. Sodium fluoride
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:43.520]  and they don't care. And they tell the kids, you need extra fluoride. And then the kids
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:47.680]  get the cancer and they chemo them up and they lower their little five, six, seven, ten
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:51.600]  year old down in that grave and everybody goes back and they have other kids and they
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:56.920]  keep just shooting them up and fluoride in them and it is just death, death, death. All
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:02.160]  and because the public won't come to grips with how evil the government is. They cannot
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.560]  and the doctors don't know their compartmentalized jackasses. Now I'm going to shut up. I just,
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:11.320]  this just really upsets me going back to Jonathan. Okay. Tell the story. You're talking to your
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:16.240]  friend from Austin and you're, you know, she's happy. She's healthy. Suddenly it's a brain
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:23.760]  tumor. They claim, uh, and then tell me what happened to her. Um, well, back where, um,
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:29.760]  she started, uh, uh, mother, she started having headaches. And so her mother, you know, just
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.600]  thought something, you know, just migrants from so, you know, but she noticed that it
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:39.280]  persisted. So, you know, they decided to take it to a hospital and, um, once they got there,
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:43.760]  they checked her out and at first they didn't find anything, but she continued to have problems
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.440]  and she started like losing her balance and stuff like that. So they took her back to
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:58.080]  and they found the tumor and Skype phone. I'm on, I'm on my cell phone. Okay. Well,
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:02.960]  it's breaking up. Uh, go back. Did I hear you say after she took the vaccines when all this started?
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:09.440]  Right. Well, well, after talking to him, I found out that she took the vaccines back in
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:16.000]  September. Do you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not even sure. I just, you know, I'm just getting
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.560]  the pieces of it. So the school said it's the law. You've got to take it. Let me guess. There
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:25.920]  is no law. You're able to refuse. So they lied to commit the crime. Then they inject her and then
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:32.800]  bye-bye. Right. She was told that she had to take two shots before she came to school and I'm,
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:37.600]  I'm not sure which two shots they were, but you know, and just talking to him to them and
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:43.360]  and after me being listening to you, I just started coming to me like, you know, let me check
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  into this. And so that's why I called today because I heard you were going to have someone on
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.840]  there today about vaccinations. Yeah. Well, people, people will try to whitewash this, but
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:56.000]  they admit HPVs killing people. They admit the swine flu killed people. They admit and they
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.080]  say, well, a certain amount dying is normal. Or then they'll say, Oh, it's const, you know,
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:03.840]  it's consequential. You're just saying they died and that it's connected to the snow.
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.040]  People give their daughters these shots and they die a couple of weeks later or that day.
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:12.880]  And they had men, the doctors come in and say, yeah, they had an auto immune response and killed
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:18.480]  them. But more often than not, sir, Google cancer viruses and vaccines. It's in all the
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:24.960]  major vaccine lines. And, and, and what was this little girl black? Yes. Okay. Well, let me just
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:30.400]  tell you this stuff kills white people. But when it's a bio weapon,
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:36.880]  like HIV or other things, which was part of the US government cancer research weapons program,
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:43.200]  weaponized cancer program, it's all much more destructive on blacks. In every case we've seen
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:47.440]  the vaccines are causing a lot of the diabetes. You notice it's in blacks and Hispanics are
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:54.240]  eating the same amount of sugar whites are. It's all of this. It's race bio weapons and they
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:58.720]  introduce it through the vaccines. The schools don't know the teachers don't know the doctors
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:04.240]  don't know they're too cowardly to ever admit the full horror. And parents just want to kind of
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.520]  forget about it. Oh, no, I'd be more painful about decided they killed my daughter. I better just
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:14.000]  rationalize it. I've gotten to the point where if I'm pumping gas or I'm driving to the parking
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:17.920]  line, I see people with a baby, I say, don't vaccinate them. For God's sake, research it.
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:20.480]  And a lot of times they'll look at me hatefully or a lot of times they'll wave and smile.
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:27.040]  But I have to warn these people this is a chemical biological weapons attack, sir.
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:30.560]  Now, with her case, what type of here it is says
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:36.160]  mcallum athletes remember one of their own mcallum sophomore hurtlers.
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:41.840]  Chris seals were a pin in the lowercase h encased in the heart.
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:50.160]  To the district 26 a track me teammate, Rachelle Ellis and many other nights wore
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:56.560]  t shirts with we run for Haley's they always make it a big event to but never talk about the vaccines.
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:40:01.600]  Same thing with HIV, everything autism. Some members of the track team observed a moment of
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:10.560]  silence. Haley Brent was not with them. School's mission was completed. But in a way she was.
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:15.600]  Haley, a 15 year old sophomore at mcallum died Tuesday, three months after being diagnosed with
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:23.360]  a brain stem tumor. Yeah. So she inspired me a lot, said Ellis, a junior. She was amazing.
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.680]  Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Just last fall, Haley was district 26.
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:32.880]  For a newcomer and the year in the volleyball, she was expected to run varsity track from
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:38.000]  mcallum this spring. This week, however, Haley was remembered more for her personality than
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:43.040]  her athletic achievements. She had an infectious smile that would line up a room. You couldn't
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:48.800]  help but fall in love with the kid. The minute you meet her, said Michael Cain, the owner of
[1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:53.440]  awesome performance volleyball, a team club for which Haley completed. Hey, maybe if half the
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:57.840]  volleyball team dies, you wake up to the vaccines, but probably not. We just don't know them. They
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:03.360]  all die now. It's just the way America works. In the months, everybody's got cancer now.
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.000]  The government says in all the UN documents, they want to kill us and that we're a cancer,
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:13.680]  but let's take more shots. I trust the government. Now, in the months since the series of headaches
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:18.960]  led to Haley's diagnosis in January, Calum's teammates kept up with her friend to blog.
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:27.440]  Haley Brent dot blogspot.com chronicle higher highs and lows, including a trip to New York
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:32.480]  made possible by make a wish foundation. You know, I wanted to make a wish, tell folks about the
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:38.640]  vaccines there. Haley was all smiles as she met talk show host Tyra Banks, but her condition
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:43.280]  declined over the past two weeks. The girls were all pretty much prepared for it. And Calum volleyball
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:48.320]  coach Amy Broderick. Yeah, that's just how America is. Kids, kids are dying all over my
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:51.920]  neighborhood. A little two, three year olds. Oh, that's what it is. We all die cancer now.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.240]  Little kids just all die. Everything's fine. But don't worry. The government's going to ban
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:00.880]  carbon dioxide plants. Breathe. That'll, that'll save us. Following the news of Haley's death,
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:04.480]  the Calum volleyball players gathered in the gym to meet with coaches and counselors.
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:09.360]  And it just goes on from there. Well, well, we can't say this was the vaccines. We just know
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:13.440]  all the kids are dying now, but go ahead. Anything else you want to add, Jonathan? What did the
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:17.120]  parents think when you told them it could have been the vaccines? Well, he said he was going
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:22.640]  to look at it, but her funeral was just this past Sunday. So I just left from them yesterday and
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:27.920]  came back up here to Arlington and I told them I was going to do some real research and I told
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.080]  them a view and what I've heard from you. And then I heard today that you were going to have
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:37.440]  someone on it. So I was just calling, you know, maybe to get some information or just to, you
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.160]  know, to be in touch with, you know, some websites or people that I can contact because
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:47.040]  I just believe that it had something to do with this because this girl was completely healthy,
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:52.320]  never had any health problems, never had anything wrong with her. And then, you know,
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:56.880]  the last time I saw her, she was just vibing and the next time I see her, she's dead.
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:02.560]  And it's like, well, she's with the maker now. And I, and these Satanists killing our people,
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:06.240]  they think it's real fun, but they're, they're going to get theirs. God bless you, sir. I'm
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:11.040]  sorry to hear about that. Yeah, there's, there's no doubt in my mind, it's a vaccines and a combo,
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:14.560]  other things. In fact, guys, I know people are in denial out there listening, snickering and
[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:18.160]  giggling. A lot of them are probably taking their daughters right now to be injected with the HPV
[1:43:18.160 --> 1:43:22.640]  because they advertise it like it cures cancer, total lie. Go read the insert folks, it didn't
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:33.200]  protect you from papillomavirus. YouTube girl dies after HPV. And there's literally probably 30,
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:38.960]  40 reports last time I checked with all of them dropping dead. Now, this is just one of them.
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:44.720]  And you notice they're gearing up now with, with, with, with less soft kill weapons.
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:49.040]  See, it's all about testing and beta testing the system to make sure doctors don't wake up,
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:53.280]  nurses don't wake up, police military don't wake up, investigators don't wake up. It's,
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.600]  it's ambient. They slowly turn the background noise up, increasing the drugs in the water,
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:01.040]  increasing the fluoride in the water, increasing the chemtrail spring, and they started
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:04.960]  meeting the chemtrail spring, increasing the number, you know, five vaccines, 20 something
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:09.600]  years ago. Now they, 60 something they want to make you take. And it's just kind of get used to,
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:18.640]  half the kids on the block died of cancer. Huh? Oh, I know a bunch of 20-something-year-old
[1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:23.840]  women all died of cancer. People right here in this office, people's, you know, fighting for
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:29.440]  their lives. Oh, it's just the neighbors got it. They're 40 years old. Oh, another dead kid. Oh,
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:35.840]  they're just all these kids dying everywhere. And I talked to parent-to-parent. Oh, I see
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:41.120]  your child's autistic. When, when did that start? Oh, Bethany was great and laughing and talking
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:48.080]  and running until 18 months ago. Did it happen the night after the night after she goes, you mean
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:53.120]  the night after I took her to the doctor for the third round of shots? Yeah, yeah. She wouldn't get
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:58.720]  up for two days and I took her to the doctor and she was real sick for a few more weeks and then
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:04.720]  she never talked or walked again. I've been reading. It's, it's in the shots. I'm like, you know,
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:11.760]  and you just talk to him and you talk to him and the globalists just laugh with pleasure. It's so
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:19.280]  enjoyable and it's going to go on and on and on and on the enjoyment and the phony drug war,
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:22.880]  triple the heroin, double the cocaine, more people in prison than ever, machine gun wars,
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:27.440]  collapsing society and they'll have more drug laws and more brainwashing that your kids to
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.560]  tattle on you and more Stasi and more forced youth brigades and the cops kids will die and the
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:38.560]  military people will die and you know, it's just, oh, it's so much fun. I mean, they, they had to
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:43.200]  blow up chemistry. I had them take off their gas masks for miles around. Thousands and thousands
[1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:48.000]  of those troops died from it. They did brainstem studies. The chemical weapon killed them and
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:58.080]  they wouldn't even give them treatment. Did you find the YouTube? Oh, John, you found one. I mean,
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.840]  I just see dozens. Here's one. HVB bomb. HVB virus does not cause cancer. HPV vaccine does.
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:11.520]  Yeah, they got some studies on that. But yeah, play the one you got, John, for folks. Go ahead.
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:20.000]  To query a Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore. She's just too tired.
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:34.400]  But to query his mother says everything changed last December after her daughter received
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:40.960]  Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer. She's never been sick. She's never been
[1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:48.080]  in a hospital. Nothing until the Gardasil shot. Two months after getting the shot,
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:54.880]  to query a says she got a rash on her face and arms, leaving these scars. She had swelling all
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:47:01.920]  over pain in her joints and poor circulation in her fingertips. Her doctor told us she now
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:09.280]  suffers from an autoimmune disease and says it is possible. The Gardasil triggered her illness,
[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:15.680]  though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven. According to a federal tracking system
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:25.200]  called VAERS, there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination and 21 reported
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:32.480]  deaths since 2006. I chose to get my daughter vaccinated. But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:39.200]  out these are anecdotal cases. Notice all these ads target blacks particularly. They want to hit
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:44.960]  you and help you good. It's like Bill Gates just so happens to be a public eugenicist and his dad
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:48.400]  runs Planned Parenthood, the founder of which said they hate blacks and want to kill them.
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:53.360]  And then they got a shot for you because they love you real good. Ted Turner gives us money
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:58.400]  because he loves those black kids. He calls them useless eaters, but he loves you and he's got a
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:03.360]  shot for you, man. So be sure and take it. That isn't the one, John. They got a CBS one about all
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:14.640]  the dead kids taking it. Just type HPV type Gardasil deaths in their guys. Try Gardasil deaths.
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:18.240]  No one believe me though. Go ahead. Find out for yourself.
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:25.360]  Admitted a lot of you kind of like killing your kids, don't you? I mean, that's why you do it,
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:33.360]  isn't it? That evil spirit in your gut. Oh, yeah. That's another newscast. Is this the one about the
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:38.640]  death? This is the death one. Now go ahead and play it.
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:45.920]  Bobby Swank was a straight A student and cheerleader. That's her near the center,
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:52.320]  but that was before she became very ill, following the standard dose of three Gardasil
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:58.480]  vaccinations. We're going to go get it because we felt like almost pressured by the commercials.
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:03.520]  Gabby got sicker after each shot, progressing to seizures, strokes, and heart problems.
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:09.200]  It was her neurologist who suspected Gardasil was to blame. I think that there are too many people
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:14.720]  having serious long-term side effects. Last fall, the government concluded there's no link between
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:23.280]  Gardasil and Doosan. Don't listen to the doctors. Listen to Gardasil. Listen to Mark that gives
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:26.720]  you all the drugs that have caused the heart attacks and everything else in the past.
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.240]  I mean, they care about you. You know, Bayer knowingly shipped out the AIDS virus to all
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:37.840]  those people in those vaccines, admittedly. Let's trust them. So what if Bayer was a Nazi company?
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:44.560]  So, I mean, this folks, listen, take all the shots. It's the law. It's not the law, but you're lying
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:49.280]  and saying it is. It's good. You can trust a government media that tells you it's the law to
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:53.440]  take the shots and then, you know, but that's not the one. There's a newscast where it starts
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:57.840]  listing all the dead girls. That's the one I want for people. You know what? They don't want to
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:02.160]  believe it. They probably think those are fake newscasts. You know what? Just inject yourselves,
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:08.880]  okay? But I'm not the conspiracy theorist. I'm not the cook. I'm not the weirdo. I can face up to
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:15.120]  what's going on. And I could face up to death threats to myself, my family, my wife, and my
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:19.680]  children to bring you this information. So you bet I'm fired up and wild because I am. I'm a primitive.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:25.040]  I'm just a good old boy because my ancestors weren't slaves. They didn't lay down to slavery.
[1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:28.560]  And I'm not afraid of thugs and bullies. I'm not afraid of death.
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:34.640]  But I'm afraid of is them continuing to be able to hurt children and hurt women and poison people
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:42.800]  from Africa to the United States, from Australia to Mexico. I've had enough of it, and I'm sick of
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:47.840]  it. You need to break your spell, break the conditioning, and realize you're under chemical,
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:53.760]  biological, and radiological attack. And that goes for all the police and military, too. We're all
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:58.720]  in this together. We can beat these people that have set this up if you'll just face the facts.

[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:12.240]  tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:18.080]  all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.200]  for the best interests of the American people. Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:28.320]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:35.120]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:42.960]  fascism. It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:50.160]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[2:00:54.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  but my dreams they aren't as empty as my conscious seems to be
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:14.400]  it's the noble lie they're doing this all for own good
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:19.400]  it's like Dr. Bianca said it's so sad they have to kill 90% of us
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:23.400]  and he understands he and his family to die too
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:29.400]  but it's good it's good for the society
[2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:36.400]  they know best they're the technocrats
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:38.400]  they want to kill everybody
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:41.400]  but it's for your own good
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:46.400]  and I blame you
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:52.400]  no one bites back as hard on their anger
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:02:00.400]  none of my pain and woe can show through
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:15.400]  but my dreams they aren't as empty as my conscious seems to be
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:22.400]  I have hours only lonely
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:32.400]  my love is vengeance that's never free
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:39.400]  I'm going to blitz through tons of news and info on what the new green bondage is going to be like
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:42.400]  all the forced injections bureaucrats bossing around
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:47.400]  they'll have all the weapons you'll have nothing
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  let's go ahead and talk to Ian in the United Kingdom
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:55.400]  I hope you're taking your shots Ian go ahead
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:59.400]  I haven't had a shot since it was forced upon me at school I'm afraid
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:03.400]  so no never will never have
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:06.400]  but one thing you're saying about the autism
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:11.400]  everybody knows that the MML vaccine is being tied to autism
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:14.400]  so that goes without saying that's well documented
[2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:17.400]  we're living in a time of Joseph Mengele
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:20.400]  this is the Mengele scenario
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:24.400]  we've got the codex alimentarius and nutricide
[2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:26.400]  and people just don't seem to recognize it
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:28.400]  they're not only trying to inject people with poisons
[2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:33.400]  they're trying to remove people's capacity to even defend their own immune system
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:37.400]  and admitting that the incredible part is
[2:03:37.400 --> 2:03:41.400]  because the public can't believe psycho killers are in control
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:46.400]  and because they can't face that they're going to put their sons and daughters in themselves in graves
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:49.400]  but one thing I have to say to you though Alex
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:51.400]  I do have to disagree with you on one aspect
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:56.400]  you were saying about that Europe has kind of given up on things
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:03:59.400]  and it's kind of strange because the one thing that we do still have in Europe is
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:01.400]  people do protest
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  but the amazing thing is
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:06.400]  and the one thing which America should really take from this
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:08.400]  and I know you don't see a lot of the material
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:13.400]  but it just demonstrates the absolute lack of any kind of representation that there is
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:17.400]  we have the million man march right in London
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:20.400]  you remember that before the invasion of Iraq
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:22.400]  there was a million man march or it wasn't
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:25.400]  it was actually a six million man march
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:27.400]  it was one in ten people marched around the country
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:31.400]  Keith Oberman says there were less than ten thousand nationwide at tea parties
[2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:33.400]  there was over a million
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  they just lied
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:36.400]  look I'm not saying Europe is broke back
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:40.400]  so as I'm saying a lot of people know that it's tyranny
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:43.400]  they just aren't taking the action it's needed to overthrow it
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:47.400]  but I hear you anything else seeing
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  even if you do take the action they ignore you
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:53.400]  well yeah I mean nobody wants the Lisbon Treaty and they just say
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:55.400]  hey we have SWAT team shut up
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:04:57.400]  now take your shots there you go
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:04:58.400]  now you die
[2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:00.400]  good good
[2:05:00.400 --> 2:05:02.400]  Alex Jones here with a question
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:04.400]  what does humidity mean to you
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:07.400]  most people think of hot and sticky summer days
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:09.400]  but many people are beginning to realize
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:12.400]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:14.400]  that's why I'd like you to visit

[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:04.400]  in the New World Order's war against humanity
[2:06:04.400 --> 2:06:07.400]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:09.400]  we've got to give them a stake
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:11.400]  in creating the kind of world order
[2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:13.400]  that I think all of us would like to see
[2:06:13.400 --> 2:06:15.400]  the Obama deception
[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:16.400]  completely destroys the myth
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:18.400]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:20.400]  of the American people
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:22.400]  while Obama's already fudging
[2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:24.400]  fudged since day one in this election
[2:06:24.400 --> 2:06:25.400]  if you have a demagogue
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:27.400]  with a fanatical mass movement
[2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:28.400]  of personality cultists
[2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:30.400]  who is imposing the program
[2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:33.400]  of a group of extreme bankers
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:34.400]  and finance oligarchs
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:07:00.400]  that's fascism
[2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:02.400]  Spring is here
[2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:04.400]  growing season
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:05.400]  the economy is not getting any better
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:07.400]  in fact it's getting worse
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:08.400]  think about it
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:09.400]  at this rate

[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:16.400]  but the time to act is now
[2:07:16.400 --> 2:07:18.400]  the country is running out of food

[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:04.400]  from his central texas command center
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:06.400]  deep behind enemy lines
[2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  the information war continues
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:12.400]  it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:18.400]  we are live ladies and gentlemen
[2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:20.400]  we're gonna be here for the next hour
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:22.400]  and 51 minutes
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:24.400]  the last hour and 51 minutes of the radio show today
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:27.400]  simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:30.400]  I am coming to you from deep behind enemy lines
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  with a mesmerized, hypnotized, brainwashed population
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:34.400]  beginning to wake up
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:36.400]  that we are in the middle of the eugenics wars
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:39.400]  that's what this will be known of in history
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:41.400]  if we're able to turn this around and defeat it
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:43.400]  how a global group of scientists with private banks
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:44.400]  who believe in eugenics
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:46.400]  got control of society
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:48.400]  how they're carrying these operations out against all of us
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:51.400]  except for a few thousand top globalists
[2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:52.400]  in their think tanks
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  and their operational systems
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:08:55.400]  less than 10,000 total
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:57.400]  we just played you clip after clip
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:08:59.400]  of people dying and dead and dying from the
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:02.400]  Gardasil HPV shot alone
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:04.400]  this is a government who admittedly grabbed 4,000
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:06.400]  plus fostered kids and radiated them to death
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:08.400]  and paid Israel to radiate 110,000
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:10.400]  Google ringworm children
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:12.400]  mainstream news in Israel
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:14.400]  these are the government that
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:17.400]  tested chemical, biological, radiologicals on troops
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:19.400]  killing them in many cases
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:21.400]  to a skeaky experiment, all of that
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:23.400]  now they know that most major vaccines
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:25.400]  have cancer viruses in them
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:27.400]  not just HV40
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:29.400]  and you know the
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:32.400]  simian virus, SV40 and other things
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:35.400]  they know that autism and cancers
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.400]  up just thousands of percentile points across the board
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:41.400]  they know that they're now having people at 25
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:42.400]  get Alzheimer's
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:45.400]  we're being hit by multiple targets
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:47.400]  and
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:49.400]  multiple angles
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:52.400]  and we got Rebecca Eastep on with us
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:54.400]  she
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:56.400]  is the national manager of the TACA
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  talk about curing autism
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:00.400]  when it stands for a mother of a child who had
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:02.400]  a reaction to vaccines
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:04.400]  was later diagnosed with autism
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:06.400]  and I just see it every day in the news
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:08.400]  people dying after the shots
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:10.400]  not just having convulsions but dying
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:12.400]  and if you think
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:14.400]  that the
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  shots are bad
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:18.400]  like MMR that's caused a scourge globally
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:20.400]  it doesn't hold a candle
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:22.400]  to factor 8
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:24.400]  which is admittedly filled with HIV and hepatitis
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:26.400]  so don't believe me just google factor 8
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:30.400]  and they just announced it calmly
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:32.400]  oh yeah we shipped it all over the world
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:34.400]  and then you expand out from there
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:36.400]  with the Gardasil
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:38.400]  folks you better grow up
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:40.400]  you better face the horror
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:42.400]  Rebecca Eastep thank you for coming on the show
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:44.400]  with us today
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:46.400]  thank you for having me Alex
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  tell folks about your organization
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:50.400]  there's a massive awakening happening
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:52.400]  to autism
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:54.400]  but then there's all these other scourges going on
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:56.400]  right
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:10:58.400]  well TACA
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:00.400]  talk about curing autism
[2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:02.400]  is a parent support group
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:04.400]  it's incredibly grassroots
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:06.400]  most of us met each other
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:08.400]  on the internet
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  and we all pretty much were from southern California
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:12.400]  when our children
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:14.400]  were diagnosed with autism
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:16.400]  and we realized there was
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:18.400]  little to nothing
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:20.400]  for our children
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:22.400]  to help them get better
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:24.400]  we were
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:26.400]  this was the year 2000
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:28.400]  and I was told that I would need to put my 2 year old
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:30.400]  in an institution at some point
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:32.400]  and I thought wow
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:34.400]  how can this be
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:36.400]  there really must be more out there
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:38.400]  and a few of us parents
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:40.400]  just started doing a lot of research
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:42.400]  and found that there are a lot of things
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:44.400]  that you can do to help children with autism
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:46.400]  and we advocate a lot
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:48.400]  with the biomedical
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:50.400]  model of treatment
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:52.400]  which ends up kind of
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:54.400]  addressing problems
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:56.400]  with the immune system
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:11:58.400]  which we traced back to vaccine reactions
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:02.400]  yes I have had countless medical doctors
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:04.400]  on brain surgeons you name it
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:06.400]  and
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:08.400]  in the 80's they started giving the MMR shot earlier
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:10.400]  and earlier as you know and the children would have convulsions
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:12.400]  sometimes in the hospital
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:14.400]  and that was always kind of a blessing in disguise
[2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  because they wouldn't swat team the mother or father
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:18.400]  saying they'd shake in the baby
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:20.400]  because there would be blood on the brain from the autoimmune response
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:22.400]  generally what happened when baby went to sleep at night
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:24.400]  after the third round of shots
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:26.400]  and then the autism
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:28.400]  after they come out of the two day coma
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:30.400]  then arrives
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:32.400]  and people obsess on the mercury
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:34.400]  that's only one subset
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:36.400]  what has your research shown
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:38.400]  well wow it sounds like
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:40.400]  you've done a lot of research
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:42.400]  yes it's not
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:44.400]  just the mercury
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:46.400]  there are so
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:48.400]  this problem is so complicated
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:50.400]  and that's what's really
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:52.400]  um
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:54.400]  that's what's kept us from getting any traction
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:56.400]  the government will look at
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:58.400]  one tiny you know they'll look at mercury
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:00.400]  standalone at
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:02.400]  with some children
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:04.400]  and declare it safe
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  but what we're saying is
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:08.400]  no this is complicated
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:10.400]  we're dealing with
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:12.400]  additives like mercury
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:14.400]  and aluminum and formaldehyde
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:16.400]  all of these toxins that are not supposed to be
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  in your body to begin with
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  and that's bad but I learned from the scientists
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:22.400]  to talk to that's itself almost a red herring
[2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  it's the
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.400]  genetic pathogen that you're supposedly
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:28.400]  being given the immunity to
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:30.400]  it's passing the blood-rained barrier
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:32.400]  it's causing a massive autoimmune response
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:34.400]  in all major organs
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:36.400]  and it's that inflammation
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:38.400]  of the brain that is
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:40.400]  what's causing the autism
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:42.400]  centering in and around the cerebral cortex
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.400]  left and right lobe
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:46.400]  that's again
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:48.400]  you have a really sophisticated understanding
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:50.400]  right so we don't know
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:52.400]  I mean what it kind of seems like
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.400]  a one-two punch you give them
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:56.400]  you give an infant that
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  their immune system is not developed yet
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:00.400]  these toxins which
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:02.400]  does something to their immune system
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:04.400]  and then on one day
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:06.400]  these infants are getting
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:08.400]  anywhere between you know six and twelve viruses
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:10.400]  injected straight into their body
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:12.400]  and in nature
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:14.400]  we would never be exposed
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:16.400]  to you know
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.400]  you're supposed to be exposed to maybe one or two viruses
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:20.400]  and then your body
[2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:22.400]  overcomes it and then you have an immunity
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:24.400]  but what are we doing we're giving these children
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:26.400]  exposing them to
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:28.400]  six to twelve different viruses
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:30.400]  on a day
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:32.400]  and there are children
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:34.400]  but like I've been told that
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:36.400]  my son is immune defective
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:38.400]  and I'm like well not really
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:40.400]  because you're not really supposed to be
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:42.400]  injecting mercury into his body
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:44.400]  I'll agree that maybe
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:46.400]  he doesn't have the ability to detoxify
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  like some people
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  that's what they say when your child and they find out
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:52.400]  their toxic for only shot they say oh your child is a problem
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:54.400]  here in Texas they testified
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:56.400]  before the legislature
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:14:58.400]  the omnibudsman for the legislature
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:00.400]  the state scientific advisor
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:02.400]  got up and said
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:04.400]  we give
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:06.400]  67% of school children
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:08.400]  that are in our custody
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:10.400]  the foster children
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:12.400]  psychotropic drugs
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:14.400]  and representative
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:16.400]  Susanna Hupp said why and he said
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.400]  they have defective genes they're subhuman
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:20.400]  now
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:22.400]  that's what they're really talking about behind the scenes
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:24.400]  he is we're doing this to them
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:26.400]  because they deserve it
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:28.400]  okay so see
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  there's a whole other level
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:32.400]  of horror man I don't know if you're aware of it
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:34.400]  that's why we're having influential folks on
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:36.400]  to tell them about this
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:38.400]  are you familiar with the Nazis and eugenics
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:40.400]  I'm not
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:42.400]  I mean you know just the rudimentary understanding
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:44.400]  but what I'm afraid of
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:46.400]  of doing is it's kind of like
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:48.400]  capitalism
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  gone a little wild like
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:52.400]  well we can produce this product
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:54.400]  and we can make money from it
[2:15:54.400 --> 2:15:56.400]  so why don't we do it
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:15:58.400]  we need the Bayer documents on factor eight
[2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:00.400]  where they knew it all had HIV and hepatitis
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:02.400]  and shipped it out to over
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:04.400]  million dosages
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:06.400]  I am unfamiliar with that document
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:08.400]  even MSNBC's covered it but just so you know
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  it's even worse man
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:12.400]  but look side issue
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  tell us about how you woke up what happened with your child
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:16.400]  and where this is all going
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:18.400]  well I can't get too specific
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  because we do have a case in federal court
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:22.400]  we're in the vaccine
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  injury compensation program
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:26.400]  but basically it's
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:28.400]  the story that I've heard
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:30.400]  and you know we have over 10,000 families
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:32.400]  in TACA
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:34.400]  and for years I answered the parent
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:36.400]  the parent support line
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:38.400]  and it's the same story you hear over and over again
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:40.400]  now tell them that story
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.400]  sure I had a very typical
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  developing child
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:46.400]  we got
[2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:48.400]  you know I get accused all the time of being
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:50.400]  anti-vaccine and I said
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:52.400]  I'd say to these people
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:54.400]  all my anti-vaccine I had my child vaccinated
[2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:56.400]  he had a vaccine injury
[2:16:56.400 --> 2:16:58.400]  I didn't start out this way
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:00.400]  but he was developing typically
[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:02.400]  all of his milestones
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:04.400]  and then one day he had
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:06.400]  a vaccine reaction
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:08.400]  which looked a little different
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:10.400]  than I would have thought I thought a vaccine reaction
[2:17:10.400 --> 2:17:12.400]  is kind of like an anaphylactic type thing
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:14.400]  or a seizure thing
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:16.400]  but what happened with him is he had this
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:18.400]  intense gastrointestinal
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:20.400]  diarrhea episode
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:22.400]  and further you know
[2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:24.400]  doing research now
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:26.400]  I know that most of your immune system
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:28.400]  is in your GI tract
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:30.400]  so that's where it started
[2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:32.400]  the body was saying get it out, get it out
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:34.400]  emergency and of course you know
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:36.400]  Crohn's didn't exist until 45 years ago
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:38.400]  and in all the major Crohn's tests
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  they find the antibodies
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  from the measles vaccines
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:44.400]  and other things in the gut
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:46.400]  and so there's a huge ongoing battle
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:48.400]  and then so your guts just shut down
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:50.400]  in the ongoing battle
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:52.400]  and so everybody out there that's got Crohn's
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:54.400]  another gift from the government but go ahead
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  well right so we had this
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:17:58.400]  horrible diarrhea episode
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:00.400]  and then after that this baby
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  who was never sick
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  was sick constantly I could not keep him
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:06.400]  well
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:08.400]  for anything and he had the worst case
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:10.400]  of hand foot and mouth disease they ever saw
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  yeah that's right I mean let's be clear
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:14.400]  about this most of these autistic children
[2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:16.400]  that were 1 in 25,000
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:18.400]  so now 1 in 86
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:20.400]  and 2 years ago was 1 in
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:22.400]  168 so it's intensifying
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:24.400]  they don't just have the mental issues
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:26.400]  where they're you know I can't
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:28.400]  focus, they have
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:30.400]  bowel problems all of this
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:32.400]  it is an overall
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:34.400]  sickness in the entire body go ahead
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:36.400]  right and that is the part
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:38.400]  that drives us crazy is that
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:40.400]  you know your mainstream doctors will tell you
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  oh you have a child with autism and they have diarrhea
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:44.400]  well that just kind of goes along with autism
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:46.400]  and we are like all the parents
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  are saying wait time out
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:50.400]  they've done it they're never going to admit
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:52.400]  what they did
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:54.400]  again the doctors have cognizance themselves
[2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:56.400]  they can't believe they're
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:58.400]  part of this they don't understand they're just
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:00.400]  like a clerk carrying out what the franchise
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:02.400]  owners are doing
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:04.400]  I actually usually never get
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:06.400]  very upset at the doctors because like you said
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:08.400]  they're just listening to the people
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:10.400]  their bosses and they
[2:19:10.400 --> 2:19:12.400]  honestly think that they haven't done anything
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:14.400]  wrong
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:16.400]  I kind of leave them alone
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:18.400]  except for you know sometimes
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:20.400]  they have a little bit of arrogance
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:22.400]  but
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:24.400]  until their kids
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:26.400]  end up in a pine box
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:28.400]  well until actually it's very
[2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:30.400]  interesting because there is a movement called
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:32.400]  Defeat Autism Now which treats
[2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:34.400]  these children whole bodies
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:36.400]  and we're filled with doctors who
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:38.400]  become defeat autism now doctors
[2:19:38.400 --> 2:19:40.400]  because their children develop autism
[2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  and once you see it in front of your face
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:44.400]  you cannot deny what happened
[2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:46.400]  that's right the doctor does this to their kid
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:48.400]  and they go whoa
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:50.400]  whoa this stuff's real
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:52.400]  they care about their kids that's right
[2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:54.400]  you care about your own flesh you'll wake up
[2:19:54.400 --> 2:19:56.400]  ma'am stay there I'll talk more about your organization
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:19:58.400]  when we get back I'm Alex Jones

[2:20:54.320 --> 2:21:06.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:13.120]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:15.000]  just as well-funded.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:20.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:21:20.160 --> 2:21:21.160]  of the American people.
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:25.680]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:31.120]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:37.640]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:37.640 --> 2:21:41.200]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:48.120]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:21:56.320 --> 2:22:00.800]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:03.200]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[2:22:03.200 --> 2:22:06.560]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource

[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:09.240]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief

[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:19.360]  We had a caller earlier who brought up this FEMA drill.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:21.880]  I turned out Burma's covered it for three hours last night.
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:22.880]  I didn't know that.
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:24.760]  I know that these drills were coming up.
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:27.440]  I hadn't really looked at them because there's just so many I get conditioned.
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:31.280]  It's foreign troops takeover drill of the U.S.
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:36.840]  Here it is from FEMA, national level exercise 2009, NLE09.
[2:24:36.840 --> 2:24:41.280]  In Germany, after they found out what Hitler had done, Germans couldn't believe it.
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:44.400]  They were in denial because they had been under the spell.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:46.920]  They couldn't believe things that bad were going on.
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:49.680]  It's the same thing here.
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.800]  Going back to Rebecca E. Stepp and we've got the website TACA.com.
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:57.680]  I'm sorry I'm ranting at you.
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:02.600]  I just have three children and it freaks me out fundamentally and I'm an aggressive guy
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:07.560]  and I just, I don't have the spell on me to accept this and I know you've probably gone
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:08.560]  through a lot of anger.
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:14.280]  This actually happened to your son, but yeah, go through what happens to the, I mean, and
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:15.960]  they do this to the children.
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:20.400]  All the studies show it's happening and they rationalize it and put out media reports saying
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:21.400]  it isn't true.
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.120]  But isn't the biggest issue how they lie and say it's the law?
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:26.960]  You've got to take all these shots when it isn't the law.
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:33.560]  The law is, they've got to present you with a waiver, but the way, but it's just incredible.
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:36.240]  I mean, are we free or not?
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:43.240]  Well, 48 out of 50 states have vaccine waiver laws.
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:49.120]  If you're in Mississippi or West Virginia, you got problems, but it is true.
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:53.480]  School districts will have you believe that your child must be fully vaccinated in order
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:55.280]  to attend school.
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:00.560]  But in, I live in California, the form that you have to fill out to have your child in
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:04.560]  school, all you have to do is flip it over and sign the waiver.
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:08.600]  It's a health department document, which again is was set up by the Eugenesis 90 years ago
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:10.480]  in the U.S. Cold Springs Harbor.
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:13.280]  That's what, for those that don't know, this whole system is.
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:15.520]  And that's why Rick Perry said you've got to take HPV.
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:20.560]  He just ordered health department to make it the list of mandatory shots to be in school.
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:22.400]  So it's, it's all a corporate fraud trick.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:23.400]  Go ahead.
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:29.040]  Well, what I, what I worry about is all of a sudden, you know, we have a hammer and everything
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.640]  looks like a nail.
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:35.040]  I'm not saying all vaccines are bad.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:41.720]  You know, I don't want polio coming back, but the thought that one size fits all is
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.120]  ridiculous, especially when it comes to a medical procedure and that there is this like
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:52.880]  feeling out there that in the media that 100% of the vaccines, 100% of the time are safe
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:54.920]  for 100% of the people.
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.640]  Now that's just wrong or there wouldn't be this vaccine injury compensation program.
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:02.480]  We know that some things are going to happen.
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:07.440]  And yet when we bring up these, you know, red flags, like our kids started to get sick
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:12.360]  within hours or days or a couple of weeks of being vaccinated, they kind of tell us,
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:15.160]  oh, you know, no way.
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:21.680]  And you know, to me, I don't understand why they're not listening to these parents who
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:23.160]  are telling the same story.
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:27.880]  Well, ma'am, I'm sure you know Nobel Prize winners say that this is all a eugenics operation.
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  You really never heard that.
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:32.240]  You don't hear about all these countries where everybody in Africa and Asia literally
[2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:35.080]  run, even though they're offering them UN money to take the shots.
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:39.880]  They run into the jungles, into the woods, into the hills, and they now pay military's
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:43.600]  bounties to hunt people down and literally net them and inject them, and then they're
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:45.420]  suddenly get HIV and are sterilized.
[2:27:45.420 --> 2:27:46.920]  You haven't heard about that?
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:52.000]  I've heard some things, but what I've had to have done is just focus my efforts on...
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  I understand, yeah.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:58.960] ...the United States, because I do a lot of advocacy work in Washington.
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  Oh, I bet you're busy.
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:03.040]  So how do folks get involved with what you're doing?
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:08.320]  Well, there's a lot of information out on the Internet.
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:15.920]  Our website is actually TakaNow, so T-A-C-A-NOW.org, and you can find a lot of information...
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:18.400]  Oh, was that wrong when I said T-A-C-A dot com?
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:19.400]  That's wrong?
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:20.400]  That's wrong.
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:21.400]  I'm sorry.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:22.400]  That was on my sheet here.
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:23.400]  That's okay.
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:26.920]  You'd go flying to Mexico, because that's the airline, but...
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:28.400]  Man, just everything.
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:29.400]  Okay, great.
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:30.400]  Thank you.
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  That's okay.
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:38.920]  There's also NVIC.org, the National Vaccine Information Center.
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:41.800]  They have a lot of information.
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:46.120]  Generation Rescue has a lot of information, generationrescue.org.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:55.200]  The thing is, as parents, we're really trying to make it a safe world for all parents.
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:02.080]  We get yelled at, I've been called a baby killer, because they look at me as an anti-vaccine,
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:03.080]  and I said, you know what?
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:05.640]  There's some really easy things to do to clean up this program.
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:06.640]  First of all...
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:09.280]  Well, these are arrogant people that want to shut you up.
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:15.360]  The baby killers are the ones putting out poison vaccines, and they always try to...
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:18.600]  They say, you're going to kill our babies, because you're not vaccinated.
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:23.000]  If their vaccines supposedly are protecting them, what's the problem?
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:30.920]  Yeah, I often think that too, but what we need to do is stop producing...
[2:29:30.920 --> 2:29:31.920]  We need...
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:36.320]  Actually, we need to produce and single-dose files, so we don't need all those toxic preservatives.
[2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:38.400]  Who wants to take those infants to toxins?
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  Who does?
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:40.400]  The globalist.
[2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:41.400]  Stay there.
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:42.400]  I want to come back and let you talk a little bit more.
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  We appreciate you coming on with us.

[2:31:01.800 --> 2:31:07.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:12.440]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:13.800]  us would like to see.
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:18.920]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:20.280]  of the American people.

[2:31:24.680 --> 2:31:29.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:37.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:31:37.920 --> 2:31:41.480]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:31:41.480 --> 2:31:48.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:33.880]  what happens, your investment will never be worthless.

[2:41:55.200 --> 2:42:19.200]  Go read books and encyclopedia about the founding of health departments.
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:27.200]  If you go to Wikipedia, which has a lot of disinfo, but the point is they link to government documents, the Rockefeller Foundation pages is, in fact, pull that up, is actually accurate.
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:33.200]  Think about Wikipedia, some stuff's accurate, some's inaccurate. You have to, like my name spelled wrong on there and they won't let us fix it.
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:45.200]  And they've got all this wrong info about me, but that's on purpose. With the Rockefeller Foundation, that's accurate because you can follow the links to university reports where they admit it, where they founded the eugenics movement.
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:55.200]  They founded Cancer Treatment Movement. They founded it all. Just Google Rockefeller Foundation. One of the first links that comes up is Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:43:07.200]  Onscreen, please. Now, you can actually link through on this. It's cited. But I'm just pulling up something quick here to show you.
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:25.200]  It says some of the historical achievements include, this is achievements, funding eugenics programs in colleges and universities. That's an achievement.
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:35.200]  Okay, now just Google Rockefeller Foundation eugenics itself. Well, actually click on their sourcing. It says number one right there. It's the last one there in that column, guys.
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:47.200]  No, no, let me show you. Let me have control of the mouse. I'll do it.
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:57.200]  I'll find it there in a break because, yeah, here it is, nature.com. That's their link. Nazi eugenics created in the United States.
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:07.200]  And then you can go through all that, how the Rockefellers financed it all. So, it was Nazi eugenics created in the U.S. and you read it and it's all there. That's the journal in nature.
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:17.200]  Okay, that said, I'm going to get back into that after I take some calls because I want to get through Heidi and Dorothy and Farris and a few others, Barbara, that have been holding patiently.
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:23.200]  And we're going to get to you guys in just a moment, Tony, Barbara and others.
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:36.200]  I want to just stop here and say, though, I get angry. I get upset. I sit here and try to project this as evil as it really is to break the spell for all my foibles and all my problems and all the things I do that are obnoxious.
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:50.200]  The one saving grace I have is that I am aware of just how shocking and evil this is and I've broken my conditioning.
[2:44:50.200 --> 2:44:58.200]  There is no spell on Alex Jones. I mean, I go to bed every night knowing there's a criminal global elite that is soft killing most of the world's population.
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:07.200]  I have their documents. I have their statements. I know my life's in danger. I know the decisions I'm making. I know how important my work is and I'm not afraid of being killed.
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:20.200]  I am afraid of not doing my work, not being effective, being stupid, not being as focused as I should be to warn people. I want to complete my mission.
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:30.200]  And then that's not some radical heroic thing. That is a basic human directive. If you care about your own species and your children, you have lost your basic directives out there.
[2:45:30.200 --> 2:45:44.200]  You have to get the prime directive back in place. Now, I want to go to Rob Dew and, of course, Aaron Dykes, who we sent up to Massachusetts.
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:55.200]  They were up there in Lexington where 234 years ago in 1775, the Revolutionary War started when the Redcoats came to confiscate the guns.
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:00.200]  Now, the media would tell you the Redcoats didn't exist. It wasn't about guns, and that didn't happen.
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:05.200]  There was actually a big university professor who said it wasn't about gun confiscation, and that the colonies were anti-gun.
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:15.200]  We exposed him. He lost his tenure. So I'm not even joking. See, we're entering a new world now where there's no EU, but there is a EU, and where there's no Lexington and Concord, but there is.
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:25.200]  And where Obama is cutting the budget by half when he spent more than all presidents before him combined. We're entering a new vortex of disinfo.
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:40.200]  But you guys were there. I want to commend you for going. You said it was a great event. Tell folks about the Oathkeepers and the Committees of Safety on the anniversary on the green, having all these police and military, I swear, that was protecting to defend the Constitution, and not follow the New World Order.
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:50.200]  That was a pretty amazing event that we attended, and I'd like to thank the guys at Oathkeepers and Committees of Safety for, you know, making us feel welcome, giving us their time.
[2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:58.200]  We got a lot of good interviews right before the event, during the event, after the event. And then we watched the reenactment that morning.
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:10.200]  We took some cameras out there and got in, and, you know, it was all about guns. They said, give us, put down your weapons and walk away, and the guy jumps out of the crowd and says, you're not getting my gun.
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:20.200]  And that's what it was about, period. You know, they wanted their guns. So they stood up watching that battle. The guys were really into it.
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:30.200]  Hey, let me ask John a question real fast. We just put in a new mic processor, a new mic stuff in here. I was just checking it with the network.
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:34.200]  I'm in Minnesota, as they're messing with it there, because I'm getting a buzz in my ear, but you guys say you're not.
[2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:43.200]  Okay. Again, for those that don't know what was going on up there, recap the basics of it, and then give us a report please.
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:50.200]  So Oathkeepers is an organization that got together with committees of safety to actually bring on this event.
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:56.200]  And what they wanted to do is have people who had already taken the oath reaffirm their oaths, because what they're looking for is not oath takers.
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:06.200]  They're looking for oath keepers. And Stewart Rhodes and Walter Reddy had a great cast of guys, and it was literally a three hour event from start to finish.
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:14.200]  There was no, you know, a guy got up and read Edwin Beer's speech about what took place that day.
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:23.200]  And then they had a lot of other naval officers, army, special forces, guys all get up and talked about what it meant for them to take the oath.
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:34.200]  And then Stewart Rhodes and who's the other guy, the policeman, the retired policeman, they got up and read the 10 orders that they will not obey.
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:35.200]  Dave Freeman.
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:40.200]  Sheriff Mac was there. He had a really good speech. He actually stopped in the maze.
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:42.200]  I want everybody to get together because everybody's kind of spread out.
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:45.200]  He's like, we need to see all the numbers. Everybody come around.
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:50.200]  One thing that was interesting, there was not one mainstream media person present, but a lot of citizen media.
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:51.200]  A lot of different groups were out there.
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:59.200]  Oh, they're scared to death of police and military saying, hold the Billarized Constitution in their oath, because according to fellow reports, that's all terrorism.
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:05.200]  Owning guns, buying ammo, being a veteran, you're the number one threat. So they keep telling you it's about al-Qaeda.
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:09.200]  It's really all been designed for you. People that won't let foreign banks conquer us.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  We've been conquered. It's through fraud, but they need our acquiescence to their fraud to continue it and expand it.
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:22.200]  Right. And I don't even know if you've heard about this, but yesterday was the day before yesterday.
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:31.200]  I think they found an ex-marine who was trying to bring a gun and some ammo and a grenade fuse onto a plane.
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:34.200]  And he actually got on the plane and they checked him in Boston.
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:39.200]  They checked his bags again and found all this stuff, which is interesting that it didn't get caught through the scanner,
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:45.200]  because they stopped Aaron coming back and wanted to search his bags because of his al-Qaeda-like camera, right?
[2:49:45.200 --> 2:49:49.200]  Yeah, that'd be right. It's always a camera.
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:53.200]  And what are you filming for? People who can't even speak English anymore.
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:55.200]  They ask you at the airport. Yeah.
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:59.200]  By you film. You know, you line up at that.
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:04.200]  Oh, I mean, no, I mean, that's what it's come to know. I mean, I saw one time a World War II that probably dead now.
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:07.200]  It was like five, six years ago in San Francisco.
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:13.200]  He's getting on a plane to go to Hawaii to the World War II Memorial. He'd been in the battle.
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:20.200]  And he literally, they had the security from the warring like bright blue commando outfits in these, in these blackbird rays.
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:22.200]  And they were, he had an oxygen bottle. They were jabbing him going,
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:26.200]  I got a little job. I mean, you know, because that's who they're going to use.
[2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:31.200]  I've got them, the FEMA drill with foreign troops for us right here that's coming up.
[2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:35.200]  National level exercise 2009. And I guess that's the new patriotism.
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:38.200]  So, so you had foreigners going on.
[2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:46.200]  Alex, they're pulling, they pull me over for a camera and the woman next to me is being extra search for a knitting kit, a crocheting kit.
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:51.200]  It's about training us. We're the enemy. It's the good lawabiding slaves must be taught.
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:51:00.200]  And they're importing people from third world police states who are used to this and who enjoy, frankly, bossing the American people around.
[2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:06.200]  But that's why it's so high prices soaring to all time highs as the dollar continues to fall in value.
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:12.200]  What can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:07.200]  The new world orders war against humanity. Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:14.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:21.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:25.200]  Well Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:25.200 --> 2:52:36.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:36.200 --> 2:52:40.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government.
[2:52:40.200 --> 2:52:47.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:24.200]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:28.200]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:35.200]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:43.200]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:53.200]  This is a two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.
[2:53:53.200 --> 2:54:14.200]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:33.200]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or heart and body extract.
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:55:06.200]  The main event the next morning had 5000 people and they did put a little speech in there about 9-11 before how we were attacked on that day.
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:12.200]  That was the last time we had a call to action attack on our country.
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:23.200]  That's why we've shut up a police state for all of you patriots here today. It's all for you. But turning your guns or al-Qaeda will get you. I'm fighting al-Qaeda.
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  Al-Qaeda is a white guy or a black guy holding a firearm. Rest them all. Go ahead.
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:42.200]  Also, Oathkeepers had a great ceremony. Captain Larry Bailey, who's an ex-navy seal, he administered the oath. I actually took the oath with a lot of other people who were non-military.
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:48.200]  It was a serious, pretty solemn event. A lot of good speeches. I'm there, Alex. I'm in.
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:50.200]  You're with al-Qaeda now.
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:56:00.200]  Oathkeepers wanted to give you a shirt. They sent one for you here. Here you go. It's a nice Oathkeeper shirt.
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:04.200]  You said a lot of supporters of the show. There was a rumor that I was going to be there.
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:14.200]  Not only did they ask and demand that Alex Jones show up, but started rumors. I think Alex Jones is here. I saw him over there. Really?
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:20.200]  Folks, he's not coming. Send us support. He's got to do the show for many more listeners.
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:23.200]  We had a great interview with the guy who wrote the 29 Palm Survey.
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:24.200]  Well done.
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:29.200]  Here's a copy of it for you. Autographed for you. He was a nice guy.
[2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:34.200]  Excellent. That's the Marine. They were doing these questionnaires. He thought he would do one and then make it public.
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:41.200]  That was the way he got it out. This is all before the new Obama film. I want to make an announcement about the new Obama film right now.
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:47.200]  I could release it July 4th and make it still good and powerful, but I've got other interviews I want to do.
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:54.200]  I was going to make it, you know, probably not as powerful as Obama's deception, but just all the latest info.
[2:56:54.200 --> 2:56:59.200]  And I thought, no, I'm going to make it more powerful. So now it's going to come out September 1st. That's it.
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:04.200]  That's the launch date. That Tuesday or Wednesday or whatever it is. I think it's a Tuesday. It is coming out September 1st.
[2:57:04.200 --> 2:57:11.200]  I mean, it'll be done by the end of July as we're shifting into a chemtrail film we're making after that.
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:18.200]  But we've got a race, but that's only a month and a half more, really. So we've got more time now to do a few more interviews.
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.200]  Excellent. Anything else that happened while you were there?
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:28.200]  It just really is refreshing to see active duty military police standing up for the Constitution.
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:34.200]  No, I will not confiscate guns. No, I will not conduct illegal searches under the Fourth Amendment.
[2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:36.200]  I'll not put people in FEMA camps.
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:38.200]  You know, knowing this stuff is going on routine.
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:41.200]  But the camps are for our safety, Glenn Beck says.
[2:57:41.200 --> 2:57:48.200]  We also met the Mass Marine, who's a young guy who is still a Marine right now. He took the oath and he's going to end up being a liaison.
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:49.200]  Did you say the Mass?
[2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:56.200]  The Mass Marine. He did a couple of YouTube videos where him and his guys, they basically study the Constitution, all his Marine buddies.
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:01.200]  They're really, so I think the al-Qaeda tuition.
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:04.200]  They built this grid for fighting al-Qaeda.
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:08.200]  Now they're going, by the way, the whole thing's for you, the American people. You are al-Qaeda.
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:11.200]  Right. And these guys know that. They know that they're going to be targeted.
[2:58:11.200 --> 2:58:15.200]  So they uphold themselves with a lot of dignity and a lot of respect.
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:22.200]  Good. They have pledged their lives, their treasure, their sacred honor, their blood on the Tree of Liberty and we will be victorious.
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:25.200]  And we were on that field where the blood was spilled.
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:27.200]  Come back. I want to hear about that.
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:28.200]  Okay.
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:33.200]  Look at you. You got the gleam in your eyes. You are fulfilling your destiny.
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:36.200]  All right. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  Seventy-second break, the final hour.
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:41.200]  They got that pastor coming on. They got beat up and your phone calls.

[2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:53.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:56.200]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[2:58:56.200 --> 2:58:58.200]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[2:58:58.200 --> 2:59:01.200]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:04.200]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line when you have your own bread.
[2:59:04.200 --> 2:59:10.200]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:13.200]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:20.200]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[2:59:54.200 --> 3:00:00.200]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:00.200 --> 3:00:07.200]  Hey folks, look at the camera over here.
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:11.200]  Have you seen this guy? Viral video all over the web.
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:16.200]  The version my guys found has 900 views.
[3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:19.200]  The original video he did has like 300,000.
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:21.200]  Yeah, here's one.
[3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:30.200]  252,832 views. Baptist, pastor, beaten, tased, big brother. Click on that one right there.
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:34.200]  I think that's the original. There's a bunch of them with hundreds of thousands of views.
[3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:37.200]  But this is happening to everybody in these internal checkpoints.
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:41.200]  And you're an illegal alien, you go right through and they even will take you and give you a job.
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:42.200]  That's a CNN.
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:46.200]  But you're a citizen, and you're a citizen, and you're an illegal alien.
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:51.200]  You go right through and they even will take you and give you a job. That's a CNN.
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:54.200]  But you're a citizen. I mean, they just start beating you.
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:59.200]  And that's how they roll. You're a gun owner. You love freedom. You're a preacher.
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:02.200]  Oh my goodness, we got an Al Qaeda here, boss.
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:08.200]  Now, what was it like being on Lexington Green where Al Qaeda fought the good troops?
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:12.200]  The evil American Al Qaeda fought the loving British troops.
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:15.200]  It's a pretty amazing place. They've kept it up really nice.
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:18.200]  Were the incredibly honorable Redcoats fought the terrorists?
[3:01:18.200 --> 3:01:21.200]  Right. And there's a particularly interesting.
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:26.200]  The leader of those Redcoats was he had a big pot belly and he had his big bottom lip sticking out.
[3:01:26.200 --> 3:01:29.200]  And I said, oh, Alex is going to love this guy because you do that voice.
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:33.200]  That just sounds totally, you know, British royalty.
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:35.200]  Put down your weapon.
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:40.200]  You're going to love it.
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:45.200]  And you know, there was fog on the battlefield that morning.
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:53.200]  The guys were coming out and they do the whole reenactment where they actually show a couple guys running back to get John Hancock's papers.
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:02:03.200]  John Hancock, that degenerate. He dare sign his name boldly in this act of treason against the crown.
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:07.200]  That was pretty much it. That was, you know, put down your weapons.
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:10.200]  Put down the weapons.
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:13.200]  And they didn't do it. They stood their ground and they were fired upon.
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:19.200]  And pretty much as they were fired upon by a larger force and then they pretty much did a unorganized retreat.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:22.200]  Outrageous terrorists, but then more militia showed up.
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:25.200]  Right. Well, in Concord, that's where they stuck it to them.
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:26.200]  Endurance.
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:28.200]  That's where they terrorized. They were terrorists.
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:30.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:33.200]  Number one threat, founding fathers evil.
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:39.200]  There was an 80 year old guy who'd fought in the French Revolutionary War or the French, French and Indian War.
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:41.200]  And he was talking about how he, he heard him coming.
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:44.200]  He heard the war drums and he got his pistols and went out there, killed three of them.
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:45.200]  Then they bayoneted him.
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:47.200]  They shot him and bayoneted him. He lived for another 18 years.
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:48.200]  And had a bunch more kids.
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:51.200]  Yeah. Yeah. And this guy was, you know, 80 when he went out and did this.
[3:02:51.200 --> 3:02:52.200]  That was another al-Qaeda.
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  Well, that's what they tell old folks, you're done. Don't be involved. Young people.
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:02:58.200]  Oh, it's time for you to party. It's your time to party.
[3:02:58.200 --> 3:03:00.200]  It's a little mind trick. That's how the spells work.
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:02.200]  It's your time to party. Never mind. Don't be involved.
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:06.200]  Oh, you're, you're middle class. You're, you're 30. You've got to make money and be successful.
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:11.200]  Oh, you're 40. Have a little fun. 50. Oh, 60. You're not supposed to be involved. Everything's fine.
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:13.200]  Well, that's not, that's not what's going to happen with oath keepers.
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:16.200]  They're getting all ages of people and they're taking their oath.
[3:03:16.200 --> 3:03:19.200]  Outrageous, outrageous, rabble.
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  But something else about these modern day constitutional oath keepers.
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:29.200]  Half of them talk with, you know, multi-syllable words, almost like the founding fathers.
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:32.200]  You get pulled over at TSA. They can even speak English.
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:36.200]  You get pulled over by a private security guard, like, shut up, no more.
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:40.200]  Yeah, tell folks, they have like our, what $2,000 lens is ripping it off and laughing at you.
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:42.200]  And then you, and how expensive it is.
[3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:44.200]  Yeah, but, and like, what is your film about?
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:47.200]  Yeah, if you, you know, I mean, tell folks what you told me during the break.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:51.200]  It's all kinds of questions. They pulled me through, like, you know, what's going on with this camera?
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:52.200]  He's like pulling off.
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:54.200]  What the hell? We got a camera?
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  Yeah.
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:59.200]  Like they put, notice the more cameras they put on us, including school bathrooms.
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:03.200]  When they see ours, it's like, I mean, they've now made it a law.
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  It's terrorism to photograph police.
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:09.200]  And now when cops have wrecks or beat people, people take photos, they're being arrested.
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:11.200]  They're arresting the president. They're doing it.
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:12.200]  Well, just keep it.
[3:04:12.200 --> 3:04:14.200]  So, so I mean, tell folks what he did to you.
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:16.200]  It's disgusting, Alex. I mean, it just rips my head.
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:17.200]  I mean, tell folks what it was like in Boston.
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:22.200]  He pulls me through next to the lady with a knitting equipment because she's the other suspicious person
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:26.200]  out of literally thousands of people. They have the Boston Marathon going on.
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:27.200]  It took forever to get through.
[3:04:27.200 --> 3:04:30.200]  He's like, what are you filming for? What is this?
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:31.200]  Tell them, well,
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:33.200]  You answer the question now, scum.
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:35.200]  And then what happened next?
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:37.200]  Yeah. Well, plus I was interrupted by the other way.
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:39.200]  You move now, I put back.
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:41.200]  You answer my question. You come here now.
[3:04:41.200 --> 3:04:42.200]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:43.200]  Doors.
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  They didn't know what I was filming, what I was filming for, what I plan to do with it.
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:50.200]  And I told them, I'm filming for your speech.
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:52.200]  You shut up.
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  Step on me.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:54.200]  Come on.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:55.200]  Get over here.
[3:04:55.200 --> 3:04:56.200]  Get up on it.
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:04:57.200]  You slay.
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:04:58.200]  You might slay it now.
[3:04:58.200 --> 3:04:59.200]  Slay.
[3:04:59.200 --> 3:05:01.200]  It is slavery, Alex, and you know it.
[3:05:01.200 --> 3:05:04.200]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:05:04.200 --> 3:05:10.200]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[3:05:10.200 --> 3:05:14.200]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[3:05:14.200 --> 3:05:15.200]  most of which are synthetic.
[3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:17.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:05:17.200 --> 3:05:20.200]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[3:05:20.200 --> 3:05:24.200]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea,
[3:05:24.200 --> 3:05:26.200]  irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[3:06:01.200 --> 3:06:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.200 --> 3:06:15.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:21.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:26.200]  While Obama's already fudging, yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:30.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:36.200]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:38.200]  that's fascism.
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:41.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:48.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:00.200]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:05.200]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[3:07:05.200 --> 3:07:09.200]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:14.200]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:21.200]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:27.200]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:31.200]  germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:36.200]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold and copper,
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:39.200]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:47.200]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[3:08:01.200 --> 3:08:06.200]  A DPS officer asked the Border Patrol if they would get the dog out and they told him no.
[3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:14.200]  So basically they told me, well, you know, you're coming out of this car one way or the other and we're going to search this car whether you like it or not.
[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:24.200]  And so a gentleman from the DPS walked over to the passenger side of the vehicle and he got out of hammer and some other device
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:30.200]  and he was kind of tapping on the window for a couple of minutes like as if he were, you know, getting ready to break the window.
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:34.200]  And he was on the passenger side, I'm all the way over on the driver's side.
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:40.200]  Well, they told me, you know, cover your eyes because there's going to be glass when we break this window in.
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:45.200]  So I put my hands over my face like this and I leaned forward to cover my eyes.
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:54.200]  And at that moment, not only did the officer on the passenger side break the window, but another hammer just came from out.
[3:08:54.200 --> 3:08:58.200]  I didn't see this coming at all and shattered the window right behind my head.
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:08:59.200]  I mean six inches from my head.
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:01.200]  So both windows shattered in the same instant.
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:08.200]  I'm like this with my face in my hands and at that moment I'm shot by tasers.
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:10.200]  So I'm in excruciating pain.
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:15.200]  I couldn't even control my body anymore because when you're hit with these tasers, you're paralyzed.
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:18.200]  And so I couldn't even, my hand came down from my face.
[3:09:18.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  I was trying to put my hand back in front of my face.
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:21.200]  I couldn't even control my arm.
[3:09:21.200 --> 3:09:23.200]  I'm screaming in pain.
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:25.200]  I'm shot with another taser.
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:35.200]  One guy from the Border Patrol grabs my head and basically shoves it into the driver's door where the broken glass was
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:40.200]  where they just busted out the window and I could just feel the glass shoving into the side of my head here
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:47.200]  as he just jammed my face into that side of that door and held it there for a little while.
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:50.200]  It's hard for me to measure the time because I was in so much pain.
[3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:56.200]  It felt like it was saying forever, but it was, I mean this definitely was taking some time.
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:09:59.200]  Then they grabbed me, threw me on the ground.
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:03.200]  Another officer stepped on my head.
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:05.200]  Big Brother.
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:07.200]  Mainstream media.
[3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:09.200]  Government cover-ups.
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:11.200]  You want answers?
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:12.200]  Well, so does he.
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:16.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:10:16.200 --> 3:10:22.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:25.200]  You know, this is the issue of jurisdiction.
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:28.200]  Jurisdiction means what government can do.
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:29.200]  Now you've got federal police.
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:31.200]  They don't use warrants anymore.
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:33.200]  They taser you if you talk back.
[3:10:33.200 --> 3:10:34.200]  They have internal checkpoints.
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:36.200]  In fact, Google this.
[3:10:36.200 --> 3:10:37.200]  They have federal maps.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:38.200]  Constitution-free zones.
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:40.200]  Show folks the national map.
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  The ACLU is actually accurate on this.
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:43.200]  They have a good map of it.
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:45.200]  And people are driving to work and stuff and they're sick of this.
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:50.200]  Every day they pull in and they go, we want to search you, but then I covered CNN earlier in the show
[3:10:50.200 --> 3:10:53.200]  where the illegal aliens, they have fake raids.
[3:10:53.200 --> 3:10:59.200]  They have fake raids of the illegal aliens and pull that CNN up for people.
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:02.200]  They have these fake raids and then take them to give them their green card
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:07.200]  after they have the stage raids for people watching United States television.
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:08.200]  Here it is, CNN.
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:11.200]  Illegal immigrants detained, then freed to work.
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:17.200]  And in this article, admits they then take them and fill out their green cards and everything for them.
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:19.200]  So, and I've talked to Austin cops.
[3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:24.200]  They arrest a citizen without driver's license, drunk driving, without insurance, they arrest you.
[3:11:24.200 --> 3:11:26.200]  The illegal aliens, they let them go.
[3:11:26.200 --> 3:11:29.200]  This happened one night, one of my guys had an expired driver's license.
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:31.200]  I saw him pulled over in front of the office.
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:32.200]  He pulled in the office.
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:35.200]  They thought that was suspicious, pulling him to the office at night, like eight at night.
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:36.200]  I pull up.
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:37.200]  He's in handcuffs.
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:38.200]  He put in a car.
[3:11:38.200 --> 3:11:39.200]  I come up and they go, hey, Alice, we like the show.
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:42.200]  Yeah, we don't arrest illegals because the judges get mad.
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:43.200]  They just let them go.
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:45.200]  But citizens, yeah, we're told to take them in.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:48.200]  So, he pulls up to this federal checkpoint.
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:51.200]  They have these things, again, in some cases, over 100 miles in.
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:56.200]  Like, for my grandfather died, he got real mad, he was driving around in the Hill Country, visiting his sister once.
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:11:58.200]  And a court patrol pulls him over.
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:03.200]  This is outside Austin, you know, 200-something miles from the border and asks him if he was a U.S. citizen.
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:07.200]  So, again, it's their excuse to harass citizens, nobody else.
[3:12:07.200 --> 3:12:11.200]  And we have a, I'm going to finish your story of the TSA.
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:17.200]  Sacred Police interrogating you about your camera, what's your film, trying to break the camera, laughing about it.
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:21.200]  They literally, I've seen them with good-looking women, they just start grabbing.
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:25.200]  And it's all part of a ritual of service to them.
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:26.200]  I dominate you.
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:27.200]  I urinate on you.
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:29.200]  It's like a dog hiking its leg.
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:31.200]  And this is what tyranny is.
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:36.200]  It's just all these do-nothing scum ruling us and then all the big criminals on top.
[3:12:36.200 --> 3:12:40.200]  But I wanted to go to Pastor Stephen L. Anderson that this happened to.
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:44.200]  Mr. Anderson, it's good to have you here with us.
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:45.200]  Good to be here.
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:46.200]  Thank you.
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:49.200]  Okay, finish up because we just played some of the clip.
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:50.200]  And a lot of people are doing this.
[3:12:50.200 --> 3:12:58.200]  I'm sure you've now noticed the videos are all over online, all over the country in Washington State in Vermont and Minnesota.
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:01.200]  People will be 100 miles in, 50 miles in.
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:02.200]  They're trying to drive to work.
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:04.200]  You've got to drive through a checkpoint.
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:05.200]  They want to search you.
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:06.200]  They want you to answer questions.
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:07.200]  People get sick of it.
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:09.200]  This isn't Nazi Germany.
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:11.200]  That happened to you.
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:14.200]  You question them and tell folks what happened.
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:17.200]  Well, do you want me to just start at the beginning and go through the whole story?
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:22.200]  Or do you want me to just tell the critical part about where they actually started to beat me and attack me?
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:24.200]  Tell the critical part.
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:30.200]  And now since this happened a week ago, I'm sure you know there's probably a million views or more of all the versions of the video up on the web.
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:33.200]  What type of response you've seen from this.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:35.200]  Well, let me take you to the most critical point.
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:41.200]  You know, we basically had a standoff for about 75 minutes of just going back and forth.
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  They wanted to search my car without a warrant.
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:45.200]  They wanted to interrogate me.
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:49.200]  I refused to answer questions and I would not allow them to search my car without a warrant.
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:53.200]  Well, finally, the DPS, that was the border patrol at this internal checkpoint.
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:58.200]  It's about 50 miles north of Mexico on an east-west highway.
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:02.200]  Well, then the DPS shows up, which is the Arizona Highway Patrol.
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:07.200]  And they come up and they, you know, they're going to take me out of the car so that they can get in and search this car.
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:12.200]  Now, you were explaining to them that you were explaining to them that this was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:13.200]  Absolutely.
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:14.200]  Repeatedly.
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:22.200]  And so they basically tricked me into thinking that they were just going to knock out the passenger window,
[3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:25.200]  which I'm thinking to myself, okay, a couple hundred bucks for a new window.
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:27.200]  No, they were going to punish you.
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:29.200]  They were going to punish you, but go ahead.
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:30.200]  Right.
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:32.200]  You know, I'm thinking to myself, couple hundred bucks, but you know what?
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:37.200]  I'm not going to back down here because, you know, this is the right of every American at stake.
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:39.200]  You know, you give them a finger, they take the whole hand.
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:41.200]  You know, you give them an inch, they take a mile.
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:46.200]  So I'm sitting there and then the Board of Patrol agents are crowded around my car to the left of me.
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:51.200]  And, you know, they've already been trying to intimidate me for the last hour and 15 minutes.
[3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:55.200]  But they told me, they said, cover your eyes because there's going to be broken glass.
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:15:03.200]  So I go ahead and put my hands over my eyes, put my face down in my lap, hardly a good position to be in when you get attacked.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:05.200]  But I've got my eyes covered.
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:13.200]  I'm bent down and not only did the passenger window break, but the driver's side window a few inches from my head broke simultaneously.
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:14.200]  Out of nowhere.
[3:15:14.200 --> 3:15:16.200]  No, no, Pastor, you made a key point, though.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:19.200]  You made a key point in psych warfare, they teach them.
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:25.200]  Before they invaded Panama for six months, they would land the helicopters, land the helicopters take off to acclimate.
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:28.200]  That's what the knocking with the hammer was.
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:29.200]  Right.
[3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:33.200]  So that you just got acclimated to the knocking of the hammer.
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:35.200]  All animal training, we're all seen as animals.
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:40.200]  And the cops are manipulated with basic animal psychology themselves in their own gangrid.
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:42.200]  So it's all brainwashing.
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:43.200]  And then there's the lie.
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:44.200]  Then there's the lie.
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:45.200]  Cover your eyes.
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:46.200]  We care about you.
[3:15:46.200 --> 3:15:49.200]  That's really just so they see what your hands are in case you've got a weapon.
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  Then they taser.
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:54.200]  Then there's the other pleasure taser, the added Satanism enjoyment.
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:15:56.200]  And then there's the stomping on the head and everything else.
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  But go ahead.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:06.200]  Let me emphasize this, the electricity never stops throughout this encounter because when they hit you with that 50,000 volt X26 taser,
[3:16:06.200 --> 3:16:15.200]  which I read that model number off of one of the tasers that I saw, when they hit you with that, there's these two little metal probes that go into your flesh.
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:16.200]  And there are wires.
[3:16:16.200 --> 3:16:22.200]  And what happens is when they do that, they can just keep pulling the trigger in order to extend the length of it.
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  So they can keep you electrified for as long as they want.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:35.200]  And that's why people die because this sadistic enjoyment, you see the cops' faces, you know, when they test it for the public,
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:37.200]  it's just a little jolt when they show it to themselves.
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:40.200]  But when they hit you with like the don't taze me, bro, and they go, no, you're going to get punished.
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:41.200]  You're going to get tortured.
[3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:43.200]  It just goes on and on and on.
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:46.200]  And you see them going, oh, God, I hate America.
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:47.200]  Oh, this was so good.
[3:16:47.200 --> 3:16:50.200]  I used to be really disturbed by that don't taze me, bro video.
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:56.200]  But it seemed pretty mild the other day when I watched it because, I mean, this went on and on.
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:00.200]  So here I am in that, you know, I had my eyes covered.
[3:17:00.200 --> 3:17:01.200]  I'm not fighting back.
[3:17:01.200 --> 3:17:02.200]  I haven't lifted a finger.
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:03.200]  I haven't threatened anything.
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:04.200]  I'm just sitting there.
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:06.200]  You know, they say cover my eyes.
[3:17:06.200 --> 3:17:07.200]  I cover my eyes.
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:12.200]  Were they cussing at you and having little victories against freedom, little hoots and noises?
[3:17:12.200 --> 3:17:15.200]  Or was it silent?
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:20.200]  You know, you mean from the offices?
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:21.200]  I don't know.
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:22.200]  All I heard was my own screaming.
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:23.200]  That's all I could hear.
[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:24.200]  You know what I mean?
[3:17:24.200 --> 3:17:30.200]  So here I am, you know, just tazed and you're totally paralyzed when you're tazed anyway.
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:32.200]  So I'm being electrified here.
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:34.200]  Glass flew at me from both sides.
[3:17:34.200 --> 3:17:42.200]  Next thing I know, a hand comes from the left and just shoves my head into the broken glass that was just busted out of the window.
[3:17:42.200 --> 3:17:48.200]  So I could feel that glass just shoving into my scalp and my face was just jammed against the door with that glass.
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:50.200]  And that's what the wounds to my head are.
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:59.200]  It's from when the agent shoved my head into that broken glass on the door and that just held it there while the electricity never stopped.
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:04.200]  A little bit of time went by, it's hard for me to measure the time, but the door then is opened.
[3:18:04.200 --> 3:18:11.200]  The driver's side door, I fall out onto the ground and a border patrol agent steps on my head with what felt like all his weight.
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:15.200]  And again, the electricity is never stopping throughout all of this, okay?
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:19.200]  And I'm just laying there screaming for mercy with somebody standing on my head.
[3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:25.200]  And it's funny because when I was in high school, we had to read a book, require reading 1984 by George Orwell.
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:31.200]  While I'm laying there with this guy stepping on my head, a quote from the book just randomly pops into my mind.
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:36.200]  And this is when the evil government guy is torturing the main character.
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:43.200]  He said, if you want a vision of the future, just imagine a boot stamping upon a human face forever.
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:45.200]  And I remember that quote popped into my mind.
[3:18:45.200 --> 3:18:47.200]  Yeah, that's O'Brien, that's O'Brien.
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:48.200]  Right.
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:53.200]  And while I'm laying there with somebody standing on my head, the electricity's not stopping.
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:58.200]  The glass is still shoving into my head from being stepped on.
[3:18:58.200 --> 3:19:05.200]  And while I'm laying there, I'm just thinking to myself, what do I have to do to get these people to stop?
[3:19:05.200 --> 3:19:07.200]  Don't they see I'm not resisting?
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:11.200]  And I'm just thinking, do they want me to scream? Do they want me to be silent?
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:15.200]  What are they looking for? Just what do I have to do to get them to stop torturing me?
[3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:19.200]  No, no, no. What else does O'Brien say to Winston when they're torturing him and electrocuting him?
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:23.200]  They said, Winston, this is about destroying humanity.
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:27.200]  Always trampling over people, stomping on people, controlling them.
[3:19:27.200 --> 3:19:28.200]  We're the priests of power.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:31.200]  We like to hurt people and hurt each other.
[3:19:31.200 --> 3:19:34.200]  That's the whole object of this, Winston.
[3:19:34.200 --> 3:19:37.200]  So what mattered was...
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:39.200]  And these guys have a nose for this.
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:41.200]  If you're a drug dealer or scum, they let you go.
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:43.200]  And I've seen it.
[3:19:43.200 --> 3:19:50.200]  But especially because you're a King James Mersen pastor, know about the corruption, it's a spiritual thing.
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:53.200]  And I've seen the video of these guys.
[3:19:53.200 --> 3:19:58.200]  A lot of these guys are on the drug tech, especially the ones at the drug checkpoints.
[3:19:58.200 --> 3:20:05.200]  These are all the potbelly ones. We'll be right back.
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:35.200]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[3:20:35.200 --> 3:20:38.200]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[3:20:38.200 --> 3:20:40.200]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:43.200]  Put in a food supply from eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:46.200]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:21:02.200]  If you're going to pick something to stand for, be sure you have enough food to keep on standing.
[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:08.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:14.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:20.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:22.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:25.200]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:25.200 --> 3:21:29.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:38.200]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:41.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:48.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:04.200]  Are you tired of losing your hard earned savings in retirement?
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:11.200]  Does a continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?

[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:17.200]  This is the end. Beautiful prayer. This is the end.
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:34.200]  Pastor Stephen L. Anderson. Okay, so you're a pastor. You're also doing some construction work at Tools. So you're there. They're jumping on you, tasering you. They're having an enjoyment. How does this end? You end up going to jail.
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:44.200]  They always, in my experience, charge you with something. It's not enough to attack you with deadly weapons. There's also got to be a false charge. Has that happened? You boil it down for us.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  Yes, two misdemeanors and these are really laughable. Number one, I was charged with obstructing a public highway because of the fact that I did not allow them to search me.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:02.200]  That caused this encounter to take so long that they're blaming me for that lane being obstructed.
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:15.200]  I say that in all the videos where the guy goes, you pull me over every day, Bill. You know I'm a U.S. citizen, pull over, got to search you. I saw this on ferries and I'm not saying Muslims are bad or terrorists, but I will never go back down to Bollivert again.
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:27.200]  I admit there was a kid, there's the ferry and there's literally people wearing the Palestinian headdresses, the very weave, all over the boat.
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:38.200]  And that didn't matter. Every time I'd go over and there's not many restaurants, so we'd come back over with my kids. I was there like four days to eat in Galveston when they'd go back and they would always search us.
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:46.200]  And I noticed because, see, they give them the directive. They don't even know why. It's train the slaves. The Americans are the terrorists.
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:57.200]  And now we have this... Pastor, are you aware of the secret documents that have been leaked? We've leaked a lot of them, saying gun owners, Christians, constitutionalists are really the terrorists and the number one threat to the government?
[3:25:57.200 --> 3:26:03.200]  Yes, I did hear that and it's interesting the timing of this happening. Just what days after that came out in the news seemed like.
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  Well, I'm looking at your picture. I mean, you know, it's pretty dangerous.
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:17.200]  Now, so how did this end? I mean, did they have any little celebrations when they put you in the car like, you idiot, you should have let us serve you?
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:25.200]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Wait, wait'll you hear this. So after I'm laying there in a pool of my own blood being stepped on and tainted repeatedly, this was the punishment section of what they were doing to me.
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:32.200]  You know, they were basically getting their vindication. Well, finally, thank God, you know, the electricity finally stopped.
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:37.200]  They get off my head and I hear a chorus of voices saying, get up, get up, stand up.
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:41.200]  So I kind of staggered my feet with their help. Blood gushing out of the side of my head.
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:52.200]  They cuffed me behind my back, put me in the trailer and that's when three Border Patrol agents started laughing at me, literally just laughing, mocking, oh, you're not so tough now.
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:58.200]  You didn't think we were going to search you, did we? Well, I guess we did get to search you and guess what they found when they searched me? Nothing.
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:03.200]  They found nothing illegal. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I've never even been arrested in my life, but don't worry.
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:10.200]  They're going to have their pension funds taken. They're going to have their children's futures destroyed. They're enjoying all the vaccines they give their kids.
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:17.200]  They're going to enjoy having their kids and diapers when they're 30. They're going to get all the curses they want to because this is the new.
[3:27:17.200 --> 3:27:28.200]  Pastor, do you know what the New World Order is? Yes. I'm familiar with, actually, I've never listened to your show, but I've watched many of your films and I think they're great.
[3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:37.200]  Well, what was it like to live the police state? It was just what you just said. I was living. I was living your film on the police state.
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:53.200]  I was right there. I'm so sick of hearing the word conspiracy theory. I think if I hear it again, I'm going to throw up because I want somebody to look at my bloody death face on YouTube and then tell me it's a theory about the fact that this country is turning into a police state.
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:28:09.200]  Now, Pastor, how long did these celebrations go on, though, about how they destroyed the Fourth Amendment, annihilated what the veterans fought for, attacked a pastor? They weren't low enough at that point. They had to just add the, just no honor.
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:13.200]  They had to add the icing of thuggishness to it.
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:29.200]  Right. And as they're wiping the blood, they had rubber gloves on, but they still had blood on their gloves, up their wrists. They had blood all over themselves. And then they start asking me if I have HIV and they're joking with me and laughing at me and mocking me.
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:31.200]  It's all about dehumanizing you.
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:33.200]  I don't know how long it was.
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:35.200]  So it was a great celebration of evil. Okay.
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:41.200]  Because the rest of their buddies were out searching my car during this time, turning up nothing.
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:45.200]  Lucky you didn't smart off at that point. There'd have been some weapons and drugs found in there, their main product.
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:53.200]  You know, finally, at one point after, after just this went on and on, because I was just sitting there silently for most of it just really shook up, obviously.
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:29:13.200]  Finally, I did, I did get a little angry and said, you know, because what this is what made me finally, you know, get upset, even in my position of being handcuffed and bloodied and everything is when the guy walked up to me, you know, CD as he comes up to me and says, if you would have just answered the questions, we would have let you go.
[3:29:13.200 --> 3:29:19.200]  Oh yeah, the Nazis, when they were torturing people, always made it your fault. Oh, so it is your fault. Go ahead.
[3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:24.200]  There was no fault. No one said they're sorry that it happened.
[3:29:24.200 --> 3:29:28.200]  Nothing. Well, stay there. I want to come back and finish up with this. We appreciate you coming on the show.
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:42.200]  But my guys just went through hell in Boston. I mean, they had foreigners who hardly speak English going, what camera? Are you terrorists and like grabbing other people that had cameras and like saying they were together, other guys and just jabbing the Americans.
[3:29:42.200 --> 3:29:52.200]  You work for us now. We train you how to be saved.
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:30:02.200]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.200 --> 3:30:08.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:30:08.200 --> 3:30:15.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:22.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:26.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:38.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.

[3:31:01.200 --> 3:31:13.200]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher.

[3:32:01.200 --> 3:32:16.200]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have? It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Not if, but when.
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:34.200]  Hi Bill. I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my solar backup generator hooked up and running. To tell you the truth, it's awesome. Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV and shortwave radio. I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid. Thanks for all your help.

[3:33:05.200 --> 3:33:13.200]  This is not America.
[3:33:19.200 --> 3:33:20.200]  Little peace.
[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:38.200]  We're going to go back to the pastor in a moment, but you guys keep telling me how this went on and on. Just like attacking old ladies, bossing people around. Like when you had your shoes off, being humiliated, like telling you hurry up, like, I don't know why. Listen, I'm scared to fly through it because I'm scared of myself. I wouldn't put up with it again.
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:59.200]  When I flew in from England, my parents flew in from England into Houston because that's where you take the continental 777s over there is the best way to fly. The people at the Houston one, they're screaming at everyone. Everyone's scared, groveling, and they're just like nuts, foreigners, and in every form of, you know, just person on power trips.
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:12.200]  Because that's what's so bizarre. It's not just citizens screaming at you. It's obvious people can't even speak English, and they're like, hurry up, get it off. And everybody's like, oh, yes. And old ladies, like, groveling on their crutches, and I'm not exaggerating.
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:26.200]  This is like five, six years ago. I'm in San Francisco on a connecting flight. I think I'm coming back from LA or something, but I went through San Francisco. I don't remember the point. I'm in San Francisco, and it was called Wolverine Security.
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:36.200]  You can check into this, folks. I don't know if they're still there, but it was like bright blue, Cobra Commander colored fatigues, boots, blouse, tucked in. Looked like Nazi uniforms from science fiction.
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:54.200]  And these berets, and they were like jabbing old people, getting on a flight to Hawaii, going, and I was like, and I almost went over there. I was like, the humiliation of it. And like, these were old vets going to a, they all had, you know, survivor of the, of the,
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:35:05.200]  what was the name of the battleship that went to the bottom, you know, so survivor of the Arizona and all this. And literally, you can tell somebody's about to die in that little oxygen tanks, you know, where the eyes are going like that, and the reds like sagging down.
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:18.200]  And the guys got hearing aids on. There's a couple more. He's got like some wife who's the young one who's only 80, and he's like, I'm going back, and like, just, and I'm going, because they were searching you when you went through the checkpoint and again at the planes.
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:31.200]  And I just realized, I said, this country's gone, man. I mean, that is what this is, is slave training. Now, folks, tell them fast, because I want to go back to the pastor and I'm going to take a few calls. The entire thing of what happened to you in Boston.
[3:35:31.200 --> 3:35:43.200]  Well, it's the same routine every time. You got to basically strip search, not quite, but that's humiliation training. Oh, it's very degrading submission training. Some of them have apologized to me on other occasions, and then they bring you through.
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:53.200]  Well, you said apologize. They go, I apologize, but is this microphone deadly? Oh, yeah, yeah. And I was saying at the break, if the military are supposed to be the best and brightest, these are the dullest and most dim-witted.
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:36:07.200]  And they're always pointing at the screening, you know, the x-ray machine. What's that? What do you think? Does that look okay to you? Every time I go through, so they do that and then like, this your bag, come over here. It's all this monosyllabic.
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:17.200]  But tell them what he said. Describe it. She said it was real bossy. Yeah, I didn't even have a time to put my shoes and belt back on. It's come over here. Explain this to me. What is this camera?
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:31.200]  You know, we have all kinds of accessories and equipment. He wants to know about just about every piece of it. And he's playing with lenses that cost, you know, hundreds and thousands of dollars and trying to screw it on backwards and one side down.
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:33.200]  He's like, what are you filming?
[3:36:33.200 --> 3:36:41.200]  Yeah, that's not enough. He wants to know what I'm working on. You said it was what you do. I mean, go through the imitation. Do like you do during the breaks, man.
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:49.200]  He did try to put you in collusion with the other guy, too. No, but you said he's like, who's he? Who's he? I say, oh, well, you know, that's my partner point to Rob.
[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:53.200]  No, not him. Guy in black jacket with camera. Yeah, black jacket.
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:37:05.200]  What about him? Well, I don't know that guy. What are you talking about? They pull over the old lady with four balls of yarn and at worst a crochet needle and it's terrible, Alex.
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:19.200]  And what's this? What's you filming for? No, but what is it? Who are you filming for? They said documentary. Who? Who? Ah, you answer question now. You answer question now. You answer my question. You answer now.
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:34.200]  Free speech. Answer now. Answer now. It's slave. But I finally tell him free speech. Any kind of giggles. Listen, you dirty American. We run this country now. Homeland security.
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:39.200]  What you do with camera? You answer my question.
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:49.200]  You know, aside from getting fit, I mean, thank God nothing happened like with this pastor, but I mean, it's basically the other ladies ordering me move back now over here.
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:57.200]  Hurry up. Hurry up. It's a nightmare. I grabbed some trays from her trying to help. This is our training to be slaves and now they're doing it on the streets and everywhere else.
[3:37:57.200 --> 3:38:09.200]  I can't. Every time it bothers me. I'm not. Listen, I don't pleasure flying anymore. I don't take my family on vacations on planes. How would I take my little children to be bossed around by scum?
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  And then on top of it, I can't take them to the beach because they're doing it there. I mean, I mean, I can't do anything anymore. And then now they're setting up checkpoints on the streets doing this.
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:34.200]  Yeah, even when I, the one time I did fly, there wasn't a trip for work here without any video equipment. Excuse me, sir, is this your bag? We found a tube of toothpaste. No liquids.
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:42.200]  And again, they always keep adding more and more. And then now it's questioning lining up. We are going to discuss the contents of your bags.
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:53.200]  Are you al-Qaeda? I mean, it's just, it's incredible. Going back to a pastor, Steve L. Anderson, where is it going from here now? I mean, they've given you false charges.
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:57.200]  You said there were two charges. One of them was them making you block the road. What's the next one?
[3:38:57.200 --> 3:39:07.200]  Right. And neither of these charges is even anything major. Just a couple misdemeanors. One was just blocking the road by not cooperating with the illegal search they were trying to do.
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:14.200]  And that number two was failure to obey the officer's order to open the door.
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:20.200]  So, you know, failing to obey and blocking the highway are the only things I'm being charged with.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:29.200]  When reality failure to obey the criminal, I mean, can a cop come to your door and say, Mo, my law and failure to bail arrest you. It's the fourth amendment.
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:40.200]  They've got these things a hundred miles. Okay, so what's the aftermath of this been like? You know, probably a million views on the web or more. What feedback have you gotten? Are they proud of themselves? Are you going to sue their lordships?
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:51.200]  Well, obviously, I mean, otherwise, who's going to pay for my fitches to my head? The 11th fitch is going to pay for my windows that I already had to pay to have replaced. I'm having to pay a lawyer to defend me.
[3:39:51.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  I mean, obviously, I've got to get retribution here, but not only that, what I want the most out of this is for this to get out to as many people as possible just to wake people up that this is happening in the United States.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:10.200]  Because these guys didn't act like this was anything special to them. It seemed to me that this was another day at the office.
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:17.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This happens. Sir, you haven't seen the hundreds, literally hundreds of videos of people that are sick of this a hundred miles into the country.
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:22.200]  I mean, sir, you haven't. I mean, had you seen all the people sick of this, this is a big phenomenon.
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:30.200]  I've seen a few, but I'm telling you, we've got to get this out. And that's the biggest thing I want to see is for people to blog this.
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:41.200]  But what's wrong with internal checkpoints and World War II vets having foreigners jab and yell at them? I mean, that's freedom, sir. The veterans fought and died so we could live in a Nazi hell.
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  Exactly.
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  Well, now were they proud of themselves? I mean, I mean, what about the police at the station? Was this another celebration?
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:41:00.200]  In their mind, they won the battle by beating and humiliating and torturing me. Uncondemned, they won the battle.
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:12.200]  Now, when it comes to the officers at the police station, you know, or actually once I got to the actual jail, I was driven, you know, 75 miles away to an emergency room where I was, my head was stitched and so forth.
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  The people at the hospital were kind of, you know, they could tell that I was well-spoken. I was a nice guy and they seemed a little shocked.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:21.200]  Why is this guy here? What have you done to him?
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:30.200]  Do you understand that whether you're Hispanic, black, white, any of it, we are the targets. Anybody who produces, anybody that works, they've gone, hey, these are suckers.
[3:41:30.200 --> 3:41:33.200]  They'll let us get away with anything. Well, just declare we're God.
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:43.200]  When I was in the hospital, they asked me, they said, you know, what happened to you? And I just pointed at the DPS officer and said, well, ask him. He's the one who did this to me.
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  And he's, oh, well, we had to get him out of the car, you know. But then when they took me down to the jail, you know, a few people were asking me questions while I was at the jail.
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  And they said, why are you here? Why are you the one that got arrested?
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:41:58.200]  Well, don't worry.
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:02.200]  They are telling me I needed to sue and everything. That's what the jailer was telling me.
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:12.200]  Well, you know, that the jailers told me to sue them. And you know, you reap what you sow. And I hope these cops know all this comes back on.
[3:42:12.200 --> 3:42:19.200]  I mean, really, I'm scared to screw somebody, not just because I'm a moral guy, but I won't do it because I know.
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  I mean, you know, you don't just get judged when you die, Pastor, from my experience. You get judged for what you do in this life and your family.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:31.200]  Absolutely. It's going to come around to you in this life. You're going to reap what you sow, no matter who you are.
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:36.200]  Good or bad, you're going to reap what you sow in this life. For sure.
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:42.200]  Hey, can I talk a little bit about Romans 13? Because this is what people are throwing in my face. And it's really unbelievable.
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  Oh, yeah, no, I saw the comments. I saw the comments on there going, you should have followed the order. It's of the Lord, all government is of God.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:55.200]  Well, why do we fight Hitler? Why did the founders fight? Why were all the prophets killed or put in prison?
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:43:00.200]  Why did they go into the lion's den? The fiery furnace for following orders? Why were Christians burned at the stakes?
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:04.200]  That is a fraud and Hitler's favorite quote was Roman 13.
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:08.200]  Yeah, I want you to make your statement on that, Pastor, but before you really don't.
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:13.200]  I'm a pastor, you know, and I actually have Romans 13 memorized in addition to almost half the New Testament.
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  Okay. And first of all, let me say this. Many of these modern Bible versions are changing Romans 13.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:24.200]  And if you look at them, they're changing the text to give it an authoritarian feel.
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:33.200]  But if you read, you know, a King James Bible, Romans 13, the first words of the chapter are, let every soul be subject to the higher powers.
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:40.200]  And of course, the highest power in this country is the U.S. Constitution, not a Border Patrol officer or DPS officer.
[3:43:40.200 --> 3:43:48.200]  But not only that, as you read through the chapter, he's talking about rulers and laws. Okay.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:52.200]  He says for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
[3:43:52.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  I think anyone will agree that a DPS officer or a Border Patrol agent is not a ruler or the supreme authority of our country.
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:10.200]  And so to sit there and say that I was disobeying authority because I wouldn't follow their unlawful command to search my car without a warrant,
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:14.200]  which violates the highest authority in this country is laughable.
[3:44:14.200 --> 3:44:25.200]  And it's like you said, if Romans 13 is telling us to blindly obey an evil government, then that would make us great Nazis.
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:30.200]  And I guess when the Antichrist comes, we'll all obey him and Stalin and whatever.
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  The Bible in Romans 13 very clearly lays out a government.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:39.200]  It says, you know, rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:43.200]  But wait a minute, we're living in a time where our government is a terror.
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  Hey, the government says abort 50 million babies.
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:47.200]  I guess that's a, oh, it's of the law.
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  God must want us to kill babies.
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:51.200]  It's a cop out.
[3:44:51.200 --> 3:44:53.200]  I blame the past.
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:59.200]  The pastors in this country who are preaching that, you know, they, I mean, I don't even know what to say about them.
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:06.200]  I mean, it's wicked that they would actually have the gauntlet to stand behind a pulpit and preach these kind of lies.
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:13.200]  But I also wanted to say something about, you know, the terrorists, because that's the other attack that's being thrown at me.
[3:45:13.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  What about 9-11?
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:21.200]  And they say, well, you know, because of 9-11, I guess I need to be tortured and beaten when I refuse to be a church.
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:26.200]  But it's funny, if you look at how the word terrorist got into our English language, it comes from French.
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:33.200]  The term terrorist was coined during the French reign of terror, you know, Revolutionary France 1793.
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:36.200]  That's where our English word terrorist comes from.
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:44.200]  And that was the government faction that instituted the reign of terror in France was known as the Terroriste.
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:52.200]  And then, and then Lenin, when he killed 20 million people before Stalin got in and killed double that, he called it the Red Terror and said it's essential.
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:46:01.200]  So yes, terror, in its very definition in France and the Soviet Union, the two first usage is government carrying out mass exterminations.
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  Right, and again, if you, you know, you study the French reign of terror, the executive branch of France at that time was called the Committee of Public Safety in 1793 to July 1794 with the Thermadorian Reaction.
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:22.200]  Okay, during that reign of terror, the government would be original terrorists, because that's where the word comes from.
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:25.200]  Terroriste has made its way into English from 1793.
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:31.200]  But you can read, Pastor, it means you, you should probably be in the MYAC reporter, the federal reporter, you can read.
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  France doesn't exist, that never existed.
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:35.200]  Oh, that never did.
[3:46:35.200 --> 3:46:37.200]  They didn't cut all those people's heads off.
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:40.200]  I'm debunking that, even camps don't exist either.
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:53.200]  Now, I just thought it was funny, it's always safety, you know, because in Revolutionary France, it was the Committee of Public Safety, and the people who beat the living fire out of me were the Department of Public Safety, which is what the Arizona Highway Patrol is called.
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:56.200]  And then there's the Department of Homeland Security.
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:46:58.200]  It sounds like the Committee of Public Safety.
[3:46:58.200 --> 3:47:02.200]  It sounds, and I'm wondering, you know, who is trying to terrify who here?
[3:47:02.200 --> 3:47:05.200]  I was accused by a Border Patrol agent.
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  He said, because I asserted my Fourth Amendment right, he said, well, I'm pretty sure you're a terrorist.
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  But they were the ones trying to terrify me.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:17.200]  They were the ones surrounding my car, threatening me, and boy, those weren't idle threats.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:22.200]  Hey, have you seen the new video of another guy?
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:25.200]  No, they threatened me with numb chucks at the window.
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:28.200]  No, that's me. That was me two months ago.
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  That was me two months ago. That's me, same guy.
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:34.200]  Oh, they showed, they showed you.
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:37.200]  Oh, so they were mad from then.
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:39.200]  Was this the same checkpoint?
[3:47:39.200 --> 3:47:42.200]  No, no, hundreds of miles apart.
[3:47:42.200 --> 3:47:43.200]  But you have to understand, I'm a...
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  So they now menace you with numb chucks.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  Have you seen the video I've got of them breaking men and women's arms with numb chucks to teach them lessons?
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:53.200]  No, I haven't.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:55.200]  But I'm a business traveler.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  I traveled for the last three years.
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  I've traveled all over the United States every week.
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  I've been through these checkpoints hundreds and hundreds of times.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:04.200]  And you just waved through.
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:08.200]  But, you know, every once in a while, the law of absence, they're going to interrogate you.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:09.200]  They're going to want to search you.
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:13.200]  And if you travel as much as I do, you know, you're going to get there at the wrong...
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:18.200]  You're going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when they want to interrogate you and search you without a warrant.
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:21.200]  And, you know, they searched me. They found nothing.
[3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:23.200]  All right, Pastor, we're almost out of time.
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:25.200]  I got to move quick here.
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:30.200]  Are you aware that they secretly recruited 13,000 preachers in 2006?
[3:48:30.200 --> 3:48:31.200]  It was secret.
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  Then they made it public.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:34.200]  It's 26,000 preachers.
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:42.200]  The clergy response teams and FEMA secretly funds them to, say, turn your guns in, go to FEMA camps, take inoculations, Romans 13,
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:44.200]  and that now it's been declassified.
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:49.200]  I mean, is that not the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany where they covertly are hiring the preachers?
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:57.200]  Absolutely. And, you know, it doesn't surprise me based on how these preachers have been preaching and twisting Romans 13
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  and the way that these modern Bible versions are changing the text of Romans 13
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  to make it fit their authoritarian, totalitarian government, you know, philosophy.
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:17.200]  You know, the King James version works it different than these new ones that are being put out by these Bible societies or whatever they are
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:21.200]  and these pastors who are basically selling out our country by telling us,
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:26.200]  be good little Christians and allow the abortion machine to go forward,
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:30.200]  the new world order, the one world government to go forward.
[3:49:30.200 --> 3:49:38.200]  How can you be a Christian or a preacher and not believe in what the Bible says is going to happen one day, you know, a one world government?
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  That's what I don't understand.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:51.200]  Well, I want the sadists that did this to you to know that everything they're doing to you will be done to them ten times worse by the evil globalists above them.
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:54.200]  And so they can't escape judgment.
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:50:02.200]  And pastor, is there a website we can visit or a YouTube channel or how to folks attend your church? How about it's a good one?
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:11.200]  Well, first of all, we got to get this video out there on YouTube, just search pastor, border patrol, it's going to come up because this has got to get out as many people as possible.
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:17.200]  We got to get this thing viral so that it doesn't keep happening to other people who, you know, are less connected than I am, I guess.
[3:50:17.200 --> 3:50:26.200]  But also the updates on the situation are out of the blog, my wife's personal blog, which is evenandersonfamily.blogspot.com.
[3:50:26.200 --> 3:50:30.200]  And then my church's website is faithfulwordbaptist.org.
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:32.200]  Faithfulword?
[3:50:32.200 --> 3:50:39.200]  Yes, it's faithfulwordbaptistchurch in Tempe, Arizona, which is right in the middle of Phoenix, right in the heart of Phoenix.
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:42.200]  ASU is in Tempe, Arizona State University.
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:43.200]  All right.
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  So that's where our church is located, very popular.
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:49.200]  Pastor, fire out the website one more time. Fire out the website one more time.
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:54.200]  www.facebookwordbaptist.org.
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:50:56.200]  All right, we'll talk to you again in an update.
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:59.200]  We'll get an update from you soon. Thank you, sir.
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:01.200]  Let me say bye to him during the break.

[3:52:01.200 --> 3:52:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:13.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:20.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:22.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:24.200]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.200 --> 3:52:37.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:48.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:54:01.200 --> 3:54:19.200]  Okay, I should not get to calls. I didn't. I took quite a bit though early on. I'll take calls tomorrow. I promise when I start the show, I'm going to cover the new fat tax and all the new carbon taxes, as we told you, it's all being announced.
[3:54:19.200 --> 3:54:31.200]  Bureaucrats micromanaging every facet. You think foreigners jabbing you and yelling at old people at airports and going, oh, what this is bad? Just get ready. You ain't seen nothing yet. You're being scientifically bathed in tyranny right now.
[3:54:31.200 --> 3:54:42.200]  But faties cause global warming, new tax. We'll get to that. I meant to get to this. This is huge. Burma's covered it last night. He'll cover it again tonight. I'm going to get Paul Watson or Kurt Nemo to do a story on it.
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:58.200]  It says foreign troops and everything for a domestic takeover drill, part of a top off 2009 national level exercise of terrorism, and FEMA, just working with police, military, foreign troops in America,
[3:54:58.200 --> 3:55:15.200]  validating the Homeland Security system. That's the federal control grid over the gun owners, the American people. They keep saying it's for foreigners. It's for foreigners. Prepare to hit the people. Prepare to hit them. Oh, we're friends. Oh, give us your rides. Let us track and get everything to control you because we want to keep you safe.
[3:55:15.200 --> 3:55:26.200]  These people will send me under our control to the number one threat to us. They've got guns and they know about our banking takeover. Oh, I'm your friend. Oh, the government loves you. I mean, that's what's going on. Offshore banks run us.
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:36.200]  That said, in closing gentlemen, you're the guys rent in Raven off air about how bad the checkpoints were. It was one of their point you were going to make about something. That's why I drug you in.
[3:55:36.200 --> 3:55:46.200]  Oh, Aaron was not hurt in the that was a setup. I wasn't really a foreigner. I wasn't really slapping him in the face. I wasn't really interrogating him. I was just showing you where all this is going.
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:58.200]  You woman, drink breast milk. I mean, that's real. We laugh a little. Drink it down. I'm sorry. I'm getting into character. I mean, we laugh a little in character, but it really is horrifying.
[3:55:58.200 --> 3:56:07.200]  And it just progressively gets worse and worse. And this is never going away. It's going to be pretty soon. They're going to have a little hot shot, little cattle prods.
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:17.200]  I mean, you'll be you'll be that's already last week. The guys patting me down after I've already, you know, taken off my shoes and put on my bag. It's going on. Nice.
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:23.200]  I just like to touch people or something. Oh, no, with hot women, it's bad. Big perverts gentlemen. Good job.
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:30.200]  I say one thing. The one thing that the oath keepers are saying that these globalists, they don't know how to drive tanks. They don't know how to shoot people.
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:37.200]  They don't know how to load a weapon. They know how to fire, fire foreigners and lobotomize people and give machine guns.
[3:56:37.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  They know how to give orders, but they don't know how to actually carry them out. So, you know, we still have the power and definitely you should take the oath or reaffirm your oath if you haven't taken it yet to the Constitution because that's the only.
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:54.200]  That is a conspiracy theory. This is not a nation run by the people. There is no liberty. That's an al-qaeda lie.
[3:56:54.200 --> 3:57:05.200]  Most foreigners working at TSA better learn about the Constitution overall and trouble. They've been hired because they'll carry out tyranny because they come from nations of tyranny where they just line folks up and machine gun them.
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:13.200]  Hey, good job, man. Thanks for coming in. They're converting the entire military over to foreigners right now. All right, retransmission, huge show covered a lot in the first hour.
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:19.200]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors here at the very, very end before we go into retransmission covered a lot of key stuff right at the start of the show.
