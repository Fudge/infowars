[00:00.000 --> 00:22.400]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[00:22.400 --> 00:34.480]  network only four days out hard to believe only four days out from the
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.440]  inauguration of President Donald J. Trump technically it's like four and a half
[00:38.440 --> 00:42.040]  days out I'm still on the road I am coming back and I'll be back in the
[00:42.040 --> 00:44.920]  studio tomorrow but they have a night will be close to me tomorrow as well
[00:44.920 --> 00:52.400]  that I'm on an airplane to Washington DC with the crew and we are going to be
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.360]  covering the inauguration live there on the ground exciting announcements by
[00:58.360 --> 01:01.520]  somebody I've been critical of Spicer I've just said he should be more hardcore
[01:01.520 --> 01:04.520]  should be more aggressive because the media is not its friend they're not
[01:04.520 --> 01:07.120]  going to work with him but he's we're getting more hardcore that's a good
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.200]  thing and he announced you notice that they're going to quote have alternative
[01:11.200 --> 01:17.480]  media and bloggers in an expanded Washington press club and that sent the
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.840]  mainstream media and the conniption fits but but notice even from Spicer the
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.200]  words are using aren't even proper we're not the alternative media we are the
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.600]  independent real proven media we're better than the New York Times better
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.840]  than the Washington Post Matt Drudge always said that anybody is as important
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.800]  as the New York Times I totally agree with that statement but he's been saying
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.680]  that for 15 years they're so discreet longer since like 1997 I guess almost
[01:43.680 --> 01:48.560]  almost 20 years 19 years they are so discredited are known to be such liars
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.040]  and so many emails are out showing how they collude with the deep state that we
[01:54.040 --> 01:59.040]  are better than them until we're ever discredited and expose this total
[01:59.040 --> 02:02.800]  frauds I mean I would hide my head and shame I would disappear if I've been
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.880]  caught in all this criminal activity but meanwhile the Politico writer who got
[02:07.880 --> 02:11.040]  caught in the email saying I'm a hack I'm a fraud I'll lie for you tell me what
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.000]  to do he's being promoted to a senior position at the New York Times from
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.360]  Politico that's a promotion in the world of political dung beetles that roll
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.680]  piles of filth around and kind of shove it down our throat so that is a big
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.640]  announcement you know I've had crew asked me here we gonna be in the Washington
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.000]  press club or you can ask Trump about that I haven't even ever brought that up
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.640]  I'm worried about getting Trump into office I'm worried about cutting taxes
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.040]  and installing the world economy I'm worried about securing the Republic of
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.200]  course ladies and gentlemen in the new Trump era he's gonna open it up to real
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.080]  press and not just dinosaur media so of course but that doesn't matter that
[02:51.080 --> 02:57.400]  doesn't matter we're digital we're in Austin Texas and so the way we get
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.920]  questions answered is we just put a special report on the message to the
[03:00.920 --> 03:06.040]  president and then later he watches it and he listens to it a lot of times late
[03:06.040 --> 03:09.120]  at night I was gonna leave it at that so we can just direct our questions
[03:09.120 --> 03:12.160]  directly at Trump you can do that on Twitter yourself doesn't mean you'll
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.160]  answer every time but let me tell you something you start tweeting at Trump
[03:15.160 --> 03:18.760]  enough he's reading it and his people are reading it this is direct
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.880]  communication ladies you know but yes I do intend to have a Washington
[03:22.880 --> 03:28.160]  correspondent it's just expensive to have somebody that lives in Washington DC and
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.960]  then who every day goes down there and ask the questions but it but it is worth
[03:30.960 --> 03:33.600]  it because the Trump people actually answer questions so that's part of
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.880]  why we need to raise capital you know I've been gone two weeks and the crews
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.280]  done an amazing job it'll be two weeks two weeks on Wednesday actually there's
[03:41.280 --> 03:45.600]  this big conspiracy theory online about where have I gone what's happened to me
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.600]  why isn't there video I'll be quite honest with you after years of having a
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.840]  video camera in my face and bright lights every day I have an entire kit here with
[03:54.840 --> 04:01.440]  lights a backpack with Skype with video with HD and I just I just haven't been
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.120]  setting it up I did it one day and I'm just I just am tired of it tired of
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.720]  looking at my face I thought you'd you know want to want a break of some type
[04:09.720 --> 04:14.200]  here so David nice to be co-hosting with me I'm on the phone people tend to like
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.720]  it though and it's more intimate I mean I remember being in dark studios just a
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.800]  microphone in front of my face the first he'll five years on air so and I'm
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.920]  thinking about maybe once a week or something actually going back to not
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.600]  being video just because at a certain point it's it's obnoxious but but I do
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.920]  apologize the fact that while this has been on phone I think that could do with
[04:36.920 --> 04:40.400]  the Skype audio and it just says you know there's actually some kind of
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.720]  reminiscent or something about you know old-timey to be on the phone as long as
[04:44.720 --> 04:48.640]  it's a good connection okay that said the big news obviously is they're
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.520]  planning riots coming up in four days and major destabilization there's all
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.320]  these other faux controversies they've dug up and so much more will break them
[04:57.320 --> 05:01.200]  all down straight ahead yesterday the Senate took the first step towards
[05:01.200 --> 05:05.200]  repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51 to 48 vote on a new budget blueprint
[05:05.200 --> 05:08.320]  that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is
[05:08.320 --> 05:12.120]  Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster liberal tears float heavy as
[05:12.120 --> 05:15.520]  the Senate had to be called an order every time a Democrat voted no with a
[05:15.520 --> 05:19.080]  nice lecture to go with it forcing the providing officer senator Cory Gardner
[05:19.080 --> 05:22.920]  to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats repeating at nauseam debate is not
[05:22.920 --> 05:26.160]  allowed during a vote now today the vote moves on to the house where we have had
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.360]  similar results the debate has been heated with Democrats speaking past their
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.600]  time bringing in large blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points and
[05:32.600 --> 05:36.000]  try to argue that Republicans are ending health care like before the
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.600]  Affordable Care Act right Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.500]  Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by big wigs and fat cats in
[05:43.500 --> 05:46.440]  the health care industry ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.080]  Care Act did creating health care monopolies in some regions he also said
[05:50.080 --> 05:53.480]  that Republicans had no plan to which Republicans responded by showing the
[05:53.480 --> 05:57.000]  many plans they brought to the debate floor this is Owen Troyer and I've got

[10:20.920 --> 10:25.600]  ahead of what they were believing all because of the Trump euphoria all because
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.800]  the announcement has been made that the United States of America is open for
[10:29.800 --> 10:34.960]  business yet again this is an incredible week of history as road report

[11:06.360 --> 11:12.160]  Hillary and then include John Kerry who all knowingly created the al-Nazra
[11:12.160 --> 11:18.400]  front in Syria six years ago and who gave them the impeds who gave them a
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.560]  service air missiles and who gave them the intelligence and who gave them the
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.760]  chemical weapons and who allowed them to attack and then changed their name to
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.200]  ISIS and now we even have the leaked audio of Kerry talking to Syrian
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.680]  opposition admitting quote Obama wanted to grow ISIS yes five years ago we broke
[11:37.680 --> 11:44.680]  it all down we had Colonel Schaefer Dr. Steve Pachennick Tosh Plumlee on air and
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.160]  we had other sources that were not on air and now you see the new national
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.840]  security advisor to the president who was the commanding general over military
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.120]  intelligence over defense intelligence who sat there and witnessed our
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.520]  government arming al-Qaeda and the man that led the revolt inside the US
[12:04.520 --> 12:10.560]  military to link up with the Russians and transfer the intelligence to them to
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.400]  take out ISIS slash al-Qaeda and last year it was in military to military the
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.760]  new book by Sy Hersch and he came on the broadcast talk about it see how that
[12:21.760 --> 12:27.200]  works see how much trouble the New World Order is in and by the way the military
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.160]  called Obama's bluff four years ago remember that they said listen we're
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.120]  not going to be their Air Force and they got Senator Paul to come out they got
[12:36.120 --> 12:39.800]  Senator Cruz to come out to their credit and say we're not gonna be al-Qaeda's
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.000]  Air Force remember that that's how far we've come that's that's how much has
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.280]  been exposed that's how exciting it is and then even the chairman of the Joint
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.920]  Chiefs Dempsey got on board and went to Obama on a Friday night and said you're
[12:53.920 --> 12:58.400]  not going to bomb them Sunday was supposed to start that Sunday in two
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.400]  days he said the military is gonna refuse to load the weapons you're about
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.800]  to have full mutiny and they said I can have you court-martialed he said I'm not
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.480]  going doing it but you go ahead and do that and all of it's gonna come out that
[13:10.480 --> 13:14.960]  you've ordered us to fund al-Qaeda and ISIS so there's been a Mexican standoff
[13:14.960 --> 13:18.140]  ladies and gentlemen for those of us that don't know what that is it's where
[13:18.140 --> 13:23.120]  you're aiming a gun at them they're aiming a gun at you and then somebody else
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.000]  is aiming a gun at both of you basically a Mexican standoff is in the movie the
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.600]  good the bad the ugly we're all three guys are aiming guns each other that's
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.400]  a Mexican standoff folks and that is exactly what we've been in here for
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.200]  about three four years okay a total Mexican standoff with the new world
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.040]  order and the public has kind of been like the third person with a gun not
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.160]  knowing who to shoot the public hasn't known what's going on meanwhile the
[13:47.160 --> 13:50.880]  Patriots the military the intelligence agencies have so the biggest hoax out
[13:50.880 --> 13:55.280]  there is that intelligence agencies actually don't like Trump they're the
[13:55.280 --> 13:58.400]  whole reason this happened and I'm not trying to make them the heroes I'm not
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.800]  gonna lie to you everybody knows what critics I've been of the intelligence
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.440]  agencies but I wasn't there to destroy them I was there to reform them I wasn't
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.560]  there to overthrow the government I was there to restore it you see I'm what you

[16:02.960 --> 16:07.640]  audience spreading the word we owe it to drudge we owe it to to Donald Trump for
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.520]  having the courage to go to the demonization and the attacks he's gone
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.520]  through but just the last year or so our audience has more than tripled we can
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.680]  see all the metrics and so yes we've got an uphill battle but I'm telling you
[16:21.680 --> 16:27.120]  this is really really really really exciting this is an amazing time to be
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.080]  alive and there's a lot of threats coming up we're gonna break those down a
[16:31.080 --> 16:34.720]  lot of key clips I want to go over and also a lot of exciting news it's
[16:34.720 --> 16:40.520]  starting to happen Trump's people and Trump are starting to tweet out as well
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.480]  as Fox is starting to pick up wait a minute the Saudi Arabians the Chinese
[16:44.480 --> 16:51.120]  the Ukrainians openly gave money to Hillary and openly lobbied for her we
[16:51.120 --> 16:58.960]  have proof that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying you know again Trump's
[16:58.960 --> 17:03.960]  got a lot going on and then a lot happening and you know but you know
[17:03.960 --> 17:09.760]  personally I have sat there and just said look the OPM hack 20 million names
[17:09.760 --> 17:13.160]  you know proof you do you know the Russian things all bull of course it
[17:13.160 --> 17:19.040]  is well we've got to do something about this you know the Chinese Communist
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.280]  bragged they gave my to Hillary so the Saudi Arabians and it just gets lost in
[17:22.280 --> 17:27.760]  the wash and I'm just not gonna go into it the point is that's what Trump
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.360]  needs to do I know it they are accusing him of what they have been caught
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.040]  doing so the good news is I have a couple clips here it's starting to come out
[17:36.040 --> 17:39.840]  it's starting to get in the news that wait a minute these other countries
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.880]  admittedly got involved and said don't vote for Trump and gave money we have
[17:45.880 --> 17:51.360]  them red-handed I know it's on a sexy and cool who it's the Russians the
[17:51.360 --> 17:54.640]  Russians and I'm not putting the Russians down when I say they can't even get
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.840]  their act together they've been under communism for 79 years before they
[17:58.840 --> 18:02.880]  started unraveling this and they really been growing despite the sanctions and
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.000]  in a lot of reforms from what I've studied what I've read and people I've
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.280]  talked to but still Russia admits they're trying to stabilize themselves and
[18:09.280 --> 18:11.960]  they've got Islamic terrorists attacking them in like 10 different
[18:11.960 --> 18:15.440]  bordering nations so they've got corruption issues deal with they're not
[18:15.440 --> 18:21.120]  manipulating anything there is solidarity in that Russia has been under the same
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.000]  globalist economic assault now David Knight can be taking over at the end of
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  this hour I want to just say he's done a fabulous job David what else is on your
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.280]  radar what are you going to be covering today well you just mentioned the
[18:32.280 --> 18:35.640]  Ukrainian situation of course this is a story that broke us to Wednesday on
[18:35.640 --> 18:38.520]  Politico we're going to go into that little bit more detailed because it was
[18:38.520 --> 18:42.640]  kind of overshadowed by the press conference of Donald Trump had but
[18:42.640 --> 18:46.960]  there were efforts that were documented by Politico between DNC officials and
[18:46.960 --> 18:51.240]  someone connected with the Ukrainian government as well as the Ukrainian
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.800]  Embassy we're also going to talk about hope and change not change but change we
[18:56.800 --> 19:03.160]  have Barack Obama and the EPA and the Department of Justice are really
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.600]  cracking down on a wide variety of regulations in the last days and of
[19:06.600 --> 19:11.240]  course we talked about that but I want to focus on some specifics this automobile
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.800]  executive that is accused of violating regulatory requirements in terms of a
[19:16.800 --> 19:22.320]  mission standards is facing 169 years in jail and let's be clear David that's
[19:22.320 --> 19:26.440]  meant to make the rollover to charges in our crew yes check down every automaker
[19:26.440 --> 19:30.120]  for four billion dollars with these impossible emissions standards that you
[19:30.120 --> 19:33.660]  pointed out that is total racketeering I'm gonna skip this network break continue
[19:33.660 --> 19:38.560]  David yeah and key to that too Alex says every day last week from Tuesday
[19:38.560 --> 19:43.280]  through Friday every single day with some first day arrest a VW executive then
[19:43.280 --> 19:45.720]  they announced some additional fines that put on Volkswagen then they went
[19:45.720 --> 19:48.720]  after fiat Chrysler the next day then they went after Renault the next day why
[19:48.720 --> 19:51.280]  they doing so much focusing on the automobile industry well for two
[19:51.280 --> 19:56.520]  reasons they're putting this narrative out there while the big Detroit auto show
[19:56.520 --> 20:00.920]  is going they did it waited till one day after it started to start doing this to
[20:00.920 --> 20:04.560]  send a message as you're pointing out to send a message to them also as part of
[20:04.560 --> 20:09.200]  the globalist agenda that they've got going here but Alex as I mentioned last
[20:09.200 --> 20:12.880]  week I really believe that the Trump administration somebody in the Department
[20:12.880 --> 20:16.640]  of Justice really needs to take a close look at the bureaucrats who are leaving
[20:16.640 --> 20:21.800]  and see if somebody is using that to start indicting bureaucrats yeah yeah this
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.920]  is they admit they want a post-industrial world they admit they want a car
[20:24.920 --> 20:28.960]  free world they admit they want a tax carbon which is a full attack on
[20:28.960 --> 20:34.040]  humanity itself that's powerful info what else is coming up David well also
[20:34.040 --> 20:37.400]  you're looking at the media gatekeepers that are being shown the door we're gonna
[20:37.400 --> 20:41.080]  look at the details of that we're going to be looking at some information that's
[20:41.080 --> 20:45.240]  developed as I said about Ukraine and we're also going to be taking a look at
[20:45.240 --> 20:49.560]  what Russia is doing you know there's all this talk about Mexico building the
[20:49.560 --> 20:53.240]  wall and helping us to build a wall on the border Russia actually came out and
[20:53.240 --> 20:58.360]  said we will work with Lithuania to put a wall along the border the Lithuanians
[20:58.360 --> 21:00.800]  say they want our wall to protect themselves from the Russians Russian
[21:00.800 --> 21:05.720]  says hey we'll give you the bricks to do that so it's an interesting back and
[21:05.720 --> 21:09.960]  forth in terms of the Cold War that started and of course it also involves
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.160]  the attacks on Donald Trump by the Intelligence Committee and Donald Trump
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.720]  pushback on that today coming right after John Brennan who did a slapdown on
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.040]  Donald Trump over the weekend on the talk shows and said it was outrageous what
[21:23.040 --> 21:26.960]  he did to say that the Intelligence Committee was involved well they were
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.120]  involved we're gonna talk about how we know they were involved in that but then
[21:30.120 --> 21:35.600]  Donald Trump came out and said that he asked is John Brennan the one who leaked
[21:35.600 --> 21:40.280]  that phony dossier on me so he put that out all of his Twitter a lot you're
[21:40.280 --> 21:43.600]  gonna be covering yeah thank you so much David we back towards the end of the
[21:43.600 --> 21:46.400]  hour I'm gonna start rolling into the news I've got in front of me and it's
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.120]  funny he just brought up Brennan that's exactly the clip I want to play but
[21:50.120 --> 21:54.280]  Brennan basically said watch what you say Trump you're endangering the world
[21:54.280 --> 21:57.840]  this is the same Brennan the head of the CIA that reportedly converted to
[21:57.840 --> 22:02.440]  Wahhabism lived in Saudi Arabia more than a decade this is the same guy that's
[22:02.440 --> 22:07.480]  been caught putting out fake intelligence this is the same guy again
[22:07.480 --> 22:12.320]  that has done so much and it was overseeing our government's CIA when
[22:12.320 --> 22:18.120]  the OPM hack happened 20 million names of all of our contacts all of our spies
[22:18.120 --> 22:24.160]  all of our assets a total roll-up of our intelligence this guy is the biggest
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.560]  national security crisis along with Obama and Hillary our world's ever seen
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.880]  this is the guy that oversaw with Hillary and with Obama and with John
[22:32.880 --> 22:38.640]  Kerry the rollout of the al-Qaeda ISIS forces worldwide and then he has the
[22:38.640 --> 22:42.720]  nerve to stick to and claim that if we have a terror attack it's Trump's fault
[22:42.720 --> 22:45.720]  when they're the ones that have opened up our borders they're the ones that have
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.360]  gotten Europe to open up their borders they're the ones that have flooded us
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.640]  with these military-aged men 80% of the quote refugees that are invaders and
[22:52.640 --> 22:56.240]  then they have the nerve to set it up after they brought the sleeper cells
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.400]  into this country and after tens of thousands of service to air missiles
[23:00.400 --> 23:05.960]  are missing given to them in Benghazi and I've had the CIA contractors on with
[23:05.960 --> 23:09.920]  the witnesses of them delivering the missiles four years ago the last straw
[23:09.920 --> 23:13.800]  for our military so when there are terror attacks or when the impads are
[23:13.800 --> 23:17.400]  used you notice they're covering up that it's impads when these airliners are
[23:17.400 --> 23:22.160]  getting shut down because that points right back at them so again everything
[23:22.160 --> 23:26.600]  they do everything they do they blame on us they're getting foreign money they're
[23:26.600 --> 23:30.120]  using foreign money in the election they blame the patriots they're working for
[23:30.120 --> 23:33.360]  foreign powers their globalists destroying our sovereignty they claim we
[23:33.360 --> 23:37.560]  work for foreign powers everything they say about us is really what they're
[23:37.560 --> 23:42.240]  doing here's a clip of John Brown what do you think of his plans his
[23:42.240 --> 23:46.520]  prescriptions what he's saying about these various trouble spots crises
[23:46.520 --> 23:50.800]  challenges around the world well what I think mr. Trump has to understand is
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.720]  that this is more than being about him and it's about the United States and
[23:55.720 --> 23:59.600]  national security and he has to make sure that now that he's going to have the
[23:59.600 --> 24:02.600]  opportunity to do something for national security as opposed to talking and
[24:02.600 --> 24:07.600]  tweeting he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that US
[24:07.600 --> 24:11.480]  national security interests are protected and are advanced and so I am very
[24:11.480 --> 24:15.040]  much hoping that he has some very good people that he is pulled together Jim
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.920]  Mattis Mike Pompeo John Kelly and others I think they are the ones that are
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.680]  going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and
[24:24.680 --> 24:32.760]  not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions spontaneity is not
[24:32.760 --> 24:36.480]  something that protects national security interests and so therefore when
[24:36.480 --> 24:39.640]  he speaks so when he reacts just to make sure he understands that the
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.680]  implications and impact the United States could be profound again it's more
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.880]  than just about mr. Trump and it's about the United States of America so more
[24:49.880 --> 24:54.440]  implications that Trump's an idiot oh these elites are going to talk to him
[24:54.440 --> 24:57.800]  and us down their noses while they leave the borders open while they let
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.320]  diseases pour in while they do everything they can to sabotage and turn off our
[25:01.320 --> 25:05.160]  power plants they're gonna say this is bigger than mr. Trump this is about the
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.600]  United States of America that they're trying to compromise into a global
[25:10.600 --> 25:15.520]  corporate government waving all of our sovereignty via the TPP so they have the
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.600]  nerve to claim he's trying to supplant America and make it all about him
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.320]  that's the new narrative when they're the ones making it all about them
[25:23.320 --> 25:27.880]  creating multinational bodies and unelected multinational boards that
[25:27.880 --> 25:34.200]  they transfer all the power to think about that everything he said was an
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.360]  inversion of reality this is the devil like a snake like people were talking
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.200]  about I mean I mean it is satanic you can't just say everything backwards the
[25:44.200 --> 25:49.980]  way they do I mean this is beyond poetry this is beyond any type of satanic
[25:49.980 --> 25:54.720]  logic I've ever even thought of the way these guys invert reality perfectly I
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.000]  mean Brennan must be some entity from the pit of hell and of course I'm being
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.200]  somewhat sarcastic here but you listen to anything he says and it's a complete
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.000]  lie it's like Clapper saying this the NSA doesn't found anybody and ever has
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  inside the US it was even declassified at that point they've been doing it for
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.880]  decades it's just like you know the press secretary years ago saying there
[26:16.880 --> 26:20.760]  is no drone program years after it was publicly admitted with thousands of
[26:20.760 --> 26:26.240]  strikes Gibbs said it doesn't exist because they're training us to accept
[26:26.240 --> 26:31.520]  lies they're assaulting us with disregard and hate to basically try to
[26:31.520 --> 26:37.400]  mutate our brains now continuing here with some more of the clips let's go
[26:37.400 --> 26:40.920]  ahead and get to this report the short clip from Fox getting into what we were
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.520]  just mentioning the fact that oh Ukraine was involved piling on well I've said
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.040]  that a hundred times the only question is who wasn't the Mexican government
[26:50.040 --> 26:55.160]  piled on Spanish TV one of the biggest powers in this country globalist own was
[26:55.160 --> 26:58.720]  saying don't vote for Trump and was pumping money in the communist Chinese
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.520]  the Saudi Arabians the Pope got involved I mean everybody the EU got involved
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.800]  they all piled on Merkel got involved oh but no the Russians on their TV channel
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.600]  that's only in hotel rooms I mean literally you can't party as almost no
[27:12.600 --> 27:17.440]  viewers in the US on purpose they keep it from getting on TV systems but oh my
[27:17.440 --> 27:21.760]  gosh it's the reason she won not her corruption no no not her falling down
[27:21.760 --> 27:27.800]  oh not that we're sick of the Clintons no the Ruskies here's that Fox clip well
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.760]  this is new there's a new report and it says the Ukrainians were trying to
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.920]  sabotage the Trump campaign you better tell us what this is about
[27:35.920 --> 27:39.480]  this is political it's interesting Ukrainian government officials allegedly
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.240]  tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Donald Trump by publicly
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.160]  questioning a his fitness for office and his ties to Russia and they tried to
[27:49.160 --> 27:53.240]  put out to seven eights and documents that linked his then campaign manager
[27:53.240 --> 27:59.000]  Paul Manafort and Trump to Russia this did not sit well with the Ukrainians who
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.600]  then thought we don't want a guy there appears to be in their minds friendly to
[28:02.600 --> 28:06.080]  Russia you know it never came to anything clearly the Russians are much
[28:06.080 --> 28:10.640]  better at this business than the Ukrainians but Manafort was and
[28:10.640 --> 28:14.960]  ultimately resigned from the campaign but there is a sense out there that
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.880]  Ukraine tried also did some background and research for Clinton aides to see
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.480]  if they could get any more dirt on Trump and his links to Russia so they
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.880]  were wildly unsuccessful while getting stopped by Donald Trump but if you listen
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.440]  to the Democrats the Russians were wildly successful in stopping Hillary
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.320]  Clinton right so that's an odd juxtaposition it is let's see if that
[28:37.320 --> 28:44.200]  story gets play yeah let's see and of course that itself is a huge whitewash
[28:44.200 --> 28:49.800]  the Democrats have turned Ukraine to a giant cash cow for themselves Joe Biden
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.760]  son heads up a company that sells four billion dollars worth of gas a year out
[28:56.760 --> 29:01.680]  of one pipeline they've got several to Western Europe hundreds of millions of
[29:01.680 --> 29:06.680]  dollars pouring in to his company now out of that pretty good you know he just
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.240]  got out of college his dad's the vice president they just hijacked a country
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.800]  with Soros they just overthrew a government that was elected and they
[29:14.800 --> 29:20.600]  turned it around and say the Russians invaded Ukraine kind of like CNN said
[29:20.600 --> 29:27.600]  the Russians invaded Georgia in 2008 or back then I wasn't sophisticated as I
[29:27.600 --> 29:33.320]  am now I'm still not sophisticated I got up 6 a.m. there was the news Russia's
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.840]  invaded Georgia I actually believed until I got to work and people were calling
[29:37.840 --> 29:41.560]  going out that didn't happen that way we'll be right back stay with us I got
[29:41.560 --> 29:50.160]  big news straight ahead on the inauguration we're on the March the
[29:50.160 --> 29:57.240]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.080 --> 30:02.680]  what's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps well according to his
[30:02.680 --> 30:06.280]  press secretary alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the
[30:06.280 --> 30:09.800]  press corps now the corporate media is freaking out as the possibility of
[30:09.800 --> 30:13.280]  Breitbart and invoices being allowed to ask questions we have an article that's
[30:13.280 --> 30:16.640]  up on our website written by Steve Watson and it talks about how this
[30:16.640 --> 30:21.200]  unprecedented move the Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.800]  yesterday that members of the alt media may be allowed to join the White House
[30:25.800 --> 30:29.840]  press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington now this off
[30:29.840 --> 30:33.280]  the chart interest in the Trump administration the president a lack
[30:33.280 --> 30:36.640]  thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a
[30:36.640 --> 30:40.920]  larger capacity Sean Spicer is attributing since 1970 all official

[33:26.760 --> 33:34.200]  it how many times must i explain myself so i can talk to the boss
[33:34.200 --> 33:42.360]  i love it again i really talked about this a lot on yesterday's show with
[33:42.360 --> 33:45.160]  david but i'm going to recap it right now and i get it all the new news is
[33:45.160 --> 33:47.880]  developing that david's coming up at the end of the hour for the balance of
[33:47.880 --> 33:53.880]  transmission and that said there were more than 10 articles i personally
[33:53.880 --> 34:00.840]  had up in my browser from the associated press Reuters AFP yahoo you name it
[34:00.840 --> 34:06.680]  where they have the headlines global elite look to china to save globalism
[34:06.680 --> 34:11.160]  world government crisis davos group admits the rise of nationalism
[34:11.160 --> 34:16.280]  led by trump and the american patriots shakes the global order to its core
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.200]  just a month and a half ago they had new york times headlines
[34:20.200 --> 34:25.480]  is what is globalism is it real and then the whole article was yours truly
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.240]  basically them saying this crazy man believes there's a global bank and
[34:29.240 --> 34:33.640]  cartel that's establishing a planetary government and carbon tax
[34:33.640 --> 34:36.760]  and again they know full well it's all real they're selling that
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.080]  in a giant con to their readers who they know they can't hide it from anymore
[34:41.080 --> 34:48.520]  going does the specific ocean exist so one claims it's made of water
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.360]  so i mean i it's it's bizarre psychological warfare but i guess it's
[34:52.360 --> 34:56.600]  meant to just stonewall people so that they don't know what to say
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.360]  or so that the debate becomes does it exist or not
[35:00.360 --> 35:04.600]  but that isn't working anymore that's the good news
[35:04.600 --> 35:08.280]  it's not working at all that's a very exciting time to be alive now

[38:25.720 --> 38:28.760]  because we hope to fix things and we hope to turn this around but the globalist
[38:28.760 --> 38:34.920]  are trying to cause a civil war just having your concealed carry or
[38:34.920 --> 38:38.040]  other states obviously have laws you just concealed carry open carry without
[38:38.040 --> 38:41.400]  you know any of the regulations on you makes you start thinking about
[38:41.400 --> 38:44.680]  security for the time you need it and that just
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.520]  overall having the general public having body armor this is the type you can
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.280]  wear all the time or carry with you and having firearms and being properly
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.480]  trained in them creates an absolute atmosphere
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.560]  where criminals basically almost become extinct
[38:59.560 --> 39:04.360]  and so it really is our duty as men but also as women
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.880]  to know how to use firearms and to really start getting our minds in a
[39:07.880 --> 39:11.640]  security perspective and again i'm not the know all
[39:11.640 --> 39:14.600]  end all person on this i'm not a peer lecturing anybody

[39:29.000 --> 39:32.600]  affiliates as well now let's get into some good news
[39:32.600 --> 39:35.800]  then we go to the really serious news about anarchists
[39:35.800 --> 39:40.360]  and others and what these sorrows funded groups are planning to do
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.440]  coming up at the inauguration and for me i probably should have led with this
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.840]  story today but so many positive things are happening i didn't get to it yet
[39:48.840 --> 39:52.200]  but there are stories up on info wars dot com
[39:52.200 --> 39:56.600]  with leaked audio of the groups saying they plan to shut things down
[39:56.600 --> 40:00.920]  right away they're they quote one up big bang
[40:00.920 --> 40:04.200]  they admit they want to shut down the inauguration we're going to be there i'm
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.600]  going to be there covering it live i you know and get back to the states today
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.200]  or get back into the main united states today uh i then uh from there
[40:14.200 --> 40:17.720]  obviously leave wednesday right there to dc but
[40:17.720 --> 40:21.240]  info wars in fact i'm just directing the listeners everybody i know david's got a
[40:21.240 --> 40:25.000]  lot of important stuff coming up but we probably should air that leaked audio
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.280]  from shepherd ambulance's article up on info wars dot com
[40:28.280 --> 40:31.880]  we need to get into the fact that they're planning a major destabilization and
[40:31.880 --> 40:35.960]  this ties in to how they're trying to basically have a coup in this country
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.120]  and uh this soft coup needs a civil unrest crisis
[40:40.120 --> 40:45.240]  to get itself off the ground and if you see the dozens and dozens of hollywood
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.080]  movies and if you see the news articles every day
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.880]  and the brainwashing and the public schools and the colleges
[40:51.880 --> 40:56.040]  and just the pushing everywhere that white people are racist out to get black
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.160]  black folks it is an attempt to create an atmosphere
[40:59.160 --> 41:05.640]  where this country is a powder keg or msm can basically then
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.520]  activate uh through the media groups of people to go out and engage in carnage
[41:10.520 --> 41:14.360]  i'm talking about black white hispanic you name it but left his hoodlums
[41:14.360 --> 41:18.600]  to create a civil emergency we've talked about all the preparations for this and
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.520]  michael moore calling for this and we've we've talked about
[41:22.520 --> 41:25.640]  all the different groups that have been pushing it and roseo donald's and
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.600]  everybody else but then you look at congressman john lewis let me pull up
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.880]  some of these articles i've got here lewis comes out
[41:35.880 --> 41:40.920]  as you know last Friday and says trump is illegitimate trump shouldn't be
[41:40.920 --> 41:44.280]  president he's not going to attend the deal he thinks the russians put him in
[41:44.280 --> 41:47.560]  this guy's a fraud so so they're moving to overturn
[41:47.560 --> 41:50.200]  his election they're moving in that direction very very strong
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.600]  trump comes out very nicely and says you want to be worried about collapsing
[41:54.600 --> 41:58.760]  in our cities where your community lives i'm trying to get jobs in there i need
[41:58.760 --> 42:02.120]  your help so that was a really really nice thing to say
[42:02.120 --> 42:05.240]  when somebody's calling you a traitor when somebody's saying you work for the
[42:05.240 --> 42:10.040]  russians i mean that is fighting words okay i mean that is serious
[42:10.040 --> 42:15.080]  defamation how does the media respond and i have stacks of news articles
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.400]  here saying it the new york times comes out and says black communities
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.480]  hurt by his words by trumps mean words to them
[42:23.480 --> 42:29.240]  why would he attack a civil rights icon and if you just type in his name and
[42:29.240 --> 42:33.720]  look at the headlines today in trumps feud with john lewis black's
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.880]  perceive a callous rival so it's about race this guy
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.280]  says he's a risky agent he says work with me to help your communities
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.080]  please i need your help sir this isn't helping
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.920]  oh my god you don't like black people and then and it's all over the news
[42:48.920 --> 42:54.440]  john lewis in 1965 and cell mother's a movie out about him just last year see
[42:54.440 --> 42:59.240]  see he got his head split open by a white state police officer
[42:59.240 --> 43:03.640]  and it's bringing back memories of that for john lewis this is crazy john lewis
[43:03.640 --> 43:06.840]  says you're a russian agent you're not legitimate the voters in this country
[43:06.840 --> 43:09.720]  don't count we're going to ignore you well you
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.200]  shouldn't be president and then trumps says hey i want to work with you come on
[43:14.200 --> 43:17.720]  and they turn it around that he doesn't like black people
[43:17.720 --> 43:23.480]  i mean folks this is a next level of disinfo
[43:23.480 --> 43:26.920]  this is crazy listen to this one the boston globe
[43:26.920 --> 43:31.080]  donald trump picked the wrong foil and civil rights hero
[43:31.080 --> 43:37.160]  john lewis oh my gosh on mlk weekend
[43:37.160 --> 43:41.160]  picks fights with civil rights hero john lewis
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.120]  did you hear that it was on mlk weekend club picked the fight did you hear it
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.360]  folks it wasn't john lewis on friday who chose to launch the attack so they
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.920]  could say it was on martin lewiser king notice how they set this up
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.160]  trump isn't thinking like that you're a risky you didn't get elected you're a
[43:57.160 --> 44:00.760]  fraud you shouldn't be in office blah blah blah know what you come to your
[44:00.760 --> 44:03.160]  inauguration biggest insult you could put out
[44:03.160 --> 44:06.200]  trumps like i'd like to work with you how about you do that and help your
[44:06.200 --> 44:08.280]  community instead of sitting there saying stuff like this
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.360]  this isn't helping that's a that's the tweet totally reasonable totally nice
[44:12.360 --> 44:17.000]  nicer than i'd be oh my gosh on martin lewis the king
[44:17.000 --> 44:24.440]  he was me right it's crazy i have had two white people
[44:24.440 --> 44:27.640]  mobbing on vacation walk over to the young people and say i was nice to
[44:27.640 --> 44:31.080]  listen to your show and i said okay why don't you listen anymore because i always
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.760]  want to tell you and and and i said well you black lives matter i don't know
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.000]  why you don't like black people and i said okay so let me guess in both cases
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.520]  you go to college and you're all inculcated into that that you know that
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.200]  your worth is admitting you're a bad person i said i'm sorry i've done anything
[44:46.200 --> 44:49.160]  bad to black people i love black people i mean i judge them just like any other
[44:49.160 --> 44:53.320]  person and most black people see through all this control but i mean this is my
[44:53.320 --> 44:56.520]  means fine dislike me well and he's like well
[44:56.520 --> 45:00.920]  one guy's like well what about what the cops do to people gather bad cops bro
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.400]  go after him but statistically it's super rare is the police state wrong
[45:05.400 --> 45:09.000]  our rights invalid some absolutely i'm the guy that's written books on it
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.400]  but i mean when soros wants us to have a civil war and burn down things and kill
[45:13.400 --> 45:17.000]  cops i'm not going to be part of that i want to fix the country not burn it
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.160]  down so it's definitely the new religion
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.760]  uh in this country and it's completely out of control
[45:24.760 --> 45:29.160]  now coming up the next hour um night's got a lot of big reports and a lot of
[45:29.160 --> 45:31.800]  things you'll be breaking down but there are two john bound reports that meant
[45:31.800 --> 45:34.840]  to get to in the summer but i've got more i've got a cover so i can't get to it
[45:34.840 --> 45:39.080]  yet i really want to get those reports aired one of them is on the
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.840]  coup d'etat they're trying it's trump very powerful four minutes long
[45:42.840 --> 45:47.000]  the other deals with shadow government and missing nukes
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.400]  and things like that very powerful but both those are going to be posted
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.840]  to info wars dot com in one article right now
[45:54.840 --> 45:58.360]  uh we should think of a powerful headline like special reports
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.880]  breakdown uh missing nuclear weapons threat inside
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.520]  usa uh you know is it a threat to to to trump inauguration
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.400]  maybe something like that and then under it uh put links to the missing minot
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.760]  nukes and into our report of dies in the missing nukes
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.120]  and mainstream media may take debate on this and say it's fake news when it
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.400]  isn't they'll probably even say my not didn't happen
[46:21.400 --> 46:25.960]  uh but i always wish they'd sent the fbi or anybody over my office to say
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.040]  well you know where's your nuke story you made that up boy but i didn't know we
[46:30.040 --> 46:34.280]  didn't make that up notice that's why lizzie graham came out
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.040]  the same afternoon freaking out this is a warning of nukes missing and and and
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.960]  charleston being nuked but they panicked in case those suckers
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.440]  did go off they'd have a cover story claiming that it was al-qaeda
[46:46.440 --> 46:49.080]  remember that was when the military was refusing
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.600]  to to back the takeover of syria for al-qaeda
[46:52.600 --> 46:56.760]  it's when the soft coup against obama was happening as a countercoup
[46:56.760 --> 47:00.680]  and then the missing nukes would have got dug up put on 18 wheelers the police
[47:00.680 --> 47:03.400]  freaked out there was an hour long confrontation
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.160]  the base commander came out and ordered them to let the nukes into 18 wheelers
[47:07.160 --> 47:12.360]  rollout and of course where do i have that information
[47:12.360 --> 47:15.640]  now there's nobody challenge me on it because they better not
[47:15.640 --> 47:18.120]  just like i told you he'll the secret service told us hillary clinton's
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.440]  falling down all the time a month later it happened
[47:20.440 --> 47:24.200]  i was from the secret service okay and i'm not going to give us this other
[47:24.200 --> 47:27.800]  information but let me tell you the government knows
[47:27.800 --> 47:32.760]  and i'm just going to leave it at that so this is a real issue people keep
[47:32.760 --> 47:35.480]  asking me will there be a tactical nuke at this event
[47:35.480 --> 47:38.360]  will there be a tactical nuke i haven't really brought that up because i don't
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.960]  think there will be okay because they've got devices that can test for them that
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.120]  can look for them if a nuke does go off we know it's the globalist
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.560]  we know how they have the means they have the history they've been the ones
[47:49.560 --> 47:53.880]  that have been pushing to remove trump they've been the ones that have been
[47:53.880 --> 47:57.400]  pushing to stop all this but here's the good news globalism's in crisis
[47:57.400 --> 48:00.680]  world government's in crisis they've gone from denying this whole world
[48:00.680 --> 48:04.920]  government exists to now openly admitting it now
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.280]  continuing ladies and gentlemen we're going to see biker's for trump and
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.800]  other great groups there to counter the communists of the anarchists and the
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.080]  other george soros comebacks they're demoralized
[48:17.080 --> 48:20.760]  they're a joke soros's clause i retired his his quizzling
[48:20.760 --> 48:26.120]  uh... joke of a son uh deranged son uh he is taking over the empire
[48:26.120 --> 48:29.480]  uh so we're seeing a real degeneration here in their system
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.560]  and just like cleveland we outnumbered him five to one every patriot who's
[48:33.560 --> 48:36.200]  always said i want to march on washingtoner
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.560]  but we politically marched on it peacefully when everybody to come and be
[48:39.560 --> 48:43.320]  peaceful and be in dc especially if you're on the east coast
[48:43.320 --> 48:45.960]  in georgia or the carolinas or virginia
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.240]  or mariland or new york or any of those done
[48:49.240 --> 48:54.600]  new jersey there is absolutely no excuse folks you have got to come there you
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.960]  have got even if you stay 50 miles away as all the hotels are checked out
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.880]  you need to come to this and be part of history because everybody wanted this
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.400]  march on washington we've done it it's happening
[49:05.400 --> 49:09.160]  it doesn't mean everything's perfect but so much is going on that's so good
[49:09.160 --> 49:12.440]  already the i m f is saying now our economic outlook is good when we're
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.520]  saying it was bad just a year ago already hundreds of billions are coming
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.680]  back with a trillion plus in the stock market uh... chrysler announcing

[49:23.560 --> 49:28.760]  u.s. and how does obama respond in his last week now four days left
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.240]  criminal indictments criminal probes of of heads of companies four billion
[49:33.240 --> 49:36.600]  dollar fines on u.s. companies to shut
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.200]  them down and to stop them moving back into the united states
[49:40.200 --> 49:43.800]  i mean you think about the open willful
[49:43.800 --> 49:47.800]  economic sabotage that is taking place
[49:47.800 --> 49:51.640]  in an organized crime against this republic it is

[54:18.280 --> 54:21.560]  you just heard alex jones live on the road he's going to be going to the
[54:21.560 --> 54:24.600]  inauguration later this week we're going to have
[54:24.600 --> 54:28.040]  a very long marathon coverage of the inauguration starting
[54:28.040 --> 54:32.440]  early in the morning and going till late at night on friday as well
[54:32.440 --> 54:36.440]  as alex jones being there live and of course we're going to talk about
[54:36.440 --> 54:40.040]  the concern of the mainstream press the
[54:40.040 --> 54:44.520]  mainstream gatekeepers are now freaking out because they're being shown the
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.640]  door but it's actually an enlargement from this
[54:47.640 --> 54:51.240]  room where they had only 49 people i guess it'll be the fabulous 50
[54:51.240 --> 54:54.680]  of the media elite only allowed there they're saying hey we're going to set up
[54:54.680 --> 54:58.920]  something where we can be more inclusive but they don't want that
[54:58.920 --> 55:02.600]  essentially they've got a guild a union that is
[55:02.600 --> 55:05.080]  pushing back pretty hard against the trump administration
[55:05.080 --> 55:08.040]  we got a lot of news that's coming up today of course we have today is martin
[55:08.040 --> 55:10.920]  luther king day many of you are off of work today and
[55:10.920 --> 55:15.880]  we look at this plan by john louis i think it was a plan to try to
[55:15.880 --> 55:18.760]  further this racism narrative you know they've got
[55:18.760 --> 55:22.280]  donald trump is a russian agent donald trump is a doff hitler donald trump is a
[55:22.280 --> 55:25.720]  racist and so forth and so on all the things that they've called you
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.960]  the deplorables who voted for him but they tried to run this through on
[55:29.960 --> 55:32.840]  martin luther king day and of course today donald trump had planned to go to
[55:32.840 --> 55:36.280]  the new african-american museum in washington dc
[55:36.280 --> 55:39.880]  they put out word he was not welcome i guess so that's been cancelled
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.880]  but we're going to take a look at how louis's plan is unraveling
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.560]  just like barack obama's executive orders will be unraveling
[55:47.560 --> 55:50.200]  in about a week's time you're going to see a lot of those gone
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.080]  but before we do i want to talk about i want to throw to this uh john bound
[55:55.080 --> 56:00.760]  report a trump coup is the maximum moment of crisis here's that report from
[56:00.760 --> 56:04.840]  john bound country is in an all-out civil war
[56:04.840 --> 56:08.360]  against foreign multinational banks that believe they own and control it
[56:08.360 --> 56:11.960]  they're alive with the communist chinese the e u bureaucrats that have hijacked
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.920]  europe the saudi arabian islamic caliphate this this this is truly world
[56:16.920 --> 56:21.400]  war four its economic is cultural and if you get military any day we're truly
[56:21.400 --> 56:25.480]  seeing the sad depths to which our nation has sunk the criminal rogue elements
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.240]  of the cia led by brennan clapper and others
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.360]  a lot of the american people to our faces constantly you know told us that the
[56:32.360 --> 56:35.560]  united states is not americans period that doesn't exist remember that that was
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.480]  what clapper told everybody and now they've come out with this fake dossier
[56:39.480 --> 56:42.840]  that when i saw it two and a half three days ago i went and i saw this before
[56:42.840 --> 56:45.960]  fortan had this the big hacker group over a year ago
[56:45.960 --> 56:51.000]  and was passing him around as a joke it's misspelled it's it's it's got fake
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.160]  names wrong names it's a classic setup like the one carl rove
[56:55.160 --> 56:58.040]  famously reportedly gave to dan rather to mess up his whole
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.640]  texas national guard story as a poison pill into the rest of story that was
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.280]  actually true i'm not a fan of dan rather overall but compared to
[57:04.280 --> 57:08.760]  rachel manow or other cia operatives like anerson cooper he's an angel but
[57:08.760 --> 57:12.760]  instead of them backing off when trump came out and said your fake news
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.360]  and time water stock dipping and people really waking up
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.560]  and even cnn had to admit the trump nailed the press conference and knocked it
[57:19.560 --> 57:23.240]  out of parker grand slam instead of that they have tripled down and anderson
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.800]  cooper and everybody else are actually defending ppg this is just so incredible
[57:27.800 --> 57:31.880]  totally and completely made up now folks are asking is this from hackers for
[57:31.880 --> 57:35.240]  chan and their spoofing board their famous trolling board the king of the
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.760]  trolls or is this opposition research well it's both this is
[57:38.760 --> 57:41.960]  opposition research mark guys correctly called it two days ago
[57:41.960 --> 57:45.560]  this is opposition research where they just cook up a bunch of lies and a bunch
[57:45.560 --> 57:47.880]  of disinformation and start floating it out there
[57:47.880 --> 57:51.400]  then got floated on the web back before the republican primaries
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.760]  over a year ago we're talking this happened like 16 months ago this happened
[57:54.760 --> 57:58.920]  in late 2015 this is just incredible was the first time this stuff started
[57:58.920 --> 58:03.400]  floating around the sky is the limit and let me assure everybody i said this a
[58:03.400 --> 58:06.520]  month ago got picked up by a lot of different publications you can simply
[58:06.520 --> 58:11.000]  google alex jones cia planning to kill donald trump now the
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.720]  media kind of took what i said in the context i said the fact that they're

[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:49.560]  delivering on in space and he has committed to the american people who
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.960]  submitted to me i'm gonna leave it that's the media doesn't have another
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.480]  heyday with it that he's going to deliver or basically
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:59.160]  die trying he is going all out and that's why we're seeing
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.760]  this unprecedented move this unprecedented move
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:07.800]  right now to disrupt the inauguration and to actually try to sell the american
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:11.080]  people an overthrow of trump the establishment the globalists are trying
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.040]  to convince themselves they can try some coup
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:17.000]  remember in the last month i've been warning you
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.880]  that they're trying to launch a continued government
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:23.960]  cog basically operation valkyrie they use cog
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:28.360]  in 1944 to try to kill hitler their continued government system
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:31.880]  but it backfired well they've turned that around now acting like trump is
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:35.720]  illegitimate they're trying to sell cog through rogue groups in the government
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:38.840]  to convince them that what they're doing is okay and normal
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:42.200]  and i've said the left is openly behind the scenes calling for
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:46.600]  martial law and the arrest of trump or the blocking of trump and then a quote
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:49.640]  new election that's why homeland security last week announced the
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:53.720]  federalization and total control of elections people said well he'll be
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.680]  gone in 10 days or so you know last week or 12 days
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:59.560]  whatever it was but see not if they suspend this
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:03.000]  election and say it was fraudulent they're seriously thinking about it now
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  rosy o'donnell is one of the top people in the new york hollywood scene she
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.600]  she's a has been but but but she's a darling with the elites and she has put
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:13.480]  out an article in yahoo she has come out
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.240]  and openly said that she wants the election suspended because she's a
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:19.960]  quote russian agent until that can be cleared up of course
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:22.840]  will never be cleared up the ones running with this info and that she wants
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:28.440]  martial law in place now cnn just three weeks ago had a
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:32.200]  talking point that they put out that i put a lot of attention on but they said
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:37.320]  civil emergency national emergency i didn't talk to my sources yet cnn
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:40.680]  we also have sources inside abc news i'm gonna stop right there
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.120]  and they said that they are seriously wargaming just like they got caught
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:48.280]  before the gulf war both times in 1991 and 2003
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.360]  wargaming the attacks with the exact targets drilled beforehand
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:57.080]  with the seamless integration of uh federal government pentagon media
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:00.120]  through the media now you see it actually materializing
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:05.640]  i first began to tell you over a month ago that cnn abc and others were going
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:10.840]  to start promoting the idea of a civil emergency a national emergency
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:16.120]  a national security emergency a continuity of government emergency or a
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.960]  c o g now under a c o g you have a president was
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:23.000]  actually a foreign agent that was confirmed you have to have congressional
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.280]  emergency hearings and things like that for it to be constitutional the shadow
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.200]  government the deep state that is publicly attacking from now
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:33.480]  doesn't tend to go that route because they are the deep state that they are
[1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:36.280]  actually the foreigners they're actually the globalists they're actually the
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.800]  people of the federal trade of the government
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:41.400]  that are overthrowing our republic trump is returning the republic trump is
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:45.640]  trying to disrupt the globalist operation to impoverish us and make us
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:49.880]  vassal slaves i was told over a month ago by sources inside
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  cnn and inside abc and others they said alex you are dead on
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:57.800]  we're up here wargaming civil unrest getting around the
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:01.640]  inauguration trump being arrested uh trump being
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:05.000]  indicted the news announcing he's a russian spy
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.400]  basically overthrowing the president putting it into a constitutional crisis
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:13.400]  and a national emergency being declared it's been intensifying with these
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:16.920]  rogue intelligence agencies coming out with reports that russians turned off
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:20.120]  the east coast power or the russians plan to turn off the east coast or that
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:24.120]  they had a laptop and then okay the laptop didn't even have the software on
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:27.320]  it it's all totally made up we've seen hoax after hoax after hoax after
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:33.160]  hoax
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:59.640]  sit here and take it anymore
[1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:02.520]  what's trump going to do with the hostile press corps well according to his
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.040]  press secretary alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:08.600]  press corps now the corporate media is freaking out
[1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:12.120]  as the possibility of breitbart and invoores being allowed to ask questions
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:15.240]  we have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:19.320]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move the trump's incoming
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.400]  white house press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt
[1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:26.840]  media may be allowed to join the white house press corps and take part in
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.160]  press conferences in washington now this off the chart interest in the trump
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:34.920]  administration the president elect thinking that he's going to relocate
[1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:37.480]  the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:41.640]  sean spicer is attributing since 1970 all official press briefings have been
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:45.720]  held in the james s brady room looks like he's moving them over one and based
[1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:49.800]  on cnn's performance last week where jemma costa was called out by
[1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:53.880]  president elect trump it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press

[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.680]  your host on this martin luther king day january the 16th 2017 and of course
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:34.440]  as part of martin luther king i believe it was celebration of that i believe it
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.400]  was an effort by john louis and chuck todd to try to revive this
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:43.480]  trump is a racist if you voted for him your racist meme that's going on
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:47.080]  that is coming apart his idea that
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:50.600]  trump is not legitimate trying to recycle yet again
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:53.960]  the russians did it the hack and everything that is all coming apart
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:57.400]  even the idea that they're going to boycott some of them are going to boycott
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:00.520]  you know even hillary clinton and bill clinton are going to boycott the
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.960]  inauguration and so we've got bernie sanders now
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:07.880]  saying that he will attend the inauguration he says saying that the
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:12.440]  trump presidency is illegitimate is nothing but words he said those are
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  just words that bernie sanders right now what my what my job is is going
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:19.560]  beyond media conflicts the words to say that donald trump
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:23.080]  among other things told the american people he would not cut social security
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.280]  and so forth and so in other words he said i want to focus on policy
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:28.680]  i want to make sure that donald trump does the things that he said he's going
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:31.320]  to do yeah that's right if you want to have a discussion about policy would
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:34.040]  you agree with donald trump will you disagree with donald trump that's fair
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:37.480]  game that's always fair game and of course there are areas
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:41.320]  for bernie sanders says hey i agree with donald trump on tpp
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.240]  and he may not agree with donald trump on tpp for exactly the same reasons but
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.680]  they both agree that it's not a good thing and they can do a better deal and
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:51.240]  they may have a disagreement as to how that final
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:54.280]  trade agreement would look with various nations but the bottom line is that he
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:56.840]  would work with donald trump as i pointed out yesterday when talked about
[1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:02.120]  john lewis john lewis opposed nafta and he also opposed
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:06.040]  the nsa when george bush was doing it but when brock
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:10.600]  obama did it he didn't have a problem with the nsa
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:14.760]  john lewis also opposed the 2000 year 2000
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:18.440]  china trade agreement so those are areas where he could work with donald
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.120]  trump but instead he's chosen to play the race card he's chosen to try to
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:26.120]  double down and delegitimize the trump presidency unlike
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:29.000]  bernie sanders you know bernie sanders has a good point here
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.360]  in saying that he's not going to come back and
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:35.720]  and call it a legitimate i think that he understands
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:42.280]  that the mainstream media hacked the primaries for hillary the dnc hacked the
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.160]  primaries for hillary why don't we ever hear anybody talk about that
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:49.480]  you know breitbart has a story out was hillary clinton's nomination legitimate
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:52.760]  was she a legitimate candidate and here's a person
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:55.720]  who violated national security in so many different ways
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:11:00.440]  she should have been facing trial not an election
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:03.640]  that's truly the ideas and they said here's six
[1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:09.960]  reasons why she was not legitimate as a nominee they said first of all the
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:13.960]  democrats rigged the primary we saw that with the the leak of that information
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.560]  that's what they don't want you to focus on this is what was exposed
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:21.160]  and so they create this conspiracy theory about the russians
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:24.360]  so that you don't look at that you don't look at their super delegate system you
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:28.120]  don't look at the money machine you don't look at the media
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:31.720]  hacking it for hillary what are you know what about the russians you didn't prove
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:35.480]  the russians that but we do have proof that the media colluded with hillary so
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:39.000]  they rigged the nomination against bernie sanders
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:45.240]  and of course they broke and bent the law to keep her running for president
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:49.560]  instead of putting her on trial that's the key thing that you need to take away
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:53.000]  from all of this so of course it was the democrats who
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.960]  hacked the nomination away from bernie sanders that's one of the things a lot
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:59.320]  of people were upset about one of the reasons why she lost
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:02.520]  but then it's as also interesting as we've got coming up from
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:09.400]  martin luther king day uh john lewis makes this failed attempt to label trump
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:13.640]  as a racist to martin luther king's niece came out today
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.520]  and is reported by american thinker i voted for trump she said
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:23.080]  as alveda king we've interviewed her multiple times here on the alex joneshow
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:28.440]  alex has had her on several times because she's a person of principle
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:32.840]  she's not a political hack so that's the difference
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:37.560]  john lewis and when he was 25 years old
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:41.640]  he did a lot of things that made him a legend in the civil rights
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:46.680]  movement did some good things but now here we are after 30 years as a
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:50.360]  congressman what has he done that's donald trump's point
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:54.040]  and we're going to talk about some of the allegations that
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:58.760]  this hero turned hack has made but let's take a look first at the statement from
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:02.440]  martin luther king's niece she is a pro-life leader that's one of the
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:05.160]  reasons we have her on here she understands that abortion
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:07.960]  is really targeted towards a black community that was admitted by margaret
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:12.040]  sayger that has been the focus of the abortion industry
[1:13:12.040 --> 1:13:16.280]  and so she serves as director of civil rights for the unborn
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:20.360]  as an african-american outreach for priests for life also the gospel life
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:24.280]  ministries she says she hopes that mr trump will be a pro-life president
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:26.920]  again somebody who will work with him on issues
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:31.960]  just like we saw robert kennedy jr say he would work with him on the issue of
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:35.080]  vaccines they have profound disagreements on a multitude of issues but
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:38.840]  again coming together on issues in which they agree
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:45.480]  now when donald trump pushed back against the criticisms the
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.160]  illegitimate criticisms of john lewis and said
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.280]  you need to take care of your own district you need so to accomplish
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:56.360]  something one of the things that people came back and they said
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:00.040]  we had michael steele come back and say of course a black former chair
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.040]  of the rnc came back to it don't even go there not even allowed to talk about
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.800]  this guy he's a hero ram paul said but wait a minute
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.600]  we're not attacking his legacy is that we're just pointing out that he's
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:16.520]  acting now as a political hack 50 years later so you don't get immunity for
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:19.400]  life for doing something like that just because
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.000]  you save somebody's life over here pulling them out of
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.480]  when they're drowning pulling them out of the canal
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:28.360]  doesn't give you license to go down and rob a bank later on
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:31.560]  see that that you don't get it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:36.360]  even for politicians so here's six false accusations by john lewis hero
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:39.640]  turnhack according to a bright part i think that's pretty good remember
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:42.520]  when john mccain and sarah paleon were running for office
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:46.760]  see if this sounds familiar he said senator mccain and j governor paleon
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:49.160]  are sowing the seeds of hatred and division
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.320]  is it reading off of the same script he says he's going to suggest that the
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:57.240]  republican ticket created a climate for racist
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:00.760]  terrorism that was what he said when mccain and
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:05.160]  paleon were running in 2008 2010 he falsely claimed the tea party
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:09.720]  demonstrators said the n-word during an anti obama care rally remember that
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:13.240]  we played that back and forth there was no evidence of that 2012 he falsely
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.480]  accused republicans of wanting to take americans
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:19.720]  back to gem crow he gave a speech at the dnc
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:23.160]  convention in charlotte that year and he said
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:26.920]  he recalled all the times that he'd worked as a freedom rider
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:30.440]  and later on in 2016 he falsely compared donald trump
[1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:34.920]  to george wallace he said again you remind me of the people who let the dogs
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:38.600]  loose on the demonstrators and yesterday i played a clip
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:41.960]  of a report i did two years ago about the southern poverty law center
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.800]  focusing on how morris d is the founder of southern poverty law center
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:49.400]  was not really focused on civil rights he was focused on making a lot of money
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:54.440]  we call it profits of hate p-r-o-f-i-t-s and what we did was we played the
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:58.360]  segment in there in montgomery where the freedom riders who were
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:02.040]  trying to get the federal government to enforce laws that they had and that had
[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:05.720]  been found constitutional by the supreme court against
[1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:09.560]  segregating interstate bus transportation that's what the freedom
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:13.480]  riders were about they were going to have mixed buses they were going to drive
[1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:17.000]  them through the south drive them up into washington dc and as i got into
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.960]  montgomery alabama the cooklex clan and a bunch of white
[1:16:19.960 --> 1:16:24.280]  races came after them beat uh pull pull these guys off the bus
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.680]  beat them burn the buses and morris d's the guy who founded the southern poverty
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:32.840]  law center who's always finding the kkk and hate
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:38.040]  speech everywhere this guy defended the cooklex clan guy
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:41.480]  then he decided he could make even more money doing mass mailings
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:45.320]  and then eventually he got back into the racism business
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:49.480]  but on the other side and see that's the way the democrat party works
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:52.360]  so party of demagogues there you go see that right there that guy on the ground
[1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:55.400]  if you're looking at this video the guy that's being kicked that wasn't his
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.400]  defendant that guy was his defendant uh that was kicking him there
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:03.000]  so that's the way these guys work they can flip on a dime
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.720]  you know they just look at where the demographics are flowing and what they
[1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:09.400]  want to do and it's like okay well we were pro cooklex clan last year
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:12.680]  let's become anti cooklex clan this year that's the way
[1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:16.680]  uh robert bird in west virginia worked that's the way the clinton's worked
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:19.640]  that's the way these guys are working because they focus
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:24.600]  on racial identity all the time it is truly the politics of racism that you
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:29.320]  see in the democrat party and finally let's not forget that in 2016
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:33.560]  john lewis said that bernie sanders played absolutely no role in the civil
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:36.440]  rights movement so he doesn't have a problem with people like
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:40.280]  morsy his southern poverty law center but because he's a political hack and
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:43.720]  because he was working for the clinton's he came out and said that bernie
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:46.840]  sanders wasn't involved in the civil rights movement remember that
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:50.680]  bernie sanders came out with the photographs showing him involved in the
[1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:53.400]  civil rights movement that was a guy who really did
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:57.000]  work in the civil rights movement but of course he was just
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:01.880]  ignored now one of the reports that alex was talking about in the last
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:05.720]  hour we have a article up on info wars dot com
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:09.720]  leaked audio left us plot chaos at an inauguration
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:13.000]  planned to kick off with a bang now the audio on that is
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.640]  not easy to hear on a radio broadcast so i'm just going to tell you
[1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:21.880]  what they said on that but we are going to play you a report
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:24.840]  uh that came out from project veritas today as well
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:29.000]  so we got multiple people that are investigating these plots to do
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:34.360]  underhanded things to harm people who are trying to celebrate the peaceful
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:37.880]  transition of power due to an election in this
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:40.440]  country they don't like that these are the bill
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:43.880]  airs people the communist party of america people the people that are
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:48.040]  behind that disrupt j-20 group this bill airs in the space
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:51.800]  saying it's they're doing the same thing even though these guys may be 70
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:56.120]  years old like bill airs it's what he was doing with the
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:01.080]  weathermen decades and decades ago of course he realized that it was far more
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:05.960]  effective to get involved in education to get involved in schools to
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:09.880]  propagandize our children to use the government educational
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:13.880]  institutions as a way to get these kids early and
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.480]  brainwash them and remember it was bill airs and the weathermen
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:23.000]  who popularized white skin privilege what are our children taught at every
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.400]  level now that's what they're taught so bill airs
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:30.600]  is the guy who is really teaching her kids folks
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:35.560]  because and he's far more dangerous in the educational system than he ever was
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:39.320]  when he was hurling bombs in government buildings for which he somehow
[1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:43.160]  escaped punishment now when we come back we're gonna play we're gonna
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:46.200]  tell you what that leaked audio had and we're also going to play you some of the
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:50.200]  project veritas report he's going to be with us for part two tomorrow they're

[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:12.200]  as the possibility of Breitbart and invoores being allowed to ask questions
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:15.320]  we have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:18.840]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move the trump's
[1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:22.200]  incoming white house press secretary revealed yesterday
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:25.960]  that members of the alt media may be allowed to join the white house press

[1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:47.240]  room looks like he's moving them over one and based on sienna's performance
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:51.000]  last week where jama costa was called out by president alex trump
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:54.280]  it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps

[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:17.000]  talking to mark dice you remember last week in the wake of the golden
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.880]  globes that had happened uh it was exactly a week ago
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:23.800]  the wake of the golden globes that had happened on sunday that fake
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:28.200]  uh movie award ceremony ended it truly is fake i mean look at what
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:32.200]  other people have said about look at what the hollywood form press association
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:34.520]  is there's a small group of people kind of like the
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:37.880]  washington press corps that is now bellie aching about having
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:42.920]  uh presumably lost their position of privilege and elitism
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:46.120]  saying that they're going to have to mix with the hoypoy you know while it was
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.160]  a week ago it was hollywood that was screaming loud
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:52.920]  about that and of course the hoax that
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:56.680]  meryl streep bought into and helped to propagate about the fact that
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:01.000]  donald trump had singled out a reporter who was disabled
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.560]  and mark dice completely destroyed that in a great video we played that a week
[1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:08.520]  ago we want to talk to mark dice about that also about a
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.040]  a video that he had about abortion where he asked people questions
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:16.920]  on the streets of california about abortion very very good video so we're
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.640]  going to have mark dice joining us in the next hour and we're also going to be
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:23.320]  playing that special report from alex jones about what might happen at the

[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.440]  tactical nukes we have seen ample evidence
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:34.120]  and of course advertisements from people like bill ares and others saying we want
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:37.160]  to disrupt the inauguration as much as we can
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:41.800]  so they want to and now we've got undercover
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:45.480]  investigations done by project veritas the first part was released today
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:49.240]  part two is going to be released tomorrow and james okif is going to join us
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:52.920]  to talk about that but first i want to play part one
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:56.120]  that was released today this is part of project veritas
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:00.680]  infiltrating some of these groups to say that they're going to disrupt to block
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:05.240]  to release in some cases very smelly substances to
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:08.680]  make people have to evacuate the rooms that's what they're talking about
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:14.040]  doing here's the undercover investigation from project veritas
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:24.760]  yeah and this stuff is like it's very efficient
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:28.520]  very very smelly lasts a long time and a little of it goes a long way
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.800]  and i know i'm trying to think through how to get all this pretty good
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.680]  there's usually a piece of like a little metal or a piece of glass and a liquid
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:40.360]  and it'll blow this is undercover video of potential
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:44.200]  criminal acts being planned these organizers and activists are talking
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:47.800]  about setting off butyric acid into the ventilation system
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:51.640]  and setting off fire alarm sprinklers at a trump inaugural ball
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:55.400]  later this week what you're about to see is part one of our hidden camera
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:59.800]  investigation into the groups and organizations that seek to cause havoc
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:04.120]  and violence at the trump inauguration in washington dc
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:07.720]  hi ronald reagan hi george herbert walker book
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:12.040]  preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states

[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:27.720]  out of my way in regards the next four years we are going to fight Trump and
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:31.960]  everything he stands for with no quarter ass no quarter give him no
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:35.720]  mercy of any kind throw them all under the bus
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:39.960]  i mean to get up i like the idea of the goal being that they have to pull the
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:43.400]  inauguration inside be prepared to help make the
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:46.360]  inauguration a giant cluster
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:52.120]  shortly after the election we started getting tips that radical groups are
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:55.240]  planning to derail president elect trump's inauguration
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:59.320]  perhaps even trying to shut down the city of washington dc
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:02.840]  various groups some old some new have gathered together under the
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.720]  disrupt j-20 umbrella progress unity fund workers world party
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:11.960]  americans take action answer coalition and many more
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:15.720]  today's investigation focuses on these guys from the dc
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:32.200]  anti-fascist coalition
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.040]  early on one of our journalists was sent an email inviting him to a planning
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:38.200]  meeting the discussion centered around
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:41.800]  disrupting the deplorable a big pro trump
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:46.440]  inaugural ball scheduled the night before the inauguration
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:53.800]  it was at this meeting where we met scott green
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:59.880]  luke coon and collin dunne they were very gung-ho and clearly well versed in
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:03.720]  the dark arts of sabotage we already know what we're all there for
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:06.920]  so we won't be so okay so this is we don't have to use the word deplorable at
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:09.960]  all yes and things like that so just in case there
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:14.280]  are yahoos in there through emails another meeting was set up at the
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.040]  infamous comet ping pong pizza restaurant in northwest
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:21.400]  washington dc
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:36.280]  the deplorable is being held here at the national press club
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:40.440]  in downtown washington dc the plan set off
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:45.720]  beaturic acid stink bombs forcing everyone to evacuate the premises
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:57.000]  yeah and this stuff is like it's very efficient it's very very
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:07.560]  it really lasts a long time
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:16.040]  all right it's kind of hard to hear that with the crowd noise there but what
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:19.640]  they're saying is a little bit of this goes a long way it's very efficient
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:23.080]  and we're going to set that off now we will play uh we'll have the rest of that
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.480]  posted on info wars dot com and again
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:28.760]  james o' keith is going to be joining us tomorrow to discuss
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:32.120]  not only this but also part two that will be released
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:35.160]  tomorrow it was also interesting over the weekend
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:40.120]  we saw these stories that came out came out first one uh friday night we had
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:44.280]  washington post saying that donald trump or first it said that was going to be
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:48.120]  obama who was firing the head of the general of the
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.560]  district of columbia's national guard and that he was going to be fired
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:57.000]  at 1201 right after the minute after donald trump became president this
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.640]  guy was going to be fired and that seemed to be unusual
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.000]  they said it was obama and so people looked at that said well what are they
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.080]  are they planning something here they had dc city councilman said
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.680]  that's uh that's kind of strange to do that at that point time and they said
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:14.760]  well no it wasn't obama trump wanted to do that because he doesn't like this guy
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:19.880]  and he wants to get him out right away and then they walked all of this stuff
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:23.000]  back in addition so we wound up finally
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.920]  the uh where this story got left washington post changed the story
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:30.760]  on trump firing the dc national guard they basically took it out
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:34.680]  after raising everybody's eyebrows they point out in bright bar to make this
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:38.040]  unusual decision so there's a lot of things that are very unusual about what's
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:43.080]  going on here but the bottom line folks is that these people
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:46.200]  the disrupt j20 the people who are planning to try to disrupt the
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:49.960]  inauguration of the same people who have been trying to disrupt
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:53.640]  the election who tried to disrupt the nomination
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:57.000]  process remember they said no no no we don't want to have uh
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.320]  donald trump get nominated we're going to try to organize a revolt
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:05.960]  with the electors to overrule what the people have chosen during the primaries
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:09.160]  then they said we're going to try to organize a revolt with the electoral
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:13.080]  college to overrule what the people wanted isn't it interesting
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:17.080]  that these communists always say that they
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:20.680]  represent the people the masses of the people when they really don't
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:24.840]  they have nothing but contempt for the will of the people contempt for the
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:27.560]  rule of law contempt for democracy and you know
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:30.760]  when i look at issues that i'm concerned about
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:37.160]  i've never been a fan of demonstrations because of exactly what you see there
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:40.760]  it brings out the worst elements on either side
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:44.600]  and it turns into these types of crystal knock things these types of chicago
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:48.200]  convention things i mean this is what this is all about folks these are
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:52.520]  people who like to go through the streets just aching to create a riot
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:56.520]  aching to burn a town down aching to loot businesses go through the black
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.080]  section of town and burn it and loot the businesses because they
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.840]  said that uh there was an issue with the black man and the police or whatever
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.840]  they always do the wrong thing there's ways to get change done
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:12.200]  as i pointed out before you have bernie sanders saying look i'll work with donal
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:15.240]  trump on rebuilding the infrastructure as long as he doesn't sell it off to
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:18.600]  foreign people i'm all for helping him with that saying i'll work with him
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.920]  on that but then you got on the other side you got these people like john
[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:25.800]  lewis who start spreading lies around and say well i he's totally
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:28.520]  illegitimate i can't work with him i got to shut him down
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:31.960]  and that's what these people who are working on the inauguration
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:34.760]  are looking at of course we're going to have a report from alex jones the next
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:37.400]  hour are they going to try to do something with a
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:41.880]  tactical nuke he's going to have a report with that and we've got
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:44.760]  mark dice is going to be joining us in the next hour before we get to that
[1:43:44.760 --> 1:43:47.400]  though i want to talk about davos because that's
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:51.160]  been happening over the weekend again another one of these globalist
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:54.680]  elitist confabs like bill de berg except this is the one they want you to
[1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:58.520]  pay attention to this is the one they invite the press to say here come
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:02.680]  come cover us they invite the celebrities in to make this look pretty cool
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:06.600]  unlike bill de berg that they don't want you to even know that that exists
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:09.640]  they used to make fun of people calling us conspiracy theories for even
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:13.320]  theorists for even saying that there was such a thing as bill de berg
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:16.440]  isn't it interesting how they have some meetings that they promote and other
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:19.160]  ones that they try to hide now after it became
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:22.360]  common knowledge i guess it was about three years ago that was a tipping point
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:25.800]  at that point and it got so much attention primarily
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:29.720]  because the coverage of alex jones going there that they started releasing
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:33.640]  their itinerary to the public to a limited degree we still
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:37.000]  don't know what they talk about behind closed doors
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:41.880]  and you still got people who are part of the biggest corporations
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:46.120]  politicians uh all getting together behind closed doors and talking no
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:49.320]  problem with that right we shouldn't worry about that at all
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:54.360]  but of course as we look at what the elitists are saying the imf
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:58.760]  is now interestingly boosting its growth forecast for the united states the
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:02.200]  imf the international monetary fund is raising its forecast for the us economy
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:06.600]  this year reports ap reflecting an unexpected boost
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.360]  from the economic policies of president-elect donald trump so here are
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.880]  the people who said it's going to be an absolute catastrophe
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:17.800]  if trump is elected and yet now they're raising the forecast their new outlook
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:21.320]  puts us economic growth at 2.3 percent this year
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:27.480]  and 2.5 percent in 2018 that would be an improvement says the ap from the lack
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.200]  luster us growth around 1.6 percent in 2016
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:34.840]  now donald trump says he believes that his policies
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:37.880]  are going to bring annual growth to about four percent
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.560]  so they're not up as high as donald trump but even the imf and these are the
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.560]  people who are really a core group obviously with the
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:48.920]  globalists the international monetary fund these bankers and they've gone
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:51.480]  through a policy that was identified under robert
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:55.400]  McNamara people criticize them for rent seeking they would go into
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:45:58.680]  developing countries they would say we're going to we want you to
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:04.280]  increase your welfare spending and we're going to loan you the money to do it
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:07.560]  and of course that's not money that they're going to get back that's money
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:10.840]  that's just going down into non-productive it's not the same as
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:15.560]  rebuilding germany after world war two this is putting it into
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:18.840]  non-productive areas and so of course these people
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:21.480]  are it's not going to grow their economy they're not going to be able to pay
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:24.760]  back those loans it just basically turns them into renters and it
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:27.240]  gives the people who are loaning them this money
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:31.640]  control over their infrastructure control over their country
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.480]  and so that is precisely what the globalists are trying to do
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.400]  to the united states and to europe as well that's the tactic of the bankers
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:41.960]  but even they understand that donald trump's policies
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:45.080]  are going to be a boon for the american economy meanwhile over the weekend
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:48.840]  donald trump told a german paper that nato is
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:52.200]  obsolete create a lot of stir there but it is
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:55.160]  absolutely the truth this is what donald trump said he said it's obsolete
[1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:57.880]  first because it was designed many many years ago
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:02.280]  secondly countries are not paying what they should what they agreed to
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:07.240]  and third it didn't have any way to effectively deal with terrorism
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:11.400]  nato hasn't done anything to protect us against the greatest threat
[1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:17.240]  terrorism so it's an obsolete design and at the same time he said that bmw
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:20.200]  would face a 35 import duty if they build
[1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:24.760]  bmw's in mexico and then import them into the united states so
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:27.240]  created a lot of issues he also went after uncle
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:30.840]  merkel so that she hurt germany by letting all of these
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:35.320]  illegals into the country and that shocked the european leaders who are now
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:40.200]  at davos and the washington post points out that it is raised
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:44.200]  fears among the european elite so you've got all these globalists
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:48.520]  looking for safe places that they can cower in and davos
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:52.760]  because davos itself is a safe place for the elitist
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:57.240]  at this moment they say that of course over the weekend he talked about how
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:01.880]  the european union not only did he say that nato
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:05.640]  was obsolete that nato was not serving the interests of the countries that are
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:08.280]  involved in it and many of those countries are not paying their way
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:11.560]  but he also said this he said the european union
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:16.600]  was a vehicle for german interests that wasn't that true
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:19.640]  we all know that's true and to underscore that
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:23.720]  in the same article from the washington post they go down as a retort to that
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:28.040]  who do they go to uncle merkel the head of the german republic
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:30.920]  so he says hey the germans are the ones who are running the e you and so they
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.360]  come to uncle merkel they say well what do you have to say about that
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:37.320]  because they know she is the that's true what he's saying about them and she
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:42.280]  said we europeans say the royal we
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:48.680]  merkel speaks for europe because the germans like donald trump said
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:52.680]  are controlling the european union we europeans merkel said
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:56.600]  have our destiny in our own hands do you really
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:49:00.680]  do you really i think the destiny of european europeans
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:04.760]  is in the hands of uncle merkel and the e you right now and that's why there is
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:09.560]  a massive revolt as reuters pointed out these political leaders these ceo's
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:13.160]  these top bankers who are all meeting at davos right now
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:16.440]  they're not in a celebratory mood they say beneath the veneer
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:20.280]  of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:25.080]  about the increasingly listen to this toxic political climate
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:29.240]  the reuters is not a big fan of donald trump are they they call it a toxic
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:32.920]  political climate was it a toxic political climate
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:36.920]  when they got everybody's money and they set themselves up
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:40.760]  as rulers and owners of the world they say trump is a poster child for a new
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:43.640]  strain of populism with elections looming in the netherlands
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:46.440]  france germany and possibly idly this year
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:49.880]  there's nervousness amongst davos attendees
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:53.000]  they say and of course they talk about the different topics that are going to
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.160]  be discussed at davos and remember going back to bill de berg last year
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:50:00.200]  remember that uh one of the topics that was there
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.960]  was the precariat you know the proletariat in a precarious position
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:09.560]  and so here's some of the topics here squeezed and angry how to fix the middle
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:14.280]  class politics of fear or rebellion of the forgotten
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:18.120]  tolerance at the tipping point and the post
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:22.280]  eu era this is what they'll be talking about at davos
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:26.280]  and of course when they look at the precariat
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:30.280]  the forgotten middle class the people who have been ripped off
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:37.000]  by globalism what's their solution universal basic income because
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:41.400]  just like the imf did to the third world countries they want to turn you

[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:49.000]  they want to put you on welfare as a kind of

[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:58.280]  travel out that's what they're coming at with universal basic income that's how

[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:20.280]  reports he's had recently we played it a week ago when

[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:27.400]  going to show that video and talk about that hoax
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:30.440]  line of attack and of course it's just one of many
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:33.880]  donald trump is ate off hitler donald trump is racist donald trump made fun

[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:40.280]  we're also going to talk about some reports that he's done on abortion as
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:43.400]  well when they say that uh it's going to be
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:47.560]  difficult for mike pence and others and the trump administration to do
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:50.520]  something to cut uh planned parenthood funding
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:54.360]  understand what they're saying is they're going to make it easier
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:58.600]  to kill children than to kill funding for planned parenthood that's what that's
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:01.320]  truly about now before we get back to what's

[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:47.400]  upset and they're hiding in their safe places and that luxury resort
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:50.600]  they talk about the fact that and this is coming from the wall street journal
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:53.960]  they say well you know the benefits have been mixed
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:57.640]  you know some of the wealthy countries have grown richer but the benefits have
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.000]  kind of been disproportionately spread around
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.880]  how disproportionately have they been spread around
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:07.480]  well the ap has a story then you'll see this linked on the drudge report
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:11.320]  the stark inequality oxfam says that only eight men
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.640]  only eight men are as rich as half of the world
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.160]  the bottom half of the income producers people who are living
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:22.760]  then they say one in ten people live on less than two dollars a day
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:25.960]  now to give you an idea of how this wealth consolidation is going
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:29.240]  these same people did this report just a year ago
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:33.640]  and they said isn't it outrageous and it was the 62 people
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:37.640]  had as much wealth as the bottom half now
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:42.600]  it's gone from 62 people to just eight who are those eight well people like
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:46.680]  this bill gates number one who is always out there
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:51.000]  trying to find a solution for the fact that you know we got all these people
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.040]  and we've got all these other issues what what is the thing that needs to go to

[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:23.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show on david night in the next segment we're
[2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:26.600]  going to be joined by mark dice we're going to talk about some of the great
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:30.520]  reports he's done this last week beginning with a week ago it was we
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:35.240]  had the big kerfuffle about meryl streep attacking
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:38.760]  donald trump at the golden globes that fake awards ceremony and of course it
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  was a fake story that she was attacking him for fake
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:45.880]  narrative saying he's making fun of this guy who's handicapped and he just
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:49.000]  destroyed that whole narrative in a video we're going to talk about talk to him
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.360]  about that in some of the other videos that he's put out recently
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:56.200]  always a good guest i was talking about what was happening at davos
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:00:59.160]  i think it's important to understand how donald trump is going to handle this
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:05.000]  he's already said he's going to offer deals to britain and to russia and of
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:09.080]  course when he criticizes european union and says
[2:01:09.080 --> 2:01:12.360]  that it has become a vehicle for german power
[2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:15.960]  and then says that he's going to work with britain to help them go through
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:19.480]  brexit that is a very significant signal that is
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:22.680]  being sent to the global elitists who are cowering
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:27.400]  in davos as we speak and as also said yesterday and somebody
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:32.520]  complained about it they said well you know night is always ignoring the us
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:35.720]  being the leader of globalism no they have been the leader of globalism we
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:39.000]  have been the ones who have initiated wars who've
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:42.120]  started cold wars who've set the middle east on fire who have
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:45.080]  been overthrowing regimes that's what the globalists do
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:48.120]  but see the difference is that now that trump is president
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:51.960]  they're handing the mantle to china
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:57.000]  china has emerged as a leader at davos and isn't it interesting
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.240]  this place that doesn't stand for free trade
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:06.280]  or openness in any way shape or form is now being handed
[2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:11.720]  the the lead role in pushing what they say well we want open trade now they
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:15.000]  kind of doesn't want open trade they don't want an open internet we got china
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.760]  tightening app oversight this is an article from the wall street journal
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:22.280]  they say china has long censored websites of course they call it the great
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:24.520]  firewall and now they've got the cyberspace
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:27.880]  administration of china announcing new regulations on content
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:31.640]  distributed by by apps in august uh this was
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:36.040]  member george w bush saying i just wish i could do it like china
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:39.240]  as well so did obama and obama started doing it
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:43.240]  like china did now this is what they had to say the cyberspace administration
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:48.040]  of china which we are busy setting up the equivalent here in the united states
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:52.520]  they said some apps are spreading illegal information
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:56.440]  there's one thing for you to have right there illegal information
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:03:00.760]  all these people who talk about undocumented immigrants they like to
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:03.240]  say because they say we don't like you calling people
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.080]  illegal well they're foreign citizens who are here illegally
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:10.520]  demanding benefits how's that for you instead of undocumented immigrants but
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:13.960]  when they talk about illegal information
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:17.880]  maybe we should start this narrative that there isn't any information that
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.960]  should be illegal i know wikileaks agrees with that i agree with that
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:25.720]  i don't think we should have illegal information and we're not talking about
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:29.320]  national security here either okay this is what china is talking about they
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:32.920]  say when they talk about spreading illegal information
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:37.080]  it's things like the new york times app that they demanded
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:41.400]  apple removed from their chinese apple store their app store
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:48.200]  okay and apple dutifully complied just like facebook
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:53.080]  because they both work for and work with the globalist to achieve these
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:55.800]  agendas now donald trump has said that he's going to put together
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:59.800]  deals that are going to aid britain deals that are going to ease
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:03.800]  tension with russia and of course what he's talking about here
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:07.000]  he said i took a lot of heat when i said nato was obsolete
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.520]  he said it's obsolete because it isn't taking care of terry said i took a lot
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.680]  of heat for two days and they started saying
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.520]  trump is right he said there's only five countries that are paying what they're
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:19.880]  supposed to pay in terms of supporting nato and he said
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:23.560]  only five that's not very many and then he added that
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:26.600]  he wanted to work with russia he said one of the things i think we can do
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:30.520]  is to say nuclear weapons should be taken way down the number of nuclear
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:34.440]  weapons and they should be reduced very substantially that's a part of it
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:37.880]  why is this so controversial we always heard
[2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:41.240]  from the press in the past that it was a good thing for us to reduce nuclear
[2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:44.360]  weapons we always heard that it was a good thing to reduce tensions between
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:47.560]  the us and russia who had so many nuclear weapons
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:50.760]  that they thought was a good thing but now it's evil
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.200]  it makes you a russian agent to even say that you don't want to have nuclear
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:04:59.480]  war stay with us to be right back with mark dice
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:02.440]  what's trump going to do with the hostile press corps well according to his
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:05.880]  press secretary alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:08.520]  press corps now the corporate media is freaking out
[2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:11.960]  as the possibility of breitbart and invoors being allowed to ask questions
[2:05:11.960 --> 2:05:15.160]  we have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[2:05:15.160 --> 2:05:19.160]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move the trump's incoming
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:24.040]  white house press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt media
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:27.000]  may be allowed to join the white house press corps and take part in press
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  conferences in washington now this off the chart interest in the trump
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.960]  administration the president elect thinking that he's
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:37.320]  going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a large capacity
[2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:41.480]  sean spicer is attributing since 1970 all official press briefings have been
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:45.640]  held in the james s brady room looks like he's moving them over one and based
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:50.120]  on cnn's performance last week where jemacosta was called out by president
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:54.360]  elect trump it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:57.960]  capacity that they were well i'm margaret howl reporting for info wars

[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:41.880]  dot com i don't want to talk to mark about the builder
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:45.080]  burr group and then we're going to take a look at some of his
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:47.800]  videos because he's just put out a book on the builder burr group the builder
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:51.080]  burr group facts and fictions joining us now is
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:55.720]  mark dice thank you mark for coming great to be with you happy new year it's
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:08:58.120]  a good it's a new year we're having a new president
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:02.840]  it's just fantastic i know that i'm not the only one that is feeling so good in
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:05.880]  this over you know 10-year battle that i've been involved
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:11.400]  as a contributor of the show and so it's so good and on a positive note regarding
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:14.760]  the builder burr group as far as i can understand don trump has never
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:18.600]  been there never been to the bohemian growth and that's part of the reason
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:20.760]  why the american people got behind him because
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:25.640]  he's finally was the true outsider that we have been waiting for so it's so
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:27.560]  good haven't been this happy haven't been this
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:31.400]  positive in quite a long time so you know there's a great
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.320]  parody video that came out around christmas time and of course it was the
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:39.240]  it was a parody of the of the song it's the most wonderful time
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:42.680]  of the year you know it was the most wonderful time in eight years i'm sure
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:46.520]  you saw that it was a great parody video but of course this last weekend we've
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:50.840]  got the davos meeting going on interesting that davos they want
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:53.560]  everybody to know about that the builder burr they want to pretend that that
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:56.840]  doesn't exist and we're seeing all these headlines that they're there having a
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.360]  really hard time at davos this year mark i i really feel sorry for them don't
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.520]  you i mean all these headlines davos elites are struggling for answers
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:07.880]  the global elite face a world of uncertainty these poor guys
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:11.720]  who have had everything their way for decades and it's been
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:14.920]  the rest of us who have been struggling for answers the rest of us who have been
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:18.920]  facing a world of uncertainty the rest of us who have been getting poor while the
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:22.920]  wealth concentration has continued to consolidate to an absurd level
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:26.120]  as we point out then you can see the stories linked on mad drudge
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:29.960]  a year ago it was 62 people that had as much
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:33.720]  money as the bottom half and now it's consolidated down to just
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:38.120]  eight it's absolutely amazing but tell us in your view why is it that they
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:41.000]  they come out and they brag about what they're going to do at davos but then
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  they for years completely even denied the existence of the
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.760]  builder group well davos is sort of a red herring builder
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:53.240]  berg is essentially one of the core centers of the power structure and so
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:56.120]  as as much of this audience knows there's obviously about a
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:10:59.480]  probably new people coming to your show over the last several months last year
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:03.080]  and a half with the election cycle but builder berg group for years was
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:07.800]  obviously ridiculed as a conspiracy theory and then finally as the alternative
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:12.600]  media continued to grow as social media continued to spread word and
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:15.800]  undeniable proof that the builder berg group exists
[2:11:15.800 --> 2:11:20.520]  who's going there the infiltrations and the insider admissions about what it is
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:22.600]  that they've done and what they're doing
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:27.000]  it's impossible for the mainstream media to deny that they exist anymore so
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:30.680]  now they're stuck in a hard spot because they have to pretend like it doesn't
[2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:33.240]  even matter but those of us who have been covering
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.280]  this for any amount of time know that recently
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:40.760]  they were ridiculing us for even mentioning that it exists or for being
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:43.560]  concerned about why these people were going there so
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:46.680]  it certainly is a great question to pose to the
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:50.120]  fake news media the clown network news and other
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:54.440]  mainstream media networks about why the builder berg group isn't covered or
[2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:57.960]  recently the last few years when they have mentioned it
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:04.120]  it's always with the accompanying flers saying that it's something that
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.480]  conspiracy theorists are concerned about so
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:12.040]  this election was so devastating and we're seeing the scrambling and the
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:16.840]  desperate and really sad attempts at them trying to fight back
[2:12:16.840 --> 2:12:22.120]  it's almost like a child who's been sent to bed and they're just crying and
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.760]  they don't want to go and they have no power anymore
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:30.360]  at least at this point it's I mean with these celebrities
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:33.720]  they're getting more and more detached from reality first we see them with their
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:37.320]  get-out-the-vote campaign so you know calling Donald Trump all these
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:42.360]  ridiculous slurs then they have a trying to stop the electoral
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:45.480]  college and the quality of these celebrities if you can even call it
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:49.560]  that continues to drop because I only recognize one or two of the
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:55.640]  supposed celebrities washed up d and f-list celebs in the electoral college
[2:12:55.640 --> 2:13:00.600]  psa vote and now they're singing and I think you've covered this I will survive
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:04.280]  the inauguration yeah and the most bizarre
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:07.800]  and laughable psa pathetic psa I can't believe any
[2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:12.600]  agent would allow their their their actor to do that
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:15.640]  they don't have the studio system anymore they're not watching these guys
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:19.960]  closely enough are they before we get into the hollywood video and that that
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:22.920]  excellent video that you did we played it last monday
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:26.520]  debunking that myth that meryl streep was promulgating
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:31.880]  at the global golden globes again we look at the dichotomy between
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.640]  davos and bill deberg and the fact that okay we'll talk all about this one or
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:37.880]  anything but then oh this one doesn't even exist they
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:42.280]  they called it a conspiracy theory because we kept pointing out to people
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:45.800]  over a long period of time look look oh look over here why isn't anybody covering
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:48.280]  this and of course I think that tells us
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:51.080]  something very vital about it and I think it's interesting that Donald
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:56.520]  trump talked about this weekend the fact that the EU had become a
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:01.080]  vehicle for power for germany and I think that is also at the core of this
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:04.280]  when we look at bill deberg remember bill deberg and you well know this you
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:06.600]  wrote the book on the bill deberg group here that
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:10.520]  it's your newest book you know that they held it at the
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:13.960]  bill deberg location it was where the nazis had their last
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:17.720]  victory of world war two and they did it on the 10th anniversary of that that's
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.320]  where this thing started so this is kind of rolling the nazis
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:24.680]  into this globalist structure and one of the first things they do is plot a
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:28.600]  common european currency and a european united europe
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:33.000]  that'll be united as we see now under the germans your comment on that
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.200]  what's also interesting is they broke their protocol of having to build a
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:39.480]  bird meeting in the united states on election years
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:43.240]  and every election they have the meeting in the united states obviously
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:47.480]  because it's a lot easier for the washington dc power elite to come
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:51.320]  and visit them so they don't have to leave the country so they often have it
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:56.600]  just outside of dc over in virginia in shantilly virginia or in a
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:01.640]  local area over there and they didn't do it this year and i think the reason is
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:06.120]  because in 2012 there were hundreds of protesters that surrounded the
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:10.920]  hotel for days and we were creating so much attention for them
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:14.680]  that they knew that the the attention would have been exponential
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:18.680]  this year and so they for the first time i think in
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:23.560]  recent history at least they broke the protocol and did not meet in the united
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:27.560]  states on the election year so we kind of smoked them out of their
[2:15:27.560 --> 2:15:31.960]  holes and there wasn't really a word about the coverage whatsoever
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:36.200]  so they they didn't even really mention them whatsoever i know a few years ago
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:39.400]  when drudge started linking to the bill de berg group we would see
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:43.720]  an occasional mention of them mostly in european papers the
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:47.480]  american press quite a bit more controlled through operation mockingbird
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:50.920]  but it is interesting that they're a weird spot because if they even talk about
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:53.960]  them now people are going to be wondering why the name haven't talked
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:57.880]  about them in previous years people are going to go and see the previous
[2:15:57.880 --> 2:16:01.800]  coverage and the stories from places like info wars
[2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:05.640]  about the previous years meetings and wonder why
[2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:08.760]  that they haven't been covering them for years and the cover-up
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:12.680]  is going to be even more obvious so they're they're in a really tough spot
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:15.960]  yeah yeah absolutely and of course what they talked about last year bill de berg
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:20.120]  what they're talking about davos now is the fact that the middle class has
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:23.960]  been so disenfranchised they call us the precariat
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:27.880]  their their term because i'll see this in terms of a class struggle because these
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:31.160]  are the same people that sold us marxism even though they're the corporate
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:34.760]  leaders they're also the ones who who sold us out so they give us a kind of a
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.240]  marxist term the precariat the precarious proletariat and their
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:43.880]  solution mark is going to be universal income to make us all welfare recipients
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:48.840]  as a kind of a passive soft kill isn't it yeah and that way of course it'll kill
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:53.880]  any sort of inventiveness any kind of goal setting they they
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:58.600]  it'll allow people to sit on their sofas and play on their tablets and just
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:01.880]  watch netflix all day which will they will be so detached
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:07.080]  so unmotivated that they won't be inclined to be educated they'll be lost
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:13.000]  in a digital wasteland of entertainment and that's that's part of the plan and
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:16.200]  while we had a tremendous victory electing donald trump we saw
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:19.320]  the strike back was quite quick with the
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:23.160]  coining of the term fake news which of course is backfiring
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:27.720]  they're pissing in the wind pun intended with the buzzfeed
[2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:31.320]  defamatory article coming out i mean it seems at this point
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:34.840]  we have the the upper hand at least for a while
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:41.160]  and everything that they do just fails in any stepping stone or any stumbling
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:45.480]  block rather they try to put in our way just turns into a stepping stone i mean
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:48.440]  we we can't get any better when the president elect
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:52.920]  soon to be president a few days calls the clown news network a fake news
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:55.960]  network and terrible i mean no other president
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:00.920]  would have the guts to do that and so yeah exactly i mean you know why i just
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:04.680]  just like this weekend we see it's the end of the circus after about 150 years
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:08.200]  wringling brothers is is calling it quits and and i guess
[2:18:08.200 --> 2:18:11.560]  they've really kind of been made redundant by all the clowns in washington
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:15.480]  seeing in this kind of the uh the lead uh the lead ring there
[2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:18.840]  i want to get into this report that you did about meryl streep and i want to
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:21.720]  show people this because if they didn't see this a week ago
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:25.160]  they need to go back and take a look at this report that you did that completely
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:28.520]  destroys this hoax that was being promulgated by
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:31.800]  meryl streep let's roll a little bit of that report and then get your comment on
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:34.120]  that
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:38.120]  it was that moment when the person asking to sit
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:41.560]  in the most respected seat in our country
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:48.280]  imitated a disabled reporter someone he outranked in privilege power
[2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:53.400]  and the capacity to fight back stop right there meryl because it's time for
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:56.920]  the debunking to begin she's talking about this gesture
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:00.680]  that donald trump made on the campaign trail during one of his speeches
[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:04.680]  when he was calling out what one of the reporters was saying about him
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:08.040]  it just so happened unfortunately that the reporter was
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:11.400]  physically disabled and has some deformed hands
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:15.240]  so on the surface it could okay i want to get mark's comments on that keep
[2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:18.520]  rolling that in the background as as a b-roll because what you did was you
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:21.560]  absolutely destroyed that you showed how time and again
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:25.320]  donald trump criticized people and he used that same gesture with his hands
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:28.200]  but the one time that he does it and the person
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:31.800]  is disabled has a kind of palsy or whatever they focus on that to the
[2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:35.320]  exclusion of everything else and i want to get your comments on that we're
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:38.280]  about out of time we got to go to break here i want to get your comments on that
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:41.640]  when we come back on the other side of the break it's absolutely amazing
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:46.040]  and you completely destroyed that you did a great job mark
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:49.720]  we're going to be right back stay with us

[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:38.520]  we talked in the last segment about his new book the bill de berg group
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:42.680]  facts and fiction and the difference between the bill de berg
[2:24:42.680 --> 2:24:46.200]  meetings and davos and the way those are covered but as we went to break we were
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:49.160]  playing his report from a week ago
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:53.560]  where he broke down the lies that maryl streep was
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:56.760]  putting forth about donald trump saying that he was making fun of a
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:24:59.720]  disabled reporter and of course i think the interesting
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:02.840]  thing is that the internet just doesn't blink
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.200]  and as anonymous says it doesn't forget and it never forgives and if you're
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:09.400]  going to forward through false information if you're going to
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:14.120]  promulgate lies and hoaxes uh the internet doesn't forget and it
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:17.880]  doesn't forgive uh mark you absolutely destroyed that narrative
[2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:22.120]  with your video showing all the many times that he's used that gesture
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:25.560]  not talking about somebody that had a disability
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:29.960]  yeah what it is it's a typical nervous uh quirk we all have our own
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:34.440]  unique little nonverbal gestures and when he's kind of mocking someone not for
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:37.640]  what they look like but for what they said or what they've done
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:41.480]  he sort of flails his arms around a little bit and this is something that
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:46.840]  he's done not on two occasions not on three not on four on at least five
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:50.520]  different occasions that we found on video and so
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:53.960]  the mainstream media the clown news network cnn and others
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:57.880]  they have to know that this is not him mocking
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:02.120]  the reporter it's an unfortunate coincidence that the reporter has
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:06.920]  a physical disability and so they froze or they show the clip in slow motion
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:11.160]  where it looks like he's you know allegedly making fun of the reporter's
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:16.200]  hands when that's simply not true he just flails his arms around
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:19.960]  in a way to sort of mock what it is that they have said or what it is that
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:23.560]  they've done we all have our unique nervous little quirks
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:27.480]  i mean i sometimes when i'm talking i tend to people have noticed that will
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:30.760]  wiggle my tongue back and forth and they think i'm a reptilian some people
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:34.920]  and i even had one woman years ago at my former day job accused me of sticking
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:37.560]  her tongue sticking my tongue out at her
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:40.280]  we're having a little disagreement and i was getting a little bit flustered
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:43.400]  myself and she accused me of sticking my tongue out at her
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.440]  the level of insanity is that of maryl street but
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.040]  you're nowhere close in the tongue area you're nowhere close to john carrey i
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:53.480]  mean nobody even comes close to that guy i mean
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:57.560]  maybe you remember the count i had lost count somebody did a count of the video
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:00.760]  one speech that he did it it was what over a hundred times and he flicks his
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:03.240]  tongue out like a reptile it's absolutely
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:07.000]  well gary johnson does gary johnson does stick his
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  tongue out at reporters i'm sure i'm at the bench yeah
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.360]  remember that yeah you know the video on a correction
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:18.040]  almost a million subscribers on youtube so i want to thank everyone for watching
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:21.400]  if you you know come on over to check the channel out if you you know come and
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:25.720]  see me on the show here but that video that you just showed on my channel has
[2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:29.800]  i think 700 000 views and well deserved that's a good
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:32.680]  video people need to see that they need to pass that around
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:36.440]  on social media people need to see that and that's why they're trying to shut
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:40.120]  us down because maryl street can get on television and lie to
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:43.240]  i don't know how many people watch the golden globes it could be
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:47.320]  seven or eight million people maybe maybe four or five the ratings are getting
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:51.400]  so horrible on mainstream shows but if i could make one video
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:55.720]  and it gets 700 000 views and you guys play it on your show gets millions of
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:58.760]  listeners millions more views i mean we
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:02.280]  with a shoestring budget compared to these major networks
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:06.280]  can put out the quality information to debunk their lies
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:09.560]  and that's why they're trying to label us fake news the new york times just a
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:12.280]  few weeks ago came out with an entire article
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:15.400]  almost all of it was dedicated to me calling me
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:19.000]  fake news and then i did a report about it and a quarter million people watched
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:22.200]  that video more people then read their actual
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:26.120]  article you know so you're gaining you're gaining following it because the truth
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:29.880]  is very powerful but they get maryl street and they get these actors because
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:35.640]  they make their living selling fiction and she did that in a very visceral way
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:40.200]  she cried about it she was really heard and it was a very moving speech that
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:43.240]  she gave you know a lot of people okay maybe you don't like the kinds of movies
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:47.000]  that maryl street does she's a very good actress i believe and you could see that
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  at the golden globes i mean if uh you know it's a phony award ceremony but
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:54.120]  she did deserve some kind of an award for what she the hit piece that she did on
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:57.240]  donald trump you know from the left the left gave her that award and they're
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:00.600]  going to give her more work and and more uh
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:04.520]  higher visibility because of that performance that she gave at golden globes
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:08.200]  it was very dramatic you can see how she was building up to it
[2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:12.600]  at first it wasn't you weren't clear what she was talking about and she had this
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:15.240]  whole thing to this dramatic build up she didn't
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:19.000]  reference his name she was just alluding to it
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:24.040]  such a shame and again the the editors at these media outlets they
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:27.560]  have to know that this is a total joke and the
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:31.560]  fact that they're reporting this as a supposed hit
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:36.200]  or an insult on a disabled man shows that they have no credibility they are
[2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:40.040]  liars they are the fake news as absolutely thank you so much for

[2:30:12.280 --> 2:30:15.320]  have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:19.320]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move the trump's incoming
[2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:24.200]  white house press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt media

[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:48.040]  ending very soon all right let's go to this report from
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:53.960]  alex jones public fears tactical nuke at inauguration
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:35:01.560]  it was in 2013 that we first began reporting
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:06.120]  on the missing nuclear weapons from dais air force base
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:09.000]  in west texas
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:14.120]  as i began to follow this report on the road with my family
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  fire trucks drove by which is just fitting to signify the type of crisis
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:22.680]  this country in the world's in it had been a few years before that that
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:26.840]  six air launch cruise missiles had come up missing
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:32.200]  from the minot base in north dakota and they weren't discovered till they'd
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:36.600]  been shipped to a major air force base in louisiana
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:42.200]  within one week that story breaking six people
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:45.560]  had mysteriously been gunned down or killed in different ways
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:48.520]  at that air force base
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:53.480]  in minot now why don't i preface the beginning of this transmission with
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:58.120]  that a lot of people keep asking me will they
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:03.640]  set off a low yield or a tactical nuke in dc to stop the
[2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:08.600]  truck trump inauguration and try to
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:12.840]  basically derail the old populist movement and i haven't really responded
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:16.360]  to that because we don't have any hard intel on it we
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:20.040]  don't have any chatter i don't have any sources on that fact
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:25.960]  but i have to ask myself if obama would fund isis and al-qaeda taking over
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:29.320]  multiple countries in the middle east in africa and killing hundreds of thousands
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:33.640]  of people and overthrowing non-radical regimes and putting every
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:39.000]  christian they find the sword then the answer is yes
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.120]  if the people controlling obama would launch
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:45.720]  major wars the last three years in places like ukraine
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:50.760]  start a war with russia and move us troops to the border with poland and
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:54.120]  have all sorts of other provocative actions being put in place and and the
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:59.320]  the federalizing of elections and be acting like they don't intend to leave
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:02.520]  then anything is possible i want to be clear before the national media
[2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:05.320]  picks this up and lies and says that i'm saying there's going to be a nuclear
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:09.320]  attack in dc on trump's inauguration come up in five
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:12.200]  days i'm not saying that i'm going to be there
[2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:18.840]  with my crew covering on the ground and if the globalists didn't try something
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:21.000]  like that it would end up blowing up in their face
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:24.520]  because the populist movement worldwide is exploding
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:29.240]  nationalism is exploding and the people are on to this corporate form of world
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:34.680]  government i mean they were like it's no exaggeration more than 10 major
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:39.160]  articles in afp ap wall street journal new york times
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.400]  just as we can admitting that the davos meeting in switzerland
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:46.280]  the globalists admit they're in christ as they help the communist chinese can
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:49.160]  prop them up they bet the public's awake to their
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:52.520]  planetary program so now it's in trouble because they always wanted to operate
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:56.280]  my stealth that was in the band candidate document
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:00.120]  2007 from their whole north american union meeting that it was key to keep it
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:04.200]  all stealth well if it's not stealth it's dead on arrival
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:07.560]  and so trump is only surfing in on the populist movement
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:11.080]  just like the bridge just like nigel forage just like i am
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:14.520]  just like we all are i keep explaining i'm not who's important it's you the
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:18.440]  listeners you the activist around the world
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:21.320]  all the other racial division religious stuff that's a distraction the
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:24.600]  globalists used to divide us don't we all agree we don't want foreign
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:28.680]  multinational mega banks above the law totally ruthless
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:33.560]  tax exempt running our lives yes we all agree that's wrong
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.160]  99.9 percent of us i mean we're talking less than one tenth one percent
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:40.920]  actually even benefit from this thing their ideology
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:44.920]  is to pull up the carpet is to pull up the ladder so that none of us can become
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:47.880]  self-sufficient it's all about economic enslavement it's all about turning us
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:51.720]  from owners into renters that's their admitted plan under cloward and piven
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:56.120]  and so many other documents with so many other public statements
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:38:58.760]  that's why a hard point obama tell an africans they can't have cars or air
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:01.000]  conditioning with these lands in a jumbo jet
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.600]  and air force one with like ten other major jets behind him and
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:08.040]  thousand strong entourage and over 200 secret service
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:11.560]  sometimes he has a thousand secret service when he travels
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:16.680]  i mean it's just insane how disconnected how arrogant
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:21.240]  and how elitist these people are but it's all coming to a massive head
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:25.160]  so everybody keeps asking me do you think a nuke will go off well
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:30.520]  here's some background the military has
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:36.760]  devices spectrometers you name it that are able to see different radioact
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:41.160]  device atopes even through heavy shielding
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:44.680]  so it'd be very hard to bring a nuke into dc because
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:48.360]  there will be helicopters there are satellites there are other aircraft
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:51.480]  that are scanning that area if we're being brought in
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:56.600]  if something was there it would have to be under 20 30 40 feet of concrete
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:00.840]  and that's declassified stuff from the 80s the word is they've got stuff even
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:04.360]  more powerful they can see even deeper than 30 40 feet of
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:08.840]  steel reinforced concrete so even something does get snuck in and
[2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:12.120]  detonated it's a very good chance that the powers
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:15.240]  that be were involved because they've got technologies to stop it
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:19.960]  whenever you drive in to the texas border you know out of mexico or out of
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.160]  canada and to say new york new york state
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:27.800]  though it's all these big devices a lot of antennas pointed out of your car
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:32.440]  those are radioactive snoopers i'm not an engineer i've just read about it and
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:34.920]  seen it and you know driven to the border with
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:37.400]  engineers and they've explained it to me and i'm going to look it up
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:42.120]  so again they've got all sorts of stuff and if the nuke does go off
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:45.560]  you better believe it's the shadow government wanting to use to get power
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:49.800]  in fact there are four doomsday machines that again are big jets
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:53.160]  loaded with continue government systems so in case congress ever got taken out
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:57.560]  by a nuke and or the president or both uh that
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:41:02.360]  that they would be able to successfully continue the government
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:06.600]  the problem is is that in many other countries cog systems have been used
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:09.160]  actually to seize control of the government because if something's a
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:11.160]  shadow government or something's a separate government
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:13.880]  if something has control of the government if you're wanting to actually
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:16.120]  hijack it from the elected government what do you do
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:19.640]  well you take out the elected government and then you install yourself or with
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:22.280]  groups different people in the elected government
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:25.960]  you countermand other people in the elected government and circumvent and
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.840]  have a coup that way and what's happened is the globalist by
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:31.960]  infiltration and economic takeover already taken over the us
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:36.680]  trump is a manifestation our movements manifestation of restoring the republic
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:39.960]  that's why i hammer on the fact that we are getting our country back right now
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:43.080]  people ask is trump real folks he's going after big pharma
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:46.760]  that charges us the most in the world he's going after vaccines
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:50.040]  he's going after nap time gap he's going after tpp
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:53.080]  he's going after the gun control he's going after the open borders
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:56.040]  he's going after the fact that they set our taxes the highest in the world so
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:41:58.920]  corporations wouldn't have their businesses based here
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:02.680]  he's already brought back over a hundred billion dollars
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:06.600]  of investment for 2017 and hasn't been in office yet
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:09.640]  there's already a trillion 200 billion more in the stock market
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.240]  and it goes on and on but more importantly he's discredited the
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:16.600]  mainstream media he stood up as a real leader
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.960]  he's not going to rakiovec excuse me he's not going to devos over in switzerland
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:25.960]  he's going to rakiovec uh to meet with putin they're announcing
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.000]  this meeting as his first major meeting to point out that's leaders of
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:33.080]  countries that meet and make decisions not a bunch of bankers
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:36.840]  meeting in devos behind the scenes with other heads of state engaged in open
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:40.200]  treason see what the global subconscious had to normalize treason
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:43.880]  normalize openly having secret agreements transferring power all
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:47.320]  getting together convincing themselves that since it's okay
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:50.440]  for them to get away with it that supposedly it's okay overall
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:55.160]  no it's not okay and so it's a giant con game
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:58.200]  that is coming down around them and they're scared
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:01.240]  they know they're going to get prosecuted when trump gets in
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.600]  not because trump's even vindictive but because it's justice and has to be done
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:08.680]  and sessions is going to go after him notice they said that obama care was
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:11.560]  invincible it can never be repealed now you see it's being repealed even before
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:14.520]  he's in office it's already passed what the senate
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:18.200]  now it's in the house the senate was the hard part
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:21.960]  and trump pointed out he said i could let you keep having this
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:26.280]  in 2017 and not beat it not repeal it but then it would hurt the country so
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:30.600]  bad that it might be irreversible i would get major political
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:33.160]  points against the democrats but instead we're going to repeal it because it's
[2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:37.560]  the right thing to do you see that's what a true leader does
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:40.520]  now getting back to the newt i'm gonna make this short and sweet
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:45.640]  um i hope no newt goes off but you cannot put it past these people to do
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:48.040]  anything or a financial collapse which is
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:51.960]  the equivalent of a financial hydrogen bomb uh the big thing it looks like
[2:43:51.960 --> 2:43:55.880]  they're pushing for is more media hoaxes more dossiers more made up internet
[2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:59.480]  files they call dossiers to give it credibility
[2:43:59.480 --> 2:44:06.040]  okay so you've got that to deal with um also
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:09.480]  they've been busting in tens of thousands of people in the soros
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:14.040]  and fort foundation payrolls to try to cause as much civil unrest as possible
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:16.840]  and they admit trying to shut down the inauguration so that's an active
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:19.880]  tradition right there because it's not like they're protesting something the
[2:44:19.880 --> 2:44:22.200]  government's done which is their first amendment which
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.320]  are totally support they're protesting the people's vote
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.160]  and our president coming in and trying to shut down him getting into office
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:31.720]  and trying to shut down him getting into the white house
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:34.920]  and trying to go along with rogue groups in our government
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:38.920]  to hijack control of our country see that's an outside foreign power doing
[2:44:38.920 --> 2:44:41.560]  that and that's why you see the communist
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:43.880]  chinese openly admitting they're buying a polywood
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:47.720]  to bolster the takeover of america and you read the news i mentioned earlier
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:51.640]  that the elite hope the chinese communists can help the new order survive
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:56.120]  they're openly calling on foreign powers to help them with money
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:45:00.360]  and and boycotts and you name it to quote get our president in line
[2:45:00.360 --> 2:45:04.520]  while they tell us that he secretly is meeting and worked with the russians
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:07.080]  when it's hillary they got caught doing that see
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:11.400]  they're nakedly worshiping china working with china
[2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:15.080]  using their economic muscle and more to operate illegally in this country as
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:18.360]  american people and they have the nerve to say that
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:22.600]  trump is this outside trader or enemy this is the arrogance
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:25.880]  so he's going to riovex to meet with putin for world peace
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:28.920]  acting like a real leader just like reagan did with warbachev
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:33.080]  30 years ago meanwhile they're trying to bring the country down and trying to
[2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:36.760]  sabotage our electoral process and as obama is ready to leave office
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:40.440]  he's signing thousands of documents and and just incredible
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:45.080]  piles of regulations every day and on every front it's terrible things that
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:47.480]  ruin the economy and hurt the american people
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:51.240]  that's what a nasty piece of crap globalist obama is
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:53.960]  carrying out his operation that he's sworn to do
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:56.600]  see it's not just rhetoric when i say they're evil and not to get us that's
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:00.680]  their philosophy that's their plan the american system must fail and must
[2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:03.560]  fall because it competes with their global government
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:07.240]  that picks the winners these are our sworn enemies
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:10.920]  so yes i think they could set off the nuke i'm not saying they are
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:13.880]  but clearly we've had nukes missing before and so i think people asking that
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:17.160]  question are very smart and that's something that has to be looked at
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:21.160]  but i think the race riot angle and other things like that are probably what
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:24.760]  will happen but that may not even happen because they failed
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:27.800]  to sell this whole trump as a russian agent narrative
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:30.760]  and no matter how hard they push with all these fake civil rights leaders
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:34.280]  and other race pimps it's only blowing up their face because
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:37.640]  the next big turning is here the tipping point is here
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:41.880]  you cannot deny that and that's why i'm so excited we are witnessing incredible
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:45.480]  history i'm alex joneswithinfullwars.com i'm traveling back
[2:46:45.480 --> 2:46:49.160]  to texas tomorrow and i'll be back in studio
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:52.920]  took off a few weeks with the family but it's been a working
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:56.440]  vacation and it's been good to be out here and to see what's happening in other
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:00.760]  corners of the nation but back to david knight
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:05.240]  hosting the worldwide broadcast again that's alex jones you're talking about
[2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:08.040]  the attack on the american system by the global elitists
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:12.120]  you have to understand that it's not just donald trump that they're attacking
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:14.840]  they're attacking the tens of millions of people who voted for donald trump
[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:18.040]  they're attacking the peaceful transition of power
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:22.120]  they're attacking democratic elections when they talk about
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:26.280]  how this is illegitimate and of course what is the source of this attack who
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:31.080]  has been leading this as glenn greenwald pointed out it's the deep state
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:36.520]  and he said shame on the liberals who have in many cases been at the forefront
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:40.680]  of talking about how it was wrong for the cia to be overthrowing regimes
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:43.480]  throughout the world and protested when that happened elsewhere but then
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:46.840]  inviting it here at home because they don't agree with
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:51.960]  donald trump there are ways in a representative democracy
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:55.880]  to oppose policies of people that you don't like but of course we have seen
[2:47:55.880 --> 2:47:59.080]  this is the same playbook we've seen from barack obama throughout his
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:02.760]  eight years of his administration and that is to shoot the messenger
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:06.040]  whenever we had whistleblowers or journalists exposing unconstitutional
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  criminal actions by the obama administration what was their response
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:14.200]  it was always to attack the source of the information
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:18.520]  not to say hey we didn't do anything wrong let's take a look at this no no no
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:21.800]  this guy should never have done that let's let's execute
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:25.160]  snowden let's come after him and you know there's now
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:29.400]  a petition that has over one million signatures asking
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:32.600]  obama to pardon snowden i'm all for that but you understand
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.240]  obama is not about to do that snowden represents the hallmark of the obama
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:41.560]  administration using that 100 year old law the espionage act of 1917 more than
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:45.320]  every other president combined in the last 100 years to come after
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:50.440]  whistleblowers and journalists and so it is perfectly in keeping
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:53.560]  for him to come after snowden snowden will be
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:58.360]  the epitome of the obama criminality that we see but let's take a look at this
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:00.680]  back and forth that's going on between john brennan
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:04.680]  and donald trump over the last weekend now the new american pointed out
[2:49:04.680 --> 2:49:09.560]  on saturday that donald trump and we didn't talk about this too much because
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:12.440]  there's so much else that was happening at press conference that happened on
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:16.280]  wednesday but he pointed out that he had
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:19.800]  essentially done a sting operation on the intelligence services
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:24.520]  to show that it was they who were leaking this information
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:27.960]  because we had the press conference and later on the press conference they point
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:31.720]  out he said i'll tell you what does happen i have many meetings with
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:35.720]  intelligence and every time i meet people are reading about it somebody is
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:38.760]  leaking it out and then they say he went on to explain that he
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:41.640]  considered the possibility that leaks could be coming from his office and he
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:45.880]  said well i thought maybe it's my office because i have a lot of people
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:49.560]  maybe it's them so donald trump hatched a plan
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:53.000]  to ferret out the link and this is what he said in the press conference he said
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:56.600]  and what i did is i said i won't tell anybody
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:49:59.000]  i'm going to have a meeting and i won't tell anybody about my meeting with
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.720]  intelligence and what happened was i had my meeting
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:05.880]  nobody knew not even rona my executive assistant for years
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:09.000]  she didn't know i didn't tell her nobody knew
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:12.760]  the meeting we had the meeting the meeting was over they left
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:15.080]  and he said the only people who knew about the meeting
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:19.160]  were myself and the intelligence community
[2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:23.080]  but word got out immediately that i'd had a meeting
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:28.120]  you see donald trump is not an idiot he knows how to do his own it's like i
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.600]  got a leak i'm gonna just compartmentalize this
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:34.040]  information and then see if it gets out and it did get out
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:37.560]  and that's one of the reasons why he said you know hey uh these guys are acting
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:40.440]  like nazis they put out this fake information on me we have these
[2:50:40.440 --> 2:50:42.840]  meetings i don't tell anybody but them and then they leak
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:46.840]  stuff about the meeting and then we have john brennan coming back and saying
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:50.040]  well i take great umbridge that he would compare to the
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:54.280]  nazis maybe what he should have done is compared them to the soviet union
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:57.480]  and the east german stasi because that's what the former head of the nsa
[2:50:57.480 --> 2:51:00.840]  william benny did and he's exactly right you're like me

[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:41.640]  we don't get massive grants from the government
[2:54:41.640 --> 2:54:46.200]  we don't get grants from george soros and instead they attack us when we sell

[2:54:55.720 --> 2:55:00.440]  over a month and we got in a limited shipment and so it's now available for
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:03.960]  limited time we're going to offer you 10 discount
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:07.560]  off to help you get back stocked back up because it was out for
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:10.680]  a while and again it is a very difficult thing for us to get it's
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:16.120]  because of this key ingredient bio pqq just one batch of that cost
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:21.160]  30 000 and if you want to know how important that is to your cellular

[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:38.520]  very expensive to secure it so a 10 percent discount is a significant
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:42.760]  savings off of this uh it is our i guess our most
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:45.160]  expensive supplement that we have there so 10 percent
[2:55:45.160 --> 2:55:48.200]  is a significant savings again that is now in stock
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:51.400]  as well for a limited time at info wars life
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:55.880]  dot com as i was just reporting donald trump
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:55:58.920]  pointed out in the press conference and there was so much other stuff that was
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:02.920]  going on the press conference it wasn't noticed a great deal but he said hey
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:06.600]  i knew that this information was being leaked so i set up
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:09.640]  a little actually it was a sting if you want
[2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:12.840]  and he compartmentalized this information and he only told these
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:15.720]  intelligence guys about it he said immediately after meeting nobody else
[2:56:15.720 --> 2:56:19.960]  knew about it none of my staff he goes this leaked out to the press
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:25.480]  and that is the basis of that and of course the idea that this thing is
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.560]  absolutely disgusting and false this dirty dossier
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:33.720]  he thanked bob woodward as he blasted the intelligence community over this
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:36.760]  dossier he said thank you to bob woodward who said that
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:40.040]  is a garbage document it never should have been presented
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:43.080]  trump is right to be upset and angry about it
[2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:48.520]  he said this is an article from the hill they say earlier on fox news sunday
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:54.280]  bob woodward from watergate called the dossier a garbage document and i said
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:57.800]  they never should have used it he also said intelligence officials who are
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:57:00.920]  terrific and have done a great work make a mistake here
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:03.880]  and when people make mistakes they should apologize
[2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:07.240]  but they're not apologizing they're doubling down we got
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:11.320]  john brennan coming out and saying donald trump is outrageous
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:15.320]  how dare him compare us to nazis and i pointed out well william benning has
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:18.440]  compared what the nsa is doing in the intelligence communities in
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:22.440]  terms of spying on the american people illegally unconstitutionally he has
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:25.960]  compared it to what he observed for years as a head technical person for the
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:28.920]  nsa he said this is exactly what i saw happening
[2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:34.120]  in by the stasi in east germany and in the soviet union this is what i fought
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:37.320]  against i don't want to see this happen in america
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:40.760]  and of course a lot of people have how many times
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:44.440]  has donald trump been called a nazi by everybody from glenn beck to rachel
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:47.560]  madow but when he says this they take umbridge
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:52.360]  at it according to the cia director john brennan and listen to the condescending
[2:57:52.360 --> 2:57:56.520]  tone that john brennan has he says i think donald trump needs to be mindful
[2:57:56.520 --> 2:57:59.560]  that he does not have full appreciation and understanding
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:03.960]  of what the implications are of going down that road well you know what he
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:06.360]  understands exactly what you're doing john brennan
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:09.640]  that's one of the reasons why he set up his own stinger operation and then
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:12.680]  after you did this and after you push back on this
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:16.440]  donald trump tweeted out to his 20 million twitter followers well
[2:58:16.440 --> 2:58:22.120]  was the cia boss the leaker of fake news he isn't gonna back down you guys
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:25.560]  need to understand that's why there's so much concern
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:29.320]  about what the deep state what the globalists will do
[2:58:29.320 --> 2:58:32.520]  either at the inauguration or shortly after stay with us when we come back
[2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:35.960]  we're going to talk about how barack obama offered us hope
[2:58:35.960 --> 2:58:39.800]  but what we got was chains we'll be right back
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:49.080]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:22.040]  liberty alex jones
[3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:25.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in the next segment
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:28.520]  leon macadoo and oh and short will be taking over and they'll be
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:32.040]  carrying this out through the fourth hour at the time we got left i want to
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:37.080]  take a look at the chains not the change but the chains that
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:42.760]  barack obama has been forging understand that for example in 2015
[3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:46.680]  the congress passed 87 new laws but the bureaucrats
[3:00:46.680 --> 3:00:49.960]  the bureaucracy that really is under the executive branch
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:57.880]  passed 3400 rules it's about 40 times the number of rules as laws
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:02.440]  you understand this is legislation without representation
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:05.480]  this is a permanent bureaucracy that continues to ramp up these rules and
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:09.240]  now we have seen an explosion in the last few days from barack obama
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:13.720]  now many of these organizations like bloomberg will talk about the fact oh
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:16.120]  well you know he doesn't have really that many
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:19.960]  that are that much different and count from george w bush or whatever well
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:22.920]  there's a big difference not just in the quantity
[3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:27.640]  but there's a bigger difference in the quality of these kinds of regulations
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:31.080]  for example one story from the wall street journal pointed out
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:35.400]  that a lot of these executive orders in the past have been very mundane
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:39.560]  you had an executive order from jfk that talked about
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:01:42.520]  the fact that for executive orders themselves you would have a one and a
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:47.480]  half inch margin on the paper that was an executive order so that counts as one
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:51.160]  okay and then george w bush had an executive order that says no
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:53.720]  it's not going to be a one and a half inch margin around the edge
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:58.120]  we're going to have a one inch margin on these printed executive orders
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:02.440]  that counts as one for george w bush and yet barack obama
[3:02:02.440 --> 3:02:05.720]  in terms of qualitative executive orders instead of talking about how wide the
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:09.240]  margin is going to be on the executive orders he spends his
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:16.040]  executive orders in a very big way okay it's not mundane but massive
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:19.960]  the effects of his executive orders what he does is he takes over
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:24.920]  federal uh federalizes land throughout the united states
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:28.760]  three times the amount of land that sent the state of texas he has
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:36.680]  seized illegally unconstitutionally by misusing a 1906 law against that was
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:40.920]  set up to set up monuments and so he declares essentially the state
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:44.920]  of novata as a monument or the state of utah as a monument
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:48.120]  and takes over most of the land in those areas that's
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:52.680]  what barack obama is doing and then of course these executive orders that
[3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:57.400]  come through for very disturbing things that have to do with civil liberties
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:02.360]  take a look for example as i point out the the number of
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:07.160]  things that came out of the epa last week and the department of justice
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:10.600]  involving automobiles and of course it's not only the end of the
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:13.240]  obama administration where they're trying to pile these things on but it's
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:16.120]  also the same time that one of the biggest otter shows of the world is
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.360]  going on in detroit so they seize that moment and they get big
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:25.080]  headlines each and every day and as i said before i said i said this last
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:28.840]  week when i covered it i said somebody in the upcoming department of justice
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:31.400]  needs to take a very close look at these bureaucrats
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:35.880]  who pronounce that they're going to come after Chrysler Fiat for their diesel
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:40.120]  engines one day and tank that stock by 15 percent and then the next day they do
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.520]  it for Renault and tank their stock are these guys involved in insider
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:48.920]  trading remember Nancy Pelosi did exactly that
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:53.080]  sort of thing when she was called on and she said oh there's no rule here
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:56.120]  there's no rule here see just like they're now saying oh
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:00.040]  you know we the uh donald trump can't uh continue
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:03.080]  to run his own business well there's no rule about that
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:06.680]  but he's doing things to try to walk that back ethically now their approach
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:09.560]  was when they got caught doing insider trading they said
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:12.840]  there is no controlling legal authority here you know kind of quoting
[3:04:12.840 --> 3:04:17.240]  algor and then they set up the stock act that was going to stop insider trading
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:20.200]  and then when nobody was looking they eviscerated that act
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:23.960]  they waited about eight or nine months and eviscerated it now it's not legal
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:28.040]  for bureaucrats to do this but i can guarantee you even though i can't prove
[3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:30.760]  it i can guarantee you that there's some bureaucrats there
[3:04:30.760 --> 3:04:34.440]  who are going to be making some golden parachutes by thinking
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:38.280]  these different companies one day after the other
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:41.800]  and just take a look at the difference they're coming after this one guy this
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:47.400]  Volkswagen executive they want to lock him up for 169 years in prison
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:51.480]  because he didn't comply with their regulations
[3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:54.680]  really really that's pretty amazing now when
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:58.760]  rodentrack reports that they said well he kind of lied to the agency so did
[3:04:58.760 --> 3:05:01.800]  hillary clinton stay with us i'm going to do with the hostile press corps well
[3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:04.760]  according to his press secretary alternative media bloggers are to
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:08.520]  become a part of the press corps now the corporate media is freaking out
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:12.040]  at the possibility of breitbart and invoors being allowed to ask questions
[3:05:12.040 --> 3:05:15.160]  we have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[3:05:15.160 --> 3:05:17.800]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move
[3:05:17.800 --> 3:05:22.040]  the trump's incoming white house press secretary revealed yesterday
[3:05:22.040 --> 3:05:25.800]  that members of the alt media may be allowed to join the white house press
[3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:28.920]  corps and take part in press conferences in washington
[3:05:28.920 --> 3:05:31.960]  now this off-the-chart interest in the trump administration
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:35.240]  to the president elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press
[3:05:35.240 --> 3:05:37.320]  briefings to a room with a larger capacity
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:41.480]  sean spicer is attributing since 1970 all official press briefings have been
[3:05:41.480 --> 3:05:44.840]  held in the james s brady room looks like he's moving them over
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:49.400]  one and based on cnn's performance last week where jemma costa was called out
[3:05:49.400 --> 3:05:52.120]  by president elect trump it's a miracle if they are
[3:05:52.120 --> 3:05:55.640]  ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were

[3:08:33.800 --> 3:08:37.080]  and i wanted to get started we always talk about what we want to start with
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:39.960]  we'll start uh with martin luther king's niece she
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:42.760]  comes out today and she says that she voted for
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:47.400]  donald trump on the same day donald trump also met with martin luther king
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:49.960]  jr the third so you have martin luther king's
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:52.920]  niece saying i voted for trump you have martin luther king the third
[3:08:52.920 --> 3:08:56.360]  coming out saying uh coming out and meeting with donald trump of course
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:09:00.120]  today is martin luther king day and while all this is going on
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:06.600]  al sharpton actually had a dc protest today now i was watching some of this
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:10.920]  and he had very low turnout it was actually raining on their parade
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:14.840]  and there's a story here that talks about how the protest
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:21.640]  of sharptons is beyond just donald trump but it's a beef with bipartisan when
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:24.680]  it's actually they are the ones that are hyper partisan here
[3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:29.320]  and kory booker was on the hill preaching and ranting about how
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:32.440]  they'd use this day and use this protest to bring up
[3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:35.480]  more stuff with civil rights humans rights and that's you know we're behind
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:37.640]  all that but we know what they're doing they're
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:40.520]  trying to de-legitimize trump they're trying to act like
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:44.360]  america white nationalist racists are the ones that elected donald trump
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:48.760]  and that's what they're fomenting here in the build-up to all of these protests
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:51.320]  that's that are going to happen on the inauguration
[3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:54.920]  what do you think is going on here leanne do you think uh this is going to
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:09:58.360]  work for them do you think they're going to get more people to come out with
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:01.720]  all of the stuff they're saying protesting sharped in talking today do
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:04.360]  you think this is going to help or do you think this is going to hurt them
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:07.960]  well i think you know um daily caller had a good story out about let's
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:11.560]  let's let's remember what happened when george w bush was getting inaugurated
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:15.320]  i mean it was it was violent protest there they actually had to do away with
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:18.200]  the uh the presidential walk from the car into the
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:21.480]  white house because they were afraid that you know there was going to be riots
[3:10:21.480 --> 3:10:24.520]  people were throwing eggs at his car and everything so
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:28.200]  you know i think that we're kind of seeing history repeat itself here
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:32.200]  frankly those same protesters that were disrupting george w bush's inauguration
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:37.000]  the same people with the same chance are coming around again
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:43.080]  saying um i forget what was kind of like anti-gay go away and and so they're
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:46.680]  they're here again to say the same exact thing for donald trump even though he
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:50.760]  has has yet to do anything that is is showing the gay
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:55.080]  community that he's gonna do anything to repeal um you know how far they've come
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:10:58.440]  so it's just the same exact groups that this is how they continue to get that
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:01.560]  funding year after year is they convince everyone that all of these
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:04.360]  same problems are still there they're never going to go away
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:07.800]  and you know one thing that was really frustrating to me that i was seeing
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:11.960]  um kind of a meme going around social media um it was a quote from martin
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:14.440]  luther king jr where he was saying that one of the first
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:18.840]  things that the racist white people do is they invite the black leaders
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:23.400]  to to tea to coffee and tea and and the black leaders they just can't resist
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:27.000]  that tea and so then they go and the uncle tom
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.960]  with the with the racist white guy and they come out of the meeting going you
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:33.720]  know that they they weren't that bad they were kind of nice i i think
[3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:36.280]  they're going to be good for us or whatever and so there's this meme going
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:38.360]  around so now it's just kind of reinforcing
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:42.040]  hey don't trust donald trump right when all these black leaders go and meet
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:44.760]  with him and come out of the meetings going oh you know what he's really not
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:48.360]  that bad of a guy so it's just like can we kill we can never move on
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:51.480]  it's not about you know what what martin luther king's message was
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:11:54.680]  but the judging people in the content of their character we've completely done
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:58.200]  away with that part of his message well unless we perfectly clear they can try
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:01.640]  to deny that this is some sort of emergency response to
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:05.880]  donald trump's election and the racism that it means
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:09.400]  but no that's exactly what this is they'll try to say it's bipartisan they'll
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:11.880]  try to say human rights this that the other thing no no this is clearly
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:15.080]  because donald trump was elected we know that's what this is
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:19.000]  quit trying to put a mask on it i think it's ironically in
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:21.800]  that you have today's martin luther king day
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:25.240]  and you have al sharpton who's leading these protests
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:29.080]  okay on the hill he's getting people fired up a lot of speakers out there
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:31.960]  you know preaching well there were only a couple hundred
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:35.320]  people that were there as far as the you know citizens that showed up to be a
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:38.200]  part of the protest but he had speakers multiple speakers it was very
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:41.880]  passionate a typical al sharpton type event that you would expect
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:45.800]  but the irony to me is on martin luther king day
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:49.480]  al sharpton is going to have his protest because donald trump is racist and racist
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:51.800]  selected him and people need to be aware of this
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:55.160]  but on the same day martin luther king's niece
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:58.920]  is saying she voted for trump and martin luther king the third
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:02.360]  is actually meeting with trump right so here's al sharpton
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:06.760]  trying to do everything he can to try to undermine donald trump's election
[3:13:06.760 --> 3:13:11.240]  undermine the make america grading and movement try to cast it off as racist
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:14.360]  well but on martin luther king day the actual lineage of martin luther king is
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:18.040]  here talking about trump right exactly and that's that's the issue here it's
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:21.080]  people like sharpton who are these constant race beaters that's what they've
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:24.920]  they're claimed to fame that's how they continue to make their money is by
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:30.280]  constantly dividing the the the races and so they're gonna put out that meme
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:33.400]  oh well don't think that just because martin luther king the
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:36.680]  the third is meeting with donald trump that that's gonna change anything
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:39.880]  don't believe him so they they just do not want to let go
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:43.960]  of this racial division and can't that's all they know is this the identity
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:47.400]  politics that's the problem here they don't know
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:50.760]  anything else they lose on policy their policies have failed
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:54.840]  or are complete pipe dreams so they have to cling they're the bitter clingers
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:58.120]  they're bitter clinging to identity politics and you can see the picture if
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:01.000]  you want to come back to the dot cam all of donald trump's appointments that's
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:04.200]  all the questions they were giving them was all about those social policies
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:07.080]  that they worked so hard to implement are you going to repeal those social
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:11.000]  policies and everyone's like let's talk about jobs let's
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:14.200]  talk about helping our communities you know what why are we still talking
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:17.960]  about these things that you know yeah we're we're working toward becoming a
[3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:21.720]  post-racial america i guess but i mean that's that's what i love so
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:25.080]  much when when asked at the debate how he would heal
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:28.920]  the racial divide and the racial tension in this country and donald trump said
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.000]  jobs that's gonna really make us equal and and
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:37.160]  feel like we're all true i mean this america is for all of us
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:40.760]  it's true that you know look we're not going to sit here and money is not god
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:43.880]  you know that's a sin to put money over god but
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:47.640]  it is just i mean it's just how society works if you have more money
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:51.720]  you're you're more likely to i guess be able to enjoy the things in life that
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:54.760]  you want to do i mean that's that's why people work hard
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:58.200]  yeah putting food on the table and not having to have a worry about me
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:01.880]  out and have the government hand out so you can see though there was about a
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:05.320]  couple hundred people that showed up to this protest cori booker
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:09.960]  he seems to be the new and up-and-coming star of the identity politics
[3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:13.080]  from the left you were talking about how you think he's actually trying to make
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.000]  a bid for a presidential run totally but it's kind of interesting which i
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:20.920]  really enjoy because you have the bernie sander supporters on that end
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:24.280]  they're totally calling out cori booker saying look you
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:27.720]  promised all of these things but then you went and voted
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:32.600]  against what you told us you were gonna um what was it uh raising drug prices
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:36.520]  so he went and voted with big pharma meanwhile he's out there telling the
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:40.040]  democrats these uh the voters that he was gonna be on
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:43.000]  their side but when it pushed came to shove when it came time to make that
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.640]  vote and so you have all the bernie sander supporters
[3:15:45.640 --> 3:15:49.240]  really i mean we saw how um vocal and active
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:53.000]  activated they they are and so they're all like no cori booker so
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:56.360]  it's going to be interesting to see how they even hold their people
[3:15:56.360 --> 3:16:01.320]  that side of the spectrum to task the story with people like cori booker
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:05.800]  john lewis they just cannot let go of identity politics
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:09.880]  that's what it comes down to that's the story period you can't get over identity
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:13.640]  politics you are obsessed with it your entire reality has
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:17.560]  crashed around you and you're still bitter clinging to identity politics
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:21.640]  it's it's unbelievable you think that they could think their way out of this
[3:16:21.640 --> 3:16:25.000]  paradox that they're stuck in but they just cannot do it they truly thought
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.280]  that that was going to be the their thing that they had the card they could
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:31.640]  continue to play that they would win again in a landslide and they it's
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:36.520]  obviously don't get the message america voted entirely against all those social
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:40.120]  policies and that far left progressivism let's talk a little bit about john
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:43.560]  lewis so a lot of people he said that he doesn't
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:47.560]  view president-elect donald trump as legitimate now you'll recall when people
[3:16:47.560 --> 3:16:51.960]  were saying that about barack obama it was racist to say that but when he's
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:54.680]  coming out saying that he doesn't view him as legitimate
[3:16:54.680 --> 3:16:57.960]  that's totally fine and when donald trump slammed him back
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:00.680]  they they said that donald trump really doesn't even have the right to talk to
[3:17:00.680 --> 3:17:04.360]  john lewis because he's a civil rights icon and it's and it's martin
[3:17:04.360 --> 3:17:08.840]  luther king holiday coming up so because he is a civil rights icon and
[3:17:08.840 --> 3:17:11.960]  it's martin luther king holiday you are not allowed to speak to this man
[3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:16.920]  and call him on his on his bias there so let me get this straight
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:20.840]  john lewis says that donald trump is an illegitimate president
[3:17:20.840 --> 3:17:24.440]  why oh because it was the russians that elected donald trump
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:27.960]  so that is completely inaccurate 100 percent
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:32.840]  wrong right now john lewis on the other hand here
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:38.440]  is going to say i guess he thinks that people are going to care what he thinks
[3:17:38.440 --> 3:17:41.240]  he thinks people are going to latch onto this thought that donald trump is
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:43.960]  illegitimate because he's a russian agent
[3:17:43.960 --> 3:17:48.120]  meanwhile this is the all again for some reason irony just
[3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:53.240]  just tickles me okay here's the irony barack obama is the illegitimate
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:57.880]  president his birth certificate has been caught as a forgery
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:02.440]  so we've got cold hard evidence that barack obama is an illegitimate president
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:06.200]  you've got nothing to say that donald trump is an illegitimate president
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:10.280]  but of course where does john lewis go he goes down the fake news route
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:14.120]  trump is a russian agent therefore he's illegitimate but barack obama fake
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:17.560]  birth certificate well i'm not going to comment on that
[3:18:17.560 --> 3:18:21.160]  well and interestingly enough anderson cooper actually
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:24.520]  made the point that if republicans had said
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:28.440]  this about president elect hillary clinton then the democrats would be up
[3:18:28.440 --> 3:18:31.000]  in arms which is totally true which i thought that was
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:34.040]  interesting that he called out on that a hypocrisy there
[3:18:34.040 --> 3:18:37.480]  that if they would have said that hillary clinton was illegitimate because
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:41.640]  you know she was again more proof there than donald trump
[3:18:41.640 --> 3:18:46.760]  and not even close had our had her little private server set up and put our
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:51.000]  national security with a superdelegates exactly yes
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:54.600]  cheated with the superdelegates had rigged for in the first place
[3:18:54.600 --> 3:18:57.800]  she wasn't colluding with media she would have been an illegitimate president
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:19:01.640]  you're right but you know but i don't think john lewis would have had an
[3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:05.080]  issue with hillary clinton i just have a feeling or do you think that they would
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:08.680]  have had a how do you think we would have had 20 republicans
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:12.440]  sitting out trump's inauguration if it was hillary clinton so we were actually
[3:19:12.440 --> 3:19:15.800]  going to get into all of this in the long segment and we were going to take some
[3:19:15.800 --> 3:19:19.480]  phone calls on this too but i have a whole stack of news
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:23.560]  here that is just all about the democrat wine bags
[3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:27.800]  and even more so see the democrats are going to be the ones that are going to
[3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:32.360]  talk about how they're anti-bullying you know stop bullying this stop bullying
[3:19:32.360 --> 3:19:35.000]  that you know you've heard it you've heard the same song and dance
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:39.640]  folks these are the biggest bullies in american politics making death and i've
[3:19:39.640 --> 3:19:42.680]  got a stack of news right here to prove it see i'm not
[3:19:42.680 --> 3:19:46.200]  illegitimate like john lewis where i just say illegitimate within no facts

[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:23.800]  we've had lists of graphics that we put out about this but it was on the drudge
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  report and this is a story uh that the ap ran

[3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:48.520]  that was in the story out of davos and then the

[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:58.440]  all men mostly americans you've got the expected people bill gates number one

[3:25:10.440 --> 3:25:13.160]  you know it's amazing these are the people some of them
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:16.920]  the left would praise and they would love
[3:25:16.920 --> 3:25:20.840]  while they want to get big money out of politics but meanwhile
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:26.440]  you know with antitrust laws places like facebook
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:30.360]  you know i i don't know you have a good you have a good product like
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:33.800]  microsoft facebook people use it you're going to be rich you're going to have
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:36.360]  power that that just comes with the territory but there are supposed to be
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:39.000]  antitrust laws to try to break some of this stuff up
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:43.480]  but are you surprised by this list no it's always the same list and frankly
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:46.840]  it doesn't have any other saudi princes on there i mean they're
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:50.600]  no rock child jack ma no ross child so it's like the super super rich
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:53.960]  they're not even considered they don't even want you to know how filthy rich
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:57.640]  they are or you can't even calculate their wealth right
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:01.640]  because it's so absurd beyond computation it's literally like you break the
[3:26:01.640 --> 3:26:05.320]  calculator trying to figure it out but you know here's the funny thing
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:09.880]  again the left is the the the political left is the one that claims to get big
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:14.920]  money out of politics these protesters what happened to these protesters
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:18.840]  they were just protesting wall street occupy wall street right occupy the rich
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:22.760]  take from the rich to give to the poor all the people on these lists
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:26.760]  donate to the political left every single one of them
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:30.280]  and you're going to sit here and complain that the conservatives or the
[3:26:30.280 --> 3:26:33.960]  republicans or the right is the party of the wealthy now i'm not going to sit
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:37.320]  here and act like there aren't rich people on both sides of the aisle that
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:40.840]  people who make more money tend to be more conservative of course they want to
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:44.840]  conserve what they've earned but it's just ironic to me
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:48.840]  you look at this list allegedly the richest people in the world
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:52.680]  they're all leftist they all give to the democrats
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:56.360]  and yet the democrats the protesters claim that that's what they're out
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:26:59.320]  mobilized protesting is this control right
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:04.440]  ridiculously and i i agree that's there you go just some more insanity but there
[3:27:04.440 --> 3:27:07.640]  you go apparently and then of course the other story is
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:11.960]  those eight men are as rich as half of the world's population
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:14.920]  and that means that they could have called them all white males but
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:19.320]  it was close mostly they did wish that's a good point they were really hoping
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:23.400]  i'm surprised they didn't cater the list to exclude anyone who wasn't a white
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:26.840]  male just as they could run that but
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:30.360]  they claim these eight men have as much wealth as half the world
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:35.080]  some people say that they have like 98 98 9 percent of the wealth
[3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:38.440]  i'm nobody who's going to sit here and try to do those kind of math numbers
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:42.920]  but here's what i do know okay so these people have all the wealth
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:45.240]  all right they're the richest people in the world
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:49.000]  private industry okay we're supposed to believe that that's all fine and good
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.480]  we're supposed to believe that the left wants to get big money out of politics
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:53.880]  while they take money from the richest people in the world okay
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:28:00.200]  now davos is coming up and the headline the story is
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:04.680]  in the wake of the tumultuous year the global elite face a world of uncertainty
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:08.920]  uncertainty so basically the davos group they're getting ready to meet
[3:28:08.920 --> 3:28:12.280]  and because and i mean bill burgl have the same issue
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:15.320]  because they're about to have their meeting and they don't control the
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:19.800]  president of the united states they really don't know what to do
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:23.800]  because so much of what they plan what they talk about what they discuss
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:29.080]  their future all depends on them having the the president of the
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:32.440]  united states on their side in their pocket and they don't have that anymore
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:35.880]  and other global powers right and we're seeing the people rising up across the
[3:28:35.880 --> 3:28:39.080]  globe and they're just thinking wow our global
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:42.680]  economic order is getting the shaft what are we going to do it's very
[3:28:42.680 --> 3:28:45.480]  it's very interesting to see what their little talks will be about this time
[3:28:45.480 --> 3:28:49.240]  around and also too let's not forget the bill burgl website being hacked
[3:28:49.240 --> 3:28:53.160]  saying that they've got 365 days to start working for we the people or they're
[3:28:53.160 --> 3:28:56.920]  going to totally expose them via the prison planet they've created
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:29:00.280]  with all this technology technological surveillance
[3:29:00.280 --> 3:29:04.360]  so the davos group will meet and they're gonna instead of having their normal
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:08.440]  talks about all the economic rigging the financial market rigging all the
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:11.080]  stuff that they normally do they're going to be sitting there pulling their
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:13.640]  hair out oh what do i do what do we do we don't
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:16.440]  have trump uh we're going to lose in france we're going to lose in germany
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:19.000]  we're losing all over the world nobody likes what we've done to the planet oh
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:21.080]  my gosh it's really interesting because i remember
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:25.240]  last year the davos one of the the pack jam pack talks they had
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:29.720]  was about meditation and visualization i bet none of them visualized
[3:29:29.720 --> 3:29:32.600]  what happened i don't think they saw trump coming worldwide
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:36.920]  and just like davos is worried about losing their control over the economic
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:41.080]  path john brennan is complaining about trump on twitter the intelligence
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:45.400]  agencies are worried about trump ruining their monopoly on intelligence
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:48.600]  oh my gosh you're getting trumped all over the place establishment we'll be
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:52.360]  right back the empires on the run
[3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:57.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:02.440]  what's trump going to do with the hostile press corps well according to his
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:05.960]  press secretary alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the
[3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:08.520]  press corps now the corporate media is freaking out
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:12.040]  as the possibility of breitbart and invoors being allowed to ask questions
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:15.160]  we have an article that's up on our website written by steve watson
[3:30:15.160 --> 3:30:19.400]  and it talks about how this unprecedented move the trump's incoming white
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:24.360]  house press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt media may be
[3:30:24.360 --> 3:30:27.720]  allowed to join the white house press corps and take part in press conferences
[3:30:27.720 --> 3:30:31.960]  in washington now this off-the-chart interest in the trump administration
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:35.240]  to the president a lack thinking that he's going to relocate the press
[3:30:35.240 --> 3:30:37.320]  briefings to a room with a larger capacity
[3:30:37.320 --> 3:30:41.480]  sean spicer is attributing since 1970 all official press briefings have been
[3:30:41.480 --> 3:30:44.840]  held in the james s brady room looks like he's moving them over
[3:30:44.840 --> 3:30:49.640]  one and based on cnn's performance last week where gemacosta was called out by
[3:30:49.640 --> 3:30:52.760]  president elect trump it's a miracle if they are ever let
[3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:56.520]  back in the press corps in the capacity that they were well i'm margaret hell

[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:34.360]  you're going to see it all over commercials in fact i get my guess would
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:36.840]  be you're going to see it all over commercials especially
[3:34:36.840 --> 3:34:41.400]  with the high rated events coming up like the super bowl but this is our
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:44.680]  flagship product it is unbelievable alex talks about
[3:34:44.680 --> 3:34:48.200]  how he had a finger that was numb that now
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:51.800]  he can he can he has feeling in the in the tip of his finger again i had a
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:56.680]  shoulder that i tore out of joint some years ago
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:00.600]  and it was always bothering me and nagging me about three months ago
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:04.760]  that nagging went away completely and that was after about six months of
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:09.000]  taking dna force religiously so make sure you give gna force a chance
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.880]  because i'm telling you this is an unbelievable product especially when
[3:35:11.880 --> 3:35:15.080]  you see the science that's coming out about some of the stuff behind this
[3:35:15.080 --> 3:35:17.720]  you're going to see it in the mainstream you're going to be even more
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.480]  um willing to give dna force a try and this is the groundbreaking product we
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:24.280]  started it here first remember that you want to protect your telomere's
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:27.800]  come to the original source dna force 10 off
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:31.080]  info wars life dot com all right so we've already got the lines starting to
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:34.120]  light up but let's just kind of touch on some of the stuff that we're talking
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:37.480]  about here you got democratic legislators who
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:41.160]  are planning on sitting out trump swearing in talk about
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:43.960]  completely low you can't even go that's your job
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:48.040]  yeah so you're of course i wonder how you know i wonder how
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:50.040]  that's if they're going to get anything done or if they're going to be
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:53.400]  cooperative now the officials are estimating
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:57.400]  some 800 to 900 000 people to be at the inauguration i think it's going to go
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:00.840]  over a million leon we actually had there were five million
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:04.040]  people i think that celebrated the cubs world series
[3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:07.160]  if we can't get a million people to come out to donald trump's
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:10.760]  uh the historical inauguration come on folks uh and then you've got all of
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:14.680]  these singers i've got a whole list of singers who have had to back out
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:17.880]  from singing because they're getting death threats at the inauguration
[3:36:17.880 --> 3:36:22.120]  literally a whole stack of news uh andrea bachelet
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:26.440]  um who else do we have here jennifer holliday
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:29.480]  paul anka now he says that that wasn't be from bullying
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:32.040]  uh but then you got toby keith on the other side of the spectrum saying he's
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:35.080]  not going to apologize for performing he's actually proud to play for his
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:38.840]  country and but all these stories just show how the left bullies
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:43.160]  they are the real bullies bullying people out of performing at the
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:45.720]  inauguration oh well you're not going to get a job
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:49.000]  you're not going to be accepted in the industry anymore you can't go perform at
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  donald trump uh springsteen's band the b street
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:57.240]  band saying well you know if bruce asked us not to play we wouldn't play
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:01.880]  hey bruce shut up stick to music you don't know anything about politics you're
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:05.480]  a social justice warrior with a guitar that's it
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:09.160]  and then of course we've got the leaked audio the project veritas video that
[3:37:09.160 --> 3:37:12.520]  came out today so we've got all this going on it's all coming around
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:18.120]  the inauguration leon i'm gonna be there i am not gonna lie i'm a little
[3:37:18.120 --> 3:37:21.160]  afraid alex filed the report about the dirty nuke
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:24.760]  well they're talking about uh these anti fascists we're talking about putting
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:28.200]  uh some acid attacks which is stink bombs
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:33.720]  acid bombs i've stink bombs well it's like a this is a high school prom
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:37.240]  i'm sorry i'm sorry you didn't get invited to the high school prom
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:40.440]  so you've got to ruin it for everyone else by lighting off a stink bomb
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:43.240]  that's that's what's going on here go ahead leon i'm sorry it's ridiculous so
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:46.120]  this is this acid it's it's commonly colloquially
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:50.680]  referred to as uh stink bombs but it'll just evacuate the entire building
[3:37:50.680 --> 3:37:53.720]  there where the deplorable is supposed to be being held
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:37:57.480]  uh but you know i've got a gas mask you know what we if you mess with us we'll
[3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:00.520]  find you will burn your house down i mean these are
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:05.720]  these are fascists who are talking about stopping fascism these are anti
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:08.600]  fascist protests they're holding that they're using violent
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:13.080]  means to protest a free election i mean it's just it's
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:17.000]  absolutely crazy they're giving death threats to an anti war group starting
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  civil war yeah they're giving they're threatening to murder
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.200]  andrea bocelli if he comes the the blind tenor there
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:28.200]  okay so they're attacking a blind man why would you want to experience that man's
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:31.080]  voice i mean it's like exactly well and what's wrong with you
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:35.000]  i think too is they can all kind of take a note from toby keith who's saying
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:38.440]  you know i'm not going to apologize for performing at donald trump's
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:42.440]  inauguration uh because he wants to perform for our country
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:46.040]  and our military he says i won't apologize for performing for our country
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:50.040]  our military and i think people can take a note from that that they should have
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:53.400]  really stood up and came out and said you know what i want to be a unifying
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:58.360]  voice that's why i'm gonna be here and maybe like opened up some uh
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:01.720]  some dialogue with people who are upset about it and had the opportunity to
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:05.720]  really discuss that dialogue but no that's what these fascists want is they
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:08.680]  want to shut you down and silence you all together
[3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:11.560]  they don't want to give the opportunity to open up this dialogue they just want
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:16.040]  to shut down anything that they don't like and i'm really pissed frankly that
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:22.280]  we have these people cowing to this kind of abuse and these violent fascists
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:25.480]  well they're unprincipled to me is what it comes down to
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:28.280]  because i was thinking about this if i'm a musician
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:32.920]  and let's say obama asked me to perform at his inauguration okay i can't stand
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:35.880]  obama i don't like his policies what i perform what i not perform
[3:39:35.880 --> 3:39:40.280]  you know i don't really know but it would be on the principles of his policies
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:44.840]  if i was going to do that i wouldn't get bullied out of it i wouldn't claim
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:49.080]  you know something false accusation like racism or anything like that it would
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:53.640]  be a principled stance but i don't really know i think that what we're witnessing
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:57.320]  is a lot of these musicians getting bullied out of this opportunity
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:01.400]  which is very sad and again exposes the true nature of the left and you see it
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:03.720]  with hollywood too that they're afraid to speak out if they're
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:06.840]  conservatives because they'll they have they fear that their career will be
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:09.880]  ruined and it's just exactly to me it's just
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:13.480]  bullying intimidating well yes and actually we have an actress
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:17.880]  this is uh zoe saldano who came out and admitted that hollywood arrogance helped
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:21.480]  trump win i always knew i liked her she said we got cocky we became arrogant
[3:40:21.480 --> 3:40:25.240]  and we also became bullies we were trying to single out a man for all these
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:28.840]  things he was doing wrong which here i disagree with her she says and that
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:33.160]  created empathy in a big group of people in america that felt bad for him
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:36.440]  and are believing it so no yeah she is wrong about that people didn't vote
[3:40:36.440 --> 3:40:40.120]  because they were feeling bad for donald trump being picked on no people
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:42.920]  voted because they were listening to what he was saying and they believe
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:46.280]  you know what he's what he's promising and frankly he's already
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:49.240]  for he's even in office he's already bringing back the jobs and it's nice
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:52.120]  to see some of these people in hollywood calling out their counterparts
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:55.880]  you know saying hey take a look in the mirror you're the arrogant bully
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:58.840]  you're the reason why trump won so that's refreshing at least all right we've
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:01.720]  got some phone calls here let's start with kelly in
[3:41:01.720 --> 3:41:05.640]  maryland who says she's going to the j-20 protest is that true kelly are you
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:09.800]  going to protest donald trump no not to protest to support
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:14.200]  okay my family and i are very excited we can't wait to go
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:17.720]  so what do you think about this disrupt j-20 plan
[3:41:17.720 --> 3:41:21.480]  to kick off with a bang they say they're gonna have this
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:24.120]  demonstration in front of the vp's house i mean they're
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:27.720]  they're planning some big shenanigans there are you worried
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:34.280]  no not at all i i think that um we have it all under control i think that
[3:41:34.280 --> 3:41:38.280]  i really don't think they're going to do anything we're not afraid well i i got
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:41.640]  a hand it to you kelly you are uh you're less worried than i am i'm
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:44.360]  definitely worried they're going to do something at least try to hit me with a
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:48.520]  stink bomb all right let's go to uh adam in california
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:52.040]  who it will be there for the trump protest adam are you planning on
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:41:56.120]  protesting donald trump or supporting donald trump
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:00.920]  i plan on going to the protest and doing some own shroyer confrontations for my
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:05.720]  youtube channel and nice so you're going are you trying to infiltrate
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:10.600]  the protests uh i may go undercover in the beginning so i can
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:15.080]  record their stines and get some interviews and hear them talking dirty
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:19.560]  but i want to confront the force is strong in this one
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:23.560]  yeah but what i'm really uh worried about is are we going to get 9 11 truth out
[3:42:23.560 --> 3:42:27.880]  of trump that'd be very interesting i think that
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:31.640]  if you're going to get it out of anyone he's the best bet i mean he's the one
[3:42:31.640 --> 3:42:35.800]  that brought up the secret 28 pages he's the one that has questioned
[3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:39.560]  some of the story to begin with he has he's in real estate exactly
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:42.520]  exactly the construction of the building and said it just doesn't make any sense
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:45.880]  that they came down so yeah i mean it'd be very i think you know
[3:42:45.880 --> 3:42:48.520]  pete the people could press him enough for that but
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:51.960]  once he's kind of in there with the goblins it's a little bit different
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:55.320]  then it will be classified at that point and that's the thing we were talking
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:42:58.120]  during the break that all of these uh intelligence agencies are going to have
[3:42:58.120 --> 3:43:00.680]  to make every single thing they discuss with donald trump
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:04.280]  classified so that he doesn't tweet about it but you know what that is such
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:07.880]  an astute observation or question from adam because
[3:43:07.880 --> 3:43:13.480]  if we can break through the shackles of lies from 9 11
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:17.560]  that will do wonders for for i don't even think we can measure
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:20.680]  what that would do for this country and what what what that would do for the
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:24.200]  citizens to come together on that truth because
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:29.000]  folks as soon as people know the truth about 9 11 and what really happened i'm
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.080]  not even gonna sit here and act like i do uh but we know that we've been lied to
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:39.240]  and if the entire collection of american citizens
[3:43:39.240 --> 3:43:43.560]  could learn the truth at the same time i i i think that that would bring us all
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:48.920]  together and that would be just a massive positive
[3:43:48.920 --> 3:43:52.120]  for not just the trump movement or make america great again
[3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:56.200]  just for the entire world america in general to be able to see all the fake
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:43:59.960]  news that was put out there during 9 11 and how people were told to just shut
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:03.960]  up and agree you know don't put out any crazy conspiracy theories you're with
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:07.560]  us or with the terrorists all right hey adam real quick before we let you go
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:11.400]  what's your youtube channel so we can follow the work you do over there
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:14.920]  oh you guys have been following it it's no more news you guys have picked up my

[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:28.280]  you're out there doing the damn thing okay so no more news on the youtube channel
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:31.960]  thank you so much adam all right let's go to jeremy out in new hampshire he's
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:34.680]  going to be going to the inauguration jeremy you're going to protest you're
[3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:39.240]  going to support i'm going to support trump
[3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:44.680]  are you worried i'm not worried i i think trump's gonna do a good job i
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:48.440]  gonna be one of the best president are you worried about the actual event
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:52.680]  though and anything that might go down i'm not worried i don't think nothing
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:55.080]  will go down i think we're gonna have a lot of
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:44:59.320]  safe people there to go out we're gonna have a lot of people there to
[3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:05.400]  keep us safe mm-hmm at least uh yeah five thousand national guard troops
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:08.920]  now you're gonna have bikers for trump too yeah
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:12.520]  a human wall what do you do what do you think about um i know
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:15.800]  when george w bush was being inaugurated they decided to do away with
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:19.800]  some of the traditional presidential things such as the walk from the car
[3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:23.240]  into the white house with the wave do you think donald trump should
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:27.240]  be concerned about his safety and kind of curtail some of those
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:31.720]  traditions uh i don't think so i think he did a lot of
[3:45:31.720 --> 3:45:38.360]  security well he definitely i i believe that he
[3:45:38.360 --> 3:45:41.960]  has his own private security outside of the secret service too i think that he
[3:45:41.960 --> 3:45:44.440]  might be doubling down on security actually i don't even know
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:48.600]  can he even do that as president can you have a private security detail outside
[3:45:48.600 --> 3:45:51.960]  of secret service i wonder that could be interesting because he might not even
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:55.880]  trust some of the elements within the the government
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:45:59.320]  structure of protection so i don't know that's interesting but
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:03.560]  so far nobody claims to be worried about uh what's going on i guess i'm the
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:07.320]  the most nervous nancy of the bunch let's go to eric in california who's
[3:46:07.320 --> 3:46:09.720]  also going to the inauguration there's another person from california traveling
[3:46:09.720 --> 3:46:15.320]  all the way to dc for the inauguration eric are you going to protest or support
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:19.480]  i'm going to support are you worried about any violence or getting hit with
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:23.320]  any stink bombs hell yeah we are worried i'm
[3:46:23.320 --> 3:46:26.920]  very worried i'm listening man i need bulletproof
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:31.320]  vest all that armor everything no i'm not i'm being serious though it's really
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:35.480]  serious they got they got troops on the border of russia
[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:39.240]  they got like all these different little moves they can make
[3:46:39.240 --> 3:46:43.400]  they did just put troops in norway yeah i say obama did attack during the
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:47.480]  inauguration which i'm not trying to cut you all off i don't get a lot of
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:50.680]  scenes to talk on every guy i just want to kind of stay with y'all
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:55.320]  but listen obama he is the worst he is the most
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:47:00.760]  fakest person on the planet he's using this wolf in sheep's clothing tactic
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:05.080]  where he's acting like he's the good cop it's the classic good cop bad cop
[3:47:05.080 --> 3:47:08.840]  you know what i mean he's playing this good cop oh i want the peaceful
[3:47:08.840 --> 3:47:12.840]  transition and everything like that meanwhile he got
[3:47:12.840 --> 3:47:17.240]  everybody else lining up doing all this crazy wow i never
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:22.280]  seen i'm like this is is is benign no it truly is unprecedented
[3:47:22.280 --> 3:47:26.040]  it truly is unprecedented and the crazy thing about what you just said is
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:29.560]  you've got this is this is an illustration of the polarization
[3:47:29.560 --> 3:47:33.640]  you've got a group of people like yourself and me and leanne and a lot of
[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:37.080]  people that are like minor that will say obama will go down as the worst president
[3:47:37.080 --> 3:47:40.520]  of all time then you've got another group of people that say he will be
[3:47:40.520 --> 3:47:45.000]  the greatest president of all time how does that work yeah well that's because
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:50.120]  they see his slick tv persona they buy the wolf and she's they buy the
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:47:53.400]  fake news they don't see what's actually going on that he dropped a bomb
[3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:57.320]  what every 20 minutes during his eight years of of being in office
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:48:01.000]  they don't see that side of president obama all they see is the guy that came
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:05.240]  out smooth jazz obama that went on snl and they follow the fake news
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:09.080]  yeah they see him on espn what was your final comment eric
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:12.680]  um i got a whole bunch of comments but i guess i'll break it down like this
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:15.720]  obama is not even really the first black but he's not even really the he doesn't
[3:48:15.720 --> 3:48:18.600]  even have slave blood you know what i mean like as far as being
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:21.400]  he claims he's black black black he don't even have slave blood
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:25.000]  and and i'm not trying to get all racist and all that but he's the most
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:29.240]  fakers on every level is what i'm trying to say no i hear you and i and you know
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:33.000]  and and people always say and i don't know what it doesn't matter to me
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:36.280]  uh but black white half black half white doesn't matter
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:38.840]  yeah but but this is a point that a lot of people say it's like well you're
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:41.080]  sitting here claiming he's the first african-american president but it's
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:44.360]  not even true if you're going to say what he is then he would say he's happy but
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:48.280]  it doesn't even matter he the truth is and what matters is that he is a total
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:52.040]  fraud and that is what eric nails on the head and that's it
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:55.720]  that's the legacy of barack obama his birth certificate was a fraud
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:48:59.160]  the story of how he got brought up was a fraud everything he's ever said or
[3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:02.920]  done is a total fraud Nobel peace prize award total fraud
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:06.440]  just total fraud across the board thank you so much for the call eric you're
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:10.360]  exactly right himself like the medal of valor or something he's gonna he's gonna
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:14.600]  find a way to give himself an award before it's all said and done
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:18.840]  he's gonna get it by giving biden the award no i forget i'm pretty sure
[3:49:18.840 --> 3:49:22.600]  he awarded himself what was it well it was a medal of it wasn't
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:26.200]  technically him i think it was his cabinet or his administration but he's
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:30.040]  patting himself on the back he has to nobody else will
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:34.840]  because nobody can stand the guy you know and it's just it's just sad
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:38.360]  they're bfs it's just sad and you know what i think
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:41.800]  i think that giving that award to joe biden the distinguished medal
[3:49:41.800 --> 3:49:45.080]  there it is which one was that pulled that story back up president obama
[3:49:45.080 --> 3:49:48.920]  awards himself distinguished distinguish public service yeah
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:52.520]  so there you go obama awards himself of course he has to he has to do anything
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:55.560]  and everything he can to try to cement his
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:50:00.040]  fraud legacy but we know what your legacy is obama
[3:50:00.040 --> 3:50:03.960]  what was it you bombed over 16 countries this year
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:07.480]  the only president ever who's been at war in every single year
[3:50:07.480 --> 3:50:10.760]  every single every single year you drop the bomb every eight minutes
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:14.920]  and he admitted he's very good at dropping bombs and i think that him
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:21.160]  giving that award to joe biden more than anything was a slap in our face
[3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:25.960]  because we know who joe biden really is okay we know you creepy joe
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:30.840]  we know what you do creepy joe okay we've seen the videos creepy joe
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:35.400]  for you to get up there and cry when this fraud is giving you this fraudulent
[3:50:35.400 --> 3:50:40.840]  award this is just a total ceremony of fraud and you're up here crying
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:44.680]  that's why obama did it because he knows that we know who joe biden is a total
[3:50:44.680 --> 3:50:48.440]  sicko creep so he did it right in front of our face to rub it in
[3:50:48.440 --> 3:50:53.240]  and donald trump should rescind that award immediately final segment on the

[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:47.400]  going to be protesting donald trump why is that smithy
[3:55:47.400 --> 3:55:51.560]  well because i am not going to stand by idly
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:57.000]  and have a racist sexist homophobic fan like now smithy may i ask you a
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.480]  question are you are smithy smithy excuse me
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:03.880]  are you identifying as a parrot today are you a parrot
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:08.120]  how rude are you well you're parroting the same buzzword how rude are you

[3:56:12.040 --> 3:56:15.160]  okay you have nothing to say he's so angry donald trump
[3:56:15.160 --> 3:56:19.640]  okay first of all when hillary clinton and barack obama were both still against
[3:56:19.640 --> 3:56:23.800]  same-sex marriage donald trump was congratulating his friend
[3:56:23.800 --> 3:56:26.920]  elton john on his marriage saying that this is this one's going to be for the
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:30.760]  record he's won a war when they tried to stump him on katelyn
[3:56:30.760 --> 3:56:33.320]  Jenner going you know will you let her use the
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:36.520]  same bathroom at trump tower he said she can use whatever bathroom she wants
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:40.360]  and they and that story was dead in the water you need here any of the mainstream
[3:56:40.360 --> 3:56:43.160]  you'd think that they would report that again and again and again
[3:56:43.160 --> 3:56:48.040]  he's the only candidate that's held up an lgbt flag with his name on it he's
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:50.600]  received a word for work he's done in inner cities
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:54.360]  so smithy thank you for smithy thank you for calling in with that troll just to
