[00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.185]  We are on the march.
[00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.347]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:23.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:32.645]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, and we're only four days out.
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:37.287]  Hard to believe, only four days out from the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump.
[00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.669]  Technically, it's like four and a half days out.
[00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:40.509]  I'm still on the road.
[00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:45.071]  I am coming back, and I'll be back in the studio tomorrow, but David Knight will be co-hosting with me tomorrow as well.
[00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:49.894]  Then I'm on an airplane to Washington, D.C.
[00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:55.457]  with the crew, and we are going to be covering the inauguration live there on the ground.
[00:00:56.346 --> 00:01:00.409]  Exciting announcements by somebody I've been critical of, Spicer.
[00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.292]  I've said he should be more hardcore, he should be more aggressive, because the media is not his friend.
[00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:05.713]  They're not going to work with him.
[00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:08.375]  But he's been getting more hardcore, that's a good thing.
[00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:16.902]  And he announced, you notice, that they're going to, quote, have alternative media and bloggers in an expanded Washington press club.
[00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:19.023]  And that sent mainstream media into conniption fits.
[00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:20.765]  But notice, even from Spicer,
[00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:25.304]  The words they're using aren't even proper.
[00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:26.884]  We're not the alternative media.
[00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.865]  We are the independent, real, proven media.
[00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:33.266]  We're better than the New York Times, better than the Washington Post.
[00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:40.208]  Matt Drudge always said that anybody is as important as the New York Times, and I totally agree with that statement, but he's been saying that for 15 years.
[00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:43.309]  They're so discard-longer, since like 1997, I guess, almost 20 years, 19 years.
[00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:56.423]  They are so discredited and are known to be such liars, and so many emails are out showing how they collude with the deep state, that we are better than them.
[00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:59.504]  Until we're ever discredited and exposed as total frauds.
[00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:01.165]  I mean, I would hide my head in shame.
[00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:04.367]  I would disappear if I've been caught in all this criminal activity.
[00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:04.987]  But meanwhile,
[00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:11.735]  The Politico writer who got caught in the email saying, I'm a hack, I'm a fraud, I'll lie for you, tell me what to do.
[00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:15.657]  He's being promoted to a senior position at the New York Times from Politico.
[00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:23.362]  That's a promotion in the world of political dung beetles that roll piles of filth around and kind of shove it down our throats.
[00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:25.083]  So that is a big announcement.
[00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:28.265]  You know, I've had crew ask me, hey, are we going to be in the Washington Press Club?
[00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.306]  Are you going to ask Trump about that?
[00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:32.027]  I haven't even ever brought that up.
[00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.312]  I'm worried about getting Trump into office.
[00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:38.874]  I'm worried about cutting taxes and un-stalling the world economy.
[00:02:38.874 --> 00:02:42.076]  I'm worried about securing the Republic.
[00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:48.640]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, in the new Trump era, he's going to open it up to real press and not just dinosaur media.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.001]  So, of course, but that doesn't matter.
[00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.342]  That doesn't matter.
[00:02:52.342 --> 00:02:53.342]  We're digital.
[00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:55.964]  We're in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:55.964 --> 00:03:01.327]  And so, the way we get questions answered is we just put a special report out and a message to the President.
[00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.951]  And then later he watches it and he listens to it.
[00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.412]  A lot of times late at night.
[00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:07.672]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:03:07.672 --> 00:03:10.353]  So we can just direct our questions directly at Trump.
[00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:11.694]  You can do that on Twitter yourself.
[00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:12.915]  It doesn't mean you'll answer every time.
[00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:14.195]  But let me tell you something.
[00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.696]  You start tweeting at Trump enough, he's reading it.
[00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.877]  And his people are reading it.
[00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:20.238]  This is direct communication, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:24.020]  But yes, I do intend to have a Washington correspondent.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.840]  It's just expensive.
[00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:28.044]  Perhaps somebody that lives in Washington, D.C.
[00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:30.366]  and then who every day goes down there and asks the questions.
[00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.988]  But it is worth it because the Trump people actually answer questions.
[00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:35.470]  So that's part of why we need to raise capital.
[00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.273]  I've been gone two weeks and the crew's done an amazing job.
[00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:41.135]  It'll be two weeks on Wednesday, actually.
[00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:44.498]  There's this big conspiracy theory online about where have I gone?
[00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:46.060]  What's happened to me?
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.501]  Why isn't there video?
[00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.682]  I'll be quite honest with you.
[00:03:49.577 --> 00:04:02.050]  After years of having a video camera in my face and bright lights every day, I have an entire kit here with lights, a backpack, with Skype, with video, with HD, and I just haven't been setting it up.
[00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.874]  I did it one day, and I'm just tired of it.
[00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:07.116]  Tired of looking at my ugly face.
[00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:09.979]  I probably want a break of some type here.
[00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.341]  So David Knightson, the co-host, is with me.
[00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.502]  I'm on the phone.
[00:04:13.502 --> 00:04:15.864]  People tend to like it, though, and it's more intimate.
[00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:22.590]  I mean, I remember being in dark studios with just a microphone in front of my face the first, you know, five years on air or so.
[00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:32.298]  And I'm thinking about maybe once a week or something actually going back to not being video just because at a certain point it's obnoxious.
[00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:35.161]  But I do apologize for the fact that a lot of this has been on the phone.
[00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:38.598]  Quite frankly, I could do with a Skype audio.
[00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:46.186]  It's just, you know, there's actually some kind of reminiscence or something about, you know, old-timey to be on the phone as long as it's a good connection.
[00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:50.471]  Okay, that said, the big news, obviously, is they're planning riots coming up in four days.
[00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:10.847]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:23.930]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.991]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:36.973]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending health care, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:49.544]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:55.429]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:58.651]  This is Owen Schroer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:01.793]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:03.374]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:20.180]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[00:06:25.982 --> 00:06:33.768]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:38.492]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:47.518]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:09.579]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.503]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:22.728]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:22.728 --> 00:07:24.690]  In our quest for the purest iodine,
[00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:31.677]  We drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:31.677 --> 00:07:35.581]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:38.424]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:42.488]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[00:07:42.608 --> 00:07:43.389]  We're good to go.
[00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:06.590]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.220]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.286]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:21.233]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:25.476]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.777]  We have to be good.
[00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:28.638]  We have to be pure.
[00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:29.799]  We have to be strong.
[00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:31.620]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.122]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:41.907]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:50.015]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:56.541]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:19.956]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:21.417]  Move, bitch!
[00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:22.498]  Get out the way!
[00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:30.447]  And that flag is the American flag!
[00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:34.849]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:38.270]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.911]  I will not let you down.
[00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:42.993]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.493]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:09:44.493 --> 00:09:46.614]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:09:46.614 --> 00:09:52.917]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:55.058]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:55.779]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:14.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are only four days out from President-elect Trump becoming the President of the United States.
[00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:22.305]  And already there is an IMF boost growth forecast for the USA, many, many points ahead of what they were believing.
[00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:25.107]  All because of the Trump euphoria.
[00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:31.551]  All because the announcement has been made that the United States of America is open for business yet again.
[00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:36.555]  This is an incredible week of history as DrudgeReport.com says.
[00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:39.076]  It is truly amazing.
[00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:42.519]  We have the FBI arresting the wife of the Orlando nightclub terrorist.
[00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:44.928]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:46.449]  It's time to start going after their families.
[00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:49.090]  I don't spit that like torture their families.
[00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.732]  I'm saying clearly, their families, their mosque, know what they're doing.
[00:10:53.732 --> 00:10:55.753]  They're not apologizing for it.
[00:10:55.753 --> 00:10:57.714]  They think it's funny.
[00:10:57.714 --> 00:11:02.957]  And it's time that we go after people that are aiding and abetting terrorists in this country.
[00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:08.480]  That includes Obama, and that includes Hillary, and that includes John Kerry.
[00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:35.238]  Who all-knowingly created the Al-Nusra Front in Syria six years ago, and who gave them the M-PADS, who gave them the surface-to-air missiles, and who gave them the intelligence, and who gave them the chemical weapons, and who allowed them to attack, and then changed their name to ISIS, and now we even have the leaked audio of Kerry talking to Syrian opposition, admitting, quote, Obama wanted to grow ISIS.
[00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.213]  Yes, five years ago we broke it all down.
[00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:47.496]  We had Colonel Schaefer, Dr. Steve Pchenik, Tosh Plumlee on air, and we had other sources that were not on air.
[00:11:47.496 --> 00:12:04.842]  And now you see the new National Security Advisor to the President, who was the commanding general over military intelligence, over defense intelligence, who sat there and witnessed our government arming Al Qaeda, and the man that led the revolt inside the U.S.
[00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:05.442]  military.
[00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:14.158]  To link up with the Russians and transfer the intelligence to them to take out ISIS-slash-Al Qaeda.
[00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:21.301]  And last year it was in, Military to Military, the new book by Cy Hersh, and he came on the broadcast to talk about it.
[00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:22.141]  See how that works?
[00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.423]  See how much trouble the New World Order is in?
[00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:30.365]  And by the way, the military called Obama's bluff four years ago, remember that?
[00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:33.266]  They said, listen, we're not going to be their air force, and they got Senator
[00:12:34.392 --> 00:12:40.196]  They got Paul to come out, they got Senator Cruz to come out to their credit and say we're not going to be Al Qaeda's Air Force.
[00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:42.037]  Remember that?
[00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:43.758]  That's how far we've come.
[00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:45.859]  That's how much has been exposed.
[00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:48.040]  That's how exciting it is.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:56.826]  And then even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dempsey, got on board and went to Obama on a Friday night and said, you're not going to bomb them Sunday.
[00:12:56.826 --> 00:12:59.127]  It was supposed to start that Sunday in two days.
[00:12:59.127 --> 00:13:02.109]  He said, the military is going to refuse to load the weapons.
[00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:03.310]  You're about to have full mutiny.
[00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:06.265]  And they said, I can have you court-martialed.
[00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:07.486]  He said, I'm not going to do it.
[00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:13.310]  But you go ahead and do that, and all of it's going to come out that you've ordered us to fund Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.212]  So there's been a Mexican standoff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:21.196]  For those of you that don't know what that is, it's where you're aiming a gun at them, they're aiming a gun at you.
[00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.111]  And then somebody else is aiming a gun at both of you.
[00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:30.472]  Basically, a Mexican standoff is in the movie The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, where all three guys are aiming guns at each other.
[00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:32.672]  That's a Mexican standoff, folks.
[00:13:32.672 --> 00:13:37.294]  And that is exactly what we've been in here for about three, four years, okay?
[00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:40.354]  A total Mexican standoff with the New World Order.
[00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:45.175]  And the public has kind of been like the third person with a gun, not knowing who to shoot.
[00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:46.576]  The public hasn't known what's going on.
[00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:49.917]  Meanwhile, the patriots, the military, the intelligence agencies have.
[00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:51.137]  So the biggest hoax out there,
[00:13:52.368 --> 00:13:55.031]  Is that intelligence agencies actually don't like Trump.
[00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:56.533]  They're the whole reason this happened.
[00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:58.175]  And I'm not trying to make them the heroes.
[00:13:58.175 --> 00:13:59.196]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:02.861]  Everybody knows what critics I've been of the intelligence agencies.
[00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:05.143]  But I wasn't there to destroy them.
[00:14:05.143 --> 00:14:06.105]  I was there to reform them.
[00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:07.907]  I wasn't there to overthrow the government.
[00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:08.808]  I was there to restore it.
[00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:11.586]  You see, I'm what you call loyal opposition.
[00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:12.827]  People called me loyal opposition.
[00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:14.608]  Oh, he's that Alex Jones.
[00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:15.869]  He's loyal opposition.
[00:14:15.869 --> 00:14:18.551]  He doesn't want to burn everything down and kill everybody.
[00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:20.213]  Well, if that means loyal opposition, yes.
[00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:21.834]  I want low taxes.
[00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:23.335]  I want what made the country great.
[00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:25.177]  I want true family values.
[00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:26.238]  I want religious freedom.
[00:14:26.238 --> 00:14:27.539]  I want sovereignty.
[00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:28.900]  I want fair trade.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.540]  That's what I want.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.064]  Now, we've got a huge broadcast today lined up for you.
[00:14:34.064 --> 00:14:35.605]  It's become a conspiracy of its own.
[00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:36.566]  Where's Alex Jones?
[00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:38.688]  I took a working vacation for two weeks.
[00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:41.393]  It'll be two weeks on Wednesday I've been gone.
[00:14:41.393 --> 00:14:44.236]  I am flying back today in just a few hours.
[00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:45.097]  Okay?
[00:14:45.097 --> 00:14:49.041]  And what I've seen while I've been out here in different parts of the country is incredible.
[00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.764]  Again, when I tell you this, it's a good news progress report.
[00:14:51.764 --> 00:14:54.086]  It's not bragging.
[00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:58.511]  I am in, the last few days, one of the most liberal areas in the world.
[00:14:59.338 --> 00:15:02.762]  Okay, I never give my location away these days until I'm actually back.
[00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:04.483]  I'll tell you the full story.
[00:15:04.483 --> 00:15:10.369]  I am in one of the most liberal places in the United States, and I have been mobbed.
[00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:17.596]  I go to the trendy restaurants, that's all that's around here, and every waiter's a listener.
[00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:19.999]  I go out to a surf beach,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.422]  The surfers, almost all of them, are listeners.
[00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.844]  And I don't mean just listeners.
[00:15:25.844 --> 00:15:28.827]  I mean, they're like, hey, I heard Michael Schneider on yesterday.
[00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:29.748]  What's the big secret?
[00:15:29.748 --> 00:15:30.829]  What's the big announcement?
[00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:31.950]  What is it you can't talk about?
[00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.292]  Come on, come on, come on, tell me.
[00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:38.316]  You know, I'm at a hotel pool, you know, with the family or whatever.
[00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:40.138]  I mean, I literally
[00:15:41.654 --> 00:15:43.775]  It's like I'm a rock star or something now.
[00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.516]  And I don't say that to go, ooh, I'm a rock star.
[00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:46.616]  I don't care about that.
[00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:47.456]  I don't like that.
[00:15:47.456 --> 00:15:48.777]  I can't stand it.
[00:15:48.777 --> 00:15:51.718]  But it is a byproduct of the success.
[00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:54.699]  And I'm here to tell you the New World Order is in trouble.
[00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:58.781]  I don't care if somebody's black, they're white, they're Asian, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:02.042]  The hottest thing in this country right now is being awake to tyranny.
[00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:04.543]  And we owe that to you, the audience, spreading the word.
[00:16:04.543 --> 00:16:05.384]  We owe it to Drudge.
[00:16:05.384 --> 00:16:08.585]  We owe it to Donald Trump for having the courage
[00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:13.272]  Because of the demonization and the attacks he's gone through.
[00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:17.252]  But just in the last year or so, our audience has more than tripled.
[00:16:17.252 --> 00:16:18.533]  We can see all the metrics.
[00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:20.913]  And so, yes, we've got an uphill battle.
[00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:25.874]  But I'm telling you, this is really, really, really, really exciting.
[00:16:25.874 --> 00:16:27.574]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:16:27.574 --> 00:16:29.935]  And there's a lot of threats coming up.
[00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:30.875]  We're going to break those down.
[00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.135]  A lot of key clips I want to go over.
[00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:34.656]  And also a lot of exciting news.
[00:16:34.656 --> 00:16:35.576]  It's starting to happen.
[00:16:37.345 --> 00:16:50.992]  Trump's people and Trump are starting to tweet out, as well as Fox is starting to pick up, wait a minute, the Saudi Arabians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians openly gave money to Hillary and openly lobbied for her.
[00:16:50.992 --> 00:16:52.533]  We have proof!
[00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:53.374]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:16:53.374 --> 00:16:54.734]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:16:54.734 --> 00:17:02.779]  You know, again, Trump's got a lot going on and a lot happening.
[00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:04.500]  And, you know, personally,
[00:17:05.755 --> 00:17:13.900]  I have sat there and just said, look, the OPM hack, 20 million names, you know, proof, you know, the Russian thing's all bull, of course it is.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.842]  Well, we've got to do something about this.
[00:17:16.842 --> 00:17:22.586]  You know, the Chinese Communist bragged that they gave money to Hillary, so the Saudi Arabians, and it just gets lost in the wash.
[00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:26.699]  And I'm just not going to go into it.
[00:17:26.699 --> 00:17:28.379]  The point is, that's what Trump needs to do.
[00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:29.720]  I know it.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.721]  They are accusing him of what they have been caught doing.
[00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.622]  So the good news is, I have a couple clips here, it's starting to come out.
[00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:42.984]  It's starting to get in the news that, wait a minute, these other countries admittedly got involved and said, don't vote.
[00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.346]  For Trump and gave money.
[00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:48.310]  We have them red-handed.
[00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.433]  I know it's not as sexy and cool.
[00:17:50.433 --> 00:17:51.714]  It's the Russians, the Russians.
[00:17:51.714 --> 00:17:55.539]  And I'm not putting the Russians down when I say they can't even get their act together.
[00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:59.885]  They've been under communism for 79 years before they started unraveling this.
[00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:06.351]  And they've really been growing despite the sanctions and a lot of reforms from what I've studied, what I've read, and people I've talked to.
[00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:09.555]  But still, Russia admits they're trying to stabilize themselves.
[00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:13.199]  And they've got Islamic terrorists attacking them in like 10 different bordering nations.
[00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:14.720]  So they've got corruption issues.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.263]  They're not manipulating anything.
[00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:23.176]  There is solidarity in that Russia has been under the same globalist economic assault.
[00:18:23.176 --> 00:18:25.997]  Now, David Knight's going to be taking over at the end of this hour.
[00:18:25.997 --> 00:18:27.859]  I want to just say he's done a fabulous job.
[00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:29.440]  David, what else is on your radar?
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.960]  What are you going to be covering today?
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.422]  Well, Alex, you just mentioned the Ukrainian situation.
[00:18:33.422 --> 00:18:36.123]  Of course, this is a story that broke gust Wednesday on Politico.
[00:18:36.123 --> 00:18:41.967]  We're going to go into that a little bit more detail because it was kind of overshadowed by the press conference that Donald Trump had.
[00:18:42.527 --> 00:18:51.735]  But there were efforts that were documented by Politico between DNC officials and someone connected with the Ukrainian government as well as the Ukrainian embassy.
[00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:55.078]  We're also going to talk about hope and chains.
[00:18:55.078 --> 00:18:56.779]  Not change, but chains.
[00:18:56.779 --> 00:19:06.507]  We have Barack Obama and the EPA and the Department of Justice are really cracking down on a wide variety of regulations in the last days.
[00:19:06.507 --> 00:19:10.070]  And of course we've talked about that, but I want to focus on some specifics.
[00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.231]  This
[00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:21.054]  Automobile executive that is accused of violating regulatory requirements in terms of emission standards is facing 169 years in jail.
[00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:24.915]  And let's be clear, David, that's meant to make them roll over to charges that aren't true.
[00:19:24.915 --> 00:19:32.197]  They want to shake down every automaker for $4 billion with these impossible emissions standards that you pointed out that is total racketeering.
[00:19:32.197 --> 00:19:33.318]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:33.858]  Continue, David.
[00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:48.604]  Yeah, and key to that too, Alex, is every day last week, from Tuesday through Friday, every single day, first they arrest a VW executive, then they announce some additional fines they've put on Volkswagen, then they went after Fiat Chrysler the next day, then they went after Renault the next day.
[00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.785]  Why are they doing so much focusing on the automobile industry?
[00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:52.205]  Well, for two reasons.
[00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:57.508]  They're putting this narrative out there while the big Detroit auto show is going.
[00:19:57.508 --> 00:20:03.210]  They did it, waited until one day after it started to start doing this, to send a message, as you're pointing out, to send a message to them.
[00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.793]  Also, it's part of the globalist agenda that they've got going here.
[00:20:07.793 --> 00:20:30.971]  But Alex, as I mentioned last week, I really believe that the Trump administration, somebody in the Department of Justice, really needs to take a close look at the bureaucrats who are leaving and see if somebody is using that to... We need to start indicting bureaucrats because they admit they want a post-industrial world, they admit they want a car-free world, they admit they want to tax carbon, which is a full attack on humanity itself.
[00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:31.852]  That's powerful info.
[00:20:31.852 --> 00:20:33.253]  What else is coming up, David?
[00:20:33.593 --> 00:20:37.056]  Well, we're also going to be looking at the media gatekeepers that are being shown the door.
[00:20:37.056 --> 00:20:38.698]  We're going to look at the details of that.
[00:20:38.698 --> 00:20:43.463]  We're going to be looking at some information that's developed, as I said, about Ukraine.
[00:20:43.463 --> 00:20:46.125]  And we're also going to be taking a look at what Russia is doing.
[00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:51.931]  You know, there's all this talk about Mexico building the wall and helping us to build a wall on the border.
[00:20:51.931 --> 00:20:54.814]  Russia actually came out and said, we will work with
[00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:57.777]  Lithuania to put a wall along the border.
[00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:00.480]  The Lithuanians say they want a wall to protect themselves from the Russians.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.922]  The Russians say, hey, we'll give you the bricks to do that.
[00:21:02.922 --> 00:21:08.728]  So taking them up on that, it's an interesting back and forth in terms of the Cold War that's started.
[00:21:08.728 --> 00:21:13.533]  And of course, it also involves the attacks on Donald Trump by the Intelligence Committee.
[00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:17.877]  And Donald Trump pushed back on that today, coming right after John Brennan, who
[00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:26.124]  Did a slap down on Donald Trump over the weekend on the talk shows and said it was outrageous what he did to say that the intelligence community was involved.
[00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:27.605]  Well, they were involved.
[00:21:27.605 --> 00:21:29.887]  We're going to talk about how we know they were involved in that.
[00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:37.874]  But then Donald Trump came out and said that he asked, is John Brennan the one who leaked that phony dossier on me?
[00:21:37.874 --> 00:21:39.435]  So he put that out to all of his Twitter.
[00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:41.356]  That's a lot you're going to be covering.
[00:21:41.356 --> 00:21:41.997]  Thank you so much.
[00:21:41.997 --> 00:21:44.319]  Dave, we'll be back towards the end of the hour.
[00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:46.241]  I'm going to start rolling into the news I've got in front of me.
[00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.882]  And it's funny, he just brought up Brennan.
[00:21:47.882 --> 00:21:52.787]  That's exactly the clip I want to play, where Brennan basically said, watch what you say, Trump.
[00:21:52.787 --> 00:21:54.728]  You're endangering the world.
[00:21:54.728 --> 00:22:00.974]  This is the same Brennan, the head of the CIA that reportedly converted to Wahhabism, lived in Saudi Arabia more than a decade.
[00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:04.157]  This is the same guy that's been caught putting out fake intelligence.
[00:22:04.737 --> 00:22:14.020]  This is the same guy, again, that has done so much and who was overseeing our government's CIA when the OPM hack happened.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:19.462]  20 million names of all of our contacts, all of our spies, all of our assets.
[00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:19.722]  I think?
[00:22:37.077 --> 00:22:57.201]  Worldwide, and then he has the nerve to sit there and claim that if we have a terror attack, it's Trump's fault, when they're the ones that have opened up our borders, they're the ones that have gotten Europe to open up their borders, they're the ones that have flooded us with these military-age men, 80% of the quote, refugees that are invaders, and then they have the nerve to set it up after they've brought the sleeper cells into this country,
[00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:11.213]  And after tens of thousands of surface-to-air missiles are missing, given to them in Benghazi, and I've had the CIA contractors on with the witnesses of them delivering the missiles four years ago, the last straw for our military.
[00:23:11.213 --> 00:23:21.041]  So when there are terror attacks, or when MPADs are used, you notice they're covering up that it's MPADs when these airliners are getting shut down, because that points right back at them.
[00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:22.563]  So again, everything they do,
[00:23:23.323 --> 00:23:25.204]  Everything they do, they blame on us.
[00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:26.465]  They're getting foreign money.
[00:23:26.465 --> 00:23:28.026]  They're using foreign money in the election.
[00:23:28.026 --> 00:23:29.467]  They blame the patriots.
[00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:30.928]  They're working for foreign powers.
[00:23:30.928 --> 00:23:32.810]  They're globalists destroying our sovereignty.
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.111]  They claim we work for foreign powers.
[00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:37.893]  Everything they say about us is really what they're doing.
[00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:40.395]  Here's a clip of John Brennan.
[00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:47.740]  What do you think of his plans, his prescriptions, what he's saying about these various trouble spots, crises, challenges around the world?
[00:23:48.439 --> 00:23:54.447]  Well, what I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him.
[00:23:54.447 --> 00:23:57.291]  It's about the United States and national security.
[00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:02.898]  And he has to make sure that now that he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security as opposed to talking and tweeting.
[00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:07.520]  He's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.602]  national security interests are protected and are advanced.
[00:24:10.602 --> 00:24:14.903]  And so I am very much hoping that he has some very good people that he has pulled together.
[00:24:14.903 --> 00:24:19.345]  Jim Mattis, Mike Pompeo, John Kelly and others.
[00:24:19.345 --> 00:24:22.846]  I think they are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel
[00:24:23.406 --> 00:24:31.571]  About what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions.
[00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:42.937]  Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests and so therefore when he speaks or when he reacts is to make sure he understands that the implications and impact the United States could be profound.
[00:24:42.937 --> 00:24:47.700]  Again, it's more than just about Mr. Trump and it's about the United States of America.
[00:24:49.466 --> 00:24:52.110]  So, more implications that Trump's an idiot.
[00:24:52.110 --> 00:25:02.743]  Oh, these elites are going to talk to him and us down their noses while they leave the borders open, while they let diseases pour in, while they do everything they can to sabotage and turn off our power plants.
[00:25:02.743 --> 00:25:04.746]  They're going to say, this is bigger than Mr. Trump.
[00:25:04.746 --> 00:25:07.570]  This is about the United States of America that they're trying.
[00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:14.801]  To compromise into a global corporate government waiving all of our sovereignty via the TPP.
[00:25:14.801 --> 00:25:19.763]  So they have the nerve to claim he's trying to supplant America and make it all about him.
[00:25:19.763 --> 00:25:21.063]  That's the new narrative.
[00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:30.026]  When they're the ones making it all about them, creating multinational bodies and unelected multinational boards that they transfer all the power to.
[00:25:31.836 --> 00:25:32.717]  Think about that.
[00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:35.579]  Everything he said was an inversion of reality.
[00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:39.682]  This is the devil-like, snake-like people we're talking about.
[00:25:39.682 --> 00:25:42.044]  I mean, it is satanic.
[00:25:42.044 --> 00:25:45.246]  You can't just say everything backwards the way they do.
[00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:46.787]  I mean, this is beyond poetry.
[00:25:46.787 --> 00:25:51.851]  This is beyond any type of satanic logic I've ever even thought of.
[00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:54.513]  The way these guys invert reality perfectly.
[00:25:55.073 --> 00:26:03.640]  I mean, Brennan must be some entity from the pit of hell, and of course I'm being somewhat sarcastic here, but you listen to anything he says, and it's a complete lie.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.083]  It's like Clapper saying this.
[00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:10.046]  The NSA doesn't spy on anybody it ever has inside the U.S.
[00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:11.467]  It was even declassified at that point.
[00:26:11.467 --> 00:26:12.428]  They've been doing it for decades.
[00:26:13.294 --> 00:26:18.619]  It's just like the press secretary years ago saying there is no drone program.
[00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:26.686]  Years after it was publicly admitted with thousands of strikes, Gibbs said it doesn't exist because they're training us to accept lies.
[00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:33.311]  They're assaulting us with disregard and hate to basically try to mutate our brains.
[00:26:33.311 --> 00:26:34.993]  Now continuing here with some more of the clips.
[00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:44.892]  Let's go ahead and get to this report, this short clip from Fox, getting into what we were just mentioning, the fact that, oh, Ukraine was involved piling on.
[00:26:44.892 --> 00:26:47.074]  Well, I've said that a hundred times.
[00:26:47.074 --> 00:26:48.976]  The only question is, who wasn't?
[00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:50.978]  The Mexican government piled on.
[00:26:50.978 --> 00:26:53.160]  Spanish TV, one of the biggest powers in this country.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.761]  We're good to go.
[00:27:24.804 --> 00:27:26.261]  Please, here's that Fox clip.
[00:27:27.654 --> 00:27:28.975]  Well, this is new.
[00:27:28.975 --> 00:27:34.600]  There's a new report, and it says the Ukrainians were trying to sabotage the Trump campaign.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.881]  You better tell us what this is about.
[00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:36.621]  This is in Politico.
[00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:37.642]  It's interesting.
[00:27:37.642 --> 00:27:48.611]  Ukrainian government officials allegedly tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Donald Trump by publicly questioning, A, his fitness for office, and his ties to Russia.
[00:27:48.611 --> 00:27:56.298]  And they tried to put out, disseminate some documents that linked his then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Trump to Russia.
[00:27:56.818 --> 00:28:03.260]  This did not sit well with the Ukrainians who then thought, we don't want a guy who appears to be, in their minds, friendly to Russia.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.960]  You know, it never came to anything.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.001]  Clearly the Russians are much better at this business than the Ukrainians.
[00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:13.043]  But Manafort was, and ultimately resigned from the campaign.
[00:28:13.043 --> 00:28:16.123]  But there is a sense out there that Ukraine tried.
[00:28:16.123 --> 00:28:23.145]  Also did some background and research for Clinton aides to see if they could get any more dirt on Trump and his links to Russia.
[00:28:23.145 --> 00:28:25.186]  So they were wildly unsuccessful.
[00:28:25.506 --> 00:28:26.747]  And of course, that itself is a huge whitewash.
[00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:29.950]  The Democrats have turned Ukraine into a giant cash cow for themselves.
[00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:30.711]  Joe Biden's son...
[00:28:51.042 --> 00:29:00.927]  Heads up a company that sells $4 billion worth of gas a year out of one pipeline, they've got several, to Western Europe.
[00:29:00.927 --> 00:29:05.650]  Hundreds of millions of dollars pouring in to his company now out of that.
[00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.150]  Pretty good!
[00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:18.477]  You know, he just got out of college, his dad's the vice president, they just hijacked the country with Soros, they just overthrew a government that was elected, and then they turn it around and say the Russians invaded Ukraine.
[00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:24.255]  Kind of like CNN said, the Russians invaded Georgia in 2008.
[00:29:24.255 --> 00:29:29.219]  Of course, back then, I wasn't as sophisticated as I am now, and I'm still not sophisticated.
[00:29:29.219 --> 00:29:32.222]  I got up at 6 a.m.
[00:29:32.222 --> 00:29:34.283]  There was the news, Russia has invaded Georgia.
[00:29:34.283 --> 00:29:36.906]  I actually believed it until I got to work.
[00:29:36.906 --> 00:29:40.148]  And people were calling, going, Alex, that didn't happen that way.
[00:29:40.148 --> 00:29:40.889]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:40.889 --> 00:29:41.389]  Stay with us.
[00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:43.031]  I got big news straight ahead on the inauguration.
[00:29:48.726 --> 00:29:51.731]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.731 --> 00:29:55.357]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:02.029]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:06.850]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:12.432]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[00:30:12.432 --> 00:30:28.955]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt-media may be allowed to join the White House press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington.
[00:30:29.335 --> 00:30:32.477]  Now this off-the-chart interest in the Trump administration.
[00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:37.741]  The President-elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity.
[00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:43.705]  Sean Spicer is attributing, since 1970 all official press briefings have been held in the James S. Brady room.
[00:30:43.705 --> 00:30:56.133]  Looks like he's moving them over one and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[00:30:56.133 --> 00:30:58.795]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:30:59.235 --> 00:31:00.056]  Hey, everyone.
[00:31:00.056 --> 00:31:02.337]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:02.337 --> 00:31:06.200]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.261]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:18.548]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:18.548 --> 00:31:24.532]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:24.992 --> 00:31:39.829]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:40.529]  I think so.
[00:31:59.124 --> 00:32:04.547]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in the battle for freedom.
[00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:06.949]  And the information war is paramount.
[00:32:06.949 --> 00:32:18.496]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars.com and send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcast and download the free iPhone and Droid apps at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:23.139]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.

[00:32:27.082 --> 00:32:27.582]  And finally,
[00:32:27.742 --> 00:32:31.825]  We have launched our new free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:33.926]  You can download it on iPhone and Android.
[00:32:33.926 --> 00:32:41.390]  Once you've downloaded the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app, you can then if you choose pay $4.95 a month to get InfoWars Prime.

[00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:51.697]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much as 50% off for members of
[00:32:52.517 --> 00:32:54.419]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:19.880]  I love it.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.623]  So I can talk to the boss.
[00:33:23.623 --> 00:33:26.506]  Haha, love it!
[00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:49.904]  Again, I really talked about this a lot on yesterday's show with David, but I'm going to recap it right now to get into all the new news that's developing that David's coming up at the end of the hour for the Ballots to Transmission.
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:34:02.152]  And that's that there were more than 10 articles I personally had up in my browser from the Associated Press, Reuters, AFP, Yahoo, you name it, where they have the headlines.
[00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:07.079]  Global elite look to China to save globalism.
[00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:08.400]  World government in crisis.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:16.425]  Davos Group admits the rise of nationalism led by Trump and the American patriots shakes the global order to its core.
[00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:19.247]  Just a month and a half ago they had New York Times headlines.
[00:34:19.247 --> 00:34:22.048]  What is globalism?
[00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:22.729]  Is it real?
[00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:33.830]  And then the whole article was yours truly, basically them saying, this crazy man believes there's a global banking cartel that's establishing a planetary government and carbon tax.
[00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.632]  And again, they know full well it's all real.
[00:34:35.632 --> 00:34:44.821]  They're selling that in a giant con to their readers, who they know they can't hide it from anymore, going, does the Pacific Ocean exist?
[00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:46.643]  Someone claims it's made of water.
[00:34:48.684 --> 00:35:00.534]  So, I mean, it's bizarre psychological warfare, but I guess it's meant to just stonewall people so that they don't know what to say, or so that the debate becomes, does it exist or not?
[00:35:00.534 --> 00:35:02.355]  But that isn't working anymore.
[00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:04.797]  That's the good news.
[00:35:04.797 --> 00:35:06.418]  It's not working at all.
[00:35:06.418 --> 00:35:08.020]  That's a very exciting time to be alive.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:15.986]  Now, separately, real fast, ladies and gentlemen, we have funded this operation with super high quality products
[00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:20.918]  And obviously, I've been gone for two weeks, so I haven't been belaboring this like I should.
[00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:32.802]  David Dunn has been doing a great job talking about it, but when I tell you the super metal vitality that we just got a limited supply back in of, or bio-true selenium are game-changing, life-changing, I mean, they've changed my life.
[00:35:32.802 --> 00:35:38.825]  When I tell you that Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, is just absolutely, totally essential, it is.
[00:35:39.688 --> 00:35:48.948]  It's crazy how so many people are deficient in these, or the amounts that are claimed that you need are much lower than what you really need from my research.
[00:35:48.948 --> 00:35:50.771]  All I know is it funds our operation.
[00:35:51.613 --> 00:35:53.895]  They're amazing products, and you need them.
[00:35:53.895 --> 00:36:08.851]  Whether it's the Oxy-Powder to flush out your guts, or Bio-Truth Selenium, or Lung Cleanse, or Living Defense, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:36:44.107 --> 00:36:44.407]  Also,
[00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:56.166]  We went out and found the very best company in the United States, plus the guys that have the patent on it, where it has the brass inserts, so it can go as long as aluminum, in many cases, or steel, or, in some cases, longer.
[00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:58.528]  Some have fired 60-plus thousand rounds through it.
[00:36:58.528 --> 00:37:00.329]  These AR-15 lowers.
[00:37:00.329 --> 00:37:02.530]  You can also have customized designs added to them.
[00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.012]  They're Magpul accessory colors.
[00:37:05.012 --> 00:37:06.633]  They have everything.
[00:37:06.633 --> 00:37:13.278]  And, again, when you purchase these from Infowars.com, we just simply have them drop shipped to you from Tennessee.
[00:37:14.142 --> 00:37:34.522]  Where they're produced, so build your own AR, find out more at InfoWarsStore.com and the really big one, no one else has this but us other than state police and now the military's getting it, Tactical Nano Technology Body Armor, previously only available to military and law enforcement, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:36.765]  This is so insanely good and listen,
[00:37:37.425 --> 00:37:40.246]  I don't have this because I'm worried about a mass shooting in an airport.
[00:37:40.246 --> 00:37:42.167]  I don't have this for things like that.
[00:37:42.167 --> 00:37:45.728]  I have this in my vehicle, obviously, because I'm a target.
[00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:53.250]  But I also have this because it's super lightweight, it can be in your backpack, and it is just over-the-top incredible.
[00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.692]  I mean, you can shoot it with, you know, Desert Eagle .50 caliber ammo.
[00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:01.493]  We've even shot handgun rounds through rifles, and it hasn't gone through.
[00:38:02.453 --> 00:38:04.915]  The Pentagon isn't saying that it stops rifles yet.
[00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.657]  They're coming out with that soon.
[00:38:06.657 --> 00:38:09.119]  But they've got vests, they've got the backpack inserts.
[00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:10.800]  We have the lowest prices.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.421]  It's produced right here in America.
[00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:15.684]  It was developed at the University of Texas in Austin.
[00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:17.265]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:38:17.265 --> 00:38:20.368]  Infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:20.368 --> 00:38:25.852]  But listen, I have this.
[00:38:25.852 --> 00:38:27.093]  Because we hope to fix things.
[00:38:27.093 --> 00:38:28.234]  And we hope to turn this around.
[00:38:28.234 --> 00:38:30.056]  But the globalists are trying to cause a civil war.
[00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:59.945]  Just having your concealed carry or other states obviously have laws you can just concealed carry or open carry without you know any of the regulations on you makes you start thinking about security for the time you need it and that just overall having the general public having body armor this is the type you can wear all the time or carry with you and having firearms and being properly trained in them creates an absolute atmosphere where criminals basically almost become extinct and so
[00:39:01.298 --> 00:39:09.203]  It really is our duty as men, but also as women, to know how to use firearms and to really start getting our minds in a security perspective.
[00:39:09.203 --> 00:39:13.005]  And again, I'm not the know-all, the end-all person on this.
[00:39:13.005 --> 00:39:14.766]  I'm not up here lecturing anybody.
[00:39:14.766 --> 00:39:20.049]  I'm talking about what I am personally trying to do in my own life.
[00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:21.610]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.291]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:25.812]  Please support all of our affiliates as well.
[00:39:30.976 --> 00:39:42.639]  Well, let's get into some good news, then we'll get into the really serious news about Anarchist and others and what these Soros-funded groups are planning to do coming up at the inauguration.
[00:39:42.639 --> 00:39:49.221]  And for me, I probably should have led with this story today, but so many positive things are happening, I didn't get to it yet.
[00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:57.303]  But there are stories up on InfoWars.com with leaked audio of the group saying they plan to shut things down right away.
[00:39:57.303 --> 00:39:59.244]  They quote, want a big bang.
[00:40:01.013 --> 00:40:03.175]  They admit they want to shut down the inauguration.
[00:40:03.175 --> 00:40:04.176]  We're going to be there.
[00:40:04.176 --> 00:40:06.318]  I'm going to be there covering it live.
[00:40:06.318 --> 00:40:12.143]  You know, I get back to the States today, or get back into the main United States today, I then
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.163]  Uh, from there, obviously, leave Wednesday, right there to D.C.
[00:40:17.163 --> 00:40:28.453]  But, InfoWars, in fact, I'm just directing the listeners, everybody, I know David's got a lot of important stuff coming up, but we probably should air that leaked audio from Shepard Ambulance's article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:28.453 --> 00:40:35.399]  We need to get into the fact that they're planning a major destabilization, and this ties in to how they're trying to basically have a coup in this country.
[00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:42.305]  And this soft coup needs a civil unrest crisis to get itself off the ground.
[00:40:42.305 --> 00:41:00.963]  And if you see the dozens and dozens of Hollywood movies, and if you see the news articles every day, and the brainwashing in the public schools and the colleges, and just the pushing everywhere that white people are racist out to get black folks, it is an attempt to create an atmosphere where this country is a powder keg
[00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:10.414]  Or MSM can basically then activate through the media groups of people to go out and engage in carnage.
[00:41:10.414 --> 00:41:16.378]  I'm talking about black, white, Hispanic, you name it, but leftist hoodlums to create a civil emergency.
[00:41:16.378 --> 00:41:20.582]  We've talked about all the preparations for this and Michael Moore calling for this and we've
[00:41:21.497 --> 00:41:29.619]  We've talked about all the different groups that have been pushing it and Rosie O'Donnell and everybody else, but then you look at Congressman John Lewis.
[00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:33.660]  Let me pull up some of these articles I've got here.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.942]  Lewis comes out, as you know, last Friday and says,
[00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:40.309]  Illegitimate.
[00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:41.390]  Trump shouldn't be president.
[00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.811]  He's not going to attend the deal.
[00:41:42.811 --> 00:41:44.392]  He thinks the Russians put him in.
[00:41:44.392 --> 00:41:45.473]  This guy's a fraud.
[00:41:45.473 --> 00:41:48.255]  So they're moving to overturn his election.
[00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:50.317]  They're moving in that direction very, very strong.
[00:41:50.317 --> 00:41:56.903]  Trump comes out very nicely and says, you want to be worried about collapsing inner cities where your community lives.
[00:41:56.903 --> 00:41:58.544]  I'm trying to get jobs in there.
[00:41:58.544 --> 00:41:59.225]  I need your help.
[00:41:59.765 --> 00:42:05.693]  So that was a really, really nice thing to say when somebody's calling you a traitor, when somebody's saying you work for the Russians.
[00:42:05.693 --> 00:42:08.977]  I mean, that is fighting words, okay?
[00:42:08.977 --> 00:42:11.800]  I mean, that is serious defamation.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.862]  How does the media respond?
[00:42:12.862 --> 00:42:14.504]  And I have stacks of news articles.
[00:42:15.211 --> 00:42:16.472]  You're saying it.
[00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:23.620]  The New York Times comes out and says black communities hurt by his words, by Trump's mean words to them.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.965]  Why would he attack a civil rights icon?
[00:42:27.965 --> 00:42:30.448]  And if you just typed in his name and look at the headlines today,
[00:42:31.738 --> 00:42:36.443]  In Trump's feud with John Lewis, blacks perceive a callous rival.
[00:42:36.443 --> 00:42:37.544]  So it's about race.
[00:42:37.544 --> 00:42:39.827]  This guy says he's a Rooski agent.
[00:42:39.827 --> 00:42:42.469]  He says, work with me to help your communities.
[00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:43.771]  Please, I need your help.
[00:42:43.771 --> 00:42:44.772]  Sir, this isn't helping.
[00:42:44.772 --> 00:42:45.813]  Oh my God!
[00:42:50.104 --> 00:42:50.745]  This is crazy.
[00:42:50.745 --> 00:42:52.087]  John Lewis says you're a Russian agent.
[00:42:52.087 --> 00:42:52.928]  You're not legitimate.
[00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:54.310]  The voters in this country don't count.
[00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:09.669]  We're going to ignore you.
[00:43:09.669 --> 00:43:11.150]  You shouldn't be president.
[00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.552]  And then Trump says, hey, I want to work with you.
[00:43:13.552 --> 00:43:14.372]  Come on.
[00:43:14.372 --> 00:43:17.915]  And they turn it around that he doesn't like black people.
[00:43:17.915 --> 00:43:23.639]  I mean, folks, this is a next level of disinfo.
[00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:25.620]  This is crazy.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.160]  Listen to this one.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:26.981]  The Boston Globe.
[00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:33.065]  Donald Trump picked the wrong foil and civil rights hero John Lewis.
[00:43:33.065 --> 00:43:34.166]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:43:34.166 --> 00:43:35.106]  On MLK weekend.
[00:43:36.807 --> 00:43:41.330]  Trump picks a fight with civil rights hero John Lewis.
[00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:41.851]  Did you hear that?
[00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:44.052]  It was on MLK weekend.
[00:43:44.052 --> 00:43:45.533]  Trump picks a fight.
[00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:46.774]  Did you hear it, folks?
[00:43:46.774 --> 00:43:51.838]  It wasn't John Lewis on Friday who chose to launch the attack so they could say it was on Martin Luther King.
[00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:53.099]  Notice how they set this up.
[00:43:53.099 --> 00:43:54.180]  Trump isn't thinking like that.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:55.941]  You're a rooskie.
[00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:56.921]  You didn't get elected.
[00:43:56.921 --> 00:43:58.142]  You're a fraud.
[00:43:58.142 --> 00:43:59.302]  You shouldn't be in office.
[00:43:59.302 --> 00:44:00.102]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:00.102 --> 00:44:01.803]  No one should come to your inauguration.
[00:44:01.803 --> 00:44:03.304]  Biggest insult you could put out.
[00:44:03.304 --> 00:44:04.784]  Trump's like, I'd like to work with you.
[00:44:04.784 --> 00:44:08.406]  How about you do that and help your community instead of sitting there saying stuff like this?
[00:44:08.406 --> 00:44:09.206]  This isn't helping.
[00:44:09.206 --> 00:44:10.667]  That's a tweet.
[00:44:10.667 --> 00:44:11.487]  Totally reasonable.
[00:44:11.487 --> 00:44:12.508]  Totally nice.
[00:44:12.508 --> 00:44:13.648]  Nicer than I'd be.
[00:44:13.648 --> 00:44:17.310]  Oh my gosh, I'm Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.471]  He was mean, right?
[00:44:21.594 --> 00:44:23.196]  It's crazy.
[00:44:23.196 --> 00:44:29.484]  I have had two white people, Bob and on vacation, walk over to me, young people, and say, Alex, I used to listen to your show.
[00:44:29.484 --> 00:44:32.267]  And I said, OK, why don't you listen to me more, because I always want to tell you.
[00:44:32.267 --> 00:44:34.530]  And they said, well, Black Lives Matter.
[00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.194]  I don't know why you don't like black people.
[00:44:37.194 --> 00:44:38.495]  And I said, OK, so let me guess.
[00:44:38.495 --> 00:44:39.797]  In both cases, you go to college.
[00:44:40.603 --> 00:44:45.028]  They're all inculcated into that, that your worth is admitting you're a bad person.
[00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:45.589]  I said, I'm sorry.
[00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:47.031]  I haven't done anything bad to black people.
[00:44:47.031 --> 00:44:48.132]  I love black people.
[00:44:48.132 --> 00:44:50.115]  I mean, I judge them just like any other person.
[00:44:50.115 --> 00:44:52.537]  And most black people see through all this control.
[00:44:52.537 --> 00:44:54.059]  But I mean, this is, I mean, he's fine.
[00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:55.421]  Dislike me.
[00:44:55.421 --> 00:44:58.545]  And he's like, well, one guy's like, well, what about what the cops do to people?
[00:44:59.372 --> 00:45:01.074]  Gather bad cops, bro.
[00:45:01.074 --> 00:45:01.814]  Go after them.
[00:45:01.814 --> 00:45:04.276]  But statistically, it's super rare.
[00:45:04.276 --> 00:45:05.597]  Is the police state wrong?
[00:45:05.597 --> 00:45:06.478]  Are our rights violated?
[00:45:06.478 --> 00:45:07.359]  Some, absolutely.
[00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:09.160]  I'm a guy that's written books on it.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:15.405]  But I mean, when Soros wants us to have a civil war and burn down things and kill cops, I'm not going to be part of that.
[00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:19.028]  I want to fix the country, not burn it down.
[00:45:19.028 --> 00:45:23.872]  So it's definitely the new religion in this country, and it's completely out of control.
[00:45:24.898 --> 00:45:35.867]  Now, coming up in the next hour, Knight's got a lot of big reports and a lot of things he's going to be breaking down, but there are two non-bound reports that I meant to get to in this hour, but I've got more I've got to cover so I can't get to it yet.
[00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:37.428]  I really want to get those reports aired.
[00:45:37.428 --> 00:45:41.010]  One of them is on the coup d'etat they're trying against Trump.
[00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.992]  Very powerful, four minutes long.
[00:45:42.992 --> 00:45:48.716]  The other deals with shadow government and missing nukes and things like that.
[00:45:48.716 --> 00:45:54.221]  Very powerful, but both those are going to be posted to InfoWars.com in one article right now.
[00:45:55.161 --> 00:46:02.503]  We should think of a powerful headline like, Special Reports Breakdown Missing Nuclear Weapons Threat Inside USA.
[00:46:02.503 --> 00:46:06.024]  You know, is it a threat to Trump inauguration?
[00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:08.205]  Maybe something like that.
[00:46:08.205 --> 00:46:14.907]  And then under it, put links to the missing Minot nukes and then to our report of Dias and the missing nukes.
[00:46:14.907 --> 00:46:18.928]  And mainstream media may take the bait on this and say it's fake news when it isn't.
[00:46:18.928 --> 00:46:20.809]  They'll probably even say Minot didn't happen.
[00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:27.714]  But I always wish they'd sent the FBI or anybody over to my office to say, where's your nuke story?
[00:46:27.714 --> 00:46:28.895]  You made that up, boy.
[00:46:28.895 --> 00:46:29.656]  But I didn't.
[00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:30.937]  No, we didn't make that up.
[00:46:30.937 --> 00:46:35.901]  Notice that's why Lindsey Graham came out the same afternoon freaking out.
[00:46:35.901 --> 00:46:40.365]  This is a warning of nukes missing and Charleston being nuked.
[00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:42.727]  They panicked in case those suckers did go off.
[00:46:42.727 --> 00:46:45.289]  They'd have a cover story claiming that it was Al Qaeda.
[00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:46.921]  Remember?
[00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:52.806]  That was when the military was refusing to back the takeover of Syria for Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:52.806 --> 00:46:56.989]  It's when the soft coup against Obama was happening as a counter-coup.
[00:46:56.989 --> 00:47:01.593]  And then the missing nukes got dug up, put on 18-wheelers, the police freaked out.
[00:47:01.593 --> 00:47:03.555]  There was an hour-long confrontation.
[00:47:03.555 --> 00:47:09.019]  The base commander came out and ordered them to let the nukes and two 18-wheelers roll out.
[00:47:09.019 --> 00:47:12.522]  And of course, where did I have that information?
[00:47:12.522 --> 00:47:15.164]  Notice nobody challenged me on it, because they better not.
[00:47:15.825 --> 00:47:19.007]  Just like I told you, the Secret Service told us Hillary Clinton's falling down all the time.
[00:47:19.007 --> 00:47:20.248]  A month later it happened.
[00:47:20.248 --> 00:47:22.750]  I was from the Secret Service.
[00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:28.034]  Okay, I'm not going to get into who gave us this other information, but let me tell you, the government knows.
[00:47:28.034 --> 00:47:29.955]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:47:29.955 --> 00:47:32.417]  So, this is a real issue.
[00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:35.580]  People keep asking me, will there be a tactical nuke at this event?
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.440]  Will there be a tactical nuke?
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.823]  I haven't really brought that up, because I don't think there will be.
[00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:40.203]  Okay?
[00:47:40.203 --> 00:47:42.985]  Because they've got devices that can test for them, that can look for them.
[00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:44.026]  If a nuke does go off,
[00:47:45.032 --> 00:47:46.213]  We know it's the globalists.
[00:47:46.213 --> 00:47:47.774]  We know they have the means.
[00:47:47.774 --> 00:47:48.674]  They have the history.
[00:47:48.674 --> 00:47:52.516]  They've been the ones that have been pushing to remove Trump.
[00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:55.118]  They've been the ones that have been pushing to stop all this.
[00:47:55.118 --> 00:47:55.938]  But here's the good news.
[00:47:55.938 --> 00:47:57.499]  Globalism's in crisis.
[00:47:57.499 --> 00:47:59.180]  World government's in crisis.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.704]  They've gone from denying this whole world government exists to now openly admitting it.
[00:48:04.704 --> 00:48:06.925]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:15.854]  We're going to see bikers for Trump and other great groups there to counter the communists and the anarchists and the other George Soros scumbags.
[00:48:15.854 --> 00:48:17.195]  They're demoralized.
[00:48:17.195 --> 00:48:17.855]  They're a joke.
[00:48:17.855 --> 00:48:19.236]  Soros is quasi-retired.
[00:48:19.236 --> 00:48:25.439]  His quizzling joke of a son, deranged son, is taking over the empire.
[00:48:26.592 --> 00:48:29.595]  So we're seeing a real degeneration here in their system.
[00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:32.638]  And just like Cleveland, we outnumbered them 5 to 1.
[00:48:32.638 --> 00:48:36.281]  Every patriot has always said, I want to march on Washington.
[00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:38.123]  But we politically marched on it peacefully.
[00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:49.933]  I want everybody to come and be peaceful and be in D.C., especially if you're on the East Coast, in Georgia or the Carolinas or Virginia or Maryland or New York or any of those, New Jersey.
[00:48:51.421 --> 00:48:53.102]  There is absolutely no excuse, folks.
[00:48:53.102 --> 00:48:55.122]  You have got to come there.
[00:48:55.122 --> 00:49:03.385]  Even if you stay 50 miles away, because all the hotels are checked out, you need to come to this and be part of history, because everybody wanted this march on Washington.
[00:49:03.385 --> 00:49:04.445]  We've done it.
[00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:05.565]  It's happening.
[00:49:05.565 --> 00:49:09.326]  It doesn't mean everything's perfect, but so much is going on that's so good.
[00:49:09.326 --> 00:49:14.248]  Already the IMF is saying, now our economic outlook is good, when they were saying it was bad just a year ago.
[00:49:14.888 --> 00:49:16.809]  Already hundreds of billions are coming back.
[00:49:16.809 --> 00:49:19.730]  A trillion plus in the stock market.
[00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.290]  Chrysler announcing they're moving back to the U.S.
[00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:24.271]  Ford announcing they're moving back to the U.S.
[00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:27.172]  And how does Obama respond in his last week?
[00:49:27.172 --> 00:49:28.892]  Now four days left.
[00:49:28.892 --> 00:49:32.773]  Criminal indictments, criminal probes of heads of companies.
[00:49:32.773 --> 00:49:34.834]  Four billion dollar fines on U.S.
[00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:40.415]  companies to shut them down and to stop them moving back into the United States.
[00:49:40.415 --> 00:49:41.816]  I mean, you think about the open
[00:49:42.801 --> 00:49:47.062]  Willful economic sabotage that is taking place.
[00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:53.754]  In organized crime against this republic, it is truly mind-boggling.
[00:49:53.754 --> 00:49:55.415]  Now, I've got a lot of other news I didn't get to.
[00:49:55.415 --> 00:49:57.276]  I'm going to file some reports on the road today.
[00:49:57.276 --> 00:49:59.557]  I'm about to go to the airport.
[00:49:59.557 --> 00:50:03.619]  And again, David's going to be doing a great job hosting today and tomorrow.
[00:50:03.619 --> 00:50:07.902]  And then I'm going to be back in studio tomorrow with him.
[00:50:07.902 --> 00:50:12.725]  But I've got a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, a lot of preparation to go to D.C.
[00:50:12.725 --> 00:50:13.805]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:50:13.805 --> 00:50:15.506]  A lot of exciting things are happening.
[00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:23.335]  The MSM wants their monopoly over information, but of course now Trump's announcing he's going to have independent media.
[00:50:23.335 --> 00:50:34.964]  I wouldn't call it alternative, but independent, free, proven, people's populist new media is going to be inside the press conferences now.
[00:50:34.964 --> 00:50:45.192]  A lot of really exciting things are happening as we break the monopoly of information, as we break the monopoly of globalist control, and as more and more freedom comes back into the world.
[00:50:45.192 --> 00:50:46.013]  This is a very
[00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:52.737]  Very exciting time to be alive, and all of you share in this victory of every race, color, and creed.
[00:50:52.737 --> 00:50:53.397]  I salute you.
[00:50:53.397 --> 00:50:55.279]  I'm Alex Jones for the InfoWar.
[00:50:55.279 --> 00:50:58.162]  We'll be right back with David Knight from the InfoWars News Center in Austin.

[00:51:36.976 --> 00:51:38.816]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:51:38.816 --> 00:51:40.517]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:51:59.773 --> 00:52:00.433]  Hello again.
[00:52:00.433 --> 00:52:01.454]  My name is Gary Clark.
[00:52:01.454 --> 00:52:08.036]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[00:52:08.036 --> 00:52:12.998]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[00:52:12.998 --> 00:52:19.161]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved one.
[00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:22.322]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[00:52:22.322 --> 00:52:27.144]  I neglected to mention how One World Whey Protein Powder has affected my life.
[00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:31.426]  Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[00:52:31.426 --> 00:52:34.227]  One World Whey solved my irregularity.
[00:52:34.227 --> 00:52:38.769]  I'd been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:42.350]  Three weeks on One World Whey set me on a new path.
[00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:45.732]  That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since.
[00:52:45.732 --> 00:52:47.152]  Will it work the same way for you?
[00:52:47.152 --> 00:52:47.993]  I don't know.
[00:52:47.993 --> 00:52:48.753]  It worked for me.
[00:52:49.153 --> 00:52:52.060]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.

[00:54:15.276 --> 00:54:16.657]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:16.657 --> 00:54:18.418]  I'm David Knight here live in the studio.
[00:54:18.418 --> 00:54:20.639]  You just heard Alex Jones live on the road.
[00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:23.301]  He's going to be going to the inauguration later this week.
[00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:32.706]  We're going to have a very long marathon coverage of the inauguration starting early in the morning and going till late at night on Friday as well as
[00:54:33.722 --> 00:54:35.122]  Alex Jones being there live.
[00:54:35.122 --> 00:54:39.383]  Of course, we're going to talk about the concern of the mainstream press.
[00:54:39.383 --> 00:54:45.525]  The mainstream gatekeepers are now freaking out because they're being shown the door.
[00:54:45.525 --> 00:54:49.306]  But it's actually an enlargement from this room where they had only 49 people.
[00:54:49.306 --> 00:54:53.747]  I guess it would be the fabulous 50 of the media elite only allowed there.
[00:54:53.747 --> 00:54:57.807]  They're saying, hey, we're going to set up something where we can be more inclusive.
[00:54:57.807 --> 00:54:58.948]  But they don't want that.
[00:54:58.948 --> 00:54:59.848]  Essentially, they've got
[00:55:00.408 --> 00:55:04.753]  A guild, a union that is pushing back pretty hard against the Trump administration.
[00:55:04.753 --> 00:55:06.575]  We've got a lot of news that's coming up today.
[00:55:06.575 --> 00:55:08.917]  Of course we have today is Martin Luther King Day.
[00:55:08.917 --> 00:55:14.042]  Many of you are off of work today and we look at this plan by John Lewis.
[00:55:14.042 --> 00:55:15.764]  I think it was a plan to try to
[00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:23.611]  Further this racism narrative, you know, they've got Donald Trump is a Russian agent, Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, Donald Trump is a racist, and so forth and so on.
[00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:28.016]  All the things that they've called you, the deplorables who voted for him.
[00:55:28.016 --> 00:55:30.878]  But they tried to run this through on Martin Luther King Day.
[00:55:30.878 --> 00:55:36.384]  And of course today, Donald Trump had planned to go to the new African American Museum in Washington, D.C.
[00:55:36.384 --> 00:55:39.547]  They put out word he was not welcome, I guess, so that's been cancelled.
[00:55:40.047 --> 00:55:48.796]  But we're going to take a look at how Lewis's plan is unraveling, just like Barack Obama's executive orders will be unraveling in about a week's time.
[00:55:48.796 --> 00:55:50.358]  You're going to see a lot of those gone.
[00:55:50.358 --> 00:55:59.668]  But before we do, I want to talk about, I want to throw to this John Bowne report, a Trump coup is a maximum moment of crisis.
[00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:01.390]  Here's that report from John Bowne.
[00:56:02.438 --> 00:56:02.618]  I think?
[00:56:24.758 --> 00:56:25.218]  I think so.
[00:56:40.472 --> 00:56:40.932]  We're good to go.
[00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:05.445]  I think so.
[00:57:27.859 --> 00:57:29.901]  Well, totally and completely made up.
[00:57:29.901 --> 00:57:35.965]  Now folks are asking, is this from hackers 4chan and their spoofing board, their famous trolling board, the king of the trolls?
[00:57:35.965 --> 00:57:37.766]  Or is this opposition research?
[00:57:37.766 --> 00:57:38.486]  Well, it's both.
[00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:40.087]  This is opposition research.
[00:57:40.087 --> 00:57:42.089]  Mark Dice correctly called it two days ago.
[00:57:42.089 --> 00:57:47.772]  This is opposition research where they just cook up a bunch of lies and a bunch of disinformation and start floating it out there.
[00:57:47.772 --> 00:57:52.155]  It then got floated on the web back before the Republican primaries over a year ago.
[00:57:52.155 --> 00:57:54.297]  We're talking, this happened like 16 months ago.
[00:57:55.218 --> 00:57:59.781]  What happened in late 2015, this is just incredible, was the first time this stuff started floating around.
[00:57:59.781 --> 00:58:06.065]  The sky is the limit, and let me assure everybody, I said this a month ago, got picked up by a lot of different publications.
[00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:10.928]  You can simply Google Alex Jones, CIA, planning to kill Donald Trump.
[00:58:10.928 --> 00:58:12.750]  Now the media kind of took what I said out of context.
[00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:21.156]  I said the fact that they're announcing continuity of government, the fact that they're announcing COG, the fact that they're announcing that they believe Russians have basically taken over the government, that's what they're saying.
[00:58:21.156 --> 00:58:22.657]  They're claiming Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:58:23.197 --> 00:58:24.718]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:24.718 --> 00:58:25.458]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.455 --> 00:58:51.316]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:51.316 --> 00:58:52.637]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:52.637 --> 00:58:53.858]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:53.858 --> 00:58:59.142]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:59.142 --> 00:59:12.692]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:12.692 --> 00:59:14.053]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:14.813 --> 00:59:16.474]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:16.474 --> 00:59:19.034]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:19.034 --> 00:59:20.335]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:20.335 --> 00:59:21.455]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:21.455 --> 00:59:22.795]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:22.795 --> 00:59:27.277]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:27.277 --> 00:59:30.458]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:30.458 --> 00:59:33.619]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:33.619 --> 00:59:34.679]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:34.679 --> 00:59:36.600]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.640]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.341]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:40.461]  And...
[00:59:41.201 --> 00:59:42.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.328]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.328 --> 01:00:18.011]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:18.011 --> 01:00:19.674]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.674 --> 01:00:24.202]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.499 --> 01:00:37.002]  I have the cover of USA Today here in front of me with their weekend edition.
[01:00:37.002 --> 01:00:39.923]  Trump's cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[01:00:39.923 --> 01:00:43.966]  That's right, they're going to disrupt the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:43.966 --> 01:00:50.290]  And all the things Trump is delivering on in spades, and he has committed to the American people, he's committed to me.
[01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.931]  I'm just going to leave it at that so the media doesn't have another heyday with it.
[01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:56.293]  That he's going to deliver, or basically, die trying.
[01:00:56.293 --> 01:00:57.634]  He is going all out.
[01:00:57.634 --> 01:01:00.756]  And that's why we're seeing this unprecedented move
[01:01:01.196 --> 01:01:09.362]  This unprecedented move right now to disrupt the inauguration and to actually try to sell the American people on an overthrow of Trump.
[01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:14.146]  The establishment, the globalists are trying to convince themselves that they can try some coup.
[01:01:14.146 --> 01:01:19.430]  Remember, in the last month I've been warning you that they're trying to launch a continued government
[01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.251]  We're good to go.
[01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:45.138]  We're good.
[01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:04.114]  I think so.
[01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:34.912]  Now, CNN, just three weeks ago, had a talking point that they put out that I didn't put a lot of attention on, but they said, civil emergency, national emergency.
[01:02:34.912 --> 01:02:37.433]  I then talked to my sources at CNN.
[01:02:37.433 --> 01:02:39.333]  We also have sources inside ABC News.
[01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:40.834]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:02:40.834 --> 01:02:51.096]  And they said that they are seriously wargaming, just like they got caught before the Gulf War both times, in 1991 and 2003, wargaming the attacks with the exact targets drilled
[01:02:51.496 --> 01:02:52.677]  We're good to go.
[01:03:21.616 --> 01:03:22.477]  We're good to go.
[01:03:36.493 --> 01:03:36.873]  We're good to go.
[01:03:56.349 --> 01:04:11.881]  Civil unrest in and around the inauguration, Trump being arrested, Trump being indicted, the news announcing he's a Russian spy, basically overthrowing the president, putting it into a constitutional crisis, and a national emergency being declared.
[01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:24.350]  It's been intensifying with these rogue intelligence agencies coming out with reports that Russians turned off the East Coast power, or that Russians planned to turn off the East Coast, or that they had a laptop, and then, okay, the laptop didn't even have the software on it.
[01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:25.371]  It's all totally made up.
[01:04:25.911 --> 01:04:28.393]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[01:04:59.781 --> 01:05:01.843]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[01:05:01.843 --> 01:05:06.667]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:12.251]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:23.901]  We have an article, it's up on our website, written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt media
[01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:28.843]  Maybe allowed to join the White House press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington.
[01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:32.305]  Now this off-the-chart interest in the Trump administration.
[01:05:32.305 --> 01:05:37.567]  The president-elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity.
[01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:43.290]  Sean Spicer is attributing, since 1970 all official press briefings have been held in the James S. Brady room.
[01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:55.907]  Looks like he's moving them over one, and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[01:05:55.907 --> 01:05:58.631]  Well, I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:03.552]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:06:03.552 --> 01:06:14.556]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extractors.
[01:06:14.636 --> 01:06:19.701]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:06:19.701 --> 01:06:22.263]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:24.004]  It helps detoxify.
[01:06:24.004 --> 01:06:26.867]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:06:26.867 --> 01:06:31.651]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:06:31.651 --> 01:06:35.775]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:06:36.195 --> 01:06:43.319]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:44.939]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[01:06:44.939 --> 01:06:45.920]  This is so key.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.262]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:06:50.262 --> 01:06:52.463]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:19.748]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.341]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:29.165]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Martin Luther King Day, January the 16th, 2017.
[01:08:29.165 --> 01:08:34.129]  And of course, as part of Martin Luther King, I believe it was a celebration of that.
[01:08:34.129 --> 01:08:40.695]  I believe it was an effort by John Lewis and Chuck Todd to try to revive this Trump is a racist.
[01:08:40.695 --> 01:08:42.917]  If you voted for him, you're a racist meme that's going on.
[01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:45.760]  Coming apart.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:54.107]  This idea that Trump is not legitimate, trying to recycle yet again, the Russians did it, the hack and everything, that is all coming apart.
[01:08:54.107 --> 01:09:01.233]  Even the idea that they're going to boycott, some of them are going to boycott, you know, even Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are going to boycott the inauguration.
[01:09:02.242 --> 01:09:06.886]  And so, we've got Bernie Sanders now saying that he will attend the inauguration.
[01:09:06.886 --> 01:09:12.009]  He says, saying that the Trump presidency is illegitimate is nothing but words.
[01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:14.271]  He said, those are just words, said Bernie Sanders.
[01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:23.958]  Right now, what my job is, is going beyond media conflicts and the words to say that Donald Trump, among other things, told the American people he would not cut Social Security and so forth and so on.
[01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.860]  In other words, he said, I want to focus on policy.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.001]  I want to make sure that Donald Trump does the things that he said he's going to do.
[01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:29.781]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:34.723]  If you want to have a discussion about policy, whether you agree with Donald Trump or you disagree with Donald Trump, that's fair game.
[01:09:34.723 --> 01:09:36.144]  That's always fair game.
[01:09:36.144 --> 01:09:41.646]  And of course, there are areas where Bernie Sanders says, hey, I agree with Donald Trump on TPP.
[01:09:41.646 --> 01:09:46.848]  He may not agree with Donald Trump on TPP for exactly the same reasons, but they both agree that it's not a good thing.
[01:09:47.634 --> 01:09:48.715]  And they can do a better deal.
[01:09:48.715 --> 01:09:53.358]  And they may have a disagreement as to how that final trade agreement would look with various nations.
[01:09:53.358 --> 01:09:55.420]  But the bottom line is that he would work with Donald Trump.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:00.884]  As I pointed out yesterday when I talked about John Lewis, John Lewis opposed NAFTA.
[01:10:00.884 --> 01:10:05.487]  And he also opposed the NSA when George Bush was doing it.
[01:10:05.487 --> 01:10:09.330]  But when Barack Obama did it, he didn't have a problem with the NSA.
[01:10:10.765 --> 01:10:16.426]  John Lewis also opposed the year 2000 China trade agreement.
[01:10:16.426 --> 01:10:21.207]  So those are areas where he could work with Donald Trump, but instead he's chosen to play the race card.
[01:10:21.207 --> 01:10:26.909]  He's chosen to try to double down and delegitimize the Trump presidency, unlike Bernie Sanders.
[01:10:26.909 --> 01:10:33.390]  You know, Bernie Sanders has a good point here in saying that he's not going to come back and call it illegitimate.
[01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:37.691]  I think that he understands that the mainstream media hacked
[01:10:38.775 --> 01:10:41.017]  The primaries for Hillary.
[01:10:41.017 --> 01:10:43.279]  The DNC hacked the primaries for Hillary.
[01:10:43.279 --> 01:10:45.341]  Why don't we ever hear anybody talk about that?
[01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:49.685]  You know, Breitbart has a story out, was Hillary Clinton's nomination legitimate?
[01:10:49.685 --> 01:10:51.928]  Was she a legitimate candidate?
[01:10:51.928 --> 01:10:59.455]  And here's a person who violated national security in so many different ways, she should have been facing trial, not an election.
[01:11:00.592 --> 01:11:02.813]  That's truly the idea.
[01:11:02.813 --> 01:11:08.797]  So here's six reasons why she was not legitimate as a nominee.
[01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:11.439]  They said, first of all, the Democrats rigged the primary.
[01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:14.101]  We saw that with the leak of that information.
[01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:16.022]  That's what they don't want you to focus on.
[01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.723]  That's what was exposed.
[01:11:17.723 --> 01:11:21.326]  And so they create this conspiracy theory about the Russians.
[01:11:21.326 --> 01:11:22.327]  So that you don't look at that.
[01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:24.328]  You don't look at their superdelegate system.
[01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:26.069]  You don't look at the money machine.
[01:11:26.069 --> 01:11:29.271]  You don't look at the media hacking it for Hillary.
[01:11:31.292 --> 01:11:35.393]  You didn't prove the Russians did, but we do have proof that the media colluded with Hillary.
[01:11:35.393 --> 01:11:39.214]  So they rigged the nomination against Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:39.214 --> 01:11:48.035]  And of course, they broke and bent the law to keep her running for president instead of putting her on trial.
[01:11:48.035 --> 01:11:51.136]  That's the key thing that you need to take away from all of this.
[01:11:51.136 --> 01:11:55.296]  So of course, it was the Democrats who hacked the nomination away from Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:55.296 --> 01:11:56.897]  That's one of the things a lot of people were upset about.
[01:11:56.897 --> 01:11:58.397]  One of the reasons why she lost.
[01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:10.973]  But then this is also interesting as we've got coming up from Martin Luther King Day, John Lewis makes this failed attempt to label Trump as a racist.
[01:12:10.973 --> 01:12:17.638]  Martin Luther King's niece came out today and is reported by American Thinker, I voted for Trump, she said.
[01:12:18.624 --> 01:12:23.228]  Miss Alveda King, we've interviewed her multiple times here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:12:23.228 --> 01:12:28.293]  Alex has had her on several times because she's a person of principle.
[01:12:28.293 --> 01:12:31.096]  She's not a political hack.
[01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:32.938]  So that's the difference.
[01:12:32.938 --> 01:12:42.807]  John Lewis, when he was 25 years old, he did a lot of things that made him a legend in the civil rights movement.
[01:12:42.807 --> 01:12:43.528]  Did some good things.
[01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:48.578]  But now, here we are, after 30 years as a congressman, what has he done?
[01:12:48.578 --> 01:12:50.580]  That's Donald Trump's point.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:56.484]  And we're going to talk about some of the allegations that this hero turned hack has made.
[01:12:56.484 --> 01:13:00.768]  But let's take a look first at the statement from Martin Luther King's niece.
[01:13:00.768 --> 01:13:02.189]  She is a pro-life leader.
[01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:03.430]  That's one of the reasons we have her on here.
[01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:07.033]  She understands that abortion is really targeted towards the black community.
[01:13:07.033 --> 01:13:08.854]  That was admitted by Margaret Sanger.
[01:13:08.854 --> 01:13:11.316]  That has been the focus of the abortion industry.
[01:13:12.313 --> 01:13:15.296]  And so she serves as Director of Civil Rights for the Unborn.
[01:13:15.296 --> 01:13:24.384]  As an African-American outreach for Priests for Life, also the Gospel of Life Ministries, she says she hopes that Mr. Trump will be a pro-life president.
[01:13:24.384 --> 01:13:27.066]  Again, somebody who will work with him on issues.
[01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:30.329]  Just like we saw Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:32.511]  say he would work with him on the issue of vaccines.
[01:13:32.511 --> 01:13:38.016]  They have profound disagreements on a multitude of issues, but again, coming together on issues on which they agree.
[01:13:40.709 --> 01:14:05.317]  When Donald Trump pushed back against the criticisms, the illegitimate criticisms of John Lewis and said, you need to take care of your own district, you need to accomplish something, one of the things that people came back and they said, we had Michael Steele come back and say, of course a black former chair of the RNC, came back and said, don't even go there, you're not even allowed to talk about this guy, he's a hero.
[01:14:05.317 --> 01:14:06.597]  Rand Paul said, but wait a minute.
[01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:14.573]  We're not attacking his legacy as that, we're just pointing out that he's acting now as a political hack, 50 years later.
[01:14:14.573 --> 01:14:18.775]  So you don't get immunity for life for doing something like that.
[01:14:18.775 --> 01:14:24.838]  Just because you saved somebody's life over here pulling them out of, when they're drowning, pulling them out of the canal.
[01:14:25.638 --> 01:14:28.539]  Doesn't give you license to go down and rob a bank later on.
[01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:30.860]  See, it doesn't work that way.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.621]  It doesn't work that way even for politicians.
[01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:36.083]  So here's six false accusations by John Lewis.
[01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:38.263]  Hero turned hack, according to Breitbart.
[01:14:38.263 --> 01:14:39.004]  I think this is pretty good.
[01:14:39.004 --> 01:14:42.665]  Remember when John McCain and Sarah Palin were running for office?
[01:14:42.665 --> 01:14:44.526]  See if this sounds familiar.
[01:14:44.526 --> 01:14:48.688]  He said, Senator McCain and Governor Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division.
[01:14:49.588 --> 01:14:58.592]  Reading off of the same script, he says he's going to suggest that the Republican ticket created a climate for racist terrorism.
[01:14:58.592 --> 01:15:03.654]  That was what he said when McCain and Palin were running in 2008.
[01:15:03.654 --> 01:15:08.636]  2010, he falsely claimed the Tea Party demonstrators said the N-word during an anti-Obamacare rally.
[01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:09.896]  Remember that?
[01:15:09.896 --> 01:15:12.877]  We played that back and forth, there was no evidence of that.
[01:15:12.877 --> 01:15:16.899]  2012, he falsely accused Republicans of wanting to take Americans back to Jim Crow.
[01:15:17.853 --> 01:15:32.298]  He gave a speech at the DNC convention in Charlotte that year and he said he recalled all the times that he'd worked as a Freedom Rider and later on in 2016 he falsely compared Donald Trump to George Wallace.
[01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:38.080]  He said again, remind me of the people who let the dogs loose on the demonstrators and yesterday I played a clip
[01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:47.931]  A report I did two years ago about the Southern Poverty Law Center focusing on how Morris Dees, the founder of Southern Poverty Law Center, was not really focused on civil rights.
[01:15:47.931 --> 01:15:49.512]  He was focused on making a lot of money.
[01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:50.914]  We call it profits of hate.
[01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:53.096]  P-R-O-F-I-T-S.
[01:15:53.096 --> 01:15:56.539]  And what we did was we played the segment in there in Montgomery.
[01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:09.068]  Well, the Freedom Riders, who were trying to get the federal government to enforce laws that they had, and that had been found constitutional by the Supreme Court, against segregating interstate bus transportation.
[01:16:09.068 --> 01:16:10.970]  That's what the Freedom Riders were about.
[01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:12.971]  They were going to have mixed buses.
[01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:16.494]  They were going to drive them through the South, drive them up into Washington, D.C.
[01:16:16.494 --> 01:16:21.378]  And as they got into Montgomery, Alabama, the Ku Klux Klan and a bunch of white racists came after them, beat
[01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:38.165]  Pull these guys off the bus, beat them, burn the buses, and Morris Dees, the guy who founded the Southern Poverty Law Center, who's always finding the KKK and hate speech everywhere, this guy defended the Ku Klux Klan guy.
[01:16:38.165 --> 01:16:41.627]  Then he decided he could make even more money doing mass mailings.
[01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:45.469]  And then eventually he got back into the racism business.
[01:16:45.469 --> 01:16:48.851]  But on the other side, and see, that's the way the Democrat Party works.
[01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:50.632]  It's a party of demagogues.
[01:16:50.632 --> 01:16:51.032]  There you go.
[01:16:51.032 --> 01:16:51.653]  See that right there?
[01:16:51.653 --> 01:16:54.035]  That guy on the ground, if you're looking at this video?
[01:16:54.035 --> 01:16:55.996]  The guy that's being kicked, that wasn't his defendant.
[01:16:55.996 --> 01:16:58.018]  That guy was his defendant.
[01:16:58.018 --> 01:16:59.559]  That was kicking him there.
[01:16:59.559 --> 01:17:01.281]  So that's the way these guys work.
[01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:02.322]  They can flip on a dime.
[01:17:03.114 --> 01:17:09.516]  You know, they just look at where the demographics are flowing and what they want to do, and it's like, okay, well, we were pro-Ku Klux Klan last year.
[01:17:09.516 --> 01:17:11.797]  Let's become anti-Ku Klux Klan this year.
[01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:15.778]  That's the way Robert Byrd and West Virginia worked.
[01:17:15.778 --> 01:17:16.798]  That's the way the Clintons worked.
[01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:22.220]  That's the way these guys are working, because they focus on racial identity all the time.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.761]  It is truly the politics of racism that you see in the Democrat Party.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:35.170]  And finally, let's not forget that in 2016, John Lewis said that Bernie Sanders played absolutely no role in the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:45.841]  So he doesn't have a problem with people like Morristy and Southern Poverty Law Center, but because he's a political hack and because he was working for the Clintons, he came out and said that Bernie Sanders wasn't involved in the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:46.282]  Remember that?
[01:17:47.048 --> 01:17:52.292]  Bernie Sanders came out with the photographs showing him involved in the civil rights movement.
[01:17:52.292 --> 01:17:57.655]  That was a guy who really did work in the civil rights movement, but of course he was just ignored.
[01:17:57.655 --> 01:18:02.199]  Now, one of the reports that Alex was talking about in the last hour
[01:18:03.223 --> 01:18:05.805]  We have a article up on Infowars.com.
[01:18:05.805 --> 01:18:06.846]  Leaked audio.
[01:18:06.846 --> 01:18:09.869]  Leftist plot chaos at inauguration.
[01:18:09.869 --> 01:18:11.070]  Plan to kick off with a bang.
[01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:16.075]  Now the audio on that is not easy to hear on a radio broadcast.
[01:18:16.075 --> 01:18:18.677]  So I'm just going to tell you what they said on that.
[01:18:18.677 --> 01:18:21.199]  But we are going to play you a report
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.003]  That came out from Project Veritas today as well.
[01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:38.235]  So we got multiple people that are investigating these plots to do underhanded things to harm people who are trying to celebrate the peaceful transition of power due to an election in this country.
[01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:39.776]  They don't like that.
[01:18:39.776 --> 01:18:41.297]  These are the Bill Ayers people.
[01:18:41.297 --> 01:18:43.339]  The Communist Party of America people.
[01:18:43.339 --> 01:18:45.781]  The people that are behind that Disrupt J20 group.
[01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:49.184]  It's Bill Ayers.
[01:18:49.184 --> 01:18:54.249]  They're doing the same thing, even though these guys may be 70 years old, like Bill Ayers.
[01:18:54.249 --> 01:18:56.571]  It's what he was doing with the Weathermen.
[01:18:57.539 --> 01:18:58.760]  Decades and decades ago.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:14.632]  Of course, he realized that it was far more effective to get involved in education, to get involved in schools, to propagandize our children, to use the government educational institutions as a way to get these kids early and brainwash them.
[01:19:14.632 --> 01:19:21.397]  And remember, it was Bill Ayers and the Weathermen who popularized white skin privilege.
[01:19:21.397 --> 01:19:23.519]  What are our children taught at every level now?
[01:19:24.502 --> 01:19:25.663]  That's what they're taught.
[01:19:25.663 --> 01:19:41.338]  So Bill Ayers is the guy who's really teaching your kids, folks, because he's far more dangerous in the educational system than he ever was when he was hurling bombs in government buildings, for which he somehow escaped punishment.
[01:19:41.338 --> 01:19:47.664]  When we come back, we're going to tell you what that leaked audio had, and we're also going to play you some of the Project Veritas report.
[01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:50.207]  He's going to be with us for Part 2 tomorrow.
[01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:52.870]  They're going to release Part 2 of that Undercover Investigation.
[01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:59.557]  We're going to play Part 1 today, and James O'Keefe is going to be our guest tomorrow when Part 2 comes out from Project Veritas.
[01:19:59.557 --> 01:20:00.358]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:03.161]  I think?
[01:20:29.019 --> 01:20:32.382]  Did you know your car can be hacked just like your computer or phone?
[01:20:32.382 --> 01:20:37.625]  Hackers can hijack the signal of your own key fob to burglarize your vehicle in seconds.
[01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:43.850]  The Black Hole Faraday Key Fob Bag is a signal impenetrable shield that stops these hacks in their tracks.
[01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:46.152]  Protect one of your most valuable assets.
[01:20:46.152 --> 01:20:48.033]  Go to HackProofBag.com.

[01:20:58.621 --> 01:20:59.722]  Think about this.
[01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:12.308]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:21:12.308 --> 01:21:16.330]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:20.394]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.

[01:21:58.342 --> 01:22:00.903]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?
[01:22:00.903 --> 01:22:06.884]  What if you had no contract, no activation fees, no hidden costs, tracking, tracing, harvesting customer data, or draconian gimmicks?

[01:23:32.932 --> 01:23:38.873]  Whatever the case, back then, Jordan Dunleavy is still in love with the memory of Lauren, the woman he'd lost so many years before.
[01:23:38.873 --> 01:23:42.374]  In Bookstore on the Seine, the journey of a conspiracy analyst, author C.L.
[01:23:42.374 --> 01:23:49.737]  Hendman, ties conspiracy theories, mystery, irony, and romance into this stimulating novel that masterfully interweaves the past with the present.
[01:23:49.737 --> 01:23:53.338]  Available on Amazon and Kindle and at BookstoreOnTheSeine.com.
[01:23:53.338 --> 01:23:55.639]  That's S-E-I-N-E dot com.
[01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:56.979]  BookstoreOnTheSeine dot com.
[01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:08.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.023]  We've got a special report, part one, of an undercover investigation by Project Veritas.
[01:24:22.752 --> 01:24:30.574]  James O'Keefe is going to be with us tomorrow on the show live, and he's going to talk about Part 2 as that is released tomorrow.
[01:24:30.574 --> 01:24:32.654]  We're going to play Part 1 for you.
[01:24:32.654 --> 01:24:35.995]  We also have some leaked audio that we have a transcript of.
[01:24:35.995 --> 01:24:40.576]  Again, the audio is not real high quality, so we're going to tell you what's in that.
[01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:47.357]  About leftists plotting chaos, and that's what we've been getting a lot of information about in the last couple of weeks.
[01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:53.300]  A lot of strange things, of course, surrounding this inauguration that we have not seen before in our lifetime.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:25:00.644]  We've got the National Guard head, and there was a lot of back and forth that centered around reports from the Washington Post.
[01:25:00.644 --> 01:25:08.688]  First they said one thing, then they said another thing, so that's an interesting aspect there, is the information that's coming out of the Washington Post.
[01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:13.251]  They're just digging it in deeper and deeper just like CNN.
[01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:18.936]  But before we get to that news, I just want to remind you about the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[01:25:18.936 --> 01:25:21.958]  This is the sale that we began at the beginning of the year.
[01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:23.839]  We're about to end this sale.
[01:25:23.839 --> 01:25:28.383]  So take advantage of these discounts anywhere from 20 to 30 percent off selected
[01:25:28.783 --> 01:25:29.304]  We're good to go.

[01:26:10.525 --> 01:26:11.666]  You can see reviews there.
[01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:15.767]  We've got online reviews that customers have written about the product.
[01:26:15.767 --> 01:26:18.188]  So take a look at the description of the product.
[01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:25.091]  Decide what you need to start off 2017 to get in the habit of making your body healthier.
[01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:32.073]  This is a great time for you to establish new habits, and so we're trying to help you do that with some specials anywhere from 20 to 30% off.
[01:26:32.073 --> 01:26:36.855]  Also, DNA Force is now back in stock after having been out for over a month.
[01:26:36.855 --> 01:26:41.977]  We have put that on sale, 10% off, to help you get back up in stock.
[01:26:41.977 --> 01:26:43.778]  We have this available for a limited time.
[01:26:43.778 --> 01:26:44.918]  This is an emergency shipment.
[01:26:44.918 --> 01:26:46.759]  We'll have a larger shipment coming in later.
[01:26:46.759 --> 01:26:52.782]  This shipment is nearly sold out, so also take advantage of that sale while you can.
[01:26:52.782 --> 01:26:53.282]  And finally,
[01:26:53.982 --> 01:27:07.932]  If you're concerned about supplements that are not going to be available because they come and go based on demand, you can make sure that you always have the products that you want to make part of your health habit to sign up for AutoShip.
[01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:10.654]  You get a 10% discount whenever you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:27:10.654 --> 01:27:12.436]  You pick the interval that you want to get shipped on.
[01:27:12.996 --> 01:27:22.999]  And if your order that you have as part of your auto ship is more than $50, you'll get free shipping in addition to the 10% discount and the guaranteed delivery.
[01:27:22.999 --> 01:27:37.582]  So that's a great way for you to set up your habits at the beginning of this new year, to set up a healthy habit, making sure your body has a good baseline of nutrition and protection from the toxins that you find in the food, your water, and the air.
[01:27:37.582 --> 01:27:39.363]  You'll find all that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:27:40.243 --> 01:27:52.853]  Now, in the short period of time that we've got left before we get to the bottom of the hour and take a break, this leaked audio, and we're going to play the Project Veritas video when we come back, but this is an article that's up on InfoWars.com today.
[01:27:52.853 --> 01:27:57.697]  Leaked audio of leftists plotting chaos at the inauguration, planning to kick it off with a bang.
[01:27:58.638 --> 01:28:09.405]  These are people that are part of this group, Disrupt J20, and this is the people who were plotting to do something in and around Vice President-elect Mike Pence's house.
[01:28:09.405 --> 01:28:24.774]  They say, this is our first big activist plan, and they say we've got a bunch of folks who are going to be organizing it, it's going to be a lot of fun, it's going to be his last few days living in Chevy Chase before he moves to the new vice presidential residence, and we're going to send him off with a bang.
[01:28:25.439 --> 01:28:27.263]  And then they talk about what they're going to do at the Deplora Ball.
[01:28:27.263 --> 01:28:35.920]  They say they're going to crash the Deplora Ball, that's one of the inauguration balls, that's the one where the... really the people, it's not an elitist...
[01:28:37.552 --> 01:28:38.112]  We're good to go.
[01:29:04.444 --> 01:29:08.526]  They also say that they're going to try to block access to the inauguration.
[01:29:08.526 --> 01:29:11.607]  So there's a lot of interesting things that are going to be coming up with that.
[01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:14.088]  And again, there is a two-part expose.
[01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:16.850]  They went undercover, as Project Veritas always does.
[01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:20.131]  James O'Keefe has released part one of that today.
[01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:22.672]  We're going to play that when we come back from break.
[01:29:22.672 --> 01:29:27.174]  And then tomorrow, he is going to be live on the show talking about part two of this.
[01:29:27.174 --> 01:29:28.315]  It's kind of interesting.
[01:29:28.315 --> 01:29:30.456]  This is an undercover video that was shot
[01:29:31.036 --> 01:29:35.960]  At Ping Pong Pizza, which was at the center of the Pizzagate issue.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.061]  So we're going to be right back with that report.
[01:29:38.061 --> 01:29:48.789]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.789 --> 01:29:50.170]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:52.692]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.692 --> 01:29:55.394]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.815 --> 01:30:01.876]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[01:30:01.876 --> 01:30:06.700]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:12.303]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[01:30:12.303 --> 01:30:21.830]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday
[01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.430]  I think?
[01:30:43.626 --> 01:30:55.801]  Looks like he's moving them over one, and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:58.665]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.105 --> 01:31:00.987]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:00.987 --> 01:31:03.028]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:03.028 --> 01:31:05.931]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:05.931 --> 01:31:11.996]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:11.996 --> 01:31:21.184]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:24.467]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[01:31:24.707 --> 01:31:28.711]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:36.739]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:36.739 --> 01:31:37.720]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.844]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:42.844 --> 01:31:46.428]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:46.428 --> 01:31:53.155]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:53.155 --> 01:31:57.240]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:59.204 --> 01:32:05.748]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:08.949]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:08.949 --> 01:32:14.552]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:14.552 --> 01:32:20.655]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:20.655 --> 01:32:23.957]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:23.957 --> 01:32:25.398]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:25.598 --> 01:32:29.920]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.861]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:32.861 --> 01:32:34.522]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:34.522 --> 01:32:37.943]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:37.943 --> 01:32:40.564]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:40.564 --> 01:32:41.605]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:41.605 --> 01:32:44.506]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:44.506 --> 01:32:45.626]  I take this.
[01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:47.027]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:47.027 --> 01:32:48.988]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:32:49.808 --> 01:32:50.609]  We fight the Globals.
[01:32:50.609 --> 01:32:51.770]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:24.707]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.707 --> 01:33:26.630]  Move, bitch!
[01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:27.531]  Get out the way!
[01:33:30.555 --> 01:33:34.037]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:33:34.037 --> 01:33:36.078]  I will not let you down.
[01:33:36.078 --> 01:33:39.441]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:33:39.441 --> 01:33:42.022]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:33:49.807 --> 01:33:51.869]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:33:51.869 --> 01:33:57.593]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:33:57.593 --> 01:34:00.135]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:03.638]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.059]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:05.059 --> 01:34:06.180]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.243]  We're going to be playing in the next hour a report from Alex Jones.
[01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:12.405]  Public fears, tactical nukes at the Trump inauguration.
[01:34:12.405 --> 01:34:14.227]  Also, we're going to be talking to Mark Dice.
[01:34:14.227 --> 01:34:19.351]  You remember last week in the wake of the Golden Globes that had happened exactly a week ago.
[01:34:20.031 --> 01:34:27.076]  In the wake of the Golden Globes that had happened on Sunday, that fake movie award ceremony, and it truly is fake.
[01:34:27.076 --> 01:34:29.298]  I mean, look at what other people have said about it.
[01:34:29.298 --> 01:34:33.100]  Look at what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:41.987]  It's a small group of people, kind of like the Washington Press Corps that is now bellyaching about having presumably lost their position of privilege and elitism.
[01:34:42.936 --> 01:34:45.560]  Uh, saying that they're going to have to mix with the Hoi Poi, you know?
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:50.306]  Well, it was a week ago it was Hollywood that was screaming loud about that.
[01:34:50.306 --> 01:35:00.298]  And of course the hoax that Meryl Streep bought into and helped to propagate about the fact that Donald Trump had singled out a reporter who was disabled.
[01:35:01.219 --> 01:35:04.923]  And Mark Dice completely destroyed that in a great video.
[01:35:04.923 --> 01:35:05.923]  We played that a week ago.
[01:35:05.923 --> 01:35:07.685]  We want to talk to Mark Dice about that.
[01:35:07.685 --> 01:35:15.852]  Also about a video that he had about abortion where he asked people questions on the streets of California about abortion.
[01:35:15.852 --> 01:35:16.833]  Very, very good video.
[01:35:16.833 --> 01:35:24.339]  So we're going to have Mark Dice joining us in the next hour and we're also going to be playing that special report from Alex Jones about what might happen at the Trump inauguration.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:36.401]  Now whether or not it's going to be tactical nukes, we have seen ample evidence and of course advertisements from people like Bill Ayers and others saying we want to disrupt the inauguration as much as we can.
[01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:43.835]  So they want to, and now we've got undercover investigations done by Project Veritas.
[01:35:43.835 --> 01:35:45.636]  The first part was released today.
[01:35:45.636 --> 01:35:50.317]  Part two is going to be released tomorrow and James O'Keefe is going to join us to talk about that.
[01:35:50.317 --> 01:35:54.318]  But first I want to play part one that was released today.
[01:35:54.318 --> 01:36:02.281]  This is part of Project Veritas infiltrating some of these groups to say that they're going to disrupt, to block, to release in some cases
[01:36:03.081 --> 01:36:07.469]  Very smelly substances to make people have to evacuate the rooms.
[01:36:07.469 --> 01:36:09.413]  That's what they're talking about doing.
[01:36:09.413 --> 01:36:12.438]  Here's the undercover investigation from Project Veritas.
[01:36:14.249 --> 01:36:19.434]  Yeah, if you had a frickin' pint of butyric acid, I don't care how big the building is, it's closed, it has to stay closed for a while.
[01:36:19.434 --> 01:36:19.634]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:19.634 --> 01:36:21.676]  Um, and this stuff is, like, it's very efficient.
[01:36:21.676 --> 01:36:25.019]  It's very, very smelly, it lasts a long time, and a little of it goes a long way.
[01:36:25.019 --> 01:36:29.043]  I know, I'm trying to think through how to get all of this produce to other parts.
[01:36:29.043 --> 01:36:32.526]  There's usually a piece of, like, beautiful metal, or a piece of glass, or liquid, and it'll glow.
[01:36:38.556 --> 01:36:42.437]  This is undercover video of potential criminal acts being planned.
[01:36:42.437 --> 01:36:52.741]  These organizers and activists are talking about setting off butyric acid into the ventilation system and setting off fire alarm sprinklers at a Trump inaugural ball later this week.
[01:36:52.741 --> 01:37:02.105]  What you're about to see is part one of our hidden camera investigation into the groups and organizations that seek to cause havoc and violence at the Trump inauguration.
[01:37:03.546 --> 01:37:05.608]  I, Ronald Reagan.
[01:37:05.608 --> 01:37:07.830]  I, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:12.234]  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:37:12.234 --> 01:37:13.435]  So help me God.
[01:37:13.435 --> 01:37:16.798]  Please lock him.
[01:37:16.798 --> 01:37:18.039]  Please lock him.
[01:37:18.039 --> 01:37:18.359]  Lock him.
[01:37:18.359 --> 01:37:18.599]  Lock him.
[01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:18.839]  Lock him.
[01:37:18.839 --> 01:37:19.300]  Don't let them in.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.962]  Hey, I just want to say one thing to the person on the phone.
[01:37:21.962 --> 01:37:23.023]  Can you please move out of my way?
[01:37:23.023 --> 01:37:23.784]  Bob Kramer sends his regards.
[01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:33.183]  The next four years, we are going to fight Trump and everything he stands for with no quarter asked, no quarter given, no mercy of any kind.
[01:37:35.868 --> 01:37:41.552]  I mean, I like the idea of the goal being that they have to pull the inauguration inside.
[01:37:41.552 --> 01:37:59.485]  Be prepared to help make the inauguration a giant clusterf**k. Shortly after the election, we started getting tips that radical groups were planning to derail President-elect Trump's inauguration, perhaps even trying to shut down the city of Washington, D.C.
[01:37:59.485 --> 01:38:04.489]  Various groups, some old, some new, have gathered together under the Disrupt J20 umbrella,
[01:38:10.233 --> 01:38:15.877]  Today's investigation focuses on these guys from the D.C.
[01:38:15.877 --> 01:38:17.679]  Anti-Fascist Coalition.
[01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:22.142]  The message has to say that, you know, we do not recognize the city government either.
[01:38:22.142 --> 01:38:25.105]  If you try to close this down, we will look for your house.
[01:38:25.105 --> 01:38:26.005]  We will burn it.
[01:38:26.005 --> 01:38:29.748]  We will physically fight the police if you try to clear one of our places.
[01:38:29.748 --> 01:38:31.129]  We will go to war.
[01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.830]  You will lose.
[01:38:32.338 --> 01:38:37.020]  Early on, one of our journalists was sent an email inviting him to a planning meeting.
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:50.605]  The discussion centered around disrupting the Deplora Ball, a big pro-Trump inaugural ball scheduled the night before the inauguration.
[01:38:50.605 --> 01:38:57.247]  It was at this meeting where we met Scott Green, Luke Kuhn, and Colin Dunn.
[01:38:57.247 --> 01:39:01.609]  They were very gung-ho and clearly well-versed in the dark arts of sabotage.
[01:39:02.159 --> 01:39:03.780]  We don't even know what we're all there for.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:08.343]  So we don't have to use the word deplorable at all.
[01:39:08.343 --> 01:39:09.183]  And things like that.
[01:39:09.183 --> 01:39:18.950]  So just in case there are Yahoo's in there... Through emails, another meeting was set up at the infamous Comet Ping Pong Pizza restaurant in Northwest Washington, D.C.
[01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:23.453]  I was thinking of things that ruin the email.
[01:39:23.453 --> 01:39:26.014]  You know, ruin their outputs.
[01:39:26.014 --> 01:39:28.836]  Or otherwise make it impossible to continue
[01:39:32.518 --> 01:39:38.906]  The Deplora Ball is being held here at the National Press Club in downtown Washington DC.
[01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:44.654]  The plan set off butyric acid stink bombs forcing everyone to evacuate the premises.
[01:39:45.882 --> 01:39:52.146]  Yeah, if you had a frickin' pint of butyric acid, I don't care how big the building is, it's closed and it's staying closed for a while too.
[01:39:52.146 --> 01:39:52.927]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:52.927 --> 01:39:55.069]  Um, and this stuff is, like, it's very efficient.
[01:39:55.069 --> 01:39:59.312]  It's very, very smelly, it lasts a long time, and a little of it goes a long way.
[01:39:59.312 --> 01:40:02.014]  It's like a repeat of the original smell we could use.
[01:40:04.835 --> 01:40:22.327]  Alright, and it's kind of hard to hear that with the crowd noise there, but what they're saying is a little bit of this goes a long way, it's very efficient, and we're going to set that off.
[01:40:22.327 --> 01:40:28.151]  We'll have the rest of that posted on Infowars.com, and again, James O'Keefe is going to be joining us tomorrow to discuss...
[01:40:28.951 --> 01:40:32.975]  Not only this, but also part two that will be released tomorrow.
[01:40:32.975 --> 01:40:38.059]  It was also interesting, over the weekend, we saw these stories that came out.
[01:40:38.059 --> 01:40:51.872]  First one, Friday night, we had Washington Post saying that Donald Trump, or first it said it was going to be Obama, who was firing the head, the general of the District of Columbia's National Guard, and that he was going to be fired at 12.01.
[01:40:53.913 --> 01:40:58.076]  Right after, the minute after Donald Trump became president, this guy was going to be fired.
[01:40:58.076 --> 01:40:59.777]  And that seemed to be unusual.
[01:40:59.777 --> 01:41:04.360]  They said it was Obama, and so people looked at that and said, whoa, what are they, are they planning something here?
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.022]  They had D.C.
[01:41:06.022 --> 01:41:10.365]  city councilmen said, that's kind of strange to do that at that point in time.
[01:41:10.365 --> 01:41:12.266]  Then they said, well, no, it wasn't Obama.
[01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:16.629]  Trump wanted to do that because he doesn't like this guy and he wants to get him out right away.
[01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:21.080]  And then they walked all of this stuff back in addition.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:28.382]  So we wound up finally, where this story got left, Washington Post changed the story on Trump firing the D.C.
[01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.063]  National Guard.
[01:41:29.063 --> 01:41:35.605]  They basically took it out after raising everybody's eyebrows, they point out, in Breitbart to make this unusual decision.
[01:41:35.605 --> 01:41:38.726]  So there's a lot of things that are very unusual about what's going on here.
[01:41:38.726 --> 01:41:41.947]  But the bottom line, folks, is that these people
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:54.266]  The Disrupt J20, the people who are planning to try to disrupt the inauguration, are the same people who have been trying to disrupt the election, who tried to disrupt the nomination process.
[01:41:54.266 --> 01:41:58.729]  Remember, they said, no, no, no, we don't want to have Donald Trump get nominated.
[01:41:58.729 --> 01:42:06.053]  We're going to try to organize a revolt with the electors to overrule what the people have chosen during the primaries.
[01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:11.536]  Then they said, we're going to try to organize a revolt with the Electoral College to overrule what the people wanted.
[01:42:11.536 --> 01:42:12.257]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:42:13.171 --> 01:42:20.215]  That these communists always say that they represent the people, the masses of the people, when they really don't.
[01:42:20.215 --> 01:42:26.479]  They have nothing but contempt for the will of the people, contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democracy.
[01:42:26.479 --> 01:42:37.306]  And you know, when I look at issues that I'm concerned about, I've never been a fan of demonstrations because of exactly what you see there.
[01:42:37.306 --> 01:42:39.948]  It brings out the worst elements on either side.
[01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:45.513]  And it turns into these types of Kristallnacht things, these types of Chicago convention things.
[01:42:45.513 --> 01:42:47.954]  I mean, this is what this is all about, folks.
[01:42:47.954 --> 01:42:58.498]  These are people who like to go through the streets just aching to create a riot, aching to burn a town down, aching to loot businesses, go through the black section of town and burn it.
[01:42:59.378 --> 01:43:04.900]  Loot the businesses because they said that there was an issue with a black man and the police or whatever.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.041]  They always do the wrong thing.
[01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:08.642]  There's ways to get change done.
[01:43:08.642 --> 01:43:16.004]  As I pointed out before, you have Bernie Sanders saying, look, I'll work with Donald Trump on rebuilding the infrastructure as long as he doesn't sell it off to foreign people.
[01:43:16.004 --> 01:43:19.146]  I'm all for helping him with that, saying I'll work with him on NAFTA.
[01:43:19.146 --> 01:43:26.368]  But then you got on the other side, you got these people like John Lewis who start spreading lies around and say, well, he's totally illegitimate.
[01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:27.029]  I can't work with him.
[01:43:27.029 --> 01:43:27.829]  I got to shut him down.
[01:43:28.644 --> 01:43:32.587]  And that's what these people who are working on the inauguration are looking at.
[01:43:32.587 --> 01:43:35.108]  And of course we're going to have a report from Alex Jones the next hour.
[01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:38.971]  Are they going to try to do something with a tactical nuke?
[01:43:38.971 --> 01:43:40.512]  He's going to have a report with that and we've got...
[01:43:42.017 --> 01:43:44.018]  Mark Dice is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:49.041]  Before we get to that, though, I want to talk about Davos, because that's been happening over the weekend.
[01:43:49.041 --> 01:43:55.645]  Again, another one of these globalist, elitist confabs like Bilderberg, except this is the one they want you to pay attention to.
[01:43:55.645 --> 01:43:59.308]  This is the one they invite the press to and say, here, come cover us.
[01:43:59.308 --> 01:44:05.792]  They invite the celebrities in to make this look pretty cool, unlike Bilderberg, that they don't want you to even know that that exists.
[01:44:06.727 --> 01:44:13.490]  They used to make fun of people, calling us conspiracy theorists for even saying that there was such a thing as Bilderberg.
[01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:17.532]  Isn't it interesting how they have some meetings that they promote and other ones that they try to hide?
[01:44:17.532 --> 01:44:33.460]  Now, after it became common knowledge, I guess it was about three years ago, there was a tipping point at that point, and it got so much attention, primarily because of the coverage of Alex Jones going there, that they started releasing their itinerary to the public to a limited degree.
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:36.022]  We still don't know what they talk about behind closed doors.
[01:44:37.111 --> 01:44:46.017]  And you still got people who are part of the biggest corporations, politicians, all getting together behind closed doors and talking.
[01:44:46.017 --> 01:44:48.018]  No problem with that, right?
[01:44:48.018 --> 01:44:49.459]  We shouldn't worry about that at all.
[01:44:49.459 --> 01:44:53.342]  But of course, as we look at what the elitists are saying, the IMF
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.724]  Is now, interestingly, boosting its growth forecast for the United States.
[01:44:58.724 --> 01:45:04.748]  The IMF, the International Monetary Fund, is raising its forecast for the US economy this year, reports AP.
[01:45:04.748 --> 01:45:10.133]  Reflecting an unexpected boost from the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump.
[01:45:10.133 --> 01:45:13.175]  So here are the people who said it's going to be an absolute catastrophe.
[01:45:14.076 --> 01:45:18.479]  If Trump is elected, and yet now they're raising the forecast, their new outlook puts U.S.
[01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:22.943]  economic growth at 2.3% this year and 2.5% in 2018.
[01:45:22.943 --> 01:45:28.447]  That would be an improvement, says the AP, from the lackluster U.S.
[01:45:28.447 --> 01:45:29.148]  growth around 1.6% in 2016.
[01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:52.134]  Now, Donald Trump says he believes that his policies are going to bring annual growth to about 4%, so they're not up as high as Donald Trump, but even the IMF, and these are the people who are really a core group, obviously, with the globalists, the International Monetary Fund, these bankers, and they've gone through a policy that was identified under Robert McNamara.
[01:45:52.134 --> 01:45:54.814]  People criticized them for rent-seeking.
[01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:59.235]  They would go into developing countries, they would say, we're gonna, we want you to increase
[01:46:00.404 --> 01:46:01.970]  Your welfare spending.
[01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:03.476]  And we're going to loan you the money to do it.
[01:46:04.465 --> 01:46:07.207]  And of course, that's not money that they're going to get back.
[01:46:07.207 --> 01:46:14.252]  That's money that's just going down into non-productive... It's not the same as rebuilding Germany after World War II.
[01:46:14.252 --> 01:46:17.655]  This is putting it into non-productive areas.
[01:46:17.655 --> 01:46:20.637]  And so, of course, these people are... It's not going to grow their economy.
[01:46:20.637 --> 01:46:22.519]  They're not going to be able to pay back those loans.
[01:46:22.519 --> 01:46:30.565]  It just basically turns them into renters, and it gives the people who are loaning them this money control over their infrastructure, control over their country.
[01:46:31.781 --> 01:46:38.143]  And so that is precisely what the globalists are trying to do to the United States and to Europe as well.
[01:46:38.143 --> 01:46:39.524]  That's the tactic of the bankers.
[01:46:39.524 --> 01:46:44.286]  But even they understand that Donald Trump's policies are going to be a boon for the American economy.
[01:46:44.286 --> 01:46:49.668]  Meanwhile, over the weekend, Donald Trump told a German paper that NATO is obsolete.
[01:46:50.831 --> 01:46:53.053]  Create a lot of stir there, but it is absolutely the truth.
[01:46:53.053 --> 01:46:54.314]  This is what Donald Trump said.
[01:46:54.314 --> 01:46:55.235]  He said it's obsolete.
[01:46:55.235 --> 01:46:57.998]  First, because it was designed many, many years ago.
[01:46:57.998 --> 01:47:02.422]  Secondly, countries are not paying what they should, what they agreed to.
[01:47:02.422 --> 01:47:07.386]  And third, it didn't have any way to effectively deal with terrorism.
[01:47:07.386 --> 01:47:11.930]  NATO hasn't done anything to protect us against the greatest threat, terrorism.
[01:47:12.921 --> 01:47:24.663]  So, it's an obsolete design, and at the same time he said that BMW would face a 35% import duty if they build BMWs in Mexico and then import them into the United States.
[01:47:24.663 --> 01:47:26.184]  It created a lot of issues.
[01:47:26.184 --> 01:47:32.745]  He also went after Angela Merkel, said that she hurt Germany by letting all of these illegals into the country.
[01:47:32.745 --> 01:47:36.586]  And that shocked the European leaders who are now at Davos.
[01:47:36.586 --> 01:47:38.166]  And the Washington Post points out
[01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:41.802]  That it has raised fears among the European elite.
[01:47:41.802 --> 01:47:43.349]  So, you've got all these globalists...
[01:47:44.286 --> 01:47:54.228]  Looking for safe places that they can cower in, in Davos, because Davos itself is a safe place for the elitist at this moment.
[01:47:54.228 --> 01:48:09.312]  They say that, of course, over the weekend he talked about how the European Union, not only did he say that NATO was obsolete, that NATO was not serving the interests of the countries that are involved in it, and many of those countries are not paying their way, but he also said this.
[01:48:09.932 --> 01:48:15.258]  He said the European Union was a vehicle for German interests.
[01:48:15.258 --> 01:48:16.819]  Now isn't that true?
[01:48:16.819 --> 01:48:18.461]  We all know that's true.
[01:48:18.461 --> 01:48:24.567]  And to underscore that, in the same article from the Washington Post, they go down as a retort to that, who do they go to?
[01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:28.175]  Angela Merkel, the head of the German Republic.
[01:48:28.175 --> 01:48:30.597]  So he says, hey, the Germans are the ones who are running the EU.
[01:48:30.597 --> 01:48:34.481]  And so they come to Angela Merkel, and they say, well, what do you have to say about that?
[01:48:34.481 --> 01:48:37.184]  Because they know she is the, that's true what he's saying about them.
[01:48:37.184 --> 01:48:44.972]  And she said, we Europeans, say the royal we, Merkel speaks for Europe.
[01:48:44.972 --> 01:48:47.595]  Because the Germans, like Donald Trump said,
[01:48:48.869 --> 01:48:50.890]  Are controlling the European Union.
[01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:55.512]  We Europeans, Merkel said, have our destiny in our own hands.
[01:48:55.512 --> 01:48:56.752]  Do you really?
[01:48:56.752 --> 01:48:57.632]  Do you really?
[01:48:57.632 --> 01:49:05.996]  I think the destiny of Europeans is in the hands of Angela Merkel and the EU right now, and that's why there is a massive revolt.
[01:49:05.996 --> 01:49:12.098]  As Reuters pointed out, these political leaders, these CEOs, these top bankers who are all meeting at Davos right now,
[01:49:13.335 --> 01:49:15.598]  They're not in a celebratory mood.
[01:49:15.598 --> 01:49:24.447]  They say beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about the increasingly, listen to this, toxic political climate.
[01:49:24.447 --> 01:49:28.131]  Reuters is not a big fan of Donald Trump, are they?
[01:49:28.131 --> 01:49:30.213]  They call it a toxic political climate.
[01:49:30.213 --> 01:49:32.135]  Was it a toxic political climate?
[01:49:33.055 --> 01:49:39.076]  When they got everybody's money and they set themselves up as rulers and owners of the world.
[01:49:39.076 --> 01:49:42.057]  They say Trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism.
[01:49:42.057 --> 01:49:50.059]  With elections looming in the Netherlands, France, Germany and possibly Italy this year, there's nervousness amongst Davos attendees.
[01:49:50.059 --> 01:49:54.760]  They say, and of course they talk about the different topics that are going to be discussed at Davos.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:50:01.341]  And remember, going back to Bilderberg last year, remember that one of the topics that was there was the precariat?
[01:50:02.742 --> 01:50:06.163]  You know, the proletariat in a precarious position.
[01:50:06.163 --> 01:50:07.443]  And so here's some of the topics here.
[01:50:07.443 --> 01:50:08.964]  Squeezed and angry.
[01:50:08.964 --> 01:50:10.604]  How to fix the middle class.
[01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:14.405]  Politics of fear or rebellion of the forgotten.
[01:50:14.405 --> 01:50:16.645]  Tolerance at the tipping point.
[01:50:16.645 --> 01:50:19.966]  And the post-EU era.
[01:50:19.966 --> 01:50:22.427]  This is what they'll be talking about at Davos.
[01:50:22.427 --> 01:50:31.349]  And of course, when they look at the precariat, the forgotten middle class, the people who have been ripped off by globalism,
[01:50:32.782 --> 01:50:34.623]  What's their solution?
[01:50:34.623 --> 01:50:36.424]  Universal basic income.
[01:50:36.424 --> 01:50:45.709]  Because just like the IMF did to the third world countries, they want to turn you into a renter, into a serf who doesn't own anything.
[01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:50.732]  They want to put you on welfare as a kind of soft kill.
[01:50:50.732 --> 01:50:54.835]  Contain you to the cities with Agenda 21 to make sure that you don't travel out.
[01:50:54.835 --> 01:50:57.956]  That's what they're coming at with universal basic income.
[01:50:57.956 --> 01:51:00.518]  That's how they're going to placate and control the precariat.
[01:51:01.138 --> 01:51:02.720]  What happened to America?
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.784]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:51:06.784 --> 01:51:09.426]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[01:51:09.426 --> 01:51:12.269]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:51:12.269 --> 01:51:17.415]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:51:17.915 --> 01:51:24.162]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:51:24.162 --> 01:51:30.408]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:51:30.408 --> 01:51:32.951]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:51:33.331 --> 01:51:34.471]  We're the solution!
[01:51:34.471 --> 01:51:35.431]  Americans!
[01:51:35.431 --> 01:51:36.972]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[01:51:36.972 --> 01:51:42.333]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:51:42.333 --> 01:51:44.153]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:51:44.153 --> 01:51:45.553]  DVDs now available.
[01:51:45.553 --> 01:51:49.474]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:51:49.474 --> 01:51:55.055]  RevelationTheMovie.info Americans need to see this film.
[01:51:55.055 --> 01:51:58.556]  RevelationTheMovie.info Let's fix it.
[01:52:02.529 --> 01:52:04.210]  Good day, America.
[01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:07.211]  Are you tired of your butt cheeks being frozen?
[01:52:07.211 --> 01:52:09.611]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:11.132]  I'm tired of the cold.
[01:52:11.132 --> 01:52:13.153]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.
[01:52:13.153 --> 01:52:14.873]  It's Fortress Clothing.

[01:52:24.076 --> 01:52:25.837]  You heard that right, even when wet.

[01:52:28.478 --> 01:52:32.400]  Work, play, sweat in the cold, and stay warm.

[01:52:58.777 --> 01:53:00.038]  My name is Robin.
[01:53:00.038 --> 01:53:01.880]  I'm 47 years of age.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.623]  I absolutely love One World Whey.
[01:53:04.623 --> 01:53:09.688]  It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein powders.
[01:53:09.688 --> 01:53:13.031]  One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[01:53:13.031 --> 01:53:16.014]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[01:53:16.014 --> 01:53:19.297]  I went through tons of brands, types and flavors, and almost
[01:53:19.457 --> 01:53:22.480]  All of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:26.663]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way.
[01:53:26.663 --> 01:53:32.228]  I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Way, too.
[01:53:32.228 --> 01:53:37.572]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it.
[01:53:37.572 --> 01:53:43.597]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for perfecting a protein powder in the product One World Way.
[01:53:43.597 --> 01:53:47.480]  From taste to how it makes me and my family feel, you get an A++.
[01:53:48.741 --> 01:53:54.224]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:53:54.224 --> 01:53:55.445]  That's OneWorld.
[01:53:55.445 --> 01:53:59.507]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:53:59.507 --> 01:54:11.854]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:11.854 --> 01:54:12.494]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:12.494 --> 01:54:17.977]  We're going to be joined in the next hour with Mark Dice, talking about the couple of special reports he's had recently
[01:54:18.746 --> 01:54:23.248]  We played it a week ago when Meryl Streep was attacking Donald Trump in the wake of the Golden Globes.
[01:54:23.248 --> 01:54:30.531]  We're going to show that video and talk about that hoax line of attack and of course it's just one of many.
[01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:31.812]  Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:31.812 --> 01:54:32.792]  Donald Trump is racist.
[01:54:32.792 --> 01:54:36.154]  Donald Trump made fun of a disabled reporter and on and on and on.
[01:54:36.154 --> 01:54:40.576]  We're going to talk about that but we're also going to talk about some reports that he's done on abortion as well.
[01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:58.166]  When they say that it's going to be difficult for Mike Pence and others in the Trump administration to do something to cut Planned Parenthood funding, understand that what they're saying is they're going to make it easier to kill children than to kill funding for Planned Parenthood.
[01:54:58.166 --> 01:54:59.647]  That's what that's truly about.
[01:54:59.647 --> 01:55:02.831]  Now, before we get back to what's going on at Davos, and I want to
[01:55:04.352 --> 01:55:10.621]  Show you exactly what's happening there, and I want to show you what Donald Trump is going to do in terms of countering the globalists.
[01:55:10.621 --> 01:55:13.344]  We already see these lines of attack developing.
[01:55:14.062 --> 01:55:22.190]  But I just want to remind you that we have our 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative, the sale that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:23.972]  Discounts of 20-30% off.

[01:55:25.413 --> 01:55:26.935]  That's our New Year sale.
[01:55:26.935 --> 01:55:28.036]  That will be ending very soon.
[01:55:28.036 --> 01:55:32.300]  We've got 30% off Brain Force, Super Male Vitality, Survival Shield X2.
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:36.504]  We have 20% off things like Secret 12, Liver Shield, Knockout, Prostagard.
[01:55:36.924 --> 01:55:37.384]  I think so.
[01:55:54.233 --> 01:55:59.697]  Analyzed, working with some Army Rangers, and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies.
[01:55:59.697 --> 01:56:06.122]  Now we've partnered up with National Defense Labs to bring you advanced nanotechnology body armor.
[01:56:06.122 --> 01:56:08.203]  Up until now, this was only available to U.S.
[01:56:08.203 --> 01:56:09.544]  military and law enforcement.
[01:56:09.544 --> 01:56:12.286]  It's a patented form of carbon nanotube technology.
[01:56:12.286 --> 01:56:16.449]  It's the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market.
[01:56:16.449 --> 01:56:21.713]  Even though it's only a quarter inch thick, it is field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[01:56:22.313 --> 01:56:27.696]  It's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, and has a 20-year warranty.
[01:56:27.696 --> 01:56:33.819]  You can find that in all the various forms, from different types of vests to secure inserts that you can put in.
[01:56:33.819 --> 01:56:38.041]  You can find that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:38.041 --> 01:56:47.546]  Now again, as we look at Davos, they're talking about how these global elite are uncertain and they're upset and they're hiding in their safe places and that luxury resort.
[01:56:47.546 --> 01:56:50.928]  They talk about the fact that, and this is coming from the Wall Street Journal, they say,
[01:56:51.903 --> 01:56:54.325]  You know, the benefits have been mixed.
[01:56:54.325 --> 01:57:01.189]  Some of the wealthy countries have grown richer, but the benefits have kind of been disproportionately spread around.
[01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:04.011]  How disproportionately have they been spread around?
[01:57:04.011 --> 01:57:07.653]  Well, the AP has a story today, and you'll see this linked on the Drudge Report.
[01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:10.635]  The stark inequality Oxfam says that only eight men
[01:57:11.471 --> 01:57:15.833]  Only 8 men are as rich as half of the world.
[01:57:15.833 --> 01:57:17.534]  The bottom half of the income producers.
[01:57:17.534 --> 01:57:22.957]  People who are living, they say 1 in 10 people live on less than $2 a day.
[01:57:22.957 --> 01:57:28.699]  Now to give you an idea of how this wealth consolidation is going, these same people did this report just a year ago.
[01:57:28.699 --> 01:57:30.960]  And they said, isn't it outrageous?
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.281]  And it was.
[01:57:32.281 --> 01:57:36.003]  The 62 people had as much wealth as the bottom half.
[01:57:36.974 --> 01:57:40.575]  Now, it's gone from 62 people to just 8.
[01:57:40.575 --> 01:57:41.875]  Who are those 8?
[01:57:41.875 --> 01:57:43.016]  Well, people like this.
[01:57:43.016 --> 01:57:52.818]  Bill Gates, number 1, who is always out there trying to find a solution for the fact that, you know, we've got all these people and we've got all these other issues.
[01:57:52.818 --> 01:57:54.499]  What is the thing that needs to go to zero?
[01:57:54.499 --> 01:57:56.539]  Well, maybe the people need to go to zero.
[01:57:56.539 --> 01:57:59.920]  You know, that's kind of what he implied with his reports, isn't it?
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.080]  We've got Bill Gates, number 1.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.260]  We've got Ortega.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:03.881]  This is one guy I don't know of in Spain.
[01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:06.362]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:06.362 --> 01:58:08.543]  Mark Dice is going to be joining us in the next hour.

[02:00:11.107 --> 02:00:17.289]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.289 --> 02:00:22.571]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:23.091]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:23.091 --> 02:00:25.292]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Mark Dice.
[02:00:25.292 --> 02:00:34.015]  We're going to talk about some of the great reports he's done this last week, beginning with a week ago, it was we had the big kerfuffle about Meryl Streep
[02:00:34.807 --> 02:00:53.835]  Attacking Donald Trump at the Golden Globes at fake awards ceremony and of course it was a fake story that she was Attacking him for fake narrative saying he's making fun of this guy who's handicapped and he just destroyed that whole narrative in a video We're gonna talk about talk to him about that and some of the other videos that he's put out recently Always a good guest.
[02:00:53.835 --> 02:01:03.759]  I was talking about what was happening at Davos I think it's important to understand how Donald Trump is gonna handle this he has already said he's going to offer deals to Britain and to Russia
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:24.338]  And of course, when he criticizes the European Union, and says that it has become a vehicle for German power, and then says that he's going to work with Britain to help them go through Brexit, that is a very significant signal that is being sent to the global elitists who are cowering in Davos as we speak.
[02:01:24.838 --> 02:01:32.643]  And as I also said yesterday, and somebody complained about it, they said, well, you know, Knight is always ignoring the U.S.
[02:01:32.643 --> 02:01:33.824]  being the leader of globalism.
[02:01:33.824 --> 02:01:35.645]  No, they have been the leader of globalism.
[02:01:35.645 --> 02:01:43.270]  We have been the ones who have initiated wars, who've started cold wars, who've set the Middle East on fire, who have been overthrowing regimes.
[02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:45.271]  That's what the globalists do.
[02:01:45.271 --> 02:01:50.715]  But see, the difference is that now that Trump is president, they're handing the mantle to China.
[02:01:52.045 --> 02:02:10.962]  China has emerged as a leader at Davos, and isn't it interesting that this place that doesn't stand for free trade or openness in any way, shape, or form is now being handed the lead role in pushing what they say, well, we want open trade.
[02:02:10.962 --> 02:02:13.144]  No, China doesn't want open trade.
[02:02:13.144 --> 02:02:14.445]  They don't want an open Internet.
[02:02:14.445 --> 02:02:16.587]  We've got China tightening app oversight.
[02:02:16.587 --> 02:02:18.229]  This is an article from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:02:18.929 --> 02:02:21.732]  Let's say, China has long censored websites, of course.
[02:02:21.732 --> 02:02:23.293]  They call it the Great Firewall.
[02:02:23.293 --> 02:02:31.241]  And now they've got the Cyberspace Administration of China announcing new regulations on content distributed by apps in August.
[02:02:31.241 --> 02:02:33.403]  This was, remember, George W. Bush?
[02:02:34.244 --> 02:02:36.305]  Saying, I just wish I could do it like China does.
[02:02:36.305 --> 02:02:40.187]  Well, so did Obama, and Obama started doing it like China did.
[02:02:40.187 --> 02:02:48.110]  Now this is what they had to say, the Cyberspace Administration of China, which we are busy setting up the equivalent here in the United States.
[02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:51.412]  They said, some apps are spreading illegal information.
[02:02:52.588 --> 02:02:55.130]  There's one thing for you to have right there.
[02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:56.551]  Illegal information.
[02:02:56.551 --> 02:03:04.137]  All these people who talk about undocumented immigrants, they like to say, because they say, we don't like you calling people illegal.
[02:03:04.137 --> 02:03:08.140]  Well, they're foreign citizens who are here illegally demanding benefits.
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:09.241]  How's that for you?
[02:03:09.241 --> 02:03:10.482]  Instead of undocumented immigrants.
[02:03:10.482 --> 02:03:19.189]  But when they talk about illegal information, maybe we should start this narrative that there isn't any information that should be illegal.
[02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:20.490]  I know Wicked Leaks agrees with that.
[02:03:20.490 --> 02:03:21.131]  I agree with that.
[02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:24.913]  I don't think we should have illegal information.
[02:03:24.913 --> 02:03:27.715]  And we're not talking about national security here either, okay?
[02:03:27.715 --> 02:03:29.297]  This is what China is talking about.
[02:03:29.297 --> 02:03:41.929]  They say when they talk about spreading illegal information, it's things like the New York Times app that they demanded Apple remove from their Chinese Apple store, their app store, okay?
[02:03:41.929 --> 02:03:47.154]  And Apple dutifully complied, just like Facebook.
[02:03:48.297 --> 02:03:53.801]  Because they both work for and work with the globalists to achieve these agendas.
[02:03:53.801 --> 02:04:03.048]  Now Donald Trump has said that he's going to put together deals that are going to aid Britain, deals that are going to ease tension with Russia, and of course what he's talking about here
[02:04:04.002 --> 02:04:07.186]  He said, I took a lot of heat when I said NATO was obsolete.
[02:04:07.186 --> 02:04:10.010]  He said, it's obsolete because it isn't taking care of terror.
[02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:14.355]  He said, I took a lot of heat for two days and they started saying Trump is right.
[02:04:14.355 --> 02:04:19.402]  He said, there's only five countries that are paying what they're supposed to pay in terms of supporting NATO.
[02:04:19.402 --> 02:04:21.084]  And he said, only five.
[02:04:21.084 --> 02:04:21.865]  That's not very many.
[02:04:22.425 --> 02:04:24.968]  And then he added that he wanted to work with Russia.
[02:04:24.968 --> 02:04:32.976]  He said, one of the things I think we can do is to say nuclear weapons should be taken way down, the number of nuclear weapons, and they should be reduced very substantially.
[02:04:32.976 --> 02:04:34.557]  That's a part of it.
[02:04:34.557 --> 02:04:36.059]  Why is this so controversial?
[02:04:37.042 --> 02:04:41.765]  We always heard from the press in the past that it was a good thing for us to reduce nuclear weapons.
[02:04:41.765 --> 02:04:45.147]  We always heard that it was a good thing to reduce tensions between the U.S.
[02:04:45.147 --> 02:04:47.748]  and Russia, who had so many nuclear weapons.
[02:04:47.748 --> 02:04:51.010]  That detente was a good thing, but now it's evil.
[02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:54.652]  It makes you a Russian agent to even say that you don't want to have nuclear war.
[02:04:54.652 --> 02:04:56.313]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Mark Dice.
[02:04:59.645 --> 02:05:01.727]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:06.530]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:12.135]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[02:05:12.135 --> 02:05:28.668]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt-media may be allowed to join the White House press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington.
[02:05:29.028 --> 02:05:39.350]  Now this off-the-chart interest in the Trump administration, the President-elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity, Sean Spicer is attributing.
[02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:43.390]  Since 1970, all official press briefings have been held in the James S. Brady room.
[02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:55.752]  Looks like he's moving them over one, and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[02:05:55.752 --> 02:05:58.473]  Well, I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.127 --> 02:06:04.550]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in the battle for freedom.

[02:08:09.858 --> 02:08:15.602]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:15.602 --> 02:08:23.727]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and joining us now is Mark Dice.
[02:08:23.727 --> 02:08:25.729]  And of course Mark is no regular to those of you
[02:08:26.579 --> 02:08:31.281]  Who watch the Alex Jones Show and follow InfoWars.com.
[02:08:31.281 --> 02:08:39.784]  Mark has now reached a million subscribers on YouTube and of course you can find a link to his YouTube channel if you go to MarkDice.com.
[02:08:39.784 --> 02:08:47.567]  I want to talk to Mark about the Bilderberg Group and then we're going to take a look at some of his videos because he's just put out a book on the Bilderberg Group.
[02:08:47.567 --> 02:08:49.688]  The Bilderberg Group Facts and Fictions.
[02:08:49.688 --> 02:08:52.188]  Joining us now is Mark Dice.
[02:08:52.188 --> 02:08:53.529]  Thank you Mark for coming.
[02:08:54.212 --> 02:08:54.913]  Great to be with you.
[02:08:54.913 --> 02:08:55.633]  Happy New Year.
[02:08:55.633 --> 02:08:56.835]  It's a good, it's a new year.
[02:08:56.835 --> 02:08:58.276]  We're having a new president.
[02:08:58.276 --> 02:08:59.497]  It's just fantastic.
[02:08:59.497 --> 02:09:07.485]  I know that I'm not the only one that is feeling so good in this over, you know, 10 year battle that I've been involved as a contributor of the show.
[02:09:07.485 --> 02:09:09.286]  And so it's so good.
[02:09:09.286 --> 02:09:17.234]  And on a positive note regarding the Bilderberg Group, as far as I can understand, Donald Trump has never been there, never been to the Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:17.754 --> 02:09:25.120]  And that's part of the reason why the American people got behind him because he finally was the true outsider that we have been waiting for.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:25.880]  So it's so good.
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:28.122]  I haven't been this happy, haven't been this positive.
[02:09:28.926 --> 02:09:30.068]  In quite a long time.
[02:09:30.068 --> 02:09:40.760]  You know there was a great parody video that came out around Christmas time and of course it was a parody of the song It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.502]  It was the most wonderful time in eight years.
[02:09:42.502 --> 02:09:43.283]  I'm sure you saw that.
[02:09:43.283 --> 02:09:45.005]  It was a great parody video.
[02:09:45.005 --> 02:09:48.870]  But of course this last weekend we've got the Davos meeting going on.
[02:09:49.210 --> 02:09:52.092]  Interesting that Davos, they want everybody to know about that.
[02:09:52.092 --> 02:09:54.834]  But Bilderberg, they want to pretend that that doesn't exist.
[02:09:54.834 --> 02:09:56.154]  And we're seeing all these headlines.
[02:09:56.154 --> 02:09:59.216]  They're having a really hard time at Davos this year, Mark.
[02:09:59.216 --> 02:10:00.637]  I really feel sorry for them, don't you?
[02:10:00.637 --> 02:10:04.660]  I mean, all these headlines, Davos elites are struggling for answers.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.881]  The global elite face a world of uncertainty.
[02:10:06.881 --> 02:10:11.404]  These poor guys who have had everything their way for decades, and it's been
[02:10:11.864 --> 02:10:23.130]  The rest of us who have been struggling for answers, the rest of us who have been facing a world of uncertainty, the rest of us who have been getting poorer while the wealth concentration has continued to consolidate to an absurd level.
[02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:33.875]  As I point out, and you can see the stories linked on Matt Drudge, a year ago it was 62 people that had as much money as the bottom half and now it's consolidated down to just 8.
[02:10:33.875 --> 02:10:35.556]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:10:35.556 --> 02:10:37.837]  But tell us, in your view, why is it that they
[02:10:38.257 --> 02:10:45.659]  They come out and they brag about what they're going to do at Davos, but then they, for years, completely even denied the existence of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:10:46.949 --> 02:10:48.630]  Well, Davos is sort of a red herring.
[02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:52.933]  Bilderberg is essentially one of the core centers of the power structure.
[02:10:52.933 --> 02:11:00.978]  And so, as much of this audience knows, there's obviously about new people coming to your show over the last several months, last year and a half with the election cycle.
[02:11:00.978 --> 02:11:05.921]  But the Bilderberg Group for years was obviously ridiculed as a conspiracy theory.
[02:11:05.921 --> 02:11:15.527]  And then finally, as the alternative media continued to grow, as social media continued to spread word and undeniable proof that the Bilderberg Group exists,
[02:11:15.967 --> 02:11:17.168]  Who's going there?
[02:11:17.168 --> 02:11:23.094]  The infiltrations and the insider admissions about what it is that they've done and what they're doing.
[02:11:23.094 --> 02:11:26.977]  It's impossible for the mainstream media to deny that they exist anymore.
[02:11:26.977 --> 02:11:31.942]  So now they're stuck in a hard spot because they have to pretend like it doesn't even matter.
[02:11:31.942 --> 02:11:40.750]  But those of us who have been covering this for any amount of time know that recently they were ridiculing us for even mentioning that it exists or for being
[02:11:40.930 --> 02:11:41.010]  It's
[02:12:00.607 --> 02:12:00.767]  Yeah.
[02:12:00.767 --> 02:12:01.308]  Yeah.
[02:12:30.515 --> 02:12:32.797]  They're getting more and more detached from reality.
[02:12:32.797 --> 02:12:39.224]  First we see them with their get out the vote campaign, calling Donald Trump all these ridiculous slurs.
[02:12:39.224 --> 02:12:43.168]  Then they have a trying to stop the Electoral College.
[02:12:43.168 --> 02:12:50.776]  And the quality of these celebrities, if you can even call it that, continues to drop because I only recognize one or two of the supposed celebrities.
[02:12:54.775 --> 02:12:54.956]  Yeah.
[02:13:04.358 --> 02:13:05.859]  And laughable, PSA.
[02:13:05.859 --> 02:13:06.900]  Pathetic, PSA.
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:12.763]  I can't believe any agent would allow their actor to do that.
[02:13:12.763 --> 02:13:14.264]  They don't have the studio system anymore.
[02:13:14.264 --> 02:13:17.586]  They're not watching these guys closely enough, are they?
[02:13:17.586 --> 02:13:28.392]  Before we get into the Hollywood video, and that excellent video that you did, and we played it last Monday, debunking that myth that Meryl Streep was promulgating at the Golden Globes,
[02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:38.016]  Again, we look at the dichotomy between Davos and Bilderberg and the fact that, okay, we'll talk all about this one and everything, but then, oh, this one doesn't even exist.
[02:13:38.016 --> 02:13:46.683]  They called it a conspiracy theory because we kept pointing out to people over a long period of time, look, look, oh, look over here, why isn't anybody covering this?
[02:13:46.683 --> 02:13:51.387]  And of course, I think that tells us something very vital about it, and I think it's interesting that Donald Trump
[02:13:52.228 --> 02:13:58.872]  Talked about this weekend the fact that the EU had become a vehicle for power for Germany.
[02:13:58.872 --> 02:14:02.495]  And I think that is also at the core of this when we look at Bilderberg.
[02:14:02.495 --> 02:14:07.398]  Remember, Bilderberg, and you well know this, you wrote the book on the Bilderberg Group here that is your newest book.
[02:14:08.098 --> 02:14:11.619]  You know that they held it at the Bilderberg location.
[02:14:11.619 --> 02:14:17.642]  It was where the Nazis had their last victory of World War II and they did it on the 10th anniversary of that.
[02:14:17.642 --> 02:14:18.802]  That's where this thing started.
[02:14:18.802 --> 02:14:31.347]  So this is kind of rolling the Nazis into this globalist structure and one of the first things they do is plot a common European currency and a European, a united Europe that'll be united as we see now under the Germans.
[02:14:31.347 --> 02:14:32.067]  Your comment on that?
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:49.745]  What's also interesting is they broke their protocol of having the Bilderberg meeting in the United States on election years and every election they have the meeting in the United States obviously because it's a lot easier for the Washington DC power elite to come and visit them so they don't have to leave the country.
[02:14:49.745 --> 02:14:57.908]  So they often have it just outside of DC over in Virginia in Chantilly, Virginia or in a local area over there.
[02:14:58.548 --> 02:15:15.144]  And they didn't do it this year and I think the reason is because in 2012 there were hundreds of protesters that surrounded the hotel for days and we were creating so much attention for them that they knew that the attention would have been exponential this year.
[02:15:15.934 --> 02:15:25.660]  And so for the first time, I think in recent history at least, they broke the protocol and did not meet in the United States on the election year.
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:32.065]  So we kind of smoked them out of their holes and there wasn't really a word about the coverage whatsoever.
[02:15:32.065 --> 02:15:35.307]  So they didn't even really mention them whatsoever.
[02:15:35.307 --> 02:15:41.291]  I know a few years ago when Drudge started linking to the Bilderberg Group, we would see an occasional mention of them.
[02:15:44.770 --> 02:15:45.190]  We're good to go.
[02:15:55.942 --> 02:16:10.937]  People are going to go and see the previous coverage and the stories from places like InfoWars about the previous year's meetings and wonder why they haven't been covering them for years and the cover-up is going to be even more obvious.
[02:16:10.937 --> 02:16:12.819]  So they're in a really tough spot.
[02:16:12.819 --> 02:16:14.140]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:17.243]  And of course what they talked about last year, Bilderberg, what they're talking about Davos now,
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:33.884]  Is the fact that the middle class has been so disenfranchised, they call us the precariat, their term, because they all see this in terms of a class struggle, because these are the same people that sold us Marxism, even though they're the corporate leaders, they're also the ones who sold us out.
[02:16:33.884 --> 02:16:46.128]  So they give us a kind of a Marxist term, the precariat, the precarious proletariat, and their solution, Mark, is going to be universal income, to make us all welfare recipients, as a kind of a passive soft kill, isn't it?
[02:16:47.392 --> 02:16:53.376]  Yeah, and that way, of course, it'll kill any sort of inventiveness, any kind of goal setting.
[02:16:53.376 --> 02:17:06.024]  It'll allow people to sit on their sofas and play on their tablets and just watch Netflix all day, which they will be so detached, so unmotivated that they won't be inclined to be educated.
[02:17:06.024 --> 02:17:06.725]  They'll be lost.
[02:17:07.265 --> 02:17:10.727]  In a digital wasteland of entertainment.
[02:17:10.727 --> 02:17:12.808]  And that's part of the plan.
[02:17:12.808 --> 02:17:23.295]  And while we had a tremendous victory electing Donald Trump, we saw the strike back was quite quick with the coining of the term fake news, which of course is backfiring.
[02:17:23.295 --> 02:17:29.658]  They're pissing in the wind, pun intended, with the BuzzFeed defamatory article coming out.
[02:17:29.658 --> 02:17:34.421]  I mean, it seems at this point we have the upper hand, at least for a while.
[02:17:36.202 --> 02:17:44.948]  Everything that they do just fails and any stepping stone or any stumbling block rather they try to put in our way just turns into a stepping stone.
[02:17:44.948 --> 02:17:54.113]  I mean we can't get any better when the president-elect, soon to be president in a few days, calls the Clown News Network a fake news network and terrible.
[02:17:54.113 --> 02:17:58.176]  I mean no other president would have the guts to do that and so...
[02:17:58.996 --> 02:18:00.477]  Exactly.
[02:18:00.477 --> 02:18:04.819]  Just like this weekend, we see it's the end of the circus after about 150 years.
[02:18:04.819 --> 02:18:11.702]  Ringling Brothers is calling it quits and I guess they've really kind of been made redundant by all the clowns in Washington.
[02:18:11.702 --> 02:18:15.663]  CNN is kind of the lead ring there.
[02:18:15.663 --> 02:18:21.366]  I want to get into this report that you did about Meryl Streep and I want to show people this because if they didn't see this a week ago,
[02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:29.232]  They need to go back and take a look at this report that you did that completely destroys this hoax that was being promulgated by Meryl Streep.
[02:18:29.232 --> 02:18:34.336]  Let's roll a little bit of that report and then get your comment on that.
[02:18:34.336 --> 02:18:44.785]  It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter.
[02:18:44.785 --> 02:18:50.670]  Someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back.
[02:18:51.525 --> 02:18:55.567]  Stop right there, Merrill, because it's time for the debunking to begin.
[02:18:55.567 --> 02:19:04.792]  She's talking about this gesture that Donald Trump made on the campaign trail during one of his speeches when he was calling out what one of the reporters was saying about him.
[02:19:04.792 --> 02:19:11.036]  It just so happened, unfortunately, that the reporter was physically disabled and has some deformed hands.
[02:19:11.556 --> 02:19:13.898]  So on the surface, it could appear that Donald Trump
[02:19:28.352 --> 02:19:30.613]  Is disabled, has a kind of palsy or whatever.
[02:19:30.613 --> 02:19:33.494]  They focus on that to the exclusion of everything else.
[02:19:33.494 --> 02:19:35.134]  And I want to get your comments on that.
[02:19:35.134 --> 02:19:36.034]  We're about out of time.
[02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:36.895]  We got to go to break here.
[02:19:36.895 --> 02:19:40.315]  I want to get your comments on that when we come back on the other side of the break.
[02:19:40.315 --> 02:19:43.736]  It's absolutely amazing and you completely destroyed that.
[02:19:43.736 --> 02:19:46.157]  You did a great job, Mark.
[02:19:46.157 --> 02:19:47.017]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:47.017 --> 02:19:47.418]  Stay with us.

[02:22:58.928 --> 02:23:11.501]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[02:23:11.501 --> 02:23:15.545]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[02:24:16.210 --> 02:24:21.378]  Obama's dog bites White House guest, and reporters laugh at the following cover-up.
[02:24:21.938 --> 02:24:25.940]  Or you two cancels his new album because Trump won the election.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:30.501]  That's really, you're right on top of things, Mark, and that's why you've got so many subscribers there.
[02:24:30.501 --> 02:24:33.582]  People can find the link at markdice.com.
[02:24:33.582 --> 02:24:34.763]  You'll find the link there.
[02:24:34.763 --> 02:24:40.705]  We talked in the last segment about his new book, The Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:45.047]  And the difference between the Bilderberg meetings and Davos and the way those are covered.
[02:24:45.047 --> 02:24:48.508]  But as we went to break, we were playing his report from a week ago.
[02:24:49.252 --> 02:24:58.536]  Where he broke down the lies that Meryl Streep was putting forth about Donald Trump saying that he was making fun of a disabled reporter.
[02:24:58.536 --> 02:25:03.037]  And of course I think the interesting thing is that the internet just doesn't blink.
[02:25:03.037 --> 02:25:05.998]  And as Anonymous says, it doesn't forget and it never forgives.
[02:25:05.998 --> 02:25:07.439]  And if you're going to forward through
[02:25:08.019 --> 02:25:08.900]  False information.
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:15.564]  If you're going to promulgate lies and hoaxes, the internet doesn't forget and it doesn't forgive.
[02:25:15.564 --> 02:25:25.691]  Mark, you absolutely destroyed that narrative with your video showing all the many times that he's used that gesture not talking about somebody that had a disability.
[02:25:25.691 --> 02:25:28.673]  Yeah, what it is, it's a typical nervous quirk.
[02:25:28.673 --> 02:25:33.376]  We all have our own unique little nonverbal gestures and when he's kind of mocking
[02:25:35.376 --> 02:25:35.476]  Yes.
[02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:03.693]  A physical disability.
[02:26:03.693 --> 02:26:12.812]  And so they froze or they show the clip in slow motion where it looks like he's, you know, allegedly making fun of the reporter's hands when that's simply not true.
[02:26:13.593 --> 02:26:20.817]  He just flails his arms around in a way to sort of mock what it is that they have said or what it is that they've done.
[02:26:20.817 --> 02:26:23.659]  We all have our unique nervous little quirks.
[02:26:23.659 --> 02:26:31.024]  I mean, I sometimes, when I'm talking, I tend to, people have noticed I will wiggle my tongue back and forth and they think I'm a reptilian, some people.
[02:26:31.024 --> 02:26:37.127]  I even had one woman years ago at my former day job accused me of sticking my tongue out at her.
[02:26:37.127 --> 02:26:42.891]  We were having a little disagreement and I was getting a little bit flustered myself and she accused me of sticking my tongue out at her.
[02:26:43.531 --> 02:26:46.633]  The level of insanity is that of Meryl Streep.
[02:26:46.633 --> 02:26:48.514]  You're nowhere close in the tongue area.
[02:26:48.514 --> 02:26:50.015]  You're nowhere close to John Kerry.
[02:26:50.015 --> 02:26:53.597]  I mean, nobody even comes close to that guy.
[02:26:53.597 --> 02:26:55.038]  Maybe you remember the count.
[02:26:55.038 --> 02:26:55.958]  I lost count.
[02:26:55.958 --> 02:26:57.759]  Somebody did a count of the video.
[02:26:57.759 --> 02:26:59.380]  One speech that he did, it was what?
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:01.742]  Over a hundred times that he flicks his tongue out like a reptile?
[02:27:02.602 --> 02:27:05.784]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:27:05.784 --> 02:27:09.365]  Gary Johnson does stick his tongue out at reporters, I'm sure.
[02:27:09.365 --> 02:27:11.846]  I'm at the bench, yeah, I remember that, yeah.
[02:27:11.846 --> 02:27:18.809]  You know, the video, correction, almost a million subscribers on YouTube, so I want to thank everyone for watching.
[02:27:18.809 --> 02:27:22.731]  Come on over to check the channel out if you come and see me on the show here.
[02:27:22.731 --> 02:27:26.632]  But that video that you just showed on my channel has, I think, 700,000 views.
[02:27:28.633 --> 02:27:49.886]  That's a good video people need to see that they need to pass that around on social media people need to see that and that's why they're trying to shut us down because Meryl Streep can get on television and lie to I don't know how many people watch the Golden Globes it could be seven or eight million people maybe maybe four or five the ratings are getting so horrible on mainstream shows but if I
[02:27:49.926 --> 02:27:57.491]  I could make one video, and it gets 700,000 views, and you guys play it on your show, it gets millions of listeners, millions more views.
[02:27:57.491 --> 02:28:08.419]  I mean, we, with a shoestring budget compared to these major networks, can put out quality information to debunk their lies, and that's why they're trying to label us fake news.
[02:28:08.419 --> 02:28:11.501]  The New York Times, just a few weeks ago, came out with an entire article
[02:28:12.395 --> 02:28:16.276]  Almost all of it was dedicated to me calling me fake news.
[02:28:16.276 --> 02:28:20.057]  And then I did a report about it and a quarter million people watched that video.
[02:28:20.057 --> 02:28:23.078]  More people then read their actual article.
[02:28:23.078 --> 02:28:27.399]  So you're gaining following because the truth is very powerful.
[02:28:27.399 --> 02:28:32.900]  But they get Meryl Streep and they get these actors because they make their living selling fiction.
[02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:35.121]  And she did that in a very visceral way.
[02:28:35.761 --> 02:28:40.545]  She cried about it, she was really hurt, and it was a very moving speech that she gave.
[02:28:40.545 --> 02:28:44.187]  You know, a lot of people, okay, maybe you don't like the kinds of movies that Meryl Streep does.
[02:28:44.187 --> 02:28:45.909]  She's a very good actress, I believe.
[02:28:45.909 --> 02:28:48.030]  And you could see that at the Golden Globes.
[02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:55.896]  I mean, it's a phony award ceremony, but she did deserve some kind of an award for the hit piece that she did on Donald Trump, you know, from the left.
[02:28:55.896 --> 02:29:03.742]  The left gave her that award, and they're going to give her more work and higher visibility because of that performance that she gave at Golden Globes.
[02:29:04.648 --> 02:29:05.648]  It was very dramatic.
[02:29:05.648 --> 02:29:08.309]  You could see how she was building up to it.
[02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:14.852]  At first, you weren't clear what she was talking about, and she had this whole thing, this dramatic build-up.
[02:29:14.852 --> 02:29:16.632]  She didn't reference his name.
[02:29:16.632 --> 02:29:19.073]  She was just alluding to it.
[02:29:19.073 --> 02:29:20.214]  Such a shame.
[02:29:20.214 --> 02:29:27.416]  And again, the editors at these media outlets, they have to know that this is a total joke.
[02:29:27.416 --> 02:29:29.057]  And the fact that they're recording this,
[02:29:30.217 --> 02:29:35.538]  As a supposed hit or an insult on a disabled man shows that they have no credibility.
[02:29:35.538 --> 02:29:36.718]  They are liars.
[02:29:36.718 --> 02:29:39.379]  They are the fake news as Trump said.
[02:29:39.379 --> 02:29:40.699]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:40.699 --> 02:29:41.279]  Mark Dice.
[02:29:41.279 --> 02:29:43.480]  You can find him at markdice.com.
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:46.700]  You can see his videos linked to his YouTube channel.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:52.701]  We'll be right back and we'll have Alex Jones's report on tactical nukes at the inauguration.
[02:29:52.701 --> 02:29:55.382]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.781 --> 02:30:01.843]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[02:30:01.843 --> 02:30:06.668]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[02:30:06.668 --> 02:30:12.253]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[02:30:12.253 --> 02:30:23.904]  We have an article, it's up on our website, written by Steve Watson, and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt media
[02:30:24.304 --> 02:30:28.825]  Maybe allowed to join the White House press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington.
[02:30:28.825 --> 02:30:32.307]  Now this off-the-chart interest in the Trump administration.
[02:30:32.307 --> 02:30:37.568]  The president-elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity.
[02:30:37.568 --> 02:30:43.290]  Sean Spicer is attributing, since 1970 all official press briefings have been held in the James S. Brady room.
[02:30:43.530 --> 02:30:55.764]  Looks like he's moving them over one, and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[02:30:55.764 --> 02:30:58.608]  Well, I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:30:59.168 --> 02:31:02.349]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:02.349 --> 02:31:04.711]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:04.711 --> 02:31:11.714]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:31:11.714 --> 02:31:17.036]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:31:17.036 --> 02:31:26.000]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:35.350]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:31:35.350 --> 02:31:42.438]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[02:31:42.438 --> 02:31:47.844]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[02:31:48.044 --> 02:31:55.909]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.443]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:32:19.443 --> 02:32:22.024]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:32:22.024 --> 02:32:23.725]  It helps detoxify.
[02:32:23.725 --> 02:32:26.606]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:32:26.606 --> 02:32:31.389]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:37.652]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:32:37.652 --> 02:32:43.074]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:32:43.074 --> 02:32:43.735]  I'm taking it now.
[02:32:44.675 --> 02:32:45.676]  This is so key.
[02:32:45.676 --> 02:32:48.237]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[02:32:48.237 --> 02:32:49.978]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:32:49.978 --> 02:32:52.200]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:55.682]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:09.775 --> 02:33:12.478]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.478 --> 02:33:19.125]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:33:19.125 --> 02:33:23.430]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.430 --> 02:33:30.057]  I'm David Knight and we're going to play for you a report that Alex did breaking down concerns about how far the globalists will go.
[02:33:31.323 --> 02:33:32.424]  against Trump.
[02:33:32.424 --> 02:33:35.026]  Will they go as far as a tactical nuke?
[02:33:35.026 --> 02:33:36.648]  We're going to play that for you in just a moment.
[02:33:36.648 --> 02:33:44.834]  Before we do, I just want to remind you that our sale that began at the beginning of the new year, Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative, that will be ending soon.
[02:33:44.834 --> 02:33:49.819]  And of course, these are discounts of 20 to 30 percent on some of our most popular supplements.
[02:33:50.439 --> 02:34:08.767]  We did that at the beginning of the year because it is very important for you to start the new year with a good habit, to establish habits that are going to be healthy, whether it's exercise or diet or supplementation, as well as protection from toxins that are in the food, water and air that you're constantly consuming.
[02:34:08.767 --> 02:34:15.931]  So we have discounts 30% off Brain Force, 30% off Supermail Vitality, 30% off Survival Shield X2, that's our
[02:34:16.631 --> 02:34:18.352]  Uh, nascent iodine that we sell.

[02:34:28.595 --> 02:34:30.535]  And of course, sleep.
[02:34:30.535 --> 02:34:34.576]  Restful sleep is a very important part of your health regime.
[02:34:34.576 --> 02:34:36.417]  And also, 20% off Prostagard.
[02:34:36.417 --> 02:34:39.118]  You'll find those and many others at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:34:39.118 --> 02:34:42.139]  And again, this sale will be ending very soon.
[02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:44.459]  This is a sale that began at the beginning of the new year.
[02:34:44.459 --> 02:34:45.740]  It will be ending very soon.
[02:34:46.636 --> 02:34:54.161]  Alright, let's go to this report from Alex Jones, Public Fears, Tactical Nuke at Inauguration.
[02:34:54.161 --> 02:35:10.032]  It was in 2013 that we first began reporting on the missing nuclear weapons from Dyess Air Force Base in West Texas.
[02:35:10.032 --> 02:35:12.854]  As I began to file this report on the road with my family,
[02:35:14.306 --> 02:35:20.190]  Fire trucks drove by, which is just fitting to signify the type of crisis this country and the world's in.
[02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:31.178]  It had been a few years before that, that six air-launched cruise missiles had come up missing from the Minot Base in North Dakota.
[02:35:31.178 --> 02:35:36.702]  And they weren't discovered until they'd been shipped to a major Air Force base in Louisiana.
[02:35:36.702 --> 02:35:39.845]  Within one week of that story breaking,
[02:35:40.951 --> 02:35:50.997]  Six people have mysteriously been gunned down or killed in different ways at that Air Force Base in Minot.
[02:35:50.997 --> 02:35:53.758]  Now why don't I preface the beginning of this transmission with that?
[02:35:53.758 --> 02:36:10.508]  A lot of people keep asking me, will they set off a low yield or a tactical nuke in DC to stop the Trump inauguration and try to basically derail the whole populist movement?
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:20.204]  And I haven't really responded to that because we don't have any hard intel on it, we don't have any chatter, I don't have any sources on that fact.
[02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:34.992]  But I have to ask myself, if Obama would fund ISIS and Al-Qaeda, taking over multiple countries in the Middle East and Africa, and killing hundreds of thousands of people, and overthrowing non-radical regimes, and putting every Christian they find with a sword,
[02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:39.172]  Then the answer is yes.
[02:36:39.172 --> 02:36:57.906]  If the people controlling Obama would launch major wars in the last three years in places like Ukraine and start a war with Russia and move US troops to the border with Poland and have all sorts of other provocative actions being put in place and the federalizing of elections and be acting like they don't intend to leave.
[02:36:59.482 --> 02:37:00.523]  That anything is possible.
[02:37:00.523 --> 02:37:09.629]  I want to be clear before the national media picks this up and lies and says that I'm saying there's going to be a nuclear attack in DC on Trump's inauguration come up in five days.
[02:37:09.629 --> 02:37:10.910]  I'm not saying that.
[02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:14.433]  I'm going to be there with my crew covering on the ground.
[02:37:16.317 --> 02:37:21.104]  And if the globalists did try something like that, it would end up blowing up in their face.
[02:37:21.104 --> 02:37:24.629]  Because the populist movement worldwide is exploding.
[02:37:24.629 --> 02:37:26.472]  Nationalism is exploding.
[02:37:26.472 --> 02:37:30.178]  And the people are on to this corporate form of world government.
[02:37:30.178 --> 02:37:31.820]  I mean, they were like, it's no exaggeration.
[02:37:32.481 --> 02:37:45.096]  More than 10 major articles in AFP, AP, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, just this weekend, admitting that at the Davos meeting in Switzerland, the globalists admit they're in crisis.
[02:37:45.096 --> 02:37:47.739]  They hope the communist Chinese can prop them up.
[02:37:47.739 --> 02:37:53.085]  They admit the public's awake to their planetary programs, so now it's in trouble, because they always wanted to operate by stealth.
[02:37:54.665 --> 02:38:01.350]  That was in the BAMF Canada documents 2007 from their whole North American Union meeting that it was key to keep it all stealth.
[02:38:01.350 --> 02:38:04.352]  Well if it's not stealth, it's dead on arrival.
[02:38:04.352 --> 02:38:07.714]  And so Trump is only surfing in on the populist movement.
[02:38:07.714 --> 02:38:11.257]  Just like the Brexit, just like Nigel Farage, just like I am.
[02:38:11.257 --> 02:38:12.037]  Just like we all are.
[02:38:12.037 --> 02:38:17.041]  I keep explaining, I'm not who's important, it's you the listeners, you the activists around the world.
[02:38:18.607 --> 02:38:22.968]  All the other racial division, religious stuff, that's a distraction the globalists use to divide us.
[02:38:22.968 --> 02:38:31.971]  Don't we all agree we don't want foreign, multinational, mega-banks, above the law, totally ruthless, tax-exempt, running our lives?
[02:38:31.971 --> 02:38:33.912]  Yes, we all agree that's wrong.
[02:38:33.912 --> 02:38:38.733]  99.9% of us, I mean we're talking less than 1 tenth of 1%, actually even benefit from this thing.
[02:38:40.049 --> 02:38:45.753]  Their ideology is to pull up the carpet, is to pull up the ladder, so that none of us can become self-sufficient.
[02:38:45.753 --> 02:38:47.174]  It's all about economic enslavement.
[02:38:47.174 --> 02:38:49.616]  It's all about turning us from owners into renters.
[02:38:49.616 --> 02:38:54.780]  That's their admitted plan under Cloward and Piven and so many other documents, but so many other public statements.
[02:38:56.254 --> 02:39:01.197]  That's why I harp on Obama telling Africans they can't have cars or air conditioning, but he lands in a jumbo jet.
[02:39:01.197 --> 02:39:02.318]  In Air Force One.
[02:39:02.318 --> 02:39:08.202]  With like 10 other major jets behind him and a thousand strong entourage and over 200 Secret Service.
[02:39:08.202 --> 02:39:11.704]  Sometimes he has a thousand Secret Service when he travels.
[02:39:11.704 --> 02:39:21.391]  I mean, it's just insane how disconnected, how arrogant, and how elitist these people are, but it's all coming to a massive head.
[02:39:21.391 --> 02:39:24.213]  So everybody keeps asking me, do you think Onuk will go off?
[02:39:24.213 --> 02:39:26.054]  Well, here's some background.
[02:39:27.602 --> 02:39:39.869]  The military has devices, spectrometers, you name it, that are able to see different radioactive isotopes even through heavy shielding.
[02:39:41.363 --> 02:39:44.004]  So it'd be very hard to bring a nuke into D.C.
[02:39:44.004 --> 02:39:51.706]  because there will be helicopters, there are satellites, there are other aircraft that are scanning that area for it being brought in.
[02:39:51.706 --> 02:39:59.367]  If something was there, it would have to be under 20, 30, 40 feet of concrete, and that's declassified stuff from the 80s.
[02:39:59.367 --> 02:40:06.749]  The word is they've got stuff even more powerful, they can see even deeper than 30, 40 feet of steel-reinforced concrete.
[02:40:06.749 --> 02:40:09.450]  So if something does get snuck in and detonated,
[02:40:10.666 --> 02:40:15.428]  It's a very good chance that the powers that be were involved because they've got technology to stop it.
[02:40:15.428 --> 02:40:27.954]  Whenever you drive into the Texas border or out of Mexico or out of Canada into, say, New York, New York State, you notice all these big devices that have a lot of antennas pointed out of your car?
[02:40:27.954 --> 02:40:30.655]  Those are radioactive snoopers.
[02:40:30.655 --> 02:40:31.375]  I'm not an engineer.
[02:40:31.375 --> 02:40:32.856]  I've just read about it and seen it.
[02:40:33.919 --> 02:40:37.560]  You know, driven to the border with engineers, and they've explained it to me, and I've gone and looked it up.
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:40.040]  So again, they've got all sorts of stuff.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:45.662]  And if a nuke does go off, you better believe it's the shadow government wanting to use COG to get power.
[02:40:45.662 --> 02:41:01.505]  In fact, there are four doomsday machines that, again, are big jets loaded with continued government systems, so in case Congress ever got taken out by a nuke, and or the president, or both, that they would be able to successfully continue the government.
[02:41:02.485 --> 02:41:08.549]  The problem is, is that in many other countries, COG systems have been used actually to seize control of the government.
[02:41:08.549 --> 02:41:16.234]  Because if something's a shadow government, if something's a separate government, if something has control of the government, if you're wanting to actually hijack it from the elected government, what do you do?
[02:41:16.234 --> 02:41:19.316]  Well, you take out the elected government, and then you install yourself.
[02:41:19.316 --> 02:41:26.821]  Or, with different people in the elected government, you countermand other people in the elected government, and circumvent, and have a coup that way.
[02:41:27.501 --> 02:41:32.049]  And what's happened is the globalists, by infiltration and economic takeover, have already taken over the U.S.
[02:41:32.049 --> 02:41:35.634]  Trump is a manifestation, and our movement is a manifestation of restoring the republic.
[02:41:36.838 --> 02:41:40.100]  That's why I hammer on the fact that we are getting our country back right now.
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:41.260]  People ask, is Trump real?
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:45.222]  Folks, he's going after Big Pharma that charges us the most in the world.
[02:41:45.222 --> 02:41:46.923]  He's going after vaccines.
[02:41:46.923 --> 02:41:48.543]  He's going after NaptonGad.
[02:41:48.543 --> 02:41:50.204]  He's going after TPP.
[02:41:50.204 --> 02:41:51.745]  He's going after the gun control.
[02:41:51.745 --> 02:41:53.265]  He's going after the open borders.
[02:41:53.265 --> 02:41:59.068]  He's going after the fact that they set our taxes the highest in the world so corporations wouldn't have their businesses based here.
[02:41:59.068 --> 02:42:00.349]  He's already brought back over a hundred
[02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:06.791]  Billion dollars of investment for 2017 hasn't been in office yet.
[02:42:06.791 --> 02:42:11.733]  There's already a trillion 200 billion more in the stock market and it goes on and on.
[02:42:11.733 --> 02:42:14.414]  But more importantly, he's discredited the mainstream media.
[02:42:14.414 --> 02:42:16.754]  He stood up as a real leader.
[02:42:16.754 --> 02:42:18.015]  He's not going to write you back.
[02:42:19.275 --> 02:42:22.018]  Excuse me, he's not going to Davos over in Switzerland.
[02:42:22.018 --> 02:42:25.502]  He's going to Reykjavik to meet with Putin.
[02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:35.873]  They're announcing this meeting as his first major meeting to point out that it's leaders of countries that meet and make decisions, not a bunch of bankers meeting in Davos behind the scenes with other heads of state.
[02:42:36.253 --> 02:42:36.874]  No, it's not okay.
[02:42:55.274 --> 02:42:58.337]  That is coming down around them and they're scared.
[02:42:58.337 --> 02:43:01.399]  They know they're going to get prosecuted when Trump gets in.
[02:43:01.399 --> 02:43:04.782]  Not because Trump's even vindictive, but because it's justice and it has to be done.
[02:43:04.782 --> 02:43:06.063]  And Sessions is going to go after him.
[02:43:07.188 --> 02:43:10.269]  Notice they said that Obamacare was invincible and can never be repealed.
[02:43:10.269 --> 02:43:13.249]  Now you see it's being repealed, even before he's in office.
[02:43:13.249 --> 02:43:16.110]  It's already passed with the Senate, now it's in the House.
[02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:18.410]  The Senate was the hard part.
[02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:29.793]  And Trump pointed out, he said, I could let you keep having this in 2017 and not beat it, not repeal it, but then it would hurt the country so bad that it might be irreversible.
[02:43:29.793 --> 02:43:34.674]  I would give major political points against the Democrats, but instead we're gonna repeal it because it's the right thing to do, you see?
[02:43:34.674 --> 02:43:36.014]  That's what a true leader does.
[02:43:37.734 --> 02:43:41.677]  Now getting back to the nuke, I'm going to make this short and sweet.
[02:43:41.677 --> 02:43:46.642]  I hope no nuke goes off, but you cannot put it past these people to do anything.
[02:43:46.642 --> 02:43:51.145]  Or a financial collapse, which is the equivalent of a financial hydrogen bomb.
[02:43:51.145 --> 02:43:58.571]  The big thing it looks like they're pushing for is more media hoaxes, more dossiers, more made-up internet files they call dossiers, to give it credibility.
[02:43:59.611 --> 02:44:02.892]  Okay, so you've got that to deal with.
[02:44:02.892 --> 02:44:14.215]  Also, they've been busting in tens of thousands of people on the Soros and Ford Foundation payrolls to try to cause as much civil unrest as possible.
[02:44:14.215 --> 02:44:16.256]  They admit trying to shut down the inauguration.
[02:44:16.256 --> 02:44:18.336]  So that's an act of sedition right there.
[02:44:18.336 --> 02:44:20.637]  Because it's not like they're protesting something the government's done.
[02:44:21.377 --> 02:44:23.318]  Which is their first amendment, which I totally support.
[02:44:23.318 --> 02:44:36.785]  They're protesting the people's vote, and our president coming in and trying to shut down him getting into office, and trying to shut down him getting into the White House, and trying to go along with rogue groups in our government to hijack control of our country.
[02:44:36.785 --> 02:44:39.046]  See, that's an outside foreign power doing that.
[02:44:40.694 --> 02:44:45.618]  And that's why you see the Communist Chinese openly admitting they're buying up Hollywood to bolster the takeover of America.
[02:44:45.618 --> 02:44:51.724]  And you read the news, I mentioned earlier, that the elite hope the Chinese Communists can help the New World Order survive.
[02:44:51.724 --> 02:45:00.471]  They're openly calling on foreign powers to help them with money and boycotts and you name it, to quote, get our president in line.
[02:45:00.471 --> 02:45:06.257]  While they tell us that he secretly is meeting and worked with the Russians, when it's Hillary that got caught doing that, see?
[02:45:07.185 --> 02:45:17.208]  They're nakedly worshipping China, working with China, using their economic muscle and more to operate illegally in this country against the American people.
[02:45:17.208 --> 02:45:21.309]  Then they have the nerve to say that Trump is this outside traitor or enemy.
[02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:22.790]  This is the arrogance.
[02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:29.572]  So he's going to Reykjavik to meet with Putin for world peace, acting like a real leader, just like Reagan did with Gorbachev 30 years ago.
[02:45:30.891 --> 02:45:34.995]  Meanwhile, they're trying to bring the country down and trying to sabotage our electoral process.
[02:45:34.995 --> 02:45:42.882]  And as Obama gets ready to leave office, he's signing thousands of documents and just incredible piles of regulations every day.
[02:45:42.882 --> 02:45:47.626]  And on every front, it's terrible things that ruin the economy and hurt the American people.
[02:45:47.626 --> 02:45:50.428]  That's what a nasty piece of crap globalist Obama is.
[02:45:51.289 --> 02:45:54.171]  Carrying out his operation that he's sworn to do.
[02:45:54.171 --> 02:45:56.432]  See, it's not just rhetoric when I say they're evil enough to get us.
[02:45:56.432 --> 02:45:57.772]  That's their philosophy.
[02:45:57.772 --> 02:45:58.993]  That's their plan.
[02:45:58.993 --> 02:46:05.016]  The American system must fail and must fall because it competes with their global government that picks the winners.
[02:46:05.016 --> 02:46:06.177]  These are our sworn enemies.
[02:46:07.378 --> 02:46:09.420]  So yes, I think they could set off a nuke.
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:11.102]  I'm not saying they are.
[02:46:11.102 --> 02:46:12.724]  But clearly we've had nukes missing before.
[02:46:12.724 --> 02:46:15.607]  And so I think people asking that question are very smart.
[02:46:15.607 --> 02:46:17.329]  And that's something that has to be looked at.
[02:46:17.329 --> 02:46:21.714]  But I think the race riot angle and other things like that are probably what will happen.
[02:46:21.714 --> 02:46:27.300]  But that may not even happen because they failed to sell this whole Trump is a Russian agent narrative.
[02:46:27.941 --> 02:46:36.204]  And no matter how hard they push with all these fake civil rights leaders and other race pimps, it's only blowing up their face because the next big turning is here.
[02:46:36.204 --> 02:46:37.725]  The tipping point is here.
[02:46:37.725 --> 02:46:40.646]  You cannot deny that, and that's why I'm so excited.
[02:46:40.646 --> 02:46:42.747]  We are witnessing incredible history.
[02:46:42.747 --> 02:46:44.488]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:46:44.488 --> 02:46:49.310]  I'm traveling back to Texas tomorrow, and I'll be back in studio.
[02:46:49.310 --> 02:46:53.552]  Took off a few weeks with the family, but it's been a working vacation.
[02:46:54.372 --> 02:46:58.760]  And it's been good to be out here and to see what's happening in other corners of the nation.
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:02.165]  But back to David Knight hosting the worldwide broadcast.
[02:47:03.777 --> 02:47:04.878]  And again, that's Alex Jones.
[02:47:04.878 --> 02:47:08.199]  He's talking about the attack on the American system by the global elitists.
[02:47:08.199 --> 02:47:12.261]  You have to understand that it's not just Donald Trump that they're attacking.
[02:47:12.261 --> 02:47:14.942]  They're attacking the tens of millions of people who voted for Donald Trump.
[02:47:14.942 --> 02:47:18.183]  They're attacking the peaceful transition of power.
[02:47:18.183 --> 02:47:23.646]  They're attacking democratic elections when they talk about how this is illegitimate.
[02:47:23.646 --> 02:47:26.247]  And of course, what is the source of this attack?
[02:47:26.247 --> 02:47:28.068]  Who's been leading this?
[02:47:28.068 --> 02:47:30.009]  As Glenn Greenwald pointed out, it's the deep state.
[02:47:31.278 --> 02:47:47.526]  And he said, shame on the liberals who have, in many cases, been at the forefront of talking about how it was wrong for the CIA to be overthrowing regimes throughout the world and protested when that happened elsewhere, but then inviting it here, at home, because they don't agree with Donald Trump.
[02:47:47.526 --> 02:47:54.090]  There are ways in a representative democracy to oppose policies of people that you don't like.
[02:47:54.997 --> 02:48:00.721]  But of course we have seen, this is the same playbook we've seen from Barack Obama throughout his eight years of his administration.
[02:48:00.721 --> 02:48:02.943]  And that is to shoot the messenger.
[02:48:02.943 --> 02:48:10.229]  Whenever we had whistleblowers or journalists exposing unconstitutional criminal actions by the Obama administration, what was their response?
[02:48:10.229 --> 02:48:14.312]  It was always to attack the source of the information.
[02:48:14.312 --> 02:48:17.554]  Not to say, hey, we didn't do anything wrong, let's take a look at this.
[02:48:17.554 --> 02:48:18.635]  No, no, no, no.
[02:48:18.635 --> 02:48:20.196]  This guy should never have done that.
[02:48:20.196 --> 02:48:22.278]  Let's execute Snowden.
[02:48:23.283 --> 02:48:30.728]  Let's come after him, and you know there's now a petition that has over 1 million signatures asking Obama to pardon Snowden.
[02:48:30.728 --> 02:48:34.970]  I'm all for that, but you understand, Obama's not about to do that.
[02:48:34.970 --> 02:48:38.032]  Snowden represents the hallmark of the Obama administration.
[02:48:38.032 --> 02:48:47.978]  Using that 100-year-old law, the Espionage Act of 1917, more than every other president combined in the last 100 years to come after whistleblowers and journalists.
[02:48:47.978 --> 02:48:51.720]  And so, it is perfectly in keeping for him to come after Snowden.
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:52.681]  Snowden will be.
[02:48:53.692 --> 02:48:57.296]  The epitome of the Obama criminality that we see.
[02:48:57.296 --> 02:49:02.962]  But let's take a look at this back and forth that's going on between John Brennan and Donald Trump over the last weekend.
[02:49:02.962 --> 02:49:12.852]  Now the New American pointed out on Saturday that Donald Trump, and we didn't talk about this too much because there's so much else that was happening in the press conference that happened on Wednesday.
[02:49:13.598 --> 02:49:24.641]  But he pointed out that he had essentially done a sting operation on the intelligence services to show that it was they who were leaking this information.
[02:49:24.641 --> 02:49:30.822]  Because we had the press conference and later on the press conference they point out he said, I'll tell you what does happen.
[02:49:30.822 --> 02:49:35.104]  I have many meetings with intelligence and every time I meet people are reading about it.
[02:49:35.104 --> 02:49:36.464]  Somebody is leaking it out.
[02:49:37.458 --> 02:49:46.003]  And then they say he went on to explain that he considered the possibility that leaks could be coming from his office and he said, well, I thought maybe it's my office because I have a lot of people.
[02:49:46.003 --> 02:49:47.123]  Maybe it's them.
[02:49:47.123 --> 02:49:51.385]  So Donald Trump hatched a plan to ferret out the link.
[02:49:51.385 --> 02:49:52.766]  And this is what he said at the press conference.
[02:49:52.766 --> 02:49:56.168]  He said, and what I did is I said, I won't tell anybody.
[02:49:56.809 --> 02:50:23.194]  I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence and what happened was I had my meeting, nobody knew, not even Rona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know, I didn't tell her, nobody knew, the meeting, we had the meeting, the meeting was over, they left and he said the only people who knew about the meeting were myself and the intelligence community, but word got out immediately that I'd had a meeting.
[02:50:23.194 --> 02:50:24.195]  You see?
[02:50:24.195 --> 02:50:25.615]  Donald Trump is not an idiot.
[02:50:26.638 --> 02:50:27.798]  He knows how to do his own.
[02:50:27.798 --> 02:50:29.019]  He's like, I got a leak.
[02:50:29.019 --> 02:50:33.060]  I'm going to just compartmentalize this information and then see if it gets out.
[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:34.241]  And it did get out.
[02:50:34.241 --> 02:50:38.222]  And that's one of the reasons why he said, you know, hey, these guys are acting like Nazis.
[02:50:38.222 --> 02:50:40.043]  They put out this fake information on me.
[02:50:40.043 --> 02:50:40.943]  We have these meetings.
[02:50:40.943 --> 02:50:42.004]  I don't tell anybody but them.
[02:50:42.004 --> 02:50:44.665]  And then they leak stuff about the meeting.
[02:50:44.665 --> 02:50:50.487]  And then we have John Brennan coming back and saying, well, I take great umbrage that he would compare us to the Nazis.
[02:50:50.487 --> 02:50:53.628]  Maybe what he should have done is compared them to the Soviet Union.
[02:50:54.444 --> 02:50:58.987]  And the East German Stasi, because that's what the former head of the NSA, William Binney, did.

[02:54:07.649 --> 02:54:09.030]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:10.331]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:10.331 --> 02:54:13.173]  The fourth hour is going to be hosted by Leanne and Owen.
[02:54:13.173 --> 02:54:15.554]  They'll be joining us in a little bit.
[02:54:15.554 --> 02:54:21.678]  But before we go back to the news, I want to finish up with this back and forth between Donald Trump and John Brennan and the CIA.
[02:54:21.678 --> 02:54:23.119]  Before we do that, I just want to remind you...
[02:54:23.931 --> 02:54:28.813]  That our special 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative, that will be ending soon.
[02:54:28.813 --> 02:54:31.714]  You can see the sales at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:31.714 --> 02:54:39.197]  Anywhere from 20 to 30% off a wide variety of supplements that we sell at InfoWarsLife, and of course that's the way we fund our operation.
[02:54:39.757 --> 02:54:41.779]  We don't get massive grants from the government.
[02:54:41.779 --> 02:54:44.181]  We don't get grants from George Soros.
[02:54:44.181 --> 02:54:51.326]  Instead, they attack us when we sell products that will help you to protect yourself, to protect your family, to protect your health.
[02:54:51.326 --> 02:54:54.548]  Also, we have received an emergency shipment of DNA Force.
[02:54:54.548 --> 02:54:57.390]  We've been out of that for over a month and we got in a
[02:54:58.271 --> 02:55:01.135]  Limited shipment, and so it's now available for a limited time.
[02:55:01.135 --> 02:55:08.185]  We're going to offer you 10% discount off to help you get stock back up because it was out for a while.
[02:55:08.185 --> 02:55:10.448]  And again, it is a very difficult thing for us to get.
[02:55:10.448 --> 02:55:12.731]  It's because of this key ingredient, BioPQQ.
[02:55:14.284 --> 02:55:17.065]  Just one batch of that costs $30,000.
[02:55:17.065 --> 02:55:32.388]  And if you want to know how important that is to your cellular health, take a look at the 175 clinical studies, read the information that we have at InfoWarsLife.com, do your own research, and you'll understand why people find this to be so important.
[02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:39.790]  Again, it's very difficult for us to secure this, very expensive to secure it, so a 10% discount is a significant savings off of this.
[02:55:41.134 --> 02:55:44.857]  It is our, I guess, our most expensive supplement that we have there.
[02:55:44.857 --> 02:55:46.558]  So 10% is a significant savings.
[02:55:46.558 --> 02:55:53.143]  Again, that is now in stock as well for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:53.143 --> 02:56:01.810]  As I was just reporting, Donald Trump pointed out in the press conference, and there was so much other stuff that was going on the press conference, it wasn't noticed a great deal.
[02:56:01.810 --> 02:56:09.015]  But he said, hey, I knew that this information was being leaked, so I set up a little, actually it was a sting if you want,
[02:56:09.887 --> 02:56:20.175]  And he compartmentalized this information, and he only told these intelligence guys about it, and he said, immediately after the meeting, nobody else knew about it, none of my staff, because this leaked out to the press.
[02:56:20.175 --> 02:56:29.703]  And that is the basis of that, and of course the idea that this thing is absolutely disgusting, and faults this dirty dossier.
[02:56:29.703 --> 02:56:30.764]  He thanked Bob Woodward.
[02:56:31.568 --> 02:56:34.771]  As he blasted the intelligence community over this dossier.
[02:56:34.771 --> 02:56:38.554]  He said thank you to Bob Woodward who said that is a garbage document.
[02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:40.136]  It never should have been presented.
[02:56:40.136 --> 02:56:43.238]  Trump is right to be upset and angry about it.
[02:56:43.238 --> 02:56:46.601]  He said this is an article from the Hill.
[02:56:46.601 --> 02:56:50.705]  They say earlier on Fox News Sunday, Bob Woodward from Watergate
[02:56:51.664 --> 02:56:55.806]  Called the dossier a garbage document, and said they never should have used it.
[02:56:55.806 --> 02:57:01.149]  He also said, intelligence officials who are terrific and have done a great work, make a mistake here.
[02:57:01.149 --> 02:57:04.091]  And when people make mistakes, they should apologize.
[02:57:04.091 --> 02:57:05.471]  But see, they're not apologizing.
[02:57:05.471 --> 02:57:06.812]  They're doubling down.
[02:57:06.812 --> 02:57:11.454]  We got John Brennan coming out and saying, Donald Trump is outrageous.
[02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:13.656]  How dare him compare us to Nazis?
[02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:19.839]  And I pointed out, well, William Benning has compared what the NSA is doing and intelligence communities in terms of spying on the American people
[02:57:20.519 --> 02:57:26.464]  Illegally, unconstitutionally, he has compared it to what he observed for years as a head technical person for the NSA.
[02:57:26.464 --> 02:57:33.349]  He said, this is exactly what I saw happening by the Stasi in East Germany and in the Soviet Union.
[02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:34.589]  This is what I fought against.
[02:57:34.589 --> 02:57:37.492]  I don't want to see this happen in America.
[02:57:37.492 --> 02:57:42.595]  And of course, a lot of people have... How many times has Donald Trump been called a Nazi?
[02:57:42.595 --> 02:57:44.817]  By everybody from Glenn Beck to Rachel Maddow.
[02:57:45.689 --> 02:57:51.210]  But when he says this, they take umbrage at it, according to the CIA Director John Brennan.
[02:57:51.210 --> 02:57:53.971]  And listen to the condescending tone that John Brennan has.
[02:57:53.971 --> 02:58:03.073]  He says, I think Donald Trump needs to be mindful that he does not have full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road.
[02:58:03.073 --> 02:58:03.933]  Well, you know what?
[02:58:03.933 --> 02:58:06.134]  He understands exactly what you're doing, John Brennan.
[02:58:06.574 --> 02:58:09.216]  That's one of the reasons why he set up his own sting operation.
[02:58:09.216 --> 02:58:20.185]  And then after you did this, and after you pushed back on this, Donald Trump tweeted out to his 20 million Twitter followers, well, was the CIA boss the leaker of fake news?
[02:58:20.185 --> 02:58:21.806]  He isn't gonna back down.
[02:58:21.806 --> 02:58:28.372]  You guys need to understand, that's why there's so much concern about what the deep state, what the globalists will do.
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:31.581]  Either at the inauguration or shortly after.
[02:58:31.581 --> 02:58:32.602]  Stay with us when we come back.
[02:58:32.602 --> 02:58:38.004]  We're going to talk about how Barack Obama offered us hope, but what we got was chains.
[02:58:38.004 --> 02:58:39.845]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:39.845 --> 02:58:43.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.127 --> 02:58:45.308]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.178 --> 02:59:00.045]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[02:59:00.045 --> 02:59:07.830]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:13.754]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[02:59:13.854 --> 02:59:19.859]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[02:59:19.859 --> 02:59:21.000]  I mean, what did they really say about them?
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.822]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[02:59:23.822 --> 02:59:27.565]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[02:59:27.565 --> 02:59:30.487]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[02:59:30.487 --> 02:59:32.348]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:59:32.348 --> 02:59:33.369]  It's a quarter-inch thick.
[02:59:33.369 --> 02:59:34.510]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:35.170]  It's waterproof.
[02:59:35.170 --> 02:59:35.651]  You can wear it.
[02:59:35.651 --> 02:59:36.331]  It's comfortable.
[02:59:36.331 --> 02:59:38.433]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[02:59:38.433 --> 02:59:40.234]  Again, fund the info org.

[02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:51.762]  It's amazing.

[03:00:00.709 --> 03:00:03.831]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:00:03.831 --> 03:00:08.874]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:08.874 --> 03:00:11.236]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:00:14.881 --> 03:00:19.003]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.003 --> 03:00:23.465]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.465 --> 03:00:24.205]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:24.205 --> 03:00:30.408]  In the next segment, Leanne McAdoo and Owen Shroyer will be taking over and they'll be carrying this out through the fourth hour.
[03:00:30.408 --> 03:00:38.591]  By the time we got left, I want to take a look at the chains, not the change, but the chains that Barack Obama has been forging.
[03:00:39.409 --> 03:00:53.297]  Understand that, for example, in 2015, the Congress passed 87 new laws, but the bureaucrats, the bureaucracy, that really is under the executive branch, passed 3,400 rules.
[03:00:53.297 --> 03:00:57.780]  That's about 40 times the number of rules as laws.
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:58.600]  Do you understand?
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:02.622]  This is legislation without representation.
[03:01:02.622 --> 03:01:05.524]  This is a permanent bureaucracy that continues to ramp up these rules.
[03:01:05.524 --> 03:01:06.765]  And now we have seen an explosion
[03:01:07.521 --> 03:01:09.362]  In the last few days from Barack Obama.
[03:01:09.362 --> 03:01:19.927]  Now, many of these organizations, like Bloomberg, will talk about the fact, oh, well, you know, he doesn't have really that many that are that much different in count from George W. Bush or whatever.
[03:01:19.927 --> 03:01:27.791]  Well, there's a big difference, not just in the quantity, but there's a bigger difference in the quality of these kinds of regulations.
[03:01:27.791 --> 03:01:34.395]  For example, one story from the Wall Street Journal pointed out that a lot of these executive orders in the past have been very mundane.
[03:01:35.575 --> 03:01:44.719]  You had an executive order from JFK that talked about the fact that for executive orders themselves, you would have a one and a half inch margin on the paper.
[03:01:44.719 --> 03:01:45.879]  That was an executive order.
[03:01:45.879 --> 03:01:47.640]  So that counts as one.
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:48.200]  Okay.
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:53.622]  And then George W. Bush had an executive order that says, no, it's not going to be a one and a half inch margin around the edge.
[03:01:53.622 --> 03:01:58.264]  We're going to have a one inch margin on these printed executive orders.
[03:01:58.264 --> 03:01:59.925]  That counts as one for George W. Bush.
[03:02:00.859 --> 03:02:12.926]  And yet, Barack Obama, in terms of qualitative executive orders, instead of talking about how wide the margin is going to be on the executive orders, he spends his executive orders in a very big way, okay?
[03:02:12.926 --> 03:02:17.789]  It's not mundane, but massive, the effects of his executive orders.
[03:02:17.789 --> 03:02:23.633]  What he does is he takes over, federalizes land throughout the United States,
[03:02:25.029 --> 03:02:38.597]  Three times the amount of land that's in the state of Texas he has seized, illegally, unconstitutionally, by misusing a 1906 law that was set up to set up monuments.
[03:02:38.597 --> 03:02:47.503]  And so he declares essentially the state of Nevada as a monument, or the state of Utah as a monument, and takes over most of the land in those areas.
[03:02:47.503 --> 03:02:49.584]  That's what Barack Obama is doing.
[03:02:50.478 --> 03:02:57.524]  And then, of course, these executive orders that come through for very disturbing things that have to do with civil liberties.
[03:02:57.524 --> 03:03:08.253]  Take a look, for example, as I point out, the number of things that came out of the EPA last week and the Department of Justice involving automobiles.
[03:03:08.253 --> 03:03:17.801]  And, of course, it's not only the end of the Obama administration where they're trying to pile these things on, but it's also the same time that one of the biggest auto shows of the world is going on in Detroit.
[03:03:17.801 --> 03:03:18.941]  So they seize that moment
[03:03:19.727 --> 03:03:22.829]  And they get big headlines each and every day.
[03:03:22.829 --> 03:03:38.778]  And as I said before, I said this last week when I covered it, I said, somebody in the upcoming Department of Justice needs to take a very close look at these bureaucrats who pronounce that they're going to come after Chrysler Fiat for their diesel engines one day and tank that stock by 15%.
[03:03:38.778 --> 03:03:43.181]  And then the next day they do it for Renault and tank their stock.
[03:03:43.181 --> 03:03:44.882]  Are these guys involved in insider trading?
[03:03:46.363 --> 03:03:50.545]  Remember, Nancy Pelosi did exactly that sort of thing.
[03:03:50.545 --> 03:03:51.266]  She was called on it.
[03:03:51.266 --> 03:03:53.187]  She said, oh, there's no rule here.
[03:03:53.187 --> 03:03:54.107]  There's no rule here.
[03:03:54.107 --> 03:03:55.148]  See?
[03:03:55.148 --> 03:04:00.991]  Just like they're now saying, oh, you know, Donald Trump can't continue to run his own business.
[03:04:00.991 --> 03:04:02.132]  Well, there's no rule about that.
[03:04:03.211 --> 03:04:05.832]  But he's doing things to try to walk that back ethically.
[03:04:05.832 --> 03:04:13.515]  Now their approach was, when they got caught doing insider trading, they said, there is no controlling legal authority here, you know, kind of quoting Al Gore.
[03:04:13.515 --> 03:04:17.376]  And then they set up the Stock Act that was going to stop insider trading.
[03:04:17.376 --> 03:04:19.757]  And then when nobody was looking, they eviscerated that act.
[03:04:20.337 --> 03:04:22.758]  They waited about eight or nine months and eviscerated it.
[03:04:22.758 --> 03:04:38.442]  Now it's not legal for bureaucrats to do this, but I can guarantee you, even though I can't prove it, I can guarantee you that there's some bureaucrats there who are going to be making some golden parachutes by tanking these different companies one day after the other.
[03:04:38.442 --> 03:04:40.222]  And just take a look at the difference.
[03:04:40.222 --> 03:04:43.363]  They're coming after this one guy, this Volkswagen executive.
[03:04:43.363 --> 03:04:45.003]  They want to lock him up for 169 years in prison because
[03:04:48.945 --> 03:04:49.706]  He didn't
[03:05:07.602 --> 03:05:12.147]  I'm freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[03:05:12.147 --> 03:05:28.685]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Steve Watson and it talks about how this unprecedented move that Trump's incoming White House press secretary revealed yesterday that members of the alt-media may be allowed to join the White House press corps and take part in press conferences in Washington.
[03:05:29.045 --> 03:05:32.187]  Now this off-the-chart interest in the Trump administration.
[03:05:32.187 --> 03:05:37.451]  The President-Elect thinking that he's going to relocate the press briefings to a room with a larger capacity.
[03:05:37.451 --> 03:05:43.416]  Sean Spicer is attributing, since 1970 all official press briefings have been held in the James S. Brady room.
[03:05:43.416 --> 03:05:55.846]  Looks like he's moving them over one and based on CNN's performance last week where Jim Acosta was called out by President-Elect Trump, it's a miracle if they are ever let back in the press corps in the capacity that they were.
[03:05:55.846 --> 03:05:58.508]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com

[03:08:26.967 --> 03:08:29.089]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:08:29.089 --> 03:08:34.052]  Owen Schroer, Leigh Ann McAdoo with you, and we have stacks of news to cover.
[03:08:34.052 --> 03:08:37.194]  And I wanted to get started, we always talk about what we want to start with.
[03:08:37.194 --> 03:08:39.916]  We'll start with Martin Luther King's niece.
[03:08:39.916 --> 03:08:44.039]  She comes out today and she says that she voted for Donald Trump.
[03:08:44.039 --> 03:08:48.562]  On the same day, Donald Trump also met with Martin Luther King Jr., the third
[03:08:49.082 --> 03:08:51.385]  So you have Martin Luther King's niece saying, I voted for Trump.
[03:08:51.385 --> 03:08:56.129]  You have Martin Luther King III coming out and meeting with Donald Trump.
[03:08:56.129 --> 03:08:58.472]  Of course, today is Martin Luther King Day.
[03:08:58.472 --> 03:09:04.378]  And while all this is going on, Al Sharpton actually had a DC protest today.
[03:09:04.998 --> 03:09:08.482]  Now, I was watching some of this, and he had very low turnout.
[03:09:08.482 --> 03:09:11.164]  It was actually raining on their parade.
[03:09:11.164 --> 03:09:24.878]  And there's a story here that talks about how the protest of Sharpton's is beyond just Donald Trump, but it's a beef with bipartisan, when it's actually, they are the ones that are hyper-partisan here.
[03:09:24.878 --> 03:09:28.261]  And Cory Booker was on the Hill preaching and ranting about how
[03:09:29.422 --> 03:09:36.550]  They need to use this day and use this protest to bring up more stuff with civil rights, human rights, and that's, you know, we're behind all that.
[03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:37.531]  But we know what they're doing.
[03:09:37.531 --> 03:09:39.233]  They're trying to delegitimize Trump.
[03:09:39.233 --> 03:09:44.478]  They're trying to act like America, white nationalists, racists are the ones that elected Donald Trump.
[03:09:44.478 --> 03:09:50.985]  And that's what they're fomenting here in the buildup to all of these protests that are going to happen on the inauguration.
[03:09:51.465 --> 03:09:53.247]  What do you think is going on here, Leanne?
[03:09:53.247 --> 03:09:55.709]  Do you think this is going to work for them?
[03:09:55.709 --> 03:10:01.714]  Do you think they're going to get more people to come out with all this stuff they're saying, protesting, Sharpton talking today?
[03:10:01.714 --> 03:10:04.476]  Do you think this is going to help or do you think this is going to hurt them?
[03:10:04.476 --> 03:10:11.662]  Well, I think, you know, Daily Caller had a good story out about, let's remember what happened when George W. Bush was getting inaugurated.
[03:10:11.662 --> 03:10:13.764]  I mean, it was violent protests there.
[03:10:13.764 --> 03:10:19.809]  They actually had to do away with the presidential walk from the car into the White House because they were afraid that
[03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.489]  I think so.
[03:10:35.638 --> 03:10:35.718]  I'm
[03:10:50.814 --> 03:10:50.894]  Yes.
[03:11:11.060 --> 03:11:13.141]  It was a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:11:13.141 --> 03:11:30.128]  where he was saying that one of the first things that the racist white people do is they invite the black leaders to tea, to coffee and tea, and the black leaders, they just can't resist that tea, and so then they go and the Uncle Tom with the racist white guy, and they come out of the meeting going, you know,
[03:11:31.489 --> 03:11:32.409]  They weren't that bad.
[03:11:32.409 --> 03:11:33.570]  They were kind of nice.
[03:11:33.570 --> 03:11:35.311]  I think they're going to be good for us or whatever.
[03:11:35.311 --> 03:11:36.592]  And so there's this meme going around.
[03:11:36.592 --> 03:11:44.318]  So now it's just kind of reinforcing, hey, don't trust Donald Trump when all these black leaders go and meet with him and come out of the meetings going, oh, you know what?
[03:11:44.318 --> 03:11:45.639]  He's really not that bad of a guy.
[03:11:45.639 --> 03:11:48.561]  So it's just like, can we, we can never move on.
[03:11:48.561 --> 03:11:53.944]  It's not about, you know, what Martin Luther King's message was, but the judging people and the content of their character.
[03:11:53.944 --> 03:11:56.146]  We've completely done away with that part of his message.
[03:11:56.206 --> 03:11:57.447]  Well, let's be perfectly clear.
[03:11:57.447 --> 03:12:07.876]  They can try to deny that this is some sort of emergency response to Donald Trump's election and the racism that it means, but no, that's exactly what this is.
[03:12:07.876 --> 03:12:09.337]  They'll try to say it's bipartisan.
[03:12:09.337 --> 03:12:10.958]  They'll try to say human rights, this, that, the other thing.
[03:12:10.958 --> 03:12:11.258]  No, no, no.
[03:12:11.258 --> 03:12:13.720]  This is clearly because Donald Trump was elected.
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:15.222]  We know that's what this is.
[03:12:15.222 --> 03:12:16.623]  Quit trying to put a mask on it.
[03:12:17.183 --> 03:12:26.846]  I think it's ironic, Leigh-Anne, that you have today's Martin Luther King Day, and you have Al Sharpton, who's leading these protests, okay, on the Hill.
[03:12:26.846 --> 03:12:27.966]  He's getting people fired up.
[03:12:27.966 --> 03:12:29.707]  A lot of speakers out there, you know, preaching.
[03:12:29.707 --> 03:12:30.687]  A couple hundred.
[03:12:30.687 --> 03:12:36.148]  Well, there were only a couple hundred people that were there as far as the, you know, citizens that showed up to be a part of the protest.
[03:12:36.148 --> 03:12:37.829]  But he had speakers, multiple speakers.
[03:12:37.829 --> 03:12:42.010]  It was very passionate, a typical Al Sharpton-type event that you would expect.
[03:12:42.010 --> 03:12:45.251]  But the irony to me is, on Martin Luther King Day,
[03:12:46.031 --> 03:12:51.914]  Al Sharpton is going to have his protest because Donald Trump is racist and racists elected him and people need to be aware of this.
[03:12:51.914 --> 03:13:00.618]  But on the same day, Martin Luther King's niece is saying she voted for Trump and Martin Luther King III is actually meeting with Trump.
[03:13:00.618 --> 03:13:00.978]  Right.
[03:13:00.978 --> 03:13:10.823]  So here's Al Sharpton trying to do everything he can to try to undermine Donald Trump's election, undermine the Make America Great Again movement, try to cast it off as racist.
[03:13:11.423 --> 03:13:15.366]  Well, but on Martin Luther King Day, the actual lineage of Martin Luther King is here talking about Trump.
[03:13:15.366 --> 03:13:15.846]  Right.
[03:13:15.846 --> 03:13:16.466]  Exactly.
[03:13:16.466 --> 03:13:18.007]  And that's that's the issue here.
[03:13:18.007 --> 03:13:20.549]  It's people like Sharpton who are these constant race baiters.
[03:13:20.549 --> 03:13:22.510]  That's what they've their claim to fame.
[03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:28.194]  That's how they continue to make their money is by constantly dividing the races.
[03:13:28.194 --> 03:13:30.476]  And so they're going to put out that meme.
[03:13:30.476 --> 03:13:36.800]  Oh, well, don't think that just because Martin Luther King, the third is meeting with Donald Trump, that that's going to change anything.
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:37.520]  Don't believe them.
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:41.123]  So they just do not want to let go of this racial division.
[03:13:41.403 --> 03:13:42.003]  They can't.
[03:13:42.003 --> 03:13:44.624]  That's all they know is the identity politics.
[03:13:44.624 --> 03:13:45.904]  That's the problem here.
[03:13:45.904 --> 03:13:48.165]  They don't know anything else.
[03:13:48.165 --> 03:13:53.647]  They lose on policy, their policies have failed, or are complete pipe dreams, so they have to cling.
[03:13:53.647 --> 03:13:54.967]  They're the bitter clingers.
[03:13:54.967 --> 03:13:59.028]  They're bitter clinging to identity politics, and you can see the picture here if you want to come back to the dot cam.
[03:13:59.028 --> 03:14:05.870]  And that was what all of Donald Trump's appointments, all the questions they were giving them, was all about those social policies that they worked so hard to implement.
[03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:07.971]  Are you going to repeal those social policies?
[03:14:07.971 --> 03:14:08.511]  And everyone's like,
[03:14:09.651 --> 03:14:10.892]  Let's talk about jobs.
[03:14:10.892 --> 03:14:12.652]  Let's talk about helping our communities.
[03:14:12.652 --> 03:14:19.675]  You know, why are we still talking about these things that, you know, yeah, we're working toward becoming a post-racial America, I guess.
[03:14:19.675 --> 03:14:30.078]  But, I mean, that's what I love so much when asked at the debate how he would heal the racial divide and the racial tension in this country, and Donald Trump said jobs.
[03:14:30.078 --> 03:14:35.880]  That's what's going to really make us equal and feel like we're all... Well, it's true, I mean... This America is for all of us.
[03:14:37.341 --> 03:14:40.903]  It's true that, you know, look, we're not going to sit here and money is not God.
[03:14:40.903 --> 03:14:43.024]  You know, that's a sin to put money over God.
[03:14:43.024 --> 03:14:46.325]  But, it is just, I mean, it's just how society works.
[03:14:46.325 --> 03:14:52.728]  If you have more money, you're more likely to, I guess, be able to enjoy the things in life that you want to do.
[03:14:52.728 --> 03:14:54.849]  I mean, that's why people work hard.
[03:14:54.849 --> 03:14:58.051]  Yeah, putting food on the table and not having to have the government handout.
[03:14:58.051 --> 03:14:58.991]  Yeah, worrying about meals.
[03:14:58.991 --> 03:15:00.132]  Not have the government handout.
[03:15:00.532 --> 03:15:03.994]  So you can see though there was about a couple hundred people that showed up to this protest.
[03:15:03.994 --> 03:15:10.717]  Cory Booker, he seems to be the new and up-and-coming star of the identity politics from the left.
[03:15:10.717 --> 03:15:14.720]  You were talking about how you think he's actually trying to make a bid for a presidential run.
[03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:15.280]  Totally.
[03:15:15.660 --> 03:15:21.022]  But it's kind of interesting, which I really enjoy, because you have the Bernie Sanders supporters on that end.
[03:15:21.022 --> 03:15:32.765]  They're totally calling out Cory Booker, saying, look, you promised all of these things, but then you went and voted against what you told us you were going to, what was it, raising drug prices.
[03:15:32.765 --> 03:15:35.086]  So he went and voted with Big Pharma.
[03:15:35.086 --> 03:15:37.387]  Meanwhile, he's out there telling the Democrats these
[03:15:38.127 --> 03:15:38.707]  I don't know.
[03:15:58.604 --> 03:16:05.907]  The story with people like Cory Booker, John Lewis, they just cannot let go of identity politics.
[03:16:05.907 --> 03:16:06.888]  That's what it comes down to.
[03:16:06.888 --> 03:16:08.708]  That's the story, period.
[03:16:08.708 --> 03:16:17.812]  You can't get over identity politics, you are obsessed with it, your entire reality has crashed around you, and you're still bitter clinging to identity politics.
[03:16:17.812 --> 03:16:18.573]  It's unbelievable.
[03:16:18.573 --> 03:16:24.215]  You think that they could think their way out of this paradox that they're stuck in, but they just cannot do it.
[03:16:24.315 --> 03:16:33.600]  They truly thought that that was going to be their thing, that they had the card that they could continue to play, that they would win again in a landslide, and they obviously don't get the message.
[03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:39.023]  America voted entirely against all those social policies and that far-left progressivism.
[03:16:39.023 --> 03:16:40.484]  Let's talk a little bit about John Lewis.
[03:16:40.484 --> 03:16:45.807]  So, a lot of people, he said that he doesn't view President-elect Donald Trump as legitimate.
[03:16:46.387 --> 03:16:51.450]  Now, you'll recall when people were saying that about Barack Obama, it was racist to say that.
[03:16:51.450 --> 03:16:55.733]  But when he's coming out saying that he doesn't view him as legitimate, that's totally fine.
[03:16:55.733 --> 03:17:03.597]  And when Donald Trump slammed him back, they said that Donald Trump really doesn't even have the right to talk to John Lewis because he's a civil rights icon.
[03:17:03.597 --> 03:17:06.459]  And it's Martin Luther King holiday coming up.
[03:17:06.459 --> 03:17:14.864]  So because he is a civil rights icon and it's Martin Luther King holiday, you are not allowed to speak to this man and call him on his bias there.
[03:17:15.504 --> 03:17:17.025]  So let me get this straight.
[03:17:17.025 --> 03:17:20.907]  John Lewis says that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president.
[03:17:20.907 --> 03:17:21.687]  Why?
[03:17:21.687 --> 03:17:24.609]  Oh, because it was the Russians that elected Donald Trump.
[03:17:24.609 --> 03:17:27.730]  So that is completely inaccurate.
[03:17:27.730 --> 03:17:28.451]  100% wrong.
[03:17:28.451 --> 03:17:29.211]  Right.
[03:17:29.211 --> 03:17:34.334]  Now, John Lewis, on the other hand here, is going to say, I guess,
[03:17:35.114 --> 03:17:38.638]  He thinks that people are going to care what he thinks.
[03:17:38.638 --> 03:17:44.064]  He thinks people are going to latch onto this thought that Donald Trump is illegitimate because he's a Russian agent.
[03:17:44.064 --> 03:17:49.310]  Meanwhile, this is the all, again, for some reason irony just, just tickles me.
[03:17:49.310 --> 03:17:49.530]  Okay.
[03:17:50.011 --> 03:17:51.172]  Here's the irony.
[03:17:51.172 --> 03:17:54.373]  Barack Obama is the illegitimate president.
[03:17:54.373 --> 03:17:58.015]  His birth certificate has been caught as a forgery.
[03:17:58.015 --> 03:18:02.558]  So we've got cold hard evidence that Barack Obama is an illegitimate president.
[03:18:02.558 --> 03:18:06.400]  You've got nothing to say that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president.
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:08.341]  But of course, where does John Lewis go?
[03:18:08.341 --> 03:18:10.442]  He goes down the fake news route.
[03:18:10.442 --> 03:18:13.144]  Trump is a Russian agent, therefore he's illegitimate.
[03:18:13.144 --> 03:18:15.685]  But Barack Obama, fake birth certificate?
[03:18:15.685 --> 03:18:16.946]  Well, I'm not going to comment on that.
[03:18:17.671 --> 03:18:29.560]  Well, and interestingly enough, Anderson Cooper actually made the point that if Republicans had said this about President-elect Hillary Clinton, then the Democrats would be up in arms.
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:34.224]  Which is totally true, which I thought that was interesting that he called out on that hypocrisy there.
[03:18:34.224 --> 03:18:39.548]  That if they would have said that Hillary Clinton was illegitimate because, you know, she was under FBI investigation.
[03:18:39.548 --> 03:18:41.209]  Which, again, more proof there than Donald Trump.
[03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:42.830]  It's not even close.
[03:18:44.131 --> 03:18:44.812]  We're good to go.
[03:19:00.212 --> 03:19:02.853]  I don't think John Lewis would have had an issue with Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:02.853 --> 03:19:04.034]  I just have a feeling.
[03:19:04.034 --> 03:19:11.858]  Or do you think we would have had 20 Republicans sitting out Trump's inauguration if it was Hillary Clinton?
[03:19:11.858 --> 03:19:22.624]  So we were actually going to get into all of this in the long segment, and we were going to take some phone calls on this too, but I have a whole stack of news here that is just all about the Democrat wine bags.
[03:19:23.844 --> 03:19:32.730]  And, even more so, see the Democrats are going to be the ones that are going to talk about how they're anti-bullying, you know, stop bullying this, stop bullying that.
[03:19:32.730 --> 03:19:33.571]  You know, you've heard it.
[03:19:33.571 --> 03:19:35.092]  You've heard the same song and dance.
[03:19:35.092 --> 03:19:38.734]  Folks, these are the biggest bullies in American politics.
[03:19:38.734 --> 03:19:39.355]  Making death threats.
[03:19:39.355 --> 03:19:42.117]  And I've got a stack of news right here to prove it.
[03:19:42.117 --> 03:19:46.380]  See, I'm not illegitimate like John Lewis where I just say illegitimate but then no facts.
[03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:48.681]  No, I say illegitimate and then I have the facts.
[03:19:48.681 --> 03:19:52.204]  That's what we do at InfoWars.com, Alex Jones Show, 4th Hour, Liam McAdoo, Owen Schroeder.

[03:20:10.233 --> 03:20:14.275]  But how would you keep your refrigerator running in a long-term EMP blackout?

[03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:02.081]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:23:02.081 --> 03:23:03.221]  Charlie Daniels.
[03:23:03.221 --> 03:23:05.041]  He's always loved America.
[03:23:05.041 --> 03:23:06.842]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:23:06.842 --> 03:23:09.682]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[03:23:09.682 --> 03:23:13.803]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:23:13.803 --> 03:23:17.764]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:23:17.764 --> 03:23:19.664]  Well, you know what this expo's gonna be, don't you?
[03:23:19.664 --> 03:23:21.284]  There's gonna be a few guns.
[03:23:21.284 --> 03:23:21.605]  Oh, yeah.
[03:23:21.605 --> 03:23:23.585]  I'll tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:23:24.185 --> 03:23:25.126]  At all.
[03:23:25.126 --> 03:23:26.187]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:23:26.187 --> 03:23:28.309]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:29.530]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:23:29.530 --> 03:23:31.491]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:23:31.491 --> 03:23:37.456]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:23:37.456 --> 03:23:39.358]  Then beef was for supper.
[03:23:40.098 --> 03:23:42.540]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:23:42.540 --> 03:23:44.502]  Theatrical screenings on demand.

[03:24:00.715 --> 03:24:02.437]  All the leaves are brown.
[03:24:02.437 --> 03:24:04.459]  All the leaves are brown.
[03:24:04.459 --> 03:24:06.240]  And the sky is grey.
[03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:07.341]  And the sky is grey.
[03:24:08.920 --> 03:24:10.941]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:24:10.941 --> 03:24:12.661]  Owen Troyer and Leanne McAdoo with you.
[03:24:12.661 --> 03:24:15.442]  And this was on Drudge Report today.
[03:24:15.442 --> 03:24:20.444]  This is something that the InfoWars team has been reporting on for a long, long time.
[03:24:20.444 --> 03:24:28.807]  We've had lists of graphics that we've put out about this, but it was on the Drudge Report and this is a story that the AP ran doubly today.
[03:24:28.807 --> 03:24:31.848]  And you can comment on this, you can have your thoughts.
[03:24:31.848 --> 03:24:34.029]  Me and Leanne will share some and then we'll kind of put a bow on it.
[03:24:34.709 --> 03:24:41.795]  But the story that came out of the AP, one coming out of Switzerland, one coming out of London, almost the exact same time today.
[03:24:41.795 --> 03:24:42.956]  Stark inequality.
[03:24:42.956 --> 03:24:46.479]  Oxfam says eight men as rich as half the world.
[03:24:46.479 --> 03:24:47.901]  That was in the story out of Davos.
[03:24:47.901 --> 03:24:50.323]  And then a similar story out of London.
[03:24:50.323 --> 03:24:52.365]  Who are the eight richest people?
[03:24:52.365 --> 03:24:54.246]  All men, mostly Americans.
[03:24:54.246 --> 03:24:54.667]  You've got...
[03:24:55.407 --> 03:25:07.910]  The expected people, Bill Gates, number one, Amancio Ortega, number two, Warren Buffett, three, Carlos Slim, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, and Michael Bloomberg.
[03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:08.410]  Shocking.
[03:25:08.410 --> 03:25:11.111]  These are the people that... You know, it's amazing.
[03:25:11.111 --> 03:25:19.653]  These are the people, some of them, the left would praise, and they would love, while they want to get big money out of politics.
[03:25:19.653 --> 03:25:24.734]  But meanwhile, you know, with anti-trust laws, places like Facebook,
[03:25:26.624 --> 03:25:28.145]  You know, I don't know.
[03:25:28.145 --> 03:25:32.327]  You have a good product like Microsoft, Facebook, people use it.
[03:25:32.327 --> 03:25:33.208]  You're going to be rich.
[03:25:33.208 --> 03:25:34.209]  You're going to have power.
[03:25:34.209 --> 03:25:35.629]  That just comes with the territory.
[03:25:35.629 --> 03:25:39.172]  But there are supposed to be antitrust laws to try to break some of this stuff up.
[03:25:39.172 --> 03:25:41.093]  But are you surprised by this list?
[03:25:41.093 --> 03:25:41.393]  No.
[03:25:41.393 --> 03:25:42.734]  It's always the same list.
[03:25:42.734 --> 03:25:46.956]  And frankly, it doesn't have any of the Saudi princes on there.
[03:25:46.956 --> 03:25:47.797]  No Rothschilds.
[03:25:47.797 --> 03:25:49.038]  Jack Ma, no Rothschilds.
[03:25:49.038 --> 03:25:50.759]  So it's like the super, super rich.
[03:25:50.759 --> 03:25:54.261]  They don't even want you to know how filthy rich they are.
[03:25:55.061 --> 03:25:57.444]  Or you can't even calculate their wealth.
[03:25:57.444 --> 03:25:57.724]  Right.
[03:25:57.724 --> 03:25:58.645]  Because it's so absurd.
[03:25:58.645 --> 03:26:00.206]  Beyond computation.
[03:26:00.206 --> 03:26:03.589]  It's literally like you break the calculator trying to figure it out.
[03:26:03.589 --> 03:26:05.411]  But you know, here's the funny thing.
[03:26:05.411 --> 03:26:11.377]  Again, the left is the, the political left is the one that claims to get big money out of politics.
[03:26:11.377 --> 03:26:13.719]  These protesters, what happened to these protesters?
[03:26:15.014 --> 03:26:16.755]  They were just protesting Wall Street.
[03:26:16.755 --> 03:26:18.016]  Occupy Wall Street, right?
[03:26:18.016 --> 03:26:18.936]  Occupy the rich.
[03:26:18.936 --> 03:26:21.117]  Take from the rich to give to the poor.
[03:26:21.117 --> 03:26:25.299]  All the people on these lists donate to the political left!
[03:26:25.299 --> 03:26:27.060]  Every single one of them!
[03:26:27.060 --> 03:26:33.223]  And you're going to sit here and complain that the conservatives or the republicans or the right is the party of the wealthy.
[03:26:33.223 --> 03:26:36.505]  Now I'm not going to sit here and act like there aren't rich people on both sides of the aisle.
[03:26:36.505 --> 03:26:40.327]  That people who make more money tend to be more conservative.
[03:26:40.327 --> 03:26:41.928]  Of course, they want to conserve what they've earned.
[03:26:42.788 --> 03:26:58.455]  But it's just ironic to me, you look at this list, allegedly the richest people in the world, they're all leftist, they all give to the Democrats, and yet the Democrats, the protesters, claim that that's what they're out mobilized protesting is this control!
[03:26:58.455 --> 03:26:59.516]  Right.
[03:26:59.516 --> 03:27:01.157]  Ridiculously, Ann!
[03:27:01.157 --> 03:27:02.357]  I agree.
[03:27:02.357 --> 03:27:03.898]  There you go, just some more insanity.
[03:27:04.218 --> 03:27:05.539]  But there you go, apparently.
[03:27:05.539 --> 03:27:12.061]  And then, of course, the other story is, those eight men are as rich as half of the world's population.
[03:27:12.061 --> 03:27:15.262]  And they wished that they could have called them all white males, but it wasn't.
[03:27:15.262 --> 03:27:16.043]  It was close.
[03:27:16.043 --> 03:27:16.543]  Mostly.
[03:27:16.543 --> 03:27:17.423]  They did wish.
[03:27:17.423 --> 03:27:18.104]  That's a good point.
[03:27:18.104 --> 03:27:18.504]  They really wished.
[03:27:18.504 --> 03:27:19.464]  They were really hoping.
[03:27:19.464 --> 03:27:24.906]  I'm surprised they didn't cater the list to exclude anyone who wasn't a white male, just so they could run that.
[03:27:26.946 --> 03:27:30.427]  They claim these eight men have as much wealth as half the world.
[03:27:30.427 --> 03:27:35.208]  Some people say that they have like 98, 99 percent of the wealth.
[03:27:35.208 --> 03:27:38.549]  I'm nobody who's going to sit here and try to do those kind of math numbers.
[03:27:38.549 --> 03:27:40.489]  But here's what I do know.
[03:27:40.489 --> 03:27:43.030]  OK, so these people have all the wealth.
[03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.710]  All right.
[03:27:43.710 --> 03:27:45.310]  They're the richest people in the world.
[03:27:45.310 --> 03:27:46.371]  Private industry.
[03:27:46.371 --> 03:27:49.151]  OK, we're supposed to believe that that's all fine and good.
[03:27:49.151 --> 03:27:53.372]  We're supposed to believe that the left wants to get big money out of politics while they take money from the richest people in the world.
[03:27:53.372 --> 03:27:55.753]  OK, now Davos is coming up.
[03:27:56.813 --> 03:28:05.303]  And the headline, the story is, in the wake of the tumultuous year, the global elite face a world of uncertainty.
[03:28:05.303 --> 03:28:16.936]  So basically, the Davos group, they're getting ready to meet, and because, and I mean, Bilderberg will have the same issue, because they're about to have their meeting and they don't control the President of the United States,
[03:28:17.697 --> 03:28:19.919]  They really don't know what to do.
[03:28:19.919 --> 03:28:31.587]  Because so much of what they plan, what they talk about, what they discuss, their future, all depends on them having the President of the United States on their side, in their pocket.
[03:28:31.587 --> 03:28:32.588]  They don't have that anymore.
[03:28:32.588 --> 03:28:33.609]  And other global powers.
[03:28:33.849 --> 03:28:42.896]  We're seeing the people rising up across the globe and they're just thinking, wow, our global economic order is getting the shaft, what are we going to do?
[03:28:42.896 --> 03:28:46.179]  It's very interesting to see what their little talks will be about this time around.
[03:28:46.179 --> 03:28:59.490]  And also too, let's not forget the Bilderberg website being hacked, saying that they've got 365 days to start working for We The People or they're going to totally expose them via the prison planet they've created with all this technological surveillance.
[03:29:00.430 --> 03:29:12.135]  So the Davos group will meet and they're going to, instead of having their normal talks about all the economic rigging, the financial market rigging, all the stuff that they normally do, they're going to be sitting there pulling their hair out.
[03:29:12.135 --> 03:29:12.915]  Oh, what do I do?
[03:29:12.915 --> 03:29:13.475]  What do we do?
[03:29:13.475 --> 03:29:14.276]  We don't have Trump.
[03:29:14.276 --> 03:29:15.556]  We're going to lose in France.
[03:29:15.556 --> 03:29:16.516]  We're going to lose in Germany.
[03:29:16.516 --> 03:29:17.597]  We're losing all over the world.
[03:29:17.597 --> 03:29:18.977]  Nobody likes what we've done to the planet.
[03:29:18.977 --> 03:29:19.578]  Oh my gosh!
[03:29:19.578 --> 03:29:27.361]  It's really interesting because I remember last year the Davos, one of the jam-packed talks they had was about meditation and visualization.
[03:29:28.081 --> 03:29:30.401]  I bet none of them visualize what happened in 2016, worldwide.
[03:29:30.401 --> 03:29:32.722]  I don't think they saw Trump coming.
[03:29:32.722 --> 03:29:40.403]  And just like Davos is worried about losing their control over the economic path, John Brennan is complaining about Trump on Twitter.
[03:29:40.403 --> 03:29:45.624]  The intelligence agencies are worried about Trump ruining their monopoly on intelligence!
[03:29:45.624 --> 03:29:48.425]  Oh my gosh, you're getting trumped all over the place, establishment.
[03:29:48.425 --> 03:29:50.025]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.025 --> 03:29:52.565]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.565 --> 03:29:55.246]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.662 --> 03:30:01.743]  What's Trump going to do with the hostile press corps?
[03:30:01.743 --> 03:30:06.566]  Well, according to his press secretary, alternative media bloggers are to become a part of the press corps.
[03:30:06.566 --> 03:30:12.148]  Now, the corporate media is freaking out at the possibility of Breitbart and Infowars being allowed to ask questions.
[03:30:12.148 --> 03:30:14.870]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Steve Watson.
[03:30:15.250 --> 03:30:15.390]  I think?
[03:30:32.995 --> 03:30:35.036]  Well, I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.945 --> 03:30:59.765]  Hey, everyone!
[03:30:59.765 --> 03:31:05.909]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:05.909 --> 03:31:07.990]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:18.256]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:18.256 --> 03:31:24.239]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:24.719 --> 03:31:39.616]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:39.676 --> 03:31:40.136]  Thank you.
[03:31:58.815 --> 03:32:01.797]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the inauguration special.
[03:32:01.797 --> 03:32:05.519]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the new year.

[03:32:11.683 --> 03:32:18.547]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing, but many of these sales are going to have to come to an end.
[03:32:18.547 --> 03:32:23.330]  If you want across the board massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like

[03:32:37.235 --> 03:32:42.957]  This sale ends this weekend after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president.

[03:32:56.043 --> 03:32:57.904]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[03:33:11.385 --> 03:33:16.936]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:33:16.936 --> 03:33:19.621]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:24.238 --> 03:33:25.639]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:25.639 --> 03:33:41.549]  4th Hour, Owen Schroer and Leanne McAtee with you and we are going to open up the phone lines 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Now, we want to take specifically callers who are planning to go to the inauguration.
[03:33:41.549 --> 03:33:43.950]  We'd like to hear from some protesters.
[03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:46.512]  We're going to go ahead and offer up some protesters.
[03:33:46.512 --> 03:33:49.634]  If you're planning on going to the inauguration to protest Donald Trump,
[03:33:50.074 --> 03:33:51.655]  We're going to open up the phone lines for you.
[03:33:51.655 --> 03:33:52.756]  Let's hear your thoughts.
[03:33:52.756 --> 03:33:57.178]  But if you're going there to also witness the history of the inauguration, also give us a call.
[03:33:57.178 --> 03:34:02.942]  So phone line open for anybody who's planning on going to the inauguration, whether it be a protest or in support of Donald Trump.
[03:34:02.942 --> 03:34:03.522]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:34:03.522 --> 03:34:06.604]  We've got all kinds of news on that.
[03:34:06.604 --> 03:34:14.669]  Before we get to that, though, I've got to let you know that an emergency shipment of DNA Force has just come in at InfoWarsLife.com and it's 10%
[03:34:16.850 --> 03:34:17.090]  Off.
[03:34:17.090 --> 03:34:19.951]  This is already one of the best products at InfoWars.
[03:34:19.951 --> 03:34:22.371]  This is a groundbreaking product, folks.
[03:34:22.371 --> 03:34:29.533]  The whole telomeres phenomenon was started here at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:34:29.533 --> 03:34:30.813]  It's going to hit the mainstream.
[03:34:30.813 --> 03:34:33.333]  You're going to see it all over commercials.
[03:34:33.333 --> 03:34:39.995]  In fact, my guess would be you're going to see it all over commercials, especially with the high-rated events coming up like the Super Bowl.
[03:34:39.995 --> 03:34:42.555]  But this is our flagship product.
[03:34:42.555 --> 03:34:43.516]  It is unbelievable.
[03:34:43.516 --> 03:34:45.436]  Alex talks about how he had a
[03:34:45.896 --> 03:34:51.501]  A finger that was numb, that now he has feeling in the tip of his finger again.
[03:34:51.501 --> 03:34:59.387]  I had a shoulder that I tore out of joint some years ago, and it was always bothering me and nagging me.
[03:34:59.387 --> 03:35:06.513]  About three months ago, that nagging went away completely, and that was after about six months of taking DNA Force religiously.
[03:35:06.513 --> 03:35:11.417]  So, make sure you give DNA Force a chance, because I'm telling you, this is an unbelievable product.
[03:35:11.417 --> 03:35:14.580]  Especially when you see the science that's coming out about some of the stuff behind this.
[03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:16.121]  You're going to see it in the mainstream.
[03:35:16.121 --> 03:35:21.404]  You're going to be even more willing to give DNA Force a try, and this is the groundbreaking product.
[03:35:21.404 --> 03:35:22.404]  We started it here first.
[03:35:22.404 --> 03:35:22.864]  Remember that.
[03:35:22.864 --> 03:35:24.405]  You want to protect your telomeres?
[03:35:24.405 --> 03:35:29.308]  Come to the original source, DNA Force, 10% off, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:35:29.308 --> 03:35:34.531]  Alright, so we've already got the lines starting to light up, but let's just kind of touch on some of the stuff that we're talking about here.
[03:35:35.543 --> 03:35:40.747]  You got Democratic legislators who are planning on sitting out Trump's swearing in.
[03:35:40.747 --> 03:35:42.408]  Talk about completely low.
[03:35:42.408 --> 03:35:44.089]  You can't even go, that's your job.
[03:35:44.089 --> 03:35:44.750]  Yeah.
[03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:46.711]  So you're, of course.
[03:35:46.711 --> 03:35:50.974]  I wonder how, you know, I wonder how that's, if they're going to get anything done or if they're going to be cooperative.
[03:35:50.974 --> 03:35:56.938]  Now, the officials are estimating some 800,000 to 900,000 people to be at the inauguration.
[03:35:56.938 --> 03:35:59.460]  I think it's going to go over a million, Leigh-Anne.
[03:35:59.460 --> 03:36:02.963]  We actually had, there were five million people, I think, that celebrated the Cubs World Series.
[03:36:04.218 --> 03:36:10.120]  If we can't get a million people to come out to Donald Trump's historical inauguration, come on, folks.
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:11.520]  And then you've got all of these singers.
[03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:15.462]  I've got a whole list of singers who have had to back out from singing.
[03:36:15.462 --> 03:36:16.802]  Because they're getting death threats.
[03:36:16.802 --> 03:36:17.962]  At the inauguration.
[03:36:17.962 --> 03:36:20.563]  Literally, a whole stack of news.
[03:36:20.563 --> 03:36:22.944]  Andrea Bocelli.
[03:36:22.944 --> 03:36:24.044]  Who else do we have here?
[03:36:24.044 --> 03:36:25.185]  Jennifer Holliday.
[03:36:26.499 --> 03:36:29.782]  Paul Anka, now he says that that wasn't from bullying.
[03:36:29.782 --> 03:36:33.465]  But then you got Toby Keith on the other side of the spectrum saying he's not going to apologize for performing.
[03:36:33.465 --> 03:36:34.365]  He's actually proud to.
[03:36:34.365 --> 03:36:35.847]  Yeah, play for his country.
[03:36:35.847 --> 03:36:38.969]  But all these stories just show how the left bullies.
[03:36:38.969 --> 03:36:41.251]  They are the real bullies.
[03:36:41.251 --> 03:36:44.273]  Bullying people out of performing at the inauguration.
[03:36:44.273 --> 03:36:45.875]  Oh well, you're not going to get a job.
[03:36:45.875 --> 03:36:48.017]  You're not going to be accepted in the industry anymore.
[03:36:48.017 --> 03:36:49.618]  You can't go perform at Donald Trump.
[03:36:51.258 --> 03:36:57.340]  Springsteen's band, the B Street Band, saying, well, you know, if Bruce asked us not to play, we wouldn't play.
[03:36:57.340 --> 03:36:59.181]  Hey, Bruce, shut up.
[03:36:59.181 --> 03:37:00.061]  Stick to music.
[03:37:00.061 --> 03:37:01.842]  You don't know anything about politics.
[03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:04.163]  You're a social justice warrior with a guitar.
[03:37:04.163 --> 03:37:04.883]  That's it.
[03:37:05.623 --> 03:37:09.867]  And then of course we've got the leaked audio, the Project Veritas video that came out today.
[03:37:09.867 --> 03:37:11.429]  So we've got all this going on.
[03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:14.492]  It's all coming around the inauguration, Leigh-Anne.
[03:37:14.492 --> 03:37:15.333]  I'm gonna be there.
[03:37:15.333 --> 03:37:18.836]  I am not gonna lie, I'm a little afraid.
[03:37:18.836 --> 03:37:20.618]  Alex filed the report about the dirty nuke.
[03:37:21.318 --> 03:37:28.163]  Well, they're talking about these anti-fascists were talking about putting some acid attacks, which is- Stink bombs?
[03:37:28.163 --> 03:37:29.724]  Stink bombs?
[03:37:29.724 --> 03:37:31.085]  Stink bombs?
[03:37:31.085 --> 03:37:33.987]  Is this a high school prom?
[03:37:33.987 --> 03:37:35.148]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:37:35.148 --> 03:37:40.192]  You didn't get invited to the high school prom, so you've got to ruin it for everyone else by lighting off a stink bomb.
[03:37:40.792 --> 03:37:41.693]  That's what's going on here.
[03:37:41.693 --> 03:37:42.153]  Go ahead, Leigh-Anne.
[03:37:42.153 --> 03:37:42.473]  I'm sorry.
[03:37:42.473 --> 03:37:43.233]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:37:43.233 --> 03:37:44.214]  So this is this acid.
[03:37:44.214 --> 03:37:48.236]  It's commonly, colloquially referred to as stink bombs.
[03:37:48.236 --> 03:37:53.998]  But it'll just evacuate the entire building there where the deplorable is supposed to be being held.
[03:37:53.998 --> 03:37:58.060]  But they're talking about, you know, if you mess with us, we'll find you.
[03:37:58.060 --> 03:37:59.561]  We'll burn your house down.
[03:37:59.561 --> 03:38:03.203]  I mean, these are fascists who are talking about
[03:38:03.963 --> 03:38:04.984]  Stopping fascism.
[03:38:04.984 --> 03:38:06.685]  These are anti-fascist protests.
[03:38:06.685 --> 03:38:11.748]  They're holding that they're using violent means to protest a free election.
[03:38:11.748 --> 03:38:13.870]  I mean, it's just, it's absolutely crazy.
[03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:16.191]  They're giving death threats to Andrea Bocelli.
[03:38:16.191 --> 03:38:18.012]  An anti-war group starting civil war.
[03:38:18.012 --> 03:38:23.056]  Yeah, they're threatening to murder Andrea Bocelli if he comes.
[03:38:23.056 --> 03:38:24.377]  The blind tenor there.
[03:38:24.377 --> 03:38:26.518]  Okay, so they're attacking a blind man.
[03:38:26.518 --> 03:38:28.579]  Why wouldn't you want to experience that man's voice?
[03:38:28.579 --> 03:38:31.001]  I mean, it's like, what's wrong with you?
[03:38:31.221 --> 03:38:43.583]  I think too is they can all kind of take a note from Toby Keith who's saying, you know, I'm not going to apologize for performing at Donald Trump's inauguration because he wants to perform for our country and our military.
[03:38:43.583 --> 03:38:47.124]  He says, I won't apologize for performing for our country or our military.
[03:38:47.124 --> 03:38:52.245]  And I think people can take a note from that, that they should have really stood up and came out and said, you know what?
[03:38:52.245 --> 03:38:53.906]  I want to be a unifying voice.
[03:38:53.906 --> 03:38:55.886]  That's why I'm going to be here.
[03:38:56.386 --> 03:39:03.372]  And maybe, like, opened up some dialogue with people who are upset about it and had the opportunity to really discuss that dialogue.
[03:39:03.372 --> 03:39:08.437]  But no, that's what these fascists want, is they want to shut you down and silence you altogether.
[03:39:08.437 --> 03:39:11.279]  They don't want to give the opportunity to open up this dialogue.
[03:39:11.279 --> 03:39:13.501]  They just want to shut down anything that they don't like.
[03:39:13.501 --> 03:39:21.789]  And I'm really pissed, frankly, that we have these people cowing to this kind of abuse and these violent fascists.
[03:39:22.409 --> 03:39:25.270]  Well, they're unprincipled, to me, is what it comes down to.
[03:39:25.270 --> 03:39:26.871]  Because I was thinking about this.
[03:39:26.871 --> 03:39:32.213]  If I'm a musician, and let's say Obama asked me to perform at his inauguration.
[03:39:32.213 --> 03:39:33.354]  Okay, I can't stand Obama.
[03:39:33.354 --> 03:39:34.194]  I don't like his policies.
[03:39:34.194 --> 03:39:34.774]  Would I perform?
[03:39:34.774 --> 03:39:35.595]  Would I not perform?
[03:39:35.595 --> 03:39:41.517]  You know, I don't really know, but it would be on the principles of his policies if I was going to do that.
[03:39:41.517 --> 03:39:43.118]  I wouldn't get bullied out of it.
[03:39:43.118 --> 03:39:49.020]  I wouldn't claim, you know, some false accusation like racism or anything like that.
[03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:50.821]  It would be a principled stance, but I don't really know.
[03:39:51.281 --> 03:40:00.744]  I think that what we're witnessing is a lot of these musicians getting bullied out of this opportunity, which is very sad and again exposes the true nature of the left.
[03:40:00.744 --> 03:40:07.466]  Well yeah, and you see it with Hollywood too, that they're afraid to speak out if they're conservatives because they fear that their career will be ruined.
[03:40:07.466 --> 03:40:07.866]  Exactly.
[03:40:07.866 --> 03:40:09.647]  To me it's just so frustrating.
[03:40:09.647 --> 03:40:11.407]  It's bullying and intimidating.
[03:40:11.407 --> 03:40:18.590]  Well yes, and actually we have an actress, this is Zoe Saldana, who came out and admitted that Hollywood arrogance helped Trump win.
[03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:19.590]  I always knew I liked her.
[03:40:19.810 --> 03:40:23.314]  She said, we got cocky, we became arrogant, and we also became bullies.
[03:40:23.314 --> 03:40:28.241]  We were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong, which here I disagree with her.
[03:40:28.241 --> 03:40:34.188]  She says, and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and are believing it.
[03:40:34.188 --> 03:40:34.569]  So no.
[03:40:34.929 --> 03:40:35.849]  Yeah, she is wrong about that.
[03:40:35.849 --> 03:40:39.551]  People didn't vote because they were feeling bad for Donald Trump being picked on.
[03:40:39.551 --> 03:40:45.174]  No, people voted because they were listening to what he was saying and they believe, you know, what he's promising.
[03:40:45.174 --> 03:40:48.775]  And frankly, he's already, before he's even in office, he's already bringing back the jobs.
[03:40:48.775 --> 03:40:52.417]  Well, and it's nice to see some of these people in Hollywood calling out their counterparts, you know?
[03:40:52.637 --> 03:40:53.338]  No, not to protest.
[03:40:53.338 --> 03:40:53.678]  To support.
[03:41:11.201 --> 03:41:12.922]  My family and I are very excited.
[03:41:12.922 --> 03:41:14.363]  We can't wait to go.
[03:41:14.363 --> 03:41:19.987]  So what do you think about this Disrupt J20 plan to kick off with a bang?
[03:41:19.987 --> 03:41:23.570]  They say they're going to have this demonstration in front of the VP's house.
[03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:26.012]  I mean, they're planning some big shenanigans there.
[03:41:26.012 --> 03:41:27.873]  Are you worried?
[03:41:27.873 --> 03:41:29.294]  No, not at all.
[03:41:29.294 --> 03:41:32.256]  I think that we have it all under control.
[03:41:32.256 --> 03:41:32.917]  I think that
[03:41:34.546 --> 03:41:36.107]  I really don't think they're going to do anything.
[03:41:36.107 --> 03:41:37.567]  We're not afraid.
[03:41:37.567 --> 03:41:40.448]  Well, I gotta hand it to you, Kelly.
[03:41:40.448 --> 03:41:41.609]  You're less worried than I am.
[03:41:41.609 --> 03:41:43.490]  I'm definitely worried they're going to do something.
[03:41:43.490 --> 03:41:45.030]  At least try to hit me with a stink bomb.
[03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:51.293]  Alright, let's go to Adam in California, who will be there for the Trump protest.
[03:41:51.293 --> 03:41:56.435]  Adam, are you planning on protesting Donald Trump or supporting Donald Trump?
[03:41:56.435 --> 03:42:01.577]  I plan on going to the protest and doing some Owen Schroeder confrontations for my YouTube channel.
[03:42:02.645 --> 03:42:07.910]  So you're going, are you trying to infiltrate the protests?
[03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:16.657]  I may go undercover in the beginning so I can record their signs and get some interviews and hear them talking dirty, but I want to confront them.
[03:42:16.657 --> 03:42:19.680]  The force is strong in this one.
[03:42:19.680 --> 03:42:23.964]  Yeah, but what I'm really worried about is, are we going to get 9-11 truth out of Trump?
[03:42:25.307 --> 03:42:26.768]  That would be very interesting.
[03:42:26.768 --> 03:42:31.111]  I think that if you're going to get it out of anyone, he's the best bet.
[03:42:31.111 --> 03:42:34.112]  I mean, he's the one that brought up the secret 28 pages.
[03:42:34.112 --> 03:42:37.294]  He's the one that has questioned some of the story to begin with.
[03:42:37.294 --> 03:42:38.975]  He's in real estate.
[03:42:38.975 --> 03:42:43.558]  He's questioned the construction of the building and said it just doesn't make any sense that they came down.
[03:42:43.558 --> 03:42:47.981]  So yeah, I mean, it'd be very, I think, you know, the people could press him enough for that.
[03:42:48.721 --> 03:43:02.571]  Once he's kind of in there with the goblins, it's a little bit different, then it will be classified at that point and that's the thing we were talking during the break that all of these intelligence agencies are going to have to make every single thing they discuss with Donald Trump classified so that he doesn't tweet about it.
[03:43:02.571 --> 03:43:03.372]  But you know what?
[03:43:03.372 --> 03:43:11.578]  That is such an astute observation or question from Adam because if we can break through the shackles of lies from 9-11,
[03:43:13.619 --> 03:43:22.764]  That will do wonders for, I don't even think we can measure what that would do for this country and what that would do for the citizens to come together on that truth.
[03:43:22.764 --> 03:43:36.493]  Because, folks, as soon as people know the truth about 9-11 and what really happened, I'm not even going to sit here and act like I do, but we know that we've been lied to and if the entire collection
[03:43:37.759 --> 03:43:42.263]  Of American citizens could learn the truth at the same time?
[03:43:42.263 --> 03:43:53.953]  I think that that would bring us all together and that would be just a massive positive for not just the Trump movement or Make America Great Again, just for the entire world.
[03:43:53.953 --> 03:44:03.661]  America in general to be able to see all the fake news that was put out there during 9-11 and how people were told to just shut up and agree, you know, don't put out any crazy conspiracy theories.
[03:44:03.661 --> 03:44:05.303]  You're with us or you're with the terrorists.
[03:44:05.842 --> 03:44:11.625]  Alright, hey Adam, real quick before we let you go, what's your YouTube channel so we can follow the work you do over there?
[03:44:11.625 --> 03:44:12.906]  Oh, you guys have been following it.
[03:44:12.906 --> 03:44:13.966]  It's NoMoreNews.
[03:44:13.966 --> 03:44:16.988]  You guys have picked up my videos like five times in the last year.
[03:44:16.988 --> 03:44:17.728]  Nice.
[03:44:17.728 --> 03:44:20.190]  I got second place in the Make Fun of Hillary contest.
[03:44:20.190 --> 03:44:21.591]  I see.
[03:44:21.591 --> 03:44:24.192]  I told you the force was strong with this one.
[03:44:24.192 --> 03:44:25.573]  You're out there doing the damn thing.
[03:44:25.573 --> 03:44:28.394]  Okay, so NoMoreNews on the YouTube channel.
[03:44:28.394 --> 03:44:29.275]  Thank you so much, Adam.
[03:44:29.275 --> 03:44:31.936]  Alright, let's go to Jeremy out in New Hampshire.
[03:44:31.936 --> 03:44:33.477]  He's going to be going to the inauguration.
[03:44:33.477 --> 03:44:35.318]  Jeremy, are you going to protest or are you going to support?
[03:44:36.693 --> 03:44:39.354]  I'm going to support Trump.
[03:44:39.354 --> 03:44:39.974]  Are you worried?
[03:44:39.974 --> 03:44:42.895]  I'm not worried.
[03:44:42.895 --> 03:44:44.396]  I think Trump's going to do a good job.
[03:44:44.396 --> 03:44:46.877]  He's going to be one of the best presidents.
[03:44:46.877 --> 03:44:50.058]  Are you worried about the actual event, though, and anything that might go down?
[03:44:50.058 --> 03:44:52.199]  I'm not worried.
[03:44:52.199 --> 03:44:53.399]  I don't think nothing will go down.
[03:44:53.399 --> 03:44:57.020]  I think we're going to have a lot of safe people there to watch.
[03:44:57.020 --> 03:45:01.642]  We're going to have a lot of people there to keep us safe.
[03:45:01.642 --> 03:45:02.602]  At least 5,000 National Guard troops.
[03:45:05.555 --> 03:45:08.196]  You're going to have bikers for Trump too?
[03:45:08.196 --> 03:45:09.097]  Yeah.
[03:45:09.097 --> 03:45:10.157]  A human wall.
[03:45:10.157 --> 03:45:21.823]  What do you think about, I know when George W. Bush was being inaugurated they decided to do away with some of the traditional presidential things such as the walk from the car into the White House with the wave.
[03:45:21.823 --> 03:45:29.867]  Do you think Donald Trump should be concerned about his safety and kind of curtail some of those traditions?
[03:45:29.867 --> 03:45:30.968]  I don't think so.
[03:45:30.968 --> 03:45:32.328]  I think he's at a lot of security.
[03:45:35.609 --> 03:45:41.575]  Well he definitely, I believe that he has his own private security outside of the Secret Service too.
[03:45:41.575 --> 03:45:43.476]  I think that he might be doubling down on security.
[03:45:43.476 --> 03:45:46.479]  Actually, I don't even know, can he even do that as President?
[03:45:46.479 --> 03:45:50.022]  Can you have a private security detail outside of Secret Service, I wonder?
[03:45:50.703 --> 03:45:57.888]  That could be interesting because he might not even trust some of the elements within the government structure of protection.
[03:45:57.888 --> 03:45:59.069]  So I don't know, that's interesting.
[03:45:59.069 --> 03:46:02.811]  But so far nobody claims to be worried about what's going on.
[03:46:02.811 --> 03:46:05.794]  I guess I'm the most nervous Nancy of the bunch.
[03:46:05.794 --> 03:46:08.255]  Let's go to Eric in California who's also going to the inauguration.
[03:46:08.255 --> 03:46:11.898]  There's another person from California traveling all the way to DC for the inauguration.
[03:46:11.898 --> 03:46:15.560]  Eric, are you going to protest or support?
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:16.401]  I'm going to support.
[03:46:17.699 --> 03:46:21.504]  Are you worried about any violence or getting hit with any stink bombs?
[03:46:21.504 --> 03:46:23.166]  Hell yeah, I'm worried.
[03:46:23.166 --> 03:46:24.107]  I'm very worried.
[03:46:24.107 --> 03:46:25.549]  Listen, man.
[03:46:25.549 --> 03:46:29.394]  I need bulletproof vest, all that armor, everything.
[03:46:29.394 --> 03:46:29.874]  Nah, I'm not.
[03:46:29.874 --> 03:46:30.836]  I'm being serious though.
[03:46:30.836 --> 03:46:32.198]  It's really serious.
[03:46:32.198 --> 03:46:33.059]  They got, they got...
[03:46:33.661 --> 03:46:35.562]  Troops on the border of Russia.
[03:46:35.562 --> 03:46:39.365]  They got like all these different little moves they can make.
[03:46:39.365 --> 03:46:41.126]  They did just put troops in Norway.
[03:46:41.126 --> 03:46:41.566]  Yeah.
[03:46:41.566 --> 03:46:44.468]  ISIS said they wanted to attack during the inauguration.
[03:46:44.468 --> 03:46:45.649]  Obama, listen.
[03:46:45.649 --> 03:46:46.949]  I'm not trying to cut y'all off.
[03:46:46.949 --> 03:46:49.031]  I don't get a lot of chance to talk on everything.
[03:46:49.031 --> 03:46:50.792]  I just wanted to conversate with y'all.
[03:46:50.792 --> 03:46:54.574]  But listen, Obama, he is the worst.
[03:46:54.574 --> 03:46:58.197]  He is the most fakest person on the planet.
[03:46:58.197 --> 03:47:00.338]  He's using this wolf in sheep's clothing tactic.
[03:47:00.854 --> 03:47:02.996]  Where he's acting like he's the good cop.
[03:47:02.996 --> 03:47:04.558]  It's the classic good cop, bad cop.
[03:47:04.558 --> 03:47:05.599]  You know what I mean?
[03:47:05.599 --> 03:47:07.301]  He's playing this good cop.
[03:47:07.301 --> 03:47:11.786]  Oh, I want the peaceful transition and everything like that.
[03:47:11.786 --> 03:47:16.491]  Meanwhile, he got everybody else lining up doing all this crazy.
[03:47:16.491 --> 03:47:16.932]  Wow.
[03:47:16.932 --> 03:47:18.053]  I've never seen nothing like this.
[03:47:20.238 --> 03:47:22.499]  No, it truly is unprecedented.
[03:47:22.499 --> 03:47:29.722]  It truly is unprecedented and the crazy thing about what you just said is you've got, this is an illustration of the polarization.
[03:47:29.722 --> 03:47:38.346]  You've got a group of people like yourself and me and Leanne and a lot of people that are like-minded that will say Obama will go down as the worst president of all time.
[03:47:38.346 --> 03:47:42.508]  Then you've got another group of people that say he will be the greatest president of all time.
[03:47:43.365 --> 03:47:44.185]  How does that work?
[03:47:44.185 --> 03:47:48.527]  Yeah, well, that's because they see his slick TV persona.
[03:47:48.527 --> 03:47:50.048]  They buy the wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:47:50.048 --> 03:47:50.968]  They buy the fake news.
[03:47:50.968 --> 03:47:57.451]  They don't see what's actually going on, that he dropped a bomb, what, every 20 minutes during his eight years of being in office.
[03:47:57.451 --> 03:47:59.512]  They don't see that side of President Obama.
[03:47:59.512 --> 03:48:04.614]  All they see is the guy that came out, smooth jazz Obama, that went on SNL and Jimmy Fallon.
[03:48:04.614 --> 03:48:05.435]  They follow the fake news.
[03:48:05.435 --> 03:48:06.875]  Yeah, they see him on ESPN.
[03:48:06.875 --> 03:48:07.936]  What was your final comment, Eric?
[03:48:09.329 --> 03:48:12.775]  Um, I got a whole bunch of comments, but I guess I'll break it down like this.
[03:48:12.775 --> 03:48:14.638]  Obama's not even really the first black president.
[03:48:14.638 --> 03:48:16.541]  He's not even really, he doesn't even have slave blood.
[03:48:16.541 --> 03:48:17.702]  You know what I mean?
[03:48:17.702 --> 03:48:20.066]  Like, as far as being, he claims he's black, black, black.
[03:48:20.066 --> 03:48:21.769]  He don't even have slave blood in him.
[03:48:22.287 --> 03:48:27.890]  And I'm not trying to get all racist and all that, but he's the most fakest on every level is what I'm trying to say.
[03:48:27.890 --> 03:48:29.531]  No, I hear you.
[03:48:29.531 --> 03:48:36.854]  And people always say, and I don't know what, it doesn't matter to me, but black, white, half black, half white, it doesn't matter.
[03:48:36.854 --> 03:48:38.255]  But this is a point that a lot of people say.
[03:48:38.255 --> 03:48:41.937]  It's like, well, you're sitting here claiming he's the first African American president, but it's not even true.
[03:48:41.937 --> 03:48:44.338]  If you're going to say what he is, then you would say he's half black.
[03:48:44.338 --> 03:48:45.159]  But it doesn't even matter.
[03:48:45.159 --> 03:48:49.081]  The truth is, and what matters, is that he is a total fraud.
[03:48:49.081 --> 03:48:51.222]  And that is what Eric nails on the head.
[03:48:51.222 --> 03:48:51.722]  And that's it.
[03:48:52.142 --> 03:48:54.143]  That's the legacy of Barack Obama.
[03:48:54.143 --> 03:48:55.843]  His birth certificate was a fraud.
[03:48:55.843 --> 03:48:57.944]  The story of how he got brought up was a fraud.
[03:48:57.944 --> 03:49:00.704]  Everything he's ever said or done is a total fraud.
[03:49:00.704 --> 03:49:03.325]  Nobel Peace Prize award, total fraud.
[03:49:03.325 --> 03:49:05.186]  Just total fraud across the board.
[03:49:05.186 --> 03:49:06.306]  Thank you so much for the call, Eric.
[03:49:06.306 --> 03:49:06.826]  You're exactly right.
[03:49:06.826 --> 03:49:09.987]  He awarded himself, like, the Medal of Valor or something.
[03:49:09.987 --> 03:49:14.108]  He's gonna find a way to give himself an award before it's all said and done.
[03:49:14.722 --> 03:49:16.202]  He did!
[03:49:16.202 --> 03:49:17.303]  By giving Biden the award?
[03:49:17.303 --> 03:49:18.063]  No, I forget.
[03:49:18.063 --> 03:49:20.844]  I'm pretty sure he awarded himself.
[03:49:20.844 --> 03:49:22.264]  What was it?
[03:49:22.264 --> 03:49:23.584]  It wasn't technically him.
[03:49:23.584 --> 03:49:25.725]  I think it was his cabinet or his administration.
[03:49:25.725 --> 03:49:27.525]  He's patting himself on the back.
[03:49:27.525 --> 03:49:28.686]  He has to!
[03:49:28.686 --> 03:49:30.146]  Nobody else will!
[03:49:30.146 --> 03:49:31.827]  Because nobody can stand the guy!
[03:49:31.827 --> 03:49:35.788]  It's just sad.
[03:49:35.788 --> 03:49:36.548]  It's just sad.
[03:49:36.548 --> 03:49:37.348]  And you know what I think?
[03:49:38.479 --> 03:49:40.340]  I think that giving that award to Joe Biden.
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:42.181]  The Distinguished Medal.
[03:49:42.181 --> 03:49:42.902]  Which one was that?
[03:49:42.902 --> 03:49:44.343]  Pull that story back up.
[03:49:44.343 --> 03:49:49.046]  President Obama awards himself Distinguished Public Service Medal.
[03:49:49.046 --> 03:49:49.546]  So there you go.
[03:49:49.546 --> 03:49:50.827]  Obama awards himself.
[03:49:50.827 --> 03:49:51.687]  Of course he has to.
[03:49:51.687 --> 03:49:57.071]  He has to do anything and everything he can to try to cement his fraud legacy.
[03:49:57.071 --> 03:49:58.872]  But we know what your legacy is, Obama.
[03:50:00.202 --> 03:50:00.642]  What was it?
[03:50:00.642 --> 03:50:04.105]  You bombed over 16 countries this year?
[03:50:04.105 --> 03:50:08.890]  The only president ever who's been at war every single year of his presidency.
[03:50:08.890 --> 03:50:10.931]  He's dropped a bomb every 20 minutes.
[03:50:10.931 --> 03:50:13.434]  And he admitted he's very good at dropping bombs.
[03:50:13.434 --> 03:50:21.320]  And I think that him giving that award to Joe Biden, more than anything, was a slap in our face.
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:23.763]  Because we know who Joe Biden really is, okay?
[03:50:23.763 --> 03:50:25.144]  We know you, Creepy Joe.
[03:50:26.064 --> 03:50:28.526]  We know what you do, Creepy Joe, okay?
[03:50:28.526 --> 03:50:31.008]  We've seen the videos, Creepy Joe.
[03:50:31.008 --> 03:50:40.977]  For you to get up there and cry when this fraud is giving you this fraudulent award, this is just a total ceremony of fraud, and you're up here crying.
[03:50:40.977 --> 03:50:47.583]  That's why Obama did it, because he knows that we know who Joe Biden is, a total sicko creep, so he did it right in front of our face to rub it in.
[03:50:48.624 --> 03:50:52.505]  And Donald Trump should rescind that award immediately.
[03:50:52.505 --> 03:50:53.725]  Final segment on the other side.
[03:50:53.725 --> 03:50:54.585]  We've got a couple more calls.
[03:50:54.585 --> 03:50:55.165]  We'll get to you.
[03:50:55.165 --> 03:50:59.446]  Infowars.com.
[03:50:59.446 --> 03:51:02.507]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:02.507 --> 03:51:04.567]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:04.567 --> 03:51:06.388]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:06.388 --> 03:51:08.608]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[03:51:08.608 --> 03:51:11.309]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:13.449]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:13.449 --> 03:51:15.330]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[03:51:15.330 --> 03:51:17.050]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:17.350 --> 03:51:23.932]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:23.932 --> 03:51:27.353]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[03:51:27.353 --> 03:51:29.654]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:29.654 --> 03:51:32.975]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[03:51:32.975 --> 03:51:34.896]  Get your Xtendivite today!

[03:52:07.733 --> 03:52:17.776]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost $32 for an 8-pack, when you can shave with Harry's high-quality German-engineered blades for half the price?

[03:52:58.916 --> 03:52:59.597]  Hello again.
[03:52:59.597 --> 03:53:00.618]  My name is Gary Clark.
[03:53:00.618 --> 03:53:07.306]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[03:53:07.306 --> 03:53:12.152]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[03:53:12.152 --> 03:53:18.379]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones.
[03:53:18.679 --> 03:53:21.501]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[03:53:21.501 --> 03:53:26.324]  I neglected to mention how One World Whey Protein Powder has affected my life.
[03:53:26.324 --> 03:53:30.586]  Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[03:53:30.586 --> 03:53:33.388]  One World Whey solved my irregularity.
[03:53:33.388 --> 03:53:37.931]  I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[03:53:37.931 --> 03:53:41.533]  Three weeks on One World Whey set me on a new path.
[03:53:41.533 --> 03:53:44.895]  That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since.
[03:53:44.895 --> 03:53:46.316]  Will it work the same way for you?
[03:53:46.316 --> 03:53:47.156]  I don't know.
[03:53:47.156 --> 03:53:47.937]  It worked for me.
[03:53:48.317 --> 03:53:50.421]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[03:53:50.421 --> 03:53:52.404]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[03:54:06.832 --> 03:54:07.993]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:07.993 --> 03:54:08.694]  Final segment.
[03:54:08.694 --> 03:54:14.440]  Owen Schroer, Leanne McAdoo with you and I've got to let you know about the Make Our Bodies Great Again special.
[03:54:14.440 --> 03:54:19.166]  This is ending soon at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:54:56.914 --> 03:55:01.017]  So this is not just me plugging the products, this is me speaking from actual experience.
[03:55:01.017 --> 03:55:06.161]  Now, here's another actually, an actual thing that I'm experiencing that Alex Jones was right about, of course.
[03:55:06.941 --> 03:55:11.724]  People now prefer martial law to a Donald Trump presidency.
[03:55:11.724 --> 03:55:16.648]  People have now said they would rather have martial law than Donald Trump win.
[03:55:16.648 --> 03:55:20.270]  And that is what Alex has been talking about, folks.
[03:55:20.270 --> 03:55:23.712]  They would rather have... They would beg for... They'd rather be slavery.
[03:55:23.712 --> 03:55:24.793]  ...to control their lives.
[03:55:24.793 --> 03:55:26.514]  They would rather be slaves.
[03:55:26.514 --> 03:55:27.975]  They are accepting their slavery.
[03:55:27.975 --> 03:55:31.438]  They finally be conditioned into accepting their slavery.
[03:55:31.438 --> 03:55:33.419]  They'd rather have martial law than Donald Trump.
[03:55:33.419 --> 03:55:35.000]  And good for you, Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:36.401]  I'm glad that you were the spearhead of that.
[03:55:37.201 --> 03:55:38.001]  Wow.
[03:55:38.001 --> 03:55:39.042]  Good for you, Rosie.
[03:55:39.042 --> 03:55:40.002]  You don't speak for America.
[03:55:40.002 --> 03:55:44.883]  Let's go to Smitty in Missouri who says he's going to be protesting Donald Trump.
[03:55:44.883 --> 03:55:47.463]  Why is that, Smitty?
[03:55:47.463 --> 03:55:55.845]  Well, because I am not going to stand by idly and have a racist, sexist, homophobic man like Donald Trump.
[03:55:55.845 --> 03:55:58.346]  Now, Smitty, may I ask you a question?
[03:55:58.346 --> 03:55:59.606]  Smitty, Smitty, excuse me.
[03:55:59.606 --> 03:56:01.307]  Are you identifying as a parrot today?
[03:56:01.307 --> 03:56:03.247]  Are you a parrot?
[03:56:03.988 --> 03:56:05.068]  How rude are you?
[03:56:05.068 --> 03:56:07.089]  Well, you're parroting the same buzzword.
[03:56:07.089 --> 03:56:08.130]  How rude are you?
[03:56:08.130 --> 03:56:09.410]  How rude are you?
[03:56:09.410 --> 03:56:15.292]  Alright, I'm rude enough to hang up on you, because you have nothing to say.
[03:56:15.292 --> 03:56:27.296]  Okay, first of all, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were both still against same-sex marriage, Donald Trump was congratulating his friend Elton John on his marriage, saying that this one's going to be for the record.
[03:56:27.296 --> 03:56:28.077]  He's won awards!
[03:56:28.857 --> 03:56:34.721]  When they tried to stump him on Caitlyn Jenner going, you know, will you let her use the same bathroom at Trump Tower?
[03:56:34.721 --> 03:56:36.662]  He said she can use whatever bathroom she wants.
[03:56:36.662 --> 03:56:38.364]  And that story was dead in the water.
[03:56:38.364 --> 03:56:40.505]  You didn't hear any of the mainstream.
[03:56:40.505 --> 03:56:42.707]  You'd think that they would have reported that again and again and again.
[03:56:42.707 --> 03:56:47.890]  He's the only candidate that's held up an LGBT flag with his name on it.
[03:56:47.890 --> 03:56:50.712]  He's received awards for work he's done in inner cities.
[03:56:50.712 --> 03:56:51.493]  This is a joke.
[03:56:52.173 --> 03:57:00.486]  Smitty, thank you for calling in with that troll just to give us the opportunity to crush that anti-gay rumor thing that's going to be going on at the protest.
[03:57:00.486 --> 03:57:02.289]  Let's move on to Ramona.
[03:57:02.289 --> 03:57:03.130]  Go ahead, Ramona.
[03:57:03.130 --> 03:57:04.893]  You're going to Trump's inauguration from Texas.
[03:57:07.170 --> 03:57:08.651]  I take it you're excited.
[03:57:08.651 --> 03:57:10.333]  I'm very, very, very excited.
[03:57:10.333 --> 03:57:11.153]  I'm counting the days.
[03:57:11.153 --> 03:57:12.874]  It's four days from now.
[03:57:12.874 --> 03:57:14.456]  So, I got my plane ticket.
[03:57:14.456 --> 03:57:16.858]  I've got my luggage ready.
[03:57:16.858 --> 03:57:19.600]  I'm gonna go pick up my inauguration ticket.
[03:57:19.600 --> 03:57:23.082]  I am ready to get this show on the road.
[03:57:23.082 --> 03:57:28.286]  Now, are you worried about experiencing any violence when you're at the inauguration?
[03:57:28.286 --> 03:57:35.452]  No, I think I am a patriot and I will do whatever it needs to be done for our country.
[03:57:38.941 --> 03:57:41.042]  Well, this is the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[03:57:41.042 --> 03:57:42.482]  I think Ramona understands that.
[03:57:42.482 --> 03:57:49.226]  I've got all my Trump stuff so that people will know that I am a supporter
[03:58:04.033 --> 03:58:10.158]  Well, hey, and speaking of that apparel, we have just a little bit of it left at our store, at Infowarestore.com.
[03:58:10.158 --> 03:58:12.740]  People are saying, I need the Trump is my president shirt!
[03:58:12.740 --> 03:58:13.201]  I can't get it!
[03:58:13.201 --> 03:58:13.801]  I'm sorry!
[03:58:13.801 --> 03:58:15.422]  We told you it's limited time.
[03:58:15.422 --> 03:58:19.946]  There's very, I don't know if there's any of those left, but make sure you get these shirts when we come out with them, folks.
[03:58:19.946 --> 03:58:25.671]  These are limited time releases, and people like Ramona, well, they regret it when they can't get their hands on it.
[03:58:25.671 --> 03:58:26.451]  Thank you, Leanne.
[03:58:26.451 --> 03:58:27.252]  Thank you, David Nye.
[03:58:27.252 --> 03:58:28.233]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:28.233 --> 03:58:29.474]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:29.474 --> 03:58:31.295]  Owen Schroer signing off.
[03:58:31.295 --> 03:58:32.897]  You stay classy, Infowarriors.
[03:58:41.829 --> 03:58:45.826]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
