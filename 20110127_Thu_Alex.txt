[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:34.840]  Texas Alex Jones well I'm blown away right now it happens more and more
[00:34.840 --> 00:40.080]  often but sometimes I come in here and I read all the news and I get completely
[00:40.080 --> 00:47.440]  blown away I just get blown away by how crazy it all is ten years ago one of
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.520]  these stories that I have in front of me would have been fodder for three four
[00:52.520 --> 00:58.680]  hours of radio where we analyzed every facet of it now there are dozens and
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.680]  dozens of stories every day that have such incredible ramifications it shakes
[01:03.680 --> 01:09.640]  me to my very core look at this story it just went up at prisonplanet.com
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.160]  about ten minutes ago it's going up at info wars.com right now Bill would
[01:15.160 --> 01:21.160]  protect big sis citizen spies from lawsuits and I've given it the headline
[01:21.160 --> 01:28.240]  a little different from prisonplanet headline that shocker citizen spy
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.080]  networks to be given immunity and I've gone over the article in the
[01:33.080 --> 01:40.360]  legislation scanned over it and it's it's it's just unspeakable this is so the
[01:40.360 --> 01:47.080]  cable person the phone repair person the plumber the school teacher the doctor
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.480]  all of the people where you supposedly have attorney-client privilege doctor
[01:51.480 --> 01:55.480]  patient privilege or when you're hiring a company to come in and do your cable
[01:55.480 --> 02:01.280]  or when you're bringing realtors into your house and they see a reloading kit
[02:01.280 --> 02:08.400]  we've had that happen in one of our riders JT Coyote and they call the
[02:08.400 --> 02:14.280]  SWAT team on you and I've had a 12 years ago now of course a carpet cleaner
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.880]  saw a shotgun on the wall I didn't have children then so I had the shotgun you
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.720]  know up on a gun rack on my wall in my studio I was doing the show out of my
[02:23.720 --> 02:32.400]  house then broadcast out of the bedroom back bedroom and he freaked out and ran
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.000]  off to call the police and I was able to call the company and stop it and say
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.680]  you know this is Texas my shotgun is not illegal but it was it was like a
[02:39.680 --> 02:44.400]  $300 defender Winchester cheap pump shotgun and it just freaked the guy out
[02:44.400 --> 02:50.080]  and that's the new America right there and it dovetails with this article out
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.720]  of the Wall Street Journal in Dallas the cab drivers are freaked out because now
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.680]  they're gonna be put at the back of the line which is key at the airport at Love
[03:03.680 --> 03:11.040]  Field the airport there in Dallas the city airport if they don't have a natural
[03:11.040 --> 03:19.320]  gas taxi cab or van total discrimination that's like Nazi Germany Jews go to the
[03:19.320 --> 03:22.760]  back of the line or black people to the back of the bus but oh it's an
[03:22.760 --> 03:28.240]  environmental reason and and and I mean these are all just absolute bellwethers
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.040]  absolute giant red flags of total tyranny and you add it into the thousands of
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.880]  other surveillance blimps going up and drones and checkpoints and face scanning
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.400]  cameras it makes my head spin and then I've got another report here from
[03:42.400 --> 03:46.800]  activist post amazing writers it's up at info wars.com police train that
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.280]  FEMA camps are perfectly normal and they've got the training information in
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.920]  news right here where the media makes fun of you if you talk about FEMA camps
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.280]  even though they're admitted in Congress and the Houston Chronicles written
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.440]  about them but then they tell the cops oh yeah FEMA camps are good I mean we're
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.160]  in a lot of trouble do you understand offshore banks have stolen over a
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.720]  thousand trillion dollars and they just announced at Davos they want a hundred
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.480]  trillion more which they can then leverage to a thousand trillion through
[04:15.480 --> 04:21.840]  fractional reserve banking I mean the crime of the century burning made off
[04:21.840 --> 04:26.040]  Ken lay type people have totally taken over they set all this up it's a
[04:26.040 --> 04:31.040]  financial dictatorship I'm getting chills right now this is so real and
[04:31.040 --> 04:35.560]  they're training cops to put us in camps people that know this is evil and
[04:35.560 --> 04:42.680]  wrong heaven help us total immunity to the goon squads ladies and gentlemen my
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.240]  father has been approached by Homeland Security to spy on people he went and
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.680]  talked to other dentists in his office he said yeah they approached me at home
[04:48.680 --> 04:53.080]  they're approaching all of the quote professionals I've now talked to other
[04:53.080 --> 04:56.560]  professionals everybody's getting approached I mean they're setting up a
[04:56.560 --> 05:00.760]  giant spy network and it's pointed at the American people the government very
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.880]  wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.280]  day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything about
[05:10.280 --> 05:14.440]  our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even how you
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.640]  take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.880]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.840]  see he predicted the collapse of GM bannie Mae Freddie Mac and America's
[05:25.840 --> 05:29.720]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[05:29.720 --> 05:34.160]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.800]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[05:37.800 --> 05:41.960]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.680]  online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you
[05:45.680 --> 05:51.480]  can take to protect yourself you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com
[05:51.480 --> 05:57.920]  that's end of America the number 3.com watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.280]  that's end of America 3.com Alex told you the government announced recently
[06:02.280 --> 06:07.400]  that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.360]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[06:11.360 --> 06:14.760]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[06:14.760 --> 06:18.680]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their
[06:18.680 --> 06:22.520]  long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.240]  dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings account from
[06:26.240 --> 06:30.520]  e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments food is our greatest
[06:30.520 --> 06:35.000]  dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource you
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.160]  and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper stocks
[06:39.160 --> 06:43.600]  or metals Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to
[06:43.600 --> 06:47.640]  enjoy now or save for long term this will freeze the cost your food what you
[06:47.640 --> 06:54.240]  can still afford it visit e-foods direct dot com on the internet or call 800-409-5633
[06:54.240 --> 07:02.240]  that's e-foods direct dot com or 800-409-5633 hundreds of nations have
[07:02.240 --> 07:06.920]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.440]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that will be pulling the rug
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.720]  from underneath the Americans at home I have a tremendous influence on our
[07:15.720 --> 07:19.960]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[07:19.960 --> 07:25.160]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[07:25.160 --> 07:29.720]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[07:29.720 --> 07:34.120]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.880]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.800]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[07:41.800 --> 07:47.320]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[07:47.320 --> 07:53.040]  the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[07:53.040 --> 08:00.040]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV
[08:00.040 --> 08:13.960]  these the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we have
[08:13.960 --> 08:18.120]  a very important broadcast lined up for you today thank you so much for joining
[08:18.120 --> 08:26.920]  us it is the 27th day of January 2011 this Thursday edition obviously tomorrow
[08:26.920 --> 08:33.880]  I will be able to tell you a lot more about the history channel secret
[08:33.880 --> 08:37.720]  society Bohemian Grove special set to air at 9 o'clock central 10 o'clock
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.920]  Eastern tonight and I've got my fingers crossed you know obviously Brad Meltzer's
[08:44.920 --> 08:47.960]  done a lot of things that make us not trust him and I tried to grill him in a
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.440]  nice way when he was on with us earlier in the week ahead of the episode and he
[08:54.440 --> 08:59.160]  put in the proviso that oh I come off like a hero in it when I was talking to
[08:59.160 --> 09:06.200]  him off air but he said the proviso was but I haven't seen the final cut and so
[09:06.200 --> 09:12.560]  we'll see what happens with that tonight but I always try to take the field and
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.480]  engage the globalist but we'll certainly be able to definitively report on what
[09:17.480 --> 09:22.000]  really is going on tomorrow on the Friday edition and then of course Sunday we
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.320]  had dr. Paul Connick chemistry professor on a few months ago and he talked
[09:29.320 --> 09:32.600]  about the different radioactive isotopes that are in the water supplies
[09:32.600 --> 09:40.840]  that are being added via the phosphate mine derivatives that are added into the
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.760]  water that are named sodium fluoride but actually have hundreds and hundreds in
[09:44.760 --> 09:49.320]  some cases over 300 different chemicals generally it's about 150 or so depending
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.720]  on where your city buys these chemicals from and that's now since he was on hit
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.400]  the news in Texas that the state knew that this was in almost all the water
[09:57.400 --> 10:04.320]  supplies and covered it up covered up the radiation particles the radioactive
[10:04.320 --> 10:12.920]  particles of radium and of course uranium and other things but that is just
[10:12.920 --> 10:18.520]  such a huge issue such a huge issue and I've even heard local talk show host on
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.840]  local AM you know make jokes about that when it came out oh I guess the
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.640]  conspiracy theorist are right there is there is uranium in our water but then
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.120]  they laugh and giggle as if we're still bad because we're warning people about
[10:31.120 --> 10:37.560]  it and then laugh at us people get into laughing at danger and making a joke out
[10:37.560 --> 10:42.160]  of those of us that recognize it and raise the alarm and they've taken our
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.320]  self-preservation instincts and turn them on their head with many people and
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.480]  it's our job to shake people out of their mind-controlled stupor and so then
[10:51.480 --> 10:54.120]  about three weeks ago the federal government came out and said you know
[10:54.120 --> 11:00.280]  what we were wrong saying put 1.2 parts per million sodium fluoride in the
[11:00.280 --> 11:14.800]  water we want to raise the maximum level to 0.7 or to 0.7 from 1.2 and they
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.280]  said it is causing dental fluorescence and children shouldn't brush their teeth
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.240]  with it and of course all the other major studies are showing bone cancer the
[11:22.240 --> 11:25.720]  list goes on and on but now they're having to partially back off of it
[11:25.720 --> 11:29.560]  because the studies are coming out from prestigious institutions like gang
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.040]  busters that fluoride has added to many foods it's in the toothpaste it's in the
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.480]  water and that it bio accumulates like really nothing else in the bones and in
[11:38.480 --> 11:46.160]  the glands and the organs and is causing absolute pandemics of serious
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.720]  health illnesses and connet when that came out was out of the country visiting
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.080]  family he's originally from England that lives here in the US so we're unable
[11:54.080 --> 11:58.040]  to get him but he just got back yesterday he'll be on coming up in the
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.120]  second hour today and if you've ever had any questions about fluoride or you
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.040]  want to hear it directly from dr. connet he'll be here to break it down of course
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.360]  we've had many other medical doctors like dr. blalock on about what it does to
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.920]  the brain it's an excitotoxin and even low levels of sodium fluoride are like
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.120]  adjuvants they accelerate and and amplify all the other free radicals and
[12:20.120 --> 12:27.880]  dangerous chemicals very very very very dangerous and if the yuppies out there
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.520]  could ever stop giggling and laughing and talking about the Super Bowl and
[12:31.520 --> 12:38.440]  actually get focused on real issues we could have a big effect also later again
[12:38.440 --> 12:41.240]  at the start of the show I said some days I come in here and I see the news
[12:41.240 --> 12:45.840]  and it's like I've been polaxed I've been I've been struck by lightning or
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.560]  something I almost can't talk right now because I know the back story of the
[12:50.560 --> 12:53.440]  Carnegie Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation the Bellarmoll and the Gates
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.400]  Foundation saying openly and in countless reports that we've linked to in
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.280]  articles and info wars dot com and present planet dot com but Bill Gates has
[13:02.280 --> 13:07.640]  done TV live appearances where he releases genetically modified mosquitoes
[13:07.640 --> 13:17.120]  in a crowd of people on Ted TV here it is in the Daily Mail mutant mosquitoes
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.480]  Malaysia release of genetically modified insects sparks fears of
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.200]  uncontrolled new species and what have they genetically engineered these to do
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.680]  to breed with the same species of mosquitoes that they're associated with
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.280]  they've been genetically modified and to basically make them not live as long
[13:33.280 --> 13:39.080]  to reduce their biological clock genetically and of course this is what
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.200]  the globalist can introduce into our population as well through vaccines and
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.920]  other systems and that's exactly what the hardcore eugenicist promote I mean
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.160]  this is so dangerous to the biosphere so truly dangerous to the public so
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.320]  dangerous to the planet but meanwhile they've got everybody running around
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.320]  hyperventilating over carbon dioxide saying it's a deadly gas we've got to
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.000]  put taxes on it while the globalist are manipulating the very genetic connections
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.600]  of the planet and and introducing mosquitoes that that from other studies
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.960]  we've seen that they've been developing to force you to quote take
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.080]  different vaccines but then when you read they aren't really vaccines that the
[14:19.080 --> 14:26.640]  facts the mosquitoes are biological carriers of very very dangerous genetic
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.560]  manipulators into the body so this is genetic engineering going on against the
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.400]  public and if they're admitting this is going on in Malaysia and in areas of
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.280]  Africa and Latin America can you imagine what's going on secretly without a lot
[14:40.280 --> 14:44.040]  of research scientists on even the government admits that they believe
[14:44.040 --> 14:54.360]  that could be the causal effect that the weaponized version of Lyme's disease
[14:54.360 --> 14:57.680]  came from Plum Island biological weapons lab off the coast of New York and
[14:57.680 --> 15:06.720]  that so did the big mosquito scare the last decade with the West Nile and so
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.240]  they're telling you all day how they're trying to protect you from foreign
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.920]  enemies and how you need to give up all your rights and have citizens spy
[15:12.920 --> 15:16.560]  networks and tattle on your neighbors and don't trust anybody but the
[15:16.560 --> 15:19.240]  government because terrorists might kill us any minute when you got a better
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.160]  chance of dying in auto accidents associated with hitting deer there's
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.040]  over 400 a year on average you've got a better chance of dying from a honey
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.320]  bee sting right at about a hundred a year several hundred a year die from
[15:30.320 --> 15:33.440]  wastings you have a much better chance of being struck by lightning hitting a
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.520]  deer and flipping off the road I personally have had a deer but luckily
[15:37.520 --> 15:41.400]  I was only going about 15 miles an hour my cousin totaled his car almost got
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.520]  killed hitting a deer going 70 miles an hour hundreds of people die hitting
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.840]  other livestock every year you can pull up the numbers hitting cows hitting
[15:48.840 --> 15:53.680]  horses the point is is we're giving up our whole way of life our liberty our
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.400]  freedom of this big corrupt government that's controlled by offshore banks on
[15:57.400 --> 16:03.520]  record because we're scared of the scary men from Central Asia that work
[16:03.520 --> 16:11.640]  turbines and live in caves it's all hyped up and and and most of it staged
[16:11.640 --> 16:14.920]  now that said I'm gonna get into all of that later and I've got all this other
[16:14.920 --> 16:20.600]  news on the economy and the riots going on worldwide and reportedly the
[16:20.600 --> 16:29.040]  president the dictator of Egypt fleeing to England we've got that report some of
[16:29.040 --> 16:33.920]  the biggest snowstorms and coldest weather ever recorded on the east coast right
[16:33.920 --> 16:41.360]  now slamming in Obama even stuck in traffic even the great puppet Emperor
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.920]  12 hours to get home from work in DC those are the type of reports we've got
[16:46.920 --> 16:52.760]  here thanks to the quote global warming reportedly as things are so cold but
[16:52.760 --> 17:02.000]  this new article I knew this was coming but when I saw it it's just the
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.520]  ramifications of this are so massive and we need to get this report out to
[17:08.520 --> 17:16.240]  everybody and I want to commend everybody you made the two search terms we
[17:16.240 --> 17:24.280]  did yesterday number one and number two dealing with Obama's birth certificate
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.040]  and that reporter that is an admitted respected reporter and longtime friends
[17:29.040 --> 17:32.840]  of the governor and he did say I talked to the governor he told me this and how
[17:32.840 --> 17:36.880]  he knows him for decades and knew him before he was a congressperson when he
[17:36.880 --> 17:42.080]  was a taxi driver then after it became a big firestorm yesterday he went on Fox
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.200]  News and said well I meant to say I read about that in the paper I didn't talk to
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.840]  the governor and you know was he given an offer he couldn't refuse was he
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.240]  threatened there's no doubt listening to the audio tape of that radio interview
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.760]  that he was very clear that he's great longtime friends of the governor and went
[17:58.760 --> 18:04.320]  to Obama's inauguration with him two years ago when the governor was a
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.440]  congressman and that he was given folks the inside scoop and I believe he's
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.600]  obviously been pressured or threatened to amend his story he still says the
[18:13.600 --> 18:16.040]  governor is saying there's no birth certificate the governor's on record
[18:16.040 --> 18:20.080]  saying that in the newspaper but now saying he didn't confirm that again to
[18:20.080 --> 18:26.120]  him personally very very interesting on that front that's another one of the
[18:26.120 --> 18:31.200]  big stories we're gonna be talking about today but when we come back from break
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.400]  I'm gonna try to be calm and composed I'm gonna try to read this article on
[18:35.400 --> 18:41.000]  air and then I want to go over the different facets of this and the type
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.080]  of society we're entering and exactly what this is gonna mean to each and
[18:44.080 --> 18:53.320]  every one of us and this shocker citizen spy networks to be given immunity is an
[18:53.320 --> 18:59.800]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com to stausey spies with total immunity to
[18:59.800 --> 19:03.440]  break into your houses under the sneak and peek provision of Patriot Act to
[19:03.440 --> 19:09.600]  spy on you to lie on the stand about you this is pure 1984 this is Kafka-esque
[19:09.600 --> 19:16.280]  this is this is so bad it's just every day literally hundreds and hundreds of
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.640]  revelations that confirm everything that we have talked about is true except for
[19:21.640 --> 19:25.720]  one area it's worse than we said and I want to apologize for underestimating
[19:25.720 --> 19:30.400]  evil and for not being hardcore enough and and really spelling out how just how
[19:30.400 --> 19:34.320]  serious it is the Cointel Pro always accused me of exaggerating when it's
[19:34.320 --> 19:41.200]  the opposite nine times out of ten literally I underestimate and I this is
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.600]  so horrific this is so horrible this is this is so unspeakable and when you
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.600]  analyze the numbers of spies they've recruited it is in the tens of millions
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.800]  and when you get the documents on what they're training them in it's all
[19:55.800 --> 20:04.480]  anti-gun anti-family CPS type stuff David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine did
[20:04.480 --> 20:07.840]  you know that the Illuminati is striving for the beginning of the age of
[20:07.840 --> 20:12.560]  Aquarius to have their world government intact that means the loss of our
[20:12.560 --> 20:18.200]  national sovereignty Constitution Bill of Rights and Christian heritage is this
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.600]  what we want the only hope for the nation to survive is to repent of our
[20:22.600 --> 20:27.720]  national and personal sins and turn back to the living Jesus Christ reject

[24:04.520 --> 24:09.720]  first before I get into this new bombshell information I want to state
[24:09.720 --> 24:15.040]  on record that our film police state for the rise of FEMA released last year a
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.880]  hundred percent documents the entire martial law FEMA can't control grid and
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.200]  how they would roll it out the emergency centers act the Washington Post the
[24:26.200 --> 24:30.720]  Houston Chronicle reporting on the contracts for FEMA emergency centers
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.720]  during insurrection the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 four
[24:35.720 --> 24:41.520]  years ago or three and a half years ago army and homeland security and Marines
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.400]  running illegal checkpoints all over the country pulling citizens out of cars
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.640]  taking blood at checkpoints all of this is being done the citizen spy networks
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.920]  I had a military colonel from the Army on admitting they were doing gun
[24:53.920 --> 25:01.080]  confiscation drills in Arcadia Iowa it's a two-hour film you want to
[25:01.080 --> 25:05.400]  understand it all it's there I'm an expert on this more than probably anybody
[25:05.400 --> 25:09.240]  out there who isn't in the government and you know at the top of the pyramid who
[25:09.240 --> 25:13.440]  actually are running this I'm the expert from the outside going to the drills
[25:13.440 --> 25:18.160]  reading the FEMA documents all of it proven and there's endless speculation
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.000]  about do they exist it is the base closure act that ties in and everything
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.520]  we laid out before they released last year the emergency centers act that
[25:27.520 --> 25:32.960]  act to just get more funding and make it more official codifies and proves our
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.520]  entire analysis exactly how it'll be for homeless people who are locked up at
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.480]  night for their safety emergency centers during disasters or insurrection
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.400]  there's no denying this we have the biggest prison population in the world
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.000]  already four million behind bars three million and out of the system no one
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  can deny the police state grid being put into place and there's a story at
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.920]  info wars.com by Milo Nichols police trained at FEMA camps are perfectly
[26:01.920 --> 26:08.240]  normal and he links to FEMA documents that we've covered here on air unit six
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.600]  ICS facilities and when you link through to this and it's on page two of the
[26:13.600 --> 26:21.880]  article it's training.fema.gov you will read about the emergency camps now I've
[26:21.880 --> 26:25.480]  been to urban drills going back 13 years ago and I've been to many of them
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.360]  where they train the police in the military with roleplayers saying I'm
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.160]  your brother I'm your cousin I've got rides you can't take me to the camp and
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.600]  they're running drills all over the country to lock down highways check your
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.400]  license with buses and army trucks they've trained police nationwide to
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.160]  drive the buses during mass arrest situations which they can then use
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.200]  during these emergencies but I'm gonna be going over this and in this latest
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.160]  article a police officer pointed it out to the activist post and they wrote
[26:51.160 --> 26:56.800]  about it but this is what we've covered okay they are training it was just in
[26:56.800 --> 27:00.440]  the news last year that they're training the Austin police at Fort Hood for
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.760]  emergencies and sending them to Iraq to learn how to set up checkpoints and
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.720]  and and and run license and backgrounds and take people to jail and line
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.480]  citizens up and face scan you and put you in databases or check you according
[27:12.480 --> 27:19.000]  to the DMV database this is on record okay and it's totally unconstitutional
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.720]  it's totally evil and scary and authoritarian and the entire Homeland
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.320]  Security apparatus is pointed at the American people it has nothing to do
[27:28.320 --> 27:34.960]  with al-ciyeda so I'm gonna be going over that but here's the big article
[27:34.960 --> 27:37.560]  today and I want to do this again usually I do this about once a week but
[27:37.560 --> 27:40.840]  we've got to turn up the heat on this and I want to get into our the answer to

[28:18.000 --> 28:24.080]  five days straight since we launched it six days straight now and it is just
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.240]  showing the huge power that we have now I want to do another Google term today

[34:26.180 --> 34:31.100]  police state takeover political arrest confiscation of property and firearms
[34:31.100 --> 34:35.220]  that we are now entering and they will use it at a key trigger point during a
[34:35.220 --> 34:40.020]  deep depression with massive terror attacks as an overlay blamed on domestic
[34:40.020 --> 34:44.940]  grips the globalist will kill police officers all over the country and blame
[34:44.940 --> 34:49.380]  it on libertarian conservative grips we've caught British intelligence US
[34:49.380 --> 34:58.020]  intelligence and Israelis mainstream news in my film the documentary terror
[34:58.020 --> 35:03.660]  storm we've written countless articles about it just search British commandos
[35:03.660 --> 35:09.020]  caught attacking police in Basra and you'll get London Guardian with them
[35:09.020 --> 35:13.340]  dressed up like Muslims running around shooting people and then the British
[35:13.340 --> 35:16.940]  military attacked the Basra police station to get them out because they
[35:16.940 --> 35:19.940]  couldn't have you know them interrogating them or putting them on trial for it
[35:19.940 --> 35:23.860]  and that was to get Shiites and Sunnis killing each other Marines have testified
[35:23.860 --> 35:28.380]  they've caught Israeli contractors doing the same thing they've got units of
[35:28.380 --> 35:33.780]  other contractors out of the US who've been caught this is all on record so I
[35:33.780 --> 35:37.500]  want you to understand if they can't get some mindless idiot who isn't very
[35:37.500 --> 35:41.420]  capable to go out and blow you up or shoot you they're gonna send in
[35:41.420 --> 35:44.780]  commandos to kill you that are in the hammer that of course is in operation
[35:44.780 --> 35:49.740]  north woods US government Pentagon green-lighted plan to stage shootings in
[35:49.740 --> 35:57.380]  Miami DC and Baltimore Maryland and to shoot citizens police officers you name
[35:57.380 --> 36:01.300]  it and blame it on the communists to start World War three that program was
[36:01.300 --> 36:04.740]  never implemented in the US it was implemented in Europe under Operation
[36:04.740 --> 36:07.700]  Gladio I hope you're taking notes okay I'm not just saying that you look up
[36:07.700 --> 36:11.820]  Operation Gladio NATO option it's declassified our government staged over
[36:11.820 --> 36:15.620]  200 bombings in Europe to blame it on their enemies you folks it's time to
[36:15.620 --> 36:21.140]  grow up okay I'm not risking my life to play games here this is real and they
[36:21.140 --> 36:24.740]  know if they kill me now or shut me down now or set me up now that'll just
[36:24.740 --> 36:29.140]  underline and highlight everything I've said but that doesn't mean they still
[36:29.140 --> 36:34.460]  might not do it I have to face this every day and I'm doing it because I
[36:34.460 --> 36:37.180]  understand how horrible it's going to be for you and your children and my
[36:37.180 --> 36:40.780]  children if these people get away with this this is not some boss hog
[36:40.780 --> 36:43.780]  tyranny with just some stealing and some thieving by government that's already
[36:43.780 --> 36:47.440]  been going on they've stolen four plus trillion from the Pentagon the last ten
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.340]  years they've stolen the pension funds even Bloomberg reports they signed
[36:51.340 --> 36:55.180]  secret deals 11 years ago to take the death benefits of all dead and dying
[36:55.180 --> 36:59.780]  World War two through Gulf War one vets when the people die now they don't get
[36:59.780 --> 37:04.140]  their insurance money that they paid into that was an agreement with the
[37:04.140 --> 37:08.860]  Department of Veterans Affairs I mean look they're not committing crimes like
[37:08.860 --> 37:11.820]  this because they think you're gonna take the country back and bring them to
[37:11.820 --> 37:16.380]  justice they're gonna make sure we go into hardcore tyranny so they get away
[37:16.380 --> 37:21.660]  with all this you understand what I'm telling you here choose a side now and
[37:21.660 --> 37:25.100]  if you're still on the fence denying the stuff's going on get up off your
[37:25.100 --> 37:29.180]  hind end and research everything I'm breaking down I'm getting chills right
[37:29.180 --> 37:43.380]  now I can't even hardly do this radio show all right we got to stop this we
[37:43.380 --> 37:47.660]  got to peacefully speak out now and warn everybody and really break the
[37:47.660 --> 37:50.660]  trance that people been incrementally brought into to just accept more and
[37:50.660 --> 37:55.460]  more tyranny we got to make a noise every day everywhere I mean every gas
[37:55.460 --> 37:59.300]  station I go in every grocery store I'm not just talking to the clerk now I'm
[37:59.300 --> 38:06.420]  talking in the parking lot last night we were children on the bed we were gonna
[38:06.420 --> 38:11.420]  watch part of a movie and my wife wanted something from the store I drove up and I
[38:11.420 --> 38:15.660]  spent 10 minutes talking in the parking lot and the people gas in their cars up
[38:15.660 --> 38:18.900]  and inside and and they were kind of looking at me like I was crazy at first
[38:18.900 --> 38:21.820]  until they heard the authoritative information like wow I'll check into it
[38:21.820 --> 38:25.660]  but I was talking to folks gasping up their cars it's a big gas station I was
[38:25.660 --> 38:28.580]  walking around the front of the parking lot I was just standing there going
[38:28.580 --> 38:35.660]  warning it's I mean that's what it takes okay and the whole time I'm watching an
[38:35.660 --> 38:39.580]  hour of that movie we got tired went to bed I couldn't even watch the movie I
[38:39.580 --> 38:44.260]  was just thinking about all this that's the normal response to FEMA camps to
[38:44.260 --> 38:48.100]  checkpoints to surveillance blimps and drones to face scanning cameras to
[38:48.100 --> 38:52.060]  citizen spies openly being announced and telescreens going in 9,000 locations
[38:52.060 --> 38:56.140]  Walmart's mall saying spy on your neighbors
[39:01.140 --> 39:04.660]  there's probably coming a time very soon we're not gonna be able to hear us on
[39:04.660 --> 39:07.860]  air I'm telling you I can look at everything going on I can and I can
[39:07.860 --> 39:10.940]  tell you right now if we don't make a big noise now and accelerate the
[39:10.940 --> 39:13.940]  awakening it's already got the globalist on their heels a bit that's why
[39:13.940 --> 39:16.900]  they're trying to move forward fast they're fleeing forward but if we don't
[39:16.900 --> 39:22.620]  really launch massive initiatives everywhere in your towns your cities to
[39:22.620 --> 39:28.300]  really get people's attention it's over now you look on fluoride I've told people
[39:28.300 --> 39:32.340]  last year to go to all their city councils to file lawsuits not just over
[39:32.340 --> 39:36.300]  the fluoride but all the other lead mercury arsenic the radioactive isotopes
[39:36.300 --> 39:39.340]  that are in the water that that is started so the feds are backing off saying
[39:39.340 --> 39:42.780]  okay we'll take half the fluoride out maybe all of it because they know they
[39:42.780 --> 39:47.260]  can get us in the food and the toothpaste they're adding it to thousands of
[39:47.260 --> 39:51.140]  foods almost every processed food as it added there's levels that are deadly
[39:51.140 --> 39:56.220]  poisonous and many powdered eggs just to name one example and now they're kind of
[39:56.220 --> 40:00.660]  backing off see it when we were gonna protest and when we were all gonna say
[40:00.660 --> 40:04.700]  no to the body scanners they backed off for three days see they don't want to
[40:04.700 --> 40:07.740]  fight us on an open field where we have the moral high ground and it's a
[40:07.740 --> 40:11.020]  peaceful resistance they don't ever want to show you your power you've got the
[40:11.020 --> 40:18.900]  power right now to change this tyranny and sweep it away and I don't want to
[40:18.900 --> 40:22.500]  be imprisoned or tortured or be killed and then not win I'm not worried about
[40:22.500 --> 40:25.900]  myself individually when you really grasp this stuff and you're a man and
[40:25.900 --> 40:28.980]  you understand what it is to be a man nothing special not a hero just a man
[40:28.980 --> 40:32.700]  how could you not fight this how could you not speak out against it how could
[40:32.700 --> 40:39.900]  you not do everything you can those of you that have been in denial there there
[40:39.900 --> 40:45.060]  there is no way to be in denial now if you know any basics of history this is
[40:45.060 --> 40:49.940]  flaming tyranny this is the most sickening expression of it that I see
[40:49.940 --> 40:55.140]  growing it's like a tough 14-year-old who when they're a boxer is beaten up
[40:55.140 --> 40:59.500]  25-year-old boxers people say this is gonna be a champ this new world order is
[40:59.500 --> 41:04.860]  about like a 14-year-old that is just dripping with evil and I see it growing
[41:04.860 --> 41:09.580]  fast I see its muscles bulging the veins the neck getting big and I'm it's
[41:09.580 --> 41:15.100]  growing fast and I'm like whoa we've seen that in history that's bad news right
[41:15.100 --> 41:21.500]  there I was a mainline conservative folks around Paul type libertarian when I
[41:21.500 --> 41:25.900]  first got on air 16 years ago and the listeners sent me documents and said
[41:25.900 --> 41:29.100]  there's an urban warfare drill I'm a police officer in South Texas they're
[41:29.100 --> 41:32.900]  training us for martial law I'd get in the car go see it interview him get the
[41:32.900 --> 41:39.140]  video confirm it and I'd go warn people and get laughed at I interviewed police
[41:39.140 --> 41:44.460]  chiefs who the army tried to buy off police chief of San Antonio I discovered
[41:44.460 --> 41:48.740]  all this from real journalism and then I already knew history so I knew how to
[41:48.740 --> 41:54.340]  recognize what it was they're not taking us down like they take down third
[41:54.340 --> 41:57.300]  world countries in a year or so they've been setting this up for decades
[41:57.300 --> 42:02.700]  securing their ill-gotten gains over the private banking syndicate securing
[42:02.700 --> 42:06.540]  their thieving of the pension funds the pension funds are gone the private and
[42:06.540 --> 42:09.980]  public it's already been stolen on record they're now announcing the states
[42:09.980 --> 42:14.660]  are gonna go bankrupt into federal and then international deceivership just
[42:14.660 --> 42:18.740]  like Greece just like Ireland none of these cuts to government which I'm
[42:18.740 --> 42:21.780]  think is good because we shouldn't be dependent on it that's how they control
[42:21.780 --> 42:27.020]  us none of these paltry cuts these tiny cuts are gonna affect the 1.5
[42:27.020 --> 42:33.660]  quadrillion and now the bankers want 100 trillion on top then leveraged to
[42:33.660 --> 42:40.500]  another quadrillion bare minimum that's the fraction reserve banking slide rule
[42:40.500 --> 42:46.780]  we're here they're moving with their afterburners on okay I mean I'm having
[42:46.780 --> 42:52.060]  to steal myself I'm having to bolster my psyche and just go I'm going into it and
[42:52.060 --> 42:56.460]  a lot of people can't recognize what it is I'm I'm I'm girding myself
[42:56.460 --> 43:00.620]  spiritually for the times we're going into
[43:00.620 --> 43:09.740]  now here's the article shocker citizen spy networks to be given immunity info

[44:17.540 --> 44:20.980]  tip off authorities to potential extremist threats from lawsuits in the
[44:20.980 --> 44:25.220]  event they turn out to be to finger innocence reports the French news

[44:50.260 --> 44:54.460]  where you have realtors in they go in your garage and there's a gun reloading
[44:54.460 --> 44:57.780]  set and it looks dangerous and they don't ask you what is it they're too
[44:57.780 --> 45:01.860]  dumb to know it says reloading and they see a thing a black powder there and
[45:01.860 --> 45:04.660]  they call the police on you and the police go ahead and SWAT team you and
[45:04.660 --> 45:08.020]  go ahead and take your guns that's not illegal but it was an arsenal we took
[45:08.020 --> 45:14.180]  them do you understand my father has been approached to spy on people for
[45:14.180 --> 45:16.620]  Homeland Security and they went and told another dentist in the office they
[45:16.620 --> 45:21.180]  said yeah they approached me last week at home another group they're approaching
[45:21.180 --> 45:25.340]  anybody and everybody who's in a prominent position and most people get a
[45:25.340 --> 45:29.580]  little badge and a little stipend and totally get off on it and they go to the
[45:29.580 --> 45:32.780]  drills they go to the meetings we have all their internal documents and it's
[45:32.780 --> 45:36.100]  are they smoking pot are they spanking their kids are they talking about about
[45:36.100 --> 45:40.380]  the government we're publishing these every week are they talking about about
[45:40.380 --> 45:45.900]  the government go ahead and report them that's Homeland Security in Oklahoma and
[45:45.900 --> 45:49.820]  the net so wide in Texas the Homeland Security manual say they use cell phones
[45:49.820 --> 45:54.180]  are they wearing blue jeans are they a nice guy do they keep their desk locked
[45:54.180 --> 45:59.420]  at work and they're getting that paranoid weak power-tripping control
[45:59.420 --> 46:06.060]  freak segment here's an example before I moved five years ago I had a neighbor
[46:06.060 --> 46:09.460]  this old lady who would bring us we first moved in brought us cookies and one
[46:09.460 --> 46:13.820]  day she called and I was on TV on the other end I could hear my voice and she
[46:13.820 --> 46:18.820]  said is that you on TV and I said yeah and she went and hung the phone up
[46:18.820 --> 46:22.500]  suddenly she was at the fence looking at us suddenly she was coming over and
[46:22.500 --> 46:25.780]  banging the door and saying your cat went to the bathroom in my yard clean it
[46:25.780 --> 46:31.740]  up my wife said hon we don't have a cat she said listen to me missy I know you're
[46:31.740 --> 46:35.820]  lying clean it up my wife who's wearing to turn the other cheeks said okay I will
[46:35.820 --> 46:38.820]  clean it up she came over like four or five times and said clean you know clean
[46:38.820 --> 46:43.300]  it up we would go over and clean it up and go yes ma'am knowing the pure evil
[46:43.300 --> 46:47.740]  just menacing and asking about our kids and were we doing bad things to them and
[46:47.740 --> 46:51.780]  we were like let's get out of here let's move because she saw me on TV she was
[46:51.780 --> 46:59.260]  gonna show me we don't have a cat but our cat the imaginary cat was using the
[46:59.260 --> 47:05.500]  bathroom in her flower bed these people are being turned loose on us all the
[47:05.500 --> 47:09.460]  sitcoms the dramas were the bad guy that kills kids is a patriot against the new
[47:09.460 --> 47:12.940]  world order or the crazy scientist that wants to nerve gas New York thinks
[47:12.940 --> 47:16.380]  there's chemtrails you can see the demonization everywhere and they're
[47:16.380 --> 47:23.700]  just setting it up now going back to the article this is so huge house homeland
[47:23.700 --> 47:29.700]  security chairman King who was pushing to see something say something act wants
[47:29.700 --> 47:34.180]  to shield good citizens who report suspicious activity from facing the
[47:34.180 --> 47:38.300]  consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as extremism or terror so
[47:38.300 --> 47:41.020]  that way you can't face your accuser when the SWAT team comes to your house and
[47:41.020 --> 47:46.620]  kills you with a remote control in your hand or but again if you if you read the
[47:46.620 --> 47:53.380]  manuals maybe 2% about terror the rest is then do they have guns house homeland
[47:53.380 --> 47:56.260]  security chairman was pushing to see something say something campaign wants
[47:56.260 --> 47:59.300]  to shield quote good citizens who report suspicious activity for facing the
[47:59.300 --> 48:02.980]  consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as extremism or terror and
[48:02.980 --> 48:05.820]  of course it goes on to also get on the stand against you if they want to lie
[48:05.820 --> 48:09.300]  about you in that nice their army of little lying informants you always hear
[48:09.300 --> 48:12.380]  about informants going after patriots and there'll be some informant who's got
[48:12.380 --> 48:16.820]  like 10 felonies or something and they go up to stand and lie about you that's
[48:16.820 --> 48:21.180]  why they want to get rid of juries they know juries are waking up to that of
[48:21.180 --> 48:24.060]  course this will only encourage untrained people to report any behavior
[48:24.060 --> 48:27.180]  whatsoever no matter how benign or potential terrorism creating an army of
[48:27.180 --> 48:31.740]  enthusiastic but hapless citizen spies because see in Walmart in the malls now
[48:31.740 --> 48:35.020]  they're gonna call the cops on you and something happens they don't want it
[48:35.020 --> 48:40.740]  coming back see they lie and tell you cops have immunity they don't have
[48:40.740 --> 48:45.340]  immunity you have immunity under the Constitution so do they somebody's
[48:45.340 --> 48:48.420]  breaking in your house at night you fill them full of holes in Texas or many
[48:48.420 --> 48:52.100]  other states under the Constitution you have immunity because you were acting

[52:11.740 --> 52:15.300]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[52:15.300 --> 52:20.380]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[52:20.380 --> 52:25.740]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[52:25.740 --> 52:30.660]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[52:30.660 --> 52:35.060]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:35.060 --> 52:38.780]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists they're asking for more
[52:38.780 --> 52:42.700]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[52:42.700 --> 52:48.340]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[54:08.780 --> 54:13.740]  years ago when MTV ran one-minute videos showing SWAT teams busting in houses
[54:13.740 --> 54:18.020]  putting people in buses and taking them to camps just to acclimate people they
[54:18.020 --> 54:22.540]  shoved people being grabbed out of subways. This is what the military and
[54:22.540 --> 54:26.460]  police have been trained to do. I've shot video of it I've made films about it.
[54:26.460 --> 54:29.820]  Police stay for the rise of FEMA you got to get into the hands of all police
[54:29.820 --> 54:35.100]  because police really freak out when they watch it because they've been in the
[54:35.100 --> 54:39.580]  drills but been compartmentalized and so they know it's all accurate but I give
[54:39.580 --> 54:45.140]  them the full spectrum. Now let's go to this one-minute clip from MTV showing
[54:45.140 --> 54:48.980]  people being rounded up and putting a camp here it is.
[54:48.980 --> 54:54.260]  They're on a train subway.
[54:54.260 --> 55:21.940]  The Holocaust happened it says there's another one of them in their house
[55:21.940 --> 55:35.260]  being raided. SWAT team rounds up the family
[55:38.660 --> 55:42.780]  and they're put in trucks.
[55:42.780 --> 55:52.380]  The Holocaust happened to people like us. Now I have been there and you've
[55:52.380 --> 55:55.500]  heard countless guests on the show who've been there police military you name it
[55:55.500 --> 55:59.940]  when they trained to have checkpoints and put people in trucks. It's Rex 84 it
[55:59.940 --> 56:02.980]  came out in congressional hearings but still there's this denial about it. I
[56:02.980 --> 56:10.340]  want to show you unit 6 ICS facility and this has been brought back into the
[56:10.340 --> 56:15.220]  public's attention because a police officer sent it in to the activist post
[56:15.220 --> 56:19.780]  but you can go right to FEMA.gov training.fema.gov and they all package it
[56:19.780 --> 56:24.820]  and oh for emergencies or terror attacks or for civil unrest oh and they do call
[56:24.820 --> 56:28.740]  them camps and they say we'll put up barbed wire around the sports complex
[56:28.740 --> 56:33.780]  or we'll use the old military base well what did we know they were planning in
[56:33.780 --> 56:41.620]  the emergency relocation program that what are they training the clergy
[56:41.620 --> 56:44.540]  response teams the preachers to tell their flocks go to the camps take the
[56:44.540 --> 56:48.100]  inoculation it's of the Lord what's in the model state's health emergency
[56:48.100 --> 56:51.660]  powers act rounding people up taking them to the local sports stadium this is
[56:51.660 --> 56:56.380]  all there and they're now accelerating the training of police to acclimate them
[56:56.380 --> 57:01.820]  to this but the police officer says dear Milo I love your side I notice you
[57:01.820 --> 57:04.620]  haven't discussed FEMA camps yet but here's some information that you might
[57:04.620 --> 57:11.380]  find interesting I'm a police officer officer's identity withheld everyone in
[57:11.380 --> 57:14.420]  my department was recently required to take an online core sponsored by FEMA
[57:14.420 --> 57:17.980]  about the incident command structure we've had emergency managers on for
[57:17.980 --> 57:22.540]  major states disguising their their of their name and voice remember about the
[57:22.540 --> 57:27.140]  mass roundup plans in Indiana and waiting for a million dead and all of that
[57:27.140 --> 57:32.460]  and hardening all the police facilities for terror attack the incident command
[57:32.460 --> 57:36.460]  structure is the system of control set in place following a disaster catastrophe
[57:36.460 --> 57:40.180]  terror strike or other such event all of the documents from that course can be
[57:40.180 --> 57:46.220]  found at FEMA's website training dot FEMA dot gov EMI web forward slash IS is
[57:46.220 --> 57:52.780]  100 LST dot ASP these are just to find this at m4wars.com in
[57:52.780 --> 57:57.020]  particular you should pay attention to unit 6 ICS facilities here's the direct
[57:57.020 --> 58:01.220]  link first I'd like you to notice page six and eight that is actually entitled
[58:01.220 --> 58:06.060]  camps that show them page six and eight please where it says camps for folks
[58:06.060 --> 58:10.460]  watching on prison planet dot TV we have that PDF up now they claim the training
[58:10.460 --> 58:14.660]  that camps or temporary facilities and may not be required I feel that they do
[58:14.660 --> 58:17.580]  this to condition the police at the camps are perfectly normal and maybe
[58:17.580 --> 58:22.500]  necessary so that we don't hesitate to place people in the camps upon
[58:22.500 --> 58:27.500]  command and then he goes through more of it but the issue here is this is a cop
[58:27.500 --> 58:31.140]  who's getting a low-level general training then if you don't object you
[58:31.140 --> 58:35.140]  get advanced into it and I just sent the guys to Chicago last year and it was
[58:35.140 --> 58:40.620]  foreign troops training to put American roleplayers in a camp on video
[58:43.460 --> 58:50.220]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.220 --> 58:54.540]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[58:54.540 --> 58:59.540]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[58:59.540 --> 59:03.620]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[59:03.620 --> 59:07.260]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[59:07.260 --> 59:11.300]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in
[59:11.300 --> 59:14.980]  addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should

[1:00:32.620 --> 1:00:35.540]  just gets crazier every day confirming the total globalist takeover the
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:40.220]  economic news some good news Congress will probe special exemptions to
[1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:43.460]  health care law that Obama administration gave select unions and
[1:00:43.460 --> 1:00:48.500]  businesses so that's a step in the right direction Republicans have revived a
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:53.980]  proposed legislation to force ISPs or retain all user data your browsing
[1:00:53.980 --> 1:00:58.980]  history that's basically piecemeal part of the cyber security act that's
[1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:03.260]  that's incredible they're now releasing the genetically modified mosquitoes that
[1:01:03.260 --> 1:01:10.420]  are doing hellish things that is coming up but what I've been covering over the
[1:01:10.420 --> 1:01:16.100]  last hour is shocker citizen spy networks to be given immunity we want to
[1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:19.060]  make that the number one Google search term today citizen spy networks and I'm
[1:01:19.060 --> 1:01:23.300]  begging you folks to get this article and get it out to everybody and to get
[1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:27.300]  the DVD police state for the rise of FEMA you know those of you that have the
[1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:31.900]  means take it to a duplicator it says on the disk copy and share and you know

[1:01:39.940 --> 1:01:42.580]  tyranny so that those of us that are awake and know what's happening get
[1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:45.940]  scared and shut up and if we allow that chilling effect to succeed they've won
[1:01:45.940 --> 1:01:49.700]  but it's also to acclimate the police the military the bureaucrats the general
[1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:53.580]  public that spying is a great patriotic thing to do and they get you into the
[1:01:53.580 --> 1:01:57.860]  spying thinking you're gonna be spying on al-qaeda and you find out it's the
[1:01:57.860 --> 1:02:01.780]  American people and that's confirmed by all the my act and homeland security
[1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:04.980]  reports and we get new ones every week that they published stuff that was
[1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:09.020]  secret years ago just publicly oh are your neighbors talking about controversial

[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:47.460]  jokes about all this stand up the globalists think they're gonna get away
[1:02:47.460 --> 1:02:54.780]  with this it's so wildly corrupt so classically tyrannical that there should
[1:02:54.780 --> 1:02:58.700]  be no reason they should get away with this no reason they should get away with
[1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:01.780]  putting their hands down your pants and put you in radiation scanners all the
[1:03:01.780 --> 1:03:05.020]  borders wide open and they've canceled the virtual fence and most of the
[1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:12.900]  physical fence but we can secure Afghanistan and Iraq's borders look it's
[1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:17.780]  for us the banks have robbed everything don't you get it towards Soros is over
[1:03:17.780 --> 1:03:20.820]  in Davos saying again he's had a great crisis and loves what's happening to
[1:03:20.820 --> 1:03:24.020]  everybody they've lied to you about the economy getting better they've designed
[1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:26.740]  this implosion they've done it over and over again other nations they know
[1:03:26.740 --> 1:03:30.140]  exactly what they're doing and they're planning on the increased crime and the
[1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:37.540]  breakdown of society being the rollout excuse for all of this tyranny that
[1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:41.380]  they've been quietly behind the scenes getting ready it's kind of like old
[1:03:41.380 --> 1:03:45.340]  World War two footage I've seen of the ship works in New York and Boston and
[1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:51.980]  other places and they show a big giant curtain and it would crank back on a big
[1:03:51.980 --> 1:03:57.900]  cable and you'd see a huge ship a battleship or submarine and they chopped
[1:03:57.900 --> 1:04:03.500]  the blocks and it would just slide in I'm somebody who 16 years ago had studied
[1:04:03.500 --> 1:04:06.340]  history so I recognized hey what's that big curtain over there what's all those
[1:04:06.340 --> 1:04:10.420]  guys in black uniforms running around you know again this is a parable boiling it
[1:04:10.420 --> 1:04:14.100]  down let me go over and look behind the curtain I look behind it and I saw this
[1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:18.500]  giant weapon system and I saw them openly training to use it against us I
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:22.420]  mean to boil it down the globalist have a mass giant spy networks paramilitary
[1:04:22.420 --> 1:04:28.060]  forces training secret police torture every horrible thing you can imagine
[1:04:28.060 --> 1:04:33.180]  behind the scenes and now they've started to pull the curtain back and they're
[1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:36.980]  going look at it it's to keep you safe from Al Qaeda we go look here's all your
[1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:41.340]  training manuals this is for us shut up terrorist in fact that's in the documents
[1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:45.140]  that if you don't like this and say it's for you you're a terrorist well you just

[1:07:06.660 --> 1:07:10.700]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:14.620]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:07:14.620 --> 1:07:18.620]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:23.180]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:07:23.180 --> 1:07:27.180]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:30.980]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:07:30.980 --> 1:07:34.620]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:07:34.620 --> 1:07:38.940]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:21.980]  we're gonna get into the economy a lot of other important medical news like this
[1:08:21.980 --> 1:08:25.980]  headline of the Daily Mail mutant mosquitoes a laser release of genetically
[1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:30.540]  modified insect sparks fear of uncontrollable new species the fraud of
[1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:35.100]  man-made global warming becoming more and more evident is the much of the
[1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:40.500]  western world locked in ice record low temperatures since recordings began that
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:49.060]  is all coming up but finishing up the topic that's of great import that I
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:52.140]  covered in the last hour
[1:08:52.140 --> 1:09:00.660]  shocker citizen spy networks to be given immunity and Peter King the chairman
[1:09:00.660 --> 1:09:12.140]  of the Homeland Security Committee the outgoing chairman he is openly calling
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:17.020]  for total immunity to citizen spies and we've got all the manuals that have been
[1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:21.060]  made public where none of it has to do with foreign al-qaeda it is all gun
[1:09:21.060 --> 1:09:27.180]  owners libertarians people that don't like GMO foods people that criticize
[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:31.300]  fluoride criticize the private fellow reserve people that are awake people
[1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:37.100]  that know what freedom is and then I went over unit six of FEMA's website
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:40.740]  training dot FEMA dot gov where it talks about putting people in camps during
[1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:48.860]  civil unrest and the emergency centers act and all the rest of it I'm not here
[1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:52.220]  to scare you I'm here to get you concerned and awake to history and to get
[1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:55.900]  moving against this and I know people are waking up the globalist want to
[1:09:55.900 --> 1:10:00.980]  divide us along liberal conservative black white party lines this is about
[1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:04.820]  liberty versus tyranny and we've got to come together and speak out against the
[1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:09.740]  authoritarianism that the Democrats and Republicans are pushing the cyber
[1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:14.060]  security takeover the telescreens going in but if you look at history and study
[1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:19.340]  tyranny and you read now with the rank operation council and farm relations and
[1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:23.140]  others have been openly saying for more than three decades they want an
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:29.300]  authoritarian system you know you pick up the January issue 2010 of National
[1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:33.940]  Geographic it's oh the Singapore model tyranny is good we need to have this
[1:10:33.940 --> 1:10:39.180]  here don't criticize your government sit out and shut up and everything will be
[1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:42.580]  all right the giant citizen spy networks and now they want to give them
[1:10:42.580 --> 1:10:48.860]  total immunity to lie about you to spy on you to be paid to spy on you six years
[1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:51.820]  ago we got the secret documents three years later it got made public clergy
[1:10:51.820 --> 1:10:55.780]  response teams over a hundred pages of documents on info worst comm with phone
[1:10:55.780 --> 1:10:59.740]  numbers to FEMA the pastor had him show up at his office and threatening in
[1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:05.500]  Ohio they tracked it back and found out obviously breaking into our stuff
[1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:11.540]  somehow it was given to all the major preachers and when we learned it was
[1:11:11.540 --> 1:11:15.300]  nationwide they tell him take the inoculation go to the FEMA camp turn
[1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:18.580]  in your guns when the government orders them to do it but in the meantime they
[1:11:18.580 --> 1:11:22.020]  teach them Romans 13 Hitler's favorite verse do what the government says it's
[1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:25.260]  of God well we are the government we are the people it's our Constitution Bill
[1:11:25.260 --> 1:11:29.380]  of Rights of course Romans 13 saying when it's a godly government and we
[1:11:29.380 --> 1:11:32.140]  supposed to follow what Hitler said because he was a government or Stalin or
[1:11:32.140 --> 1:11:36.140]  Mao we're gonna go to Dr. Paul Conant here in a moment I just wanted to
[1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:39.700]  explain to you that when you just look at one of these things by itself it's
[1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:42.820]  bad enough but you had the thousands of points together and you know the
[1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.660]  ingredients that go into a tyranny in history and then you read the Rand
[1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:50.380]  corporation and other white papers on this they are consciously doing this
[1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:57.180]  there is a hundred percent proof they admit it there's no debating it America
[1:11:57.180 --> 1:12:01.060]  the great light of liberty home of the free land of the brave is now becoming
[1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:09.340]  the home of high-tech oppression the home of East German style spy state now
[1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:12.660]  what's another big ingredient in this and we're going to our guest here's
[1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:17.180]  CNS news cyber news service Congress will probe special exemptions to health care
[1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:20.420]  law that Obama administration gave select unions and businesses say
[1:12:20.420 --> 1:12:24.140]  Republican senator it's more than 500 now McDonald's you name it with their
[1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:27.660]  hundreds of thousands employees because they give political contributions they
[1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:32.580]  don't have to get the insurance that adds on average about 30 percent on the
[1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:37.140]  cost of an employee they've got to match it as well so it's an unfair trade
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:40.980]  advantage that's another big essence in the Soviet Union in Nazi Germany in
[1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:44.380]  Cuba in Cambodia whatever system it is it
[1:12:44.380 --> 1:12:48.940]  authoritarians all always it's a they control people by they can give you the
[1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:55.620]  letter of mark or the licensure to be able to operate and if all your homeland
[1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:58.420]  security spy you get to walk right through the airport they're now
[1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:02.220]  announcing that it's a it's a they create artificial classes and it's a
[1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:06.180]  patronage like a parentage there are hundreds of thousands of people who get
[1:13:06.180 --> 1:13:09.460]  parentage money in England just because their family served the crown well
[1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:13.380]  hundreds of years ago free homes free everything this is the system of
[1:13:13.380 --> 1:13:20.260]  patronage of control of parentage Congress will probe it now here's another
[1:13:20.260 --> 1:13:24.020]  one of the Dallas morning news and we're going to the guest Dallas cabbies
[1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:28.340]  play political football with city leaders the drivers are outraged by a
[1:13:28.340 --> 1:13:32.180]  city initiative that sends natural gas-powered cabs at the front of the
[1:13:32.180 --> 1:13:37.180]  queue at Dallas Love Field so they can go drop their people off for the football
[1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:40.380]  game Super Bowl and this is going to go on to the future this is Wall Street
[1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.020]  Journal and come back to unfair trade advantage and they say if you've got a
[1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:47.300]  natural gas car you go to the head of the line what are the Nazis first say
[1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:52.340]  Jews and others they don't get tax breaks now you can't be open on the
[1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:56.860]  weekend now you can't be open period see this is how they control oh you go along
[1:13:56.860 --> 1:14:00.380]  with the carbon taxes and the green jobs you don't work unless you do what we
[1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:05.980]  say outside of law oh you're go along with the globalists you don't have to
[1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:11.620]  get insurance for your employees oh you gave a political contribution to the
[1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:17.900]  Democrats you don't lose your Chevy dealership that's on record this is pure
[1:14:17.900 --> 1:14:25.060]  tyranny it's all illegal it's impeachable offenses instantly the sky is the
[1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:29.420]  limit imagine oh you don't have a natural gas car there's no law but the
[1:14:29.420 --> 1:14:34.660]  police and Homeland Security controls the airport so we say anybody with a
[1:14:34.660 --> 1:14:38.460]  natural gas sticker on their car you've got to wait while they go in front of you
[1:14:38.460 --> 1:14:46.660]  and get all the prime pickups that always goes with the uniforms and the
[1:14:46.660 --> 1:14:50.660]  surveillance and the spies use that system all you people that say I don't
[1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:53.660]  care about tyranny what do I have to hide I'm an auto mechanic I'm a school
[1:14:53.660 --> 1:14:58.940]  teacher I'm a they want they put in tyranny to make you a slave you understand
[1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:03.780]  that all right I'm gonna talk about it more the next hour I apologize dr. Connick
[1:15:03.780 --> 1:15:07.820]  getting him on 15 minutes late but I had to cover that I'll be with us for the
[1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:12.140]  rest of the hour but I want to talk about after he leaves this what it's
[1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:14.660]  gonna be like living in the system you already see a lot of what it's like but
[1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:19.740]  this is only the beginning and so that if we don't stand up and say no to it
[1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:23.180]  when things are darker down the road and I'm in a prison cell or dead you'll at
[1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:28.700]  least remember what I said okay and remember that you were warned and told
[1:15:28.700 --> 1:15:34.780]  and I'm not prophesying here I know history you were told you were warned
[1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:40.980]  dr. Paul Connick has for the past 20 years given over 2,000 pro bono public
[1:15:40.980 --> 1:15:47.100]  presentations on incineration and waste management 49 states in the US and seven
[1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:50.260]  provinces of Canada and 46 other countries he is co-authored six peer
[1:15:50.260 --> 1:15:55.220]  reviewed and published papers on dioxin co-edited the newsletter waste not
[1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:59.740]  provide expert testimony in court cases a critique numerous health risk
[1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:07.620]  assessment and co-produced over 50 videos on waste issues and well you know
[1:16:07.620 --> 1:16:10.460]  it's probably better for him to describe who he is and what he's done but
[1:16:10.460 --> 1:16:13.940]  he's gotten the majority of EPA scientists to write letters their union
[1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:16.340]  to write letters but how deadly fluoride is and I wanted to get him back on
[1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:20.260]  because three weeks ago the government came out in a press release was in the
[1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:24.260]  associated press and said yeah we don't want you to have 1.2 parts per million
[1:16:24.260 --> 1:16:27.500]  we're gonna cut that down to
[1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:36.940]  0.7 as the maximum and they admitted a lot of this and I want to get his take
[1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:40.100]  on why they're caving in what's happened but what else is being put in the
[1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:44.620]  water under the name fluoride and and how big of a victory this is because it
[1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:48.980]  shows if people get involved which is happening everywhere they will cave in
[1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:53.180]  because we've got the truth on our side dr. Connick I'm breaking down your a
[1:16:53.180 --> 1:16:56.540]  medical background and you're awakening good to have you here and then
[1:16:56.540 --> 1:17:00.740]  we'll get into this big development yeah hi Alex yes a very big development
[1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:06.020]  indeed yes just to fill you in on my background for nearly 15 years now I've
[1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:10.580]  been involved in researching the fluoride toxicity and the fluoridation
[1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:16.020]  issue and we just written a book on this published in October the case against
[1:17:16.020 --> 1:17:20.240]  fluoride with two other scientists James Beck from Calgary and spending
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:26.020]  mechlam from Scotland and that's a value we can order through amazon.com and
[1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:30.500]  we're still waiting for a scientific response to what is essentially the
[1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:34.340]  scientific arguments chapter and first again why this
[1:17:34.340 --> 1:17:40.820]  fluoridation is such a stupid practice but specifically you're a chemist yeah
[1:17:40.820 --> 1:17:44.060]  a prestigious one who didn't believe in any of this till you saw the facts
[1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:49.140]  absolutely well my wife asked me to look into this 14 and a half years ago I
[1:17:49.140 --> 1:17:52.660]  said what is it she said fluoridation I said take that away these people are
[1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:58.220]  crazy so I had I've fallen for the same indoctrination that millions of other
[1:17:58.220 --> 1:18:03.420]  Americans have fallen for that they made about the basically all the other
[1:18:03.420 --> 1:18:06.900]  people with white coats the scientists the regulatory agencies the
[1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:11.140]  professional bodies they all support fluoridation and those opposed to it a
[1:18:11.140 --> 1:18:16.740]  bunch of crazy networks absolutely and we have your amazing hour-long interview
[1:18:16.740 --> 1:18:22.180]  online on YouTube bombshell how fluoride is killing you and your children
[1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:26.820]  and your report the case against fluoride let's we're about to go to break but
[1:18:26.820 --> 1:18:32.260]  let's start getting into this what fluoride really does and what this new
[1:18:32.260 --> 1:18:35.060]  development with the government admitting there's quote too much fluoride
[1:18:35.060 --> 1:18:38.580]  in the water yeah well there's two things actually happened a few weeks ago
[1:18:38.580 --> 1:18:41.940]  the first one is the one you've mentioned that the CDC the Department of
[1:18:41.940 --> 1:18:45.900]  Health and Human Services said they were going to lower the so-called optimal
[1:18:45.900 --> 1:18:49.540]  level the level that's supposed to cause reduction in tooth decay without
[1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:54.300]  causing too much dental phlerosis which is harm to the teeth and on the same day
[1:18:54.300 --> 1:18:58.500]  the EPA said that they after four and a half years they were finally responding
[1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:03.260]  to the National Research Council's recommendation that they lower the

[1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:12.860]  standards they got two levels here one is the level you put in supposedly to
[1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:17.260]  reduce tooth decay and I say supposedly and the level above which you have to
[1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:22.100]  take it out because it's too dangerous and the the National Research Council
[1:19:22.100 --> 1:19:27.260]  said the level has to be lowered and that was the thing that everybody heard
[1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:31.980]  about what they didn't hear about is the following Monday the EPA's pesticide
[1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:39.620]  division agreed to all our challenges to the use of sulfur fluoride on food in
[1:19:39.620 --> 1:19:44.420]  warehouses which leaves a residue of fluoride and the argument that we use
[1:19:44.420 --> 1:19:49.060]  and they accepted if there's too much fluoride out there already so we can't
[1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:54.740]  let Dow Agro Sciences put more fluoride into absolutely they gas the food with
[1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:59.620]  this stuff and then we eat it and we did cover that here stay there

[1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:19.180]  walling I said go to all the city councils you have taken action we've
[1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:23.940]  had the anti-fluoride poster campaign I'm not taking all the credit but a slice
[1:24:23.940 --> 1:24:28.420]  of it does go to you the listeners and it shows that it doesn't matter if we have
[1:24:28.420 --> 1:24:32.260]  the facts and they laugh at us we keep pushing there's nothing they can do in
[1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:35.100]  fact I'm glad dr. Connick brought that up because that was in my folder to get to
[1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:40.700]  New York Times AP as well EPA proposes phase out of fluoride based pesticide
[1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:44.180]  this came the same week three weeks ago but didn't get as much attention we
[1:24:44.180 --> 1:24:47.820]  covered it here as them announcing okay we don't want one point one point two
[1:24:47.820 --> 1:24:51.380]  parts per million we want zero point seven but here's the issue they're not
[1:24:51.380 --> 1:24:56.060]  pointing out toothpaste processed foods have it they're spraying it on crops but
[1:24:56.060 --> 1:24:59.540]  also gassing crops and remember last week the guy went into a house they have
[1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:03.740]  the 10 up to kill bed bugs and the fluoride gas killed him and it said right
[1:25:03.740 --> 1:25:09.500]  on the door fluoride gas danger the residue gets left and so they claim
[1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:15.940]  0.7 is safe doctor but when you add in the toothpaste and the stuff in the
[1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:21.260]  food and the pesticides using it I mean my gosh what a massive load that is
[1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:25.100]  bio accumulating you know as a chemist who studies this and how could they hold
[1:25:25.100 --> 1:25:29.100]  back the truth when a decade ago and six years ago they had testimony in
[1:25:29.100 --> 1:25:32.700]  Congress the majority of EPA scientists signing a letter saying take it out I
[1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:36.060]  mean the government scientists know the truth and once the truth comes out they
[1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:41.060]  can't stop it yeah and in fact we have absolute proof that the kids are being
[1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:45.860]  overexposed to fluoride you don't have to estimate it you just measure it they've
[1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:51.220]  admitted that 41% of American children between the age of 12 and 15
[1:25:51.220 --> 1:25:56.380]  and that includes kids in Florida communities and non-floridic communities
[1:25:56.380 --> 1:26:02.460]  have some form of dental pherosis which is a simple market that the kids been
[1:26:02.460 --> 1:26:07.300]  overexposed to fluoride and that's what triggered finally triggered this drop
[1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:13.260]  from 1.2 to 0.7 parts per million but before we go on I want to thank you
[1:26:13.260 --> 1:26:19.220]  Alex very very much you know after our live interview a few months back in
[1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:24.900]  Austin I went back to the studio and your excellent production team created a
[1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:29.460]  videotape they allowed me just to speak for quite a long time that is the best
[1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:34.620]  videotape that I've managed to have done but my best interview best statement
[1:26:34.620 --> 1:26:39.620]  and I'm so glad that people are watching it around the world and I hope you'll
[1:26:39.620 --> 1:26:44.620]  keep pushing that particular videotape I just felt that your staff just allowed
[1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:50.020]  me to get the story out and then just under an hour that's great well you know
[1:26:50.020 --> 1:26:54.900]  it's had hundreds of thousands of views it's free on our YouTube channel on the
[1:26:54.900 --> 1:27:00.220]  info warrior channel but I forget the title that we gave it so people can
[1:27:00.220 --> 1:27:05.660]  easily search it do you remember the name of it no I don't I guess if they say
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:12.180]  the search fluoride so maybe one of your staff can can can look that up one
[1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:17.500]  other quick thing here the the news about this luring at the point seven
[1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:21.900]  parts per million for the so-called optimal level to reduce tooth decay
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:26.140]  which complete mythology but nevertheless it made headline news and
[1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:30.140]  that was good for us because it suddenly gave a jolt to the American public that
[1:27:30.140 --> 1:27:34.780]  maybe people like myself who had some sense to them worried about
[1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:38.740]  fluoridation so it was good from that point of view but it was a deal a deal
[1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:42.460]  was cut between the Department of Health and Human Services the water
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:47.660]  division of the EPA which said more or less if you lower the standard and make
[1:27:47.660 --> 1:27:52.500]  it look as if you're concerned when we determine a new safe drinking water
[1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:57.740]  standard we will make sure that it won't interfere with water fluoridation and
[1:27:57.740 --> 1:28:02.140]  they come out and say that they literally say we are going to come up with the
[1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:07.980]  standard which protects the water fluoridation program and this is our
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:13.620]  rages is probably the clearest example of politics interfering with science on
[1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:18.540]  this issue for many years is down there in black and white you know when you're
[1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:25.020]  determining a safe level of a substance in drinking water you should not let a
[1:28:25.020 --> 1:28:32.020]  program however well-intentioned it is interfere with your statement about what
[1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:36.700]  is safe for children to drink and they they no further on in their document
[1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:43.100]  they say the level which has a benefit is so close is so close to the level that
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:48.940]  causes harm that we are going to abandon the normal safety factors will be
[1:28:48.940 --> 1:28:54.540]  determined the safe level I mean it's it's Alice in Wonderland but very clear
[1:28:54.540 --> 1:29:01.420]  for anybody to view well you're absolutely right we did find the video
[1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:04.940]  it's on the info warrior channel on YouTube it's of course in higher quality
[1:29:04.940 --> 1:29:08.420]  at prison planet TV that's where we post all of these first and it's really the

[1:34:08.420 --> 1:34:11.780]  documents it's gotten over a hundred thousand views it needs to get ten
[1:34:11.780 --> 1:34:17.380]  million views that deals with fluoride and I talk about toxic tap water
[1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:22.820]  killing you and your children there's no doubt how deadly all of this is we're
[1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:26.060]  going back to him in a moment but if you do believe in what we're doing and you
[1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:29.900]  want to underwrite and and get the higher quality in the podcast the live
[1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:32.980]  streaming video in my book and Paul Watson's book and everything in one
[1:34:32.980 --> 1:34:37.860]  spot prison planet dot TV and then that finances us making this all and giving it
[1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:41.700]  away for free my film the Obama deception over 30 million views online
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:46.700]  total conservatively other films tens of millions of views a loose change final
[1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:51.020]  cut I produced we're here to wake people up we understand the tyranny we're
[1:34:51.020 --> 1:34:55.100]  facing we have no future if we're not successful but when you do pay $5.95 a
[1:34:55.100 --> 1:34:57.900]  month or 15 cents a day at prison planet dot TV you get the higher quality
[1:34:57.900 --> 1:35:01.820]  audio podcast just just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:35:01.820 --> 1:35:06.300]  new videos and and things every few months there restoring the republics
[1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:11.260]  one of the latest videos with of course the Constitution Party presidential
[1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:17.860]  candidate who's done such a great job Chuck Baldwin Joel Scousen the Tea Party
[1:35:17.860 --> 1:35:21.900]  deception Russell means welcome to the reservation inside ran corporation with
[1:35:21.900 --> 1:35:26.180]  Alex Abaya your toxic tap water I mean that's just some of the new stuff that
[1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:30.780]  we put up there recently on top of everything else all my films but the
[1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:35.620]  special ends on Monday you can get five plus months free it's five point three
[1:35:35.620 --> 1:35:38.340]  months freeze what it comes out to you sign up for yearly membership you get
[1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:41.860]  five point three months free when you pay for six point seven months and you
[1:35:41.860 --> 1:35:45.780]  can also on your username and passcode you can share it up to six people can
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:49.420]  log in under the same name and password we've said it that way we've looked at
[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:52.660]  it with bandwidth we're able to afford that so one membership is really six
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:57.060]  memberships or even more folks won't usually be logged on your pat your username
[1:35:57.060 --> 1:36:00.220]  or passcode just if you give it away to too many people you may get locked out
[1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:04.420]  sometimes when people are on there but that's really our goal is to get the
[1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:08.700]  word out I mean that's the over-driving operation so prison planet TV with that
[1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:12.500]  special in the online video bookstore the draft Ron Paul t-shirts are very
[1:36:12.500 --> 1:36:16.340]  popular a lot of new t-shirts we've added ball caps it's all about meeting
[1:36:16.340 --> 1:36:19.580]  like-minded people when you wear these shirts and hats creating communities to
[1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:27.340]  resist tyranny info wars.com the online video book apparel store the sponsors
[1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:30.580]  all of that funds our operation and what we're doing here we're doing something
[1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:34.620]  very very special if you go to the Google analytics you go to alexa.com and
[1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:39.300]  look at info wars.com alone at dwarfs rush limbaugh and limbeck combined now
[1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:45.300]  bigger than world net daily just one of our sites bigger than MSNBC and our
[1:36:45.300 --> 1:36:48.580]  trend straight up it's actually quite frightening the amount of threats I'm
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:51.500]  getting and things that are going on the system is scared because they know we
[1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:54.660]  have the truth and we're breaking down the walls on fluoride and so many other
[1:36:54.660 --> 1:36:59.100]  issues and I'm happy to dedicate my life and my name and my treasure to this
[1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:02.020]  fight and I appreciate your support we couldn't do it without you okay this is
[1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:05.260]  a long segment dr. conan I'm gonna try to sit back and give you the floor to go
[1:37:05.260 --> 1:37:09.060]  over this pesticide announcement what that pesticide fluoride does what's
[1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:12.460]  going on in the water and why first I want to hear from you why do you think
[1:37:12.460 --> 1:37:16.260]  they're starting to cave in I I think I know why if the vast majority of the
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:19.980]  scientists are hopping mad that work for the government if people are starting to
[1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:22.780]  follow lawsuits over not just the fluoride but the other things that are put
[1:37:22.780 --> 1:37:28.940]  in under the name they know that they've got at least back off because this is an
[1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:32.300]  issue that they know has gotten people really awake what do you think's
[1:37:32.300 --> 1:37:37.020]  happening well I think first of all it began with the internet people like
[1:37:37.020 --> 1:37:41.060]  yourself making available the information which they'd kept you know
[1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:45.220]  more or less to the priesthood the scientists within the system but now
[1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:51.220]  everybody has access to the science and we've coupled that and they've had two
[1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:55.860]  approaches for over 50 many 60 years two approaches on promoting
[1:37:55.860 --> 1:38:00.300]  fluoridation one was to claim that all the scientists and all the professional
[1:38:00.300 --> 1:38:06.660]  bodies supported it used endorsements rather than science to propel it and at
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:10.020]  the same time the other finger was pointed at the opponents being a bunch
[1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:16.340]  of of crazies well what we've been able to demonstrate with the the professional
[1:38:16.340 --> 1:38:20.060]  with the video professional perspectives on water fluoridation on our website
[1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:25.340]  that's 15 scientists explaining why it's a bad idea a professional statement now
[1:38:25.340 --> 1:38:31.540]  signed by over 3,500 scientists around the world and lastly our book the case
[1:38:31.540 --> 1:38:36.980]  against fluoride we're reaching more and more scientists more and more doctors
[1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:41.740]  more and more dentists with with an open mind so they're losing their base
[1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:47.660]  they're losing that strategy of keeping the scientists and the doctors away
[1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:53.100]  from the literature we you and others are making that literature available and
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:58.180]  perhaps the most important literature that is now become apparent is the
[1:38:58.180 --> 1:39:04.020]  evidence the fluoride damages the brain and what person in the world would
[1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:09.100]  gladly protect their children's teeth even if it worked at the expense of
[1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:13.620]  damaging their brain and since I spoke to you last time there have been another
[1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:20.740]  three published studies on IQ or studies relating to brain development have
[1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:25.660]  been published so that brings us up to 25 IQ studies plus another important
[1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  human brain study more animal studies indicating the fluoride damages the
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:36.060]  brain but guess what in the EPA's assessment of the new safe drinking
[1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:42.220]  water standard they have made no reference none at all to all this stuff on
[1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:50.340]  the brain again showing how captured the EPA water division politically is on
[1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:55.140]  this issue that they are they think it's more important to protect the water
[1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:59.300]  fluoridation program and all the reputations and all the the interests
[1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:02.860]  of the dental lobby who are concerned about lawsuits etc they have more
[1:40:02.860 --> 1:40:08.660]  concerned about protecting this program than the health and the brains of our
[1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:14.820]  children and when people find that out they're they're actually outraged as I
[1:40:14.820 --> 1:40:20.180]  say they cannot deny that our children are overexposed to fluoride you can see
[1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:26.660]  it 41% of American children aged 12 to 15 have dental pherosis which is a
[1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:31.380]  damage to the enamel what they would want you to believe is that fluoride could
[1:40:31.380 --> 1:40:36.580]  be damaging the growing tooth cells in a baby's body as they when they're born
[1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:42.460]  without damaging any other tissues in the body first of all that's highly
[1:40:42.460 --> 1:40:46.420]  unlikely it's highly likely if you're damaging the teeth you're damaging the
[1:40:46.420 --> 1:40:51.420]  bone and that has been demonstrated but also you have to worry about other
[1:40:51.420 --> 1:40:57.700]  tissues the thyroid gland the pineal gland and of course the brain itself the
[1:40:57.700 --> 1:41:04.500]  evidence is there they're completely ignoring it why I don't know you tell
[1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:08.380]  me well to be politically correct everyone just marches forward and says
[1:41:08.380 --> 1:41:13.100]  I drink my tap water I eat my food that's been sprayed with fluoride you know
[1:41:13.100 --> 1:41:18.100]  because the media says you're a kook if you actually know the science but the
[1:41:18.100 --> 1:41:22.060]  dr. Conant you don't get into this but I do I've got the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:26.180]  documents we've written articles more than 10 of them just in November and
[1:41:26.180 --> 1:41:31.300]  in December of last year at info wars.com directly linking to the big
[1:41:31.300 --> 1:41:35.660]  tax-free foundations who are you Genesis and they said we're gonna put things in
[1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:39.380]  food and water to lower fertility sperm counts down in the West by 87%
[1:41:39.380 --> 1:41:43.380]  women's fertility way down we're going to come up with things to add to the
[1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:47.660]  water the White House science are to reduce fertility we know that they
[1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:53.740]  want to reduce IQ this is a social control and population control system
[1:41:53.740 --> 1:41:58.220]  and they knew fully well in the 50s when they pushed it what they done and it's
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:00.980]  part of a strategic program our government and other governments will pay
[1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:06.340]  millions of dollars to single third world small cities to make sure they put
[1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:09.540]  in they'll they'll pay to put in the systems they'll give them new water
[1:42:09.540 --> 1:42:12.820]  treatment just to do it it's not because they care about people's teeth this is
[1:42:12.820 --> 1:42:16.820]  so cold-blooded and I think that's the final part of the equation that people
[1:42:16.820 --> 1:42:21.460]  need to go ahead and face up to this has all been done by design you probably as
[1:42:21.460 --> 1:42:24.820]  a scientist just takes absolutely you know just to you know the area of what
[1:42:24.820 --> 1:42:28.940]  the of what the chemicals doing want to get into but but I mean what can you say
[1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:32.820]  to the fact that they know this and they know what's going on and they just
[1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:38.420]  don't care well I think you know we left motivations to the last chapter in our
[1:42:38.420 --> 1:42:43.220]  book and it's simply the most difficult chapter to write trying to understand
[1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:47.220]  why people continue this stupid practice we should never have started it should
[1:42:47.220 --> 1:42:51.220]  be using the water supply to deliver medication it's such a stupid thing to
[1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:54.660]  do because you can't control the dose you can't control who gets it no individual
[1:42:54.660 --> 1:43:00.140]  supervision absolutely crazy from the the word go so yes it's a conundrum to
[1:43:00.140 --> 1:43:05.700]  understand why but you know Alex when I come on your program the I'm not saying
[1:43:05.700 --> 1:43:11.140]  that I agree with everything that you you you talk about and you when you bring
[1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:15.740]  me on you're not agreeing with every everything that I think you'd be horrified
[1:43:15.740 --> 1:43:22.100]  with some of the the other things that I believe in attitudes and so on so I
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:26.540]  think we have to stick to that I will talk about the science I I think there's
[1:43:26.540 --> 1:43:33.740]  a huge question mark about motivation I'm actually I'm more inclined to think of
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:38.500]  economic interest I think of the economic interest of the sugar industry
[1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:44.820]  which was on record before fluoridation began that they needed to find a means
[1:43:44.820 --> 1:43:50.180]  of reducing tooth decay without reducing sugar consumption knowing how strong the
[1:43:50.180 --> 1:43:55.180]  sugar lobby is I think that is a pressure that needs to be thoroughly
[1:43:55.180 --> 1:44:00.340]  doctor I totally agree with you I mean anything that the social engineers do
[1:44:00.340 --> 1:44:04.900]  they have to get with all of their main lobbies and and they always go with
[1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:09.260]  things that help them on so many fronts we know from uranium purification from
[1:44:09.260 --> 1:44:15.300]  aluminum smelting from power plant scrubbers from the phosphate fertilizer
[1:44:15.300 --> 1:44:19.220]  industry they've got all these toxic byproducts that they'd have to pay to
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:24.420]  dispose of or to store and so if they can push at the end of World War two with
[1:44:24.420 --> 1:44:27.660]  all of this you know industrial waste sitting around that it's good for you
[1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:31.140]  and put it in the water then win win win I'm saying at the social engineering
[1:44:31.140 --> 1:44:35.700]  top of the pyramid though they also like it because we know fluoride attacks the
[1:44:35.700 --> 1:44:40.020]  pineal associated with higher consciousness and in higher brain
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:44.020]  functions it does attack the thyroid it attacks reproduction it attacks the
[1:44:44.020 --> 1:44:47.820]  bones we know that from all the studies that you're such an expert on so my
[1:44:47.820 --> 1:44:53.980]  issue is I'm saying that is a a a a a a a central factor but I absolutely concur
[1:44:53.980 --> 1:44:57.580]  with you overall let's talk about the fact of what when they call it sodium
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.860]  fluoride what are they really putting in the water because I've read what the
[1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:04.220]  city of Austin buys and what's in that and pays you know close to a million
[1:45:04.220 --> 1:45:07.460]  dollars a year I've looked at there's different variants a lot of cities get
[1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:11.060]  it from China and it's turned out that there's hundreds and hundreds of
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:15.020]  chemicals in there so I have found and told people to go after cities and
[1:45:15.020 --> 1:45:19.780]  counties and water districts to say okay let them debate fluoride and say it's
[1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:22.500]  really good for you we're already starting to win that with the facts what
[1:45:22.500 --> 1:45:25.740]  about the radioactive isotopes that you write about your book that's now big
[1:45:25.740 --> 1:45:29.220]  news in Texas the state knew and covered it up for decades it now turns with the
[1:45:29.220 --> 1:45:31.940]  federal government of course they're they're talking about the cover up but
[1:45:31.940 --> 1:45:37.180]  not why is it in there where to come from so that's going on the lead the
[1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:40.940]  mercury the arsenic the other things they're adding I think that's the
[1:45:40.940 --> 1:45:46.340]  Achilles heel well yeah a lot of people agree with you over 90% of the chemicals
[1:45:46.340 --> 1:45:51.420]  used to fluoridate public water supplies in the United States come from the
[1:45:51.420 --> 1:45:55.980]  scrubbing liquor of the wet scrubbers used in the phosphate fertilizer
[1:45:55.980 --> 1:46:00.700]  industry it and the substance that is produced in those scrubbers is called
[1:46:00.700 --> 1:46:06.220]  hexafluorosilic acid it's not made it's not produced naturally in the
[1:46:06.220 --> 1:46:10.860]  environment it's a toxic waste it contains a whole bunch of other crap it
[1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:14.140]  can't be dumped into the sea by international law it can't be done
[1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:17.780]  locally because it's too concentrated but if someone buys it from them who
[1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:22.100]  comes a product and once it's a product then you can add it to the to the drinking
[1:46:22.100 --> 1:46:29.020]  water outrageous but true and apropos your issue about radioactive isotopes the
[1:46:29.020 --> 1:46:34.980]  same rock which is mined in Florida for this purpose is also mine for uranium
[1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:39.980]  and therefore one of the the things which may well be in this stuff are trace
[1:46:39.980 --> 1:46:45.980]  amounts of radioactive isotopes the door to break down isotopes from the
[1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:52.940]  decay of of of the uranium so yeah there's a huge concern in this stuff but
[1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:59.580]  again why in earth which which you put a hazardous waste into people's drinking
[1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:04.220]  water so we got two bizarre things here number one we're using the public
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:07.780]  drinking water supply to deliver medication which has not been done with
[1:47:07.780 --> 1:47:13.340]  any other substance since fluoridation began in 1945 and secondly we're using
[1:47:13.340 --> 1:47:19.220]  the public water supply as a way of getting rid of an industry's hazardous
[1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:26.540]  waste it's bizarre it's bizarre you know if you wanted to do this rationally
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:31.780]  supposing that somebody could prove to you Alex that swallowing fluoride actually
[1:47:31.780 --> 1:47:36.220]  reduces to decay and the best way to deliver it is through water so the
[1:47:36.220 --> 1:47:41.580]  obvious way to do it is to make up bottle water at one part per million and
[1:47:41.580 --> 1:47:46.100]  then make it freely available in pharmacies and supermarkets if you did
[1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:50.500]  it that way you could control the chemical that you use you could could
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:55.700]  use pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride instead of industrial grade
[1:47:55.700 --> 1:48:00.220]  hexafluorosilic acid number one number two you could make up the concentration
[1:48:00.220 --> 1:48:05.660]  one part per million and tell people only drink one liter this a day that way
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:09.300]  you control the dose the very thing that we can't do when it's in the water
[1:48:09.300 --> 1:48:14.820]  supply and because you're using if you use this approach you use a minuscule
[1:48:14.820 --> 1:48:19.660]  fraction of the fluoride that is currently being used and therefore you
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:26.660]  could afford to use sodium fluoride you know 99 point plus percent of the
[1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:30.860]  fluoride that you add to water goes nowhere near people's stomach goes
[1:48:30.860 --> 1:48:35.380]  nowhere near their teeth it's flushed down the toilet it's used to wash cars
[1:48:35.380 --> 1:48:40.420]  and everything else and the only reason that they can afford to do that is
[1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:46.140]  because they're using this hazardous product this industrial grade material
[1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:51.380]  that the phosphate fertilizer industry is only too happy to have stupid people
[1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:56.500]  buy it from them instead of paying a fortune to get rid of it in hazardous
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:49:00.460]  waste facility well I like the analogy of let's say it's reportedly good for
[1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:04.060]  your teeth which we now are learning it you know that's a fraud and then the
[1:49:04.060 --> 1:49:06.820]  government's having to admit it and saying you know don't have six year olds
[1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:11.100]  or younger brush their teeth with it but still it's all in the store shelves if I
[1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:17.460]  don't want to get sunburned and I put on 35 level sunblock I don't drink it to
[1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:22.260]  keep my skin from getting burned so so so why are you drinking this if it's
[1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:26.260]  supposedly for the teeth why isn't it just done topically but but but shifting
[1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:29.900]  gears out of that you know and I could play the newscast if you haven't seen it
[1:49:29.900 --> 1:49:33.740]  the Japanese government US government Fox News reporting it they're all
[1:49:33.740 --> 1:49:37.860]  saying they want to put lithium in the water to make us behave well so showing
[1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:41.780]  they want a social engineer with it there's a big push and statins in the
[1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:45.460]  water which a lot of evidence medical science shows isn't actually helping
[1:49:45.460 --> 1:49:50.180]  with cholesterol and it looks like another fraud but the point is they're
[1:49:50.180 --> 1:49:53.660]  now admitting and trying to condition the public to move towards total
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:57.580]  medicalization of the water and turning it into some type of drug
[1:49:57.580 --> 1:50:01.580]  interacting stew and not to mention most water supplies already contaminated
[1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:05.700]  from runoff with prozac and everything else show so they're on record and so
[1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:08.420]  is the White House science are saying they want to do things to us through
[1:50:08.420 --> 1:50:13.420]  the water that's insane it is absolutely insane from a medical point of view
[1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:18.700]  this is insane and let me go through it again once you put it into the water you
[1:50:18.700 --> 1:50:23.500]  can't control dogs ask any pharmacist that there's any drug out there for
[1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:26.420]  which he would write a prescription which says take as much as you want
[1:50:26.420 --> 1:50:31.020]  secondly you can't control who gets it's gonna go to everybody it goes gonna go
[1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:34.540]  to bottle-fed infants it's gonna go to people that are sick it's gonna go to
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:37.980]  people with poor kidney function it's gonna go to elderly people it's gonna
[1:50:37.980 --> 1:50:42.660]  go to people with poor nutrition ask a pharmacist if there's any drug that you
[1:50:42.660 --> 1:50:46.700]  can give to anyone regardless of age regardless of nutritional or health
[1:50:46.700 --> 1:50:51.260]  status they'll laugh in your face stay there stay there got to come right back

[1:54:12.460 --> 1:54:17.820]  friends and family professor Paul Conant your toxic tap water it's 59 minutes and
[1:54:17.820 --> 1:54:22.260]  12 seconds long there's another 10-minute video I did a few weeks ago
[1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:26.940]  that gets into all the hardcore documentation as well get these out to
[1:54:26.940 --> 1:54:31.980]  people this is why I do this is because I care I mean I have to go through a lot
[1:54:31.980 --> 1:54:34.660]  of trouble to keep my children away from this and then I go to the store and it's
[1:54:34.660 --> 1:54:38.500]  just almost all the water says for babies for nurseries give it to your baby
[1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:43.420]  when the government for what six years now has said people under six don't give
[1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:47.980]  them any fluoride but they push it at kids it's diabolical ladies and gentlemen
[1:54:47.980 --> 1:54:51.660]  now I wanted to go over an example here that jaren pointed out a few months ago
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:55.780]  to me and the number one allergy in the country causing the most deaths it
[1:54:55.780 --> 1:55:03.700]  affects 21 million Americans of the most common allergy is peanut or other
[1:55:03.700 --> 1:55:12.100]  similar type of these nuts and I mean peanuts got stuff in them that are good
[1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:17.820]  for you but do we force all 300 million Americans to eat peanuts well this is
[1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:21.580]  something we know isn't good sodium fluoride it's just incredible and it
[1:55:21.580 --> 1:55:25.820]  kills so many people a year with the peanuts and then now we see the record
[1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:28.700]  numbers of thyroid problems clearly associated with sodium fluoride
[1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:33.620]  especially in women we see them seven-fold increase in bone cancer in
[1:55:33.620 --> 1:55:39.660]  boys I mean this is amazing dr. Conant where do we go from here I mean I mean
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:45.060]  again they're starting to back off a little bit are they losing the battle
[1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:50.100]  I mean is the truth coming out I think they are losing yes and I don't think
[1:55:50.100 --> 1:55:54.580]  they can hide the dental phorosis and that will always be the driver here but
[1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:57.900]  when people find out that it's more about more than just teeth it isn't just
[1:55:57.900 --> 1:56:02.500]  teeth teeth teeth that concerns dentists what concerns parents his bones brains
[1:56:02.500 --> 1:56:09.860]  thyroid and so on one of the extraordinary things that the EPA says in assessing a
[1:56:09.860 --> 1:56:14.620]  damage to the bone they said well the the National Research Council says we
[1:56:14.620 --> 1:56:19.660]  should look at stage 2 skeletal phorosis and then they define what this is they
[1:56:19.660 --> 1:56:23.780]  say it's pains in the bones the stiffness in the joints pains in the
[1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:30.620]  pains in the joints etc we don't have any evidence of stage 2 skeletal
[1:56:30.620 --> 1:56:34.980]  phorosis in the United States we don't have any evidence that people have pains
[1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:39.140]  in the joints they don't have pains in the bone give me a break it's up and
[1:56:39.140 --> 1:56:44.980]  down the tree American adults with arthritis but nobody is looking to see
[1:56:44.980 --> 1:56:48.860]  if there's a connection between up these some of the forms of arthritis and
[1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:55.220]  living in authority to community for 10 20 30 40 years or so well said and again
[1:56:55.220 --> 1:57:00.340]  2000 people are hospitalized conservatively each year from peanut
[1:57:00.340 --> 1:57:05.700]  allergy 150 roughly die but I mean I mean I see the statistics all the time
[1:57:05.700 --> 1:57:10.060]  it's in the news all sorts of degenerative disease of the bones of
[1:57:10.060 --> 1:57:15.460]  skeletal system different types of arthritis juvenile onset I mean it's
[1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:20.860]  a plague but drink your fluoride yeah you know what's crazy about this you know
[1:57:20.860 --> 1:57:24.700]  there's certain things in this life we can't do anything about you know fate
[1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:28.500]  can give us a rule deal at any moment any moment you can have a heart attack any
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:31.620]  moment something was going to happen to us the doctor is going to tell us we got
[1:57:31.620 --> 1:57:36.140]  cancer there are a lot of things we can't do anything about this is one
[1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:41.860]  Alex but we can do something about we can just turn off the tap in the water
[1:57:41.860 --> 1:57:47.180]  works department and all of a sudden fluoride is no longer in our drinking
[1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:52.260]  water and this is one factor we can take out of all the other factors which may
[1:57:52.260 --> 1:57:58.340]  be causing in ill health it's as simple as that when when the light dawns when
[1:57:58.340 --> 1:58:00.820]  the politics political will is there
[1:58:00.820 --> 1:58:05.420]  fluoridation is as easy as turning off a tap it's a question of getting that
[1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:10.460]  political will and to get that political will we need more and more people out
[1:58:10.460 --> 1:58:14.420]  there in the public getting informed and that's where I think you are well
[1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:18.780]  performing a fantastic job dr. Conant thank you you're performing a
[1:58:18.780 --> 1:58:21.900]  wonderful job for humanity we're gonna be right back with you in one minute do
[1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:25.220]  five more minutes with you and then I was just handed some devastating news
[1:58:25.220 --> 1:58:30.340]  Gibbs said last week that Obama would be calling for gun control the state of the
[1:58:30.340 --> 1:58:34.580]  Union they're now doing it I have the newsweek headline White House to push
[1:58:34.580 --> 1:58:40.700]  gun control that's coming up at eight after we'll be right back stay with us
[1:58:41.700 --> 1:58:52.500]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today Alex told you the government
[1:58:52.500 --> 1:58:57.180]  announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the
[1:58:57.180 --> 1:59:01.100]  millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps the
[1:59:01.100 --> 1:59:04.460]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[1:59:04.460 --> 1:59:08.100]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[1:59:08.100 --> 1:59:12.340]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:15.900]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a
[1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:20.100]  food savings account from e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments
[1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:24.220]  food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any

[1:59:53.300 --> 2:00:00.900]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[2:00:00.900 --> 2:00:12.700]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:20.220]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.220 --> 2:00:27.180]  Alex Jones coming up in the next segment Obama to deliver gun grabbing speech
[2:00:27.180 --> 2:00:31.140]  soon I was just handed this during the last break White House to push gun
[2:00:31.140 --> 2:00:35.140]  control but it turns out when I went to m4wars.com her memo is already written
[2:00:35.140 --> 2:00:42.820]  up boil down he's got the sources at the bottom news week CBS news right there
[2:00:42.820 --> 2:00:46.860]  Obama intentionally did not mention gun control in a state of the union but
[2:00:46.860 --> 2:00:50.820]  AIDS say that in the next two weeks the administration will unveil a campaign to
[2:00:50.820 --> 2:00:55.900]  get Congress to toughen existing laws so they have thrown down the gauntlet and
[2:00:55.900 --> 2:01:03.540]  they use that drug-addled individual as a pretext to go after the Second
[2:01:03.540 --> 2:01:07.020]  Amendment they're also going to use Mexico they have a total gun ban of
[2:01:07.020 --> 2:01:11.140]  course in Mexico for the general public but they're blaming our guns for that
[2:01:11.140 --> 2:01:14.300]  even though it's admitted that most of them are military grades sold by corrupt
[2:01:14.300 --> 2:01:20.180]  military to the drug cartels so that is just absolutely incredible Obama to
[2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:27.420]  deliver gun grabbing speech soon and that is from Kurt Nemo our line went
[2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:30.380]  dead with dr. Paul Connick so that interview is probably over but that was
[2:01:30.380 --> 2:01:37.660]  a very very important interview that we just did with him and again I earlier
[2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:44.220]  went over the video here on air that we have up on one of our YouTube channels
[2:01:44.220 --> 2:01:48.380]  the info warrior channel the director channel we can put up multiple you know
[2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:53.780]  two three-hour videos we want professor Paul Connick your toxic tap water very
[2:01:53.780 --> 2:01:59.020]  very important to get that out to everybody dr. Connick we lost your
[2:01:59.020 --> 2:02:02.660]  alignment we've got you back for three minutes closing thoughts on this this is
[2:02:02.660 --> 2:02:06.180]  very exciting that we are having breakthroughs but finishing up with the
[2:02:06.180 --> 2:02:10.220]  pesticide angle because we haven't spent a lot of time on that I think that's
[2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:14.580]  almost a bigger announcement that they're gonna stop gassing the already
[2:02:14.580 --> 2:02:18.780]  picked crops that they admit gets deadly fluoride residue on it and serving
[2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:21.740]  that to us at least they're saying they want to phase it out looks like we need
[2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:26.900]  to put more pressure on that absolutely and there's a senator in hope who's
[2:02:26.900 --> 2:02:31.860]  trying to reverse that trying to endow acrocynces is going to be appealing this
[2:02:31.860 --> 2:02:36.380]  decision so it ain't over yet but at least we have the recognition that
[2:02:36.380 --> 2:02:40.020]  there's too much fluoride out there already we don't need to be adding to it
[2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:43.740]  what we need to is to complete that exercise and say if there's too much out
[2:02:43.740 --> 2:02:50.220]  there already stop adding it to the drinking water specifically another
[2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:54.740]  several different things they do to crops but this particular scenario they
[2:02:54.740 --> 2:02:58.460]  just basically crops that are already picked they just gas it correct that's
[2:02:58.460 --> 2:03:03.020]  right in warehouses and processing plants and some of the residues that they
[2:03:03.020 --> 2:03:08.620]  were permitting were actually outrageous 120 parts per million in wheat
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:16.980]  flour you know wheat flour goes into pizza pizza bread cookies candy you
[2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:22.820]  know is that you name it so a kid that's eating a lot of pizza a week or a day
[2:03:22.820 --> 2:03:30.540]  of cakes and stuff think about 120 parts per million these 120 milligrams per
[2:03:30.540 --> 2:03:36.620]  kilogram so add up all the wheat products that you're eating and see how
[2:03:36.620 --> 2:03:41.300]  many kilograms that is or how many grams that is and you could easily be
[2:03:41.300 --> 2:03:45.860]  getting if you've got if the flour had just been recently treated their
[2:03:45.860 --> 2:03:49.900]  argument of course I should back off their argument is that this is what
[2:03:49.900 --> 2:03:53.660]  they're allowed with a treat but but they're not it's not treated all the
[2:03:53.660 --> 2:03:58.620]  time and if you dilute it with the whole food supply then any individual is not
[2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:06.700]  going to get much fluoride this this way however there is a possibility some that
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:11.580]  recently treated batches of food are gonna end up going to a particular
[2:04:11.580 --> 2:04:15.700]  institute at some point you know at one point they had nine they were gonna
[2:04:15.700 --> 2:04:22.780]  allow 900 parts per million in powdered eggs 900 parts per million in powdered
[2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:26.460]  eggs that's what they were gonna allow one point we kicked up such a puff on
[2:04:26.460 --> 2:04:30.820]  that that they backed off but think about that toothpaste is a thousand parts
[2:04:30.820 --> 2:04:34.380]  per million and you're told only to use a pea-sized amount and if you should
[2:04:34.380 --> 2:04:38.460]  swallow it contact the poison controller center well how many pea-sized
[2:04:38.460 --> 2:04:44.700]  amounts of egg do you have an an omelet Dr. Paul Conant I want to commend you

[2:05:01.740 --> 2:05:05.340]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:05:05.340 --> 2:05:09.540]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:05:09.540 --> 2:05:13.860]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:17.820]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:05:17.820 --> 2:05:22.180]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[2:05:22.180 --> 2:05:26.500]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[2:05:26.500 --> 2:05:30.260]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:34.380]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:38.340]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:05:38.340 --> 2:05:42.180]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:05:42.180 --> 2:05:44.900]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[2:08:01.180 --> 2:08:11.740]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network if you
[2:08:11.740 --> 2:08:16.540]  just joined us we're into the third hour here have huge news Obama is set to
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:21.460]  announce anti-gun legislation red alert on that probably breaking that down
[2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:26.300]  also the be for victory victory against tyranny campaign has exploded like
[2:08:26.300 --> 2:08:30.780]  nothing we've ever done I want to salute all those involved in that the
[2:08:30.780 --> 2:08:38.740]  answer to 1984 1776 contest is exploded as well we're gonna be going over all
[2:08:38.740 --> 2:08:46.740]  of that information but dr. Paul Conant is a prestigious peer-reviewed publisher
[2:08:46.740 --> 2:08:52.820]  of many peer-reviewed reports he is tirelessly for 14 plus years exposed
[2:08:52.820 --> 2:08:57.180]  how deadly sodium fluoride is in the food chain three weeks ago the EPA
[2:08:57.180 --> 2:09:00.980]  announced that they are going to move to phase out the gassing of crops with
[2:09:00.980 --> 2:09:04.940]  upwards of 150 parts per million they put one part per million in the water and
[2:09:04.940 --> 2:09:08.540]  they say that's too much that's 150 times roughly they're putting on your food
[2:09:08.540 --> 2:09:14.860]  it's concentrated in so many of the products that you eat just absolutely
[2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:17.620]  incredible and they're announcing there's too much fluoride in the water they
[2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:22.780]  want to cut it roughly in half dr. Conant some stations just joined us recap
[2:09:22.780 --> 2:09:26.700]  what's happened how big this is you had one other point you wanted to make yeah
[2:09:26.700 --> 2:09:31.980]  it is a very big decision for the CDC that's promoted for adhesion for over
[2:09:31.980 --> 2:09:35.740]  50 years or at least the Department of Health and Human Services to which CDC
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:40.620]  is a part to admit that what they've been telling people for all these years
[2:09:40.620 --> 2:09:44.980]  that up to 1.2 parts a million is effective and reduces to decay without
[2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:48.380]  causing any problems they've had to admit that that's wrong and they're now
[2:09:48.380 --> 2:09:54.660]  luring the so-called optimal level to 0.7 meanwhile the EPA is moving on
[2:09:54.660 --> 2:09:59.980]  reducing the safe drinking water standard but the politics has interfered with
[2:09:59.980 --> 2:10:03.420]  that because they've made it clear that they're going to reduce it but not
[2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:07.140]  interfere with the water fluoridation program so one hand give it the other
[2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:11.540]  hand take it away and then as you've rightly pointed out the EPA a few days
[2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:15.980]  later the pesticide division agreed with all our objections we've been fighting
[2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:19.740]  this for nine years and said they're withdrawing so-fural fluoride from the
[2:10:19.740 --> 2:10:24.860]  market because kids people are getting too much fluoride and they cannot
[2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:31.140]  sanction adding even more to the to the food supply now what's happening around
[2:10:31.140 --> 2:10:35.380]  the country is more and more communities as a result of this and
[2:10:35.380 --> 2:10:40.740]  other pieces of information are stopping fluoridation Yellow Springs Ohio a
[2:10:40.740 --> 2:10:45.500]  couple of days ago voted against fluoridation yesterday Calgary the city
[2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:50.820]  council in Alberta Calgary Alberta voted against fluoridation and in New York
[2:10:50.820 --> 2:10:55.740]  City the jewel in the crown as far as fluoridation is concerned Peter Malone
[2:10:55.740 --> 2:11:01.820]  Jr. has introduced legislation to stop fluoridation in New York City believe me
[2:11:01.820 --> 2:11:06.580]  if New York City stops fluoridation that's the end of fluoridation in the
[2:11:06.580 --> 2:11:12.180]  United States and the end worldwide so if you live in New York City contact
[2:11:12.180 --> 2:11:17.700]  Peter Malone Jr. thank him contact your other counselors in New York City and
[2:11:17.700 --> 2:11:21.980]  say please support this sensible initiative it will save New York City
[2:11:21.980 --> 2:11:26.580]  over seven million dollars a year when we need to save money but also it will
[2:11:26.580 --> 2:11:31.220]  protect our children's brains and everything else from this poison
[2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:36.740]  well in closing as you said yourself I think of the hundreds of videos out
[2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:40.100]  there presentations you've given the hour long one that we produced with you a
[2:11:40.100 --> 2:11:44.540]  month ago that's on prison planet TV and free as a public service emergency
[2:11:44.540 --> 2:11:51.660]  warning on the info war channel there on YouTube everyone should send this to
[2:11:51.660 --> 2:11:54.980]  your water board to your city council your county commissioners your state
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:11:59.460]  legislators burn it burn it on the disk YouTube as a download function so does
[2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:04.740]  so does prison planet TV burn it to disk hand delivered it to them they'll see a
[2:12:04.740 --> 2:12:10.100]  distinguished doctor a chemist with the documents laying it all out an hour it's
[2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:15.180]  very well produced with him in studio with me in studio in our main studio and
[2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:19.900]  giving a speech that night in Austin very powerful delivered it to them give it
[2:12:19.900 --> 2:12:24.380]  to them because if we can show with the TSA that it's wrong and back that off
[2:12:24.380 --> 2:12:28.060]  with the fluoride it's wrong with the use of the pleaded uranium that's killing
[2:12:28.060 --> 2:12:31.540]  our troops in mass I've had the former head of the DU weapons program dr. Doug
[2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:35.300]  Rocky on many times they know what's happening if we can do that stop letting
[2:12:35.300 --> 2:12:39.420]  them use our troops as guinea pigs we can have victory victory victory because
[2:12:39.420 --> 2:12:44.900]  we have the truth on our side and just again in closing when you were here a
[2:12:44.900 --> 2:12:49.020]  month ago you got up before the city council you had three minutes here you
[2:12:49.020 --> 2:12:52.540]  are on your own expense flying to Austin you get up during three minutes
[2:12:52.540 --> 2:12:55.700]  they're laughing at you they're talking to each other we played the video here
[2:12:55.700 --> 2:13:01.220]  on air of them doing that it's actually on the Mike Hansen channel on YouTube if
[2:13:01.220 --> 2:13:05.500]  folks want to watch it and they just laughed at you now last week fluoride
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:08.860]  action spoke to them and I just saw the video on the Mike Hansen channel and
[2:13:08.860 --> 2:13:12.100]  they were not laughing this time when they brought up all the mainstream news
[2:13:12.100 --> 2:13:17.180]  about it being dangerous and you know the point is in the town I live in these
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:21.460]  little laughing corporate lackeys there needs to be lawsuits filed okay because
[2:13:21.460 --> 2:13:24.420]  they're not just putting fluoride in there's there's there's radioactive
[2:13:24.420 --> 2:13:29.060]  isotopes radium you name it that's big news in Texas these little laughing
[2:13:29.060 --> 2:13:35.220]  slime bags you know need to be dealt with politically and legally and
[2:13:35.220 --> 2:13:38.940]  peacefully because they are assaulting us and our families and I have to go
[2:13:38.940 --> 2:13:41.980]  through all sorts of expense to keep my children out of it I've moved out of
[2:13:41.980 --> 2:13:45.420]  Austin I'm now on well water so I'm outside their their their evil control
[2:13:45.420 --> 2:13:48.500]  but I do care about people being bombarded here in the city of close to a
[2:13:48.500 --> 2:13:53.500]  million people but dr. Connick what a turn of events yeah it certainly was and
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:58.820]  I wouldn't I think those councilman that you're talking about were extremely
[2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:03.260]  embarrassed when that videotape went out when people heard about their
[2:14:03.260 --> 2:14:08.620]  insulting behavior of not listening to to me and I what worries me is they
[2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:12.620]  don't listen to other people as well they treat this public participation
[2:14:12.620 --> 2:14:18.820]  here's a distinguished scientist peer reviewed prestigious in a fine suit
[2:14:18.820 --> 2:14:23.220]  distinguished giving them giving them loving information and they're laughing
[2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:27.980]  at you and ignoring you they are disgusting scum but Alex let's say this
[2:14:27.980 --> 2:14:33.340]  that day when I had the interview with you live and then went away to speak to
[2:14:33.340 --> 2:14:37.620]  the village council some of the aids and then came back and did that wonderful
[2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:43.020]  videotape I really can't thank you enough that is such a superb job that
[2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:47.700]  your production team produced the best statement I've ever had on on videotape
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:53.020]  anyway in between that time the the aids they all showed up it wasn't just one
[2:14:53.020 --> 2:14:56.820]  aid that we thought we were going to speak to all the aid showed up they all
[2:14:56.820 --> 2:15:01.140]  listened very very carefully and I think it was because of the bad press they got
[2:15:01.140 --> 2:15:06.660]  on on that treatment of of me in particular so I think they realized
[2:15:06.660 --> 2:15:11.140]  that they were you know that was a no-no and hopefully other people will get
[2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:16.260]  better treatment when they testify in public one last thing if people do watch
[2:15:16.260 --> 2:15:22.700]  this wonderful videotape of yours toxic tap water the best thing that they can
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:26.900]  do immediately watching that after watching that is to call Carol cop and
[2:15:26.900 --> 2:15:34.460]  her email is nice cough at aol.com nice cough NYS stands for New York State
[2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:44.780]  cof coalition opposed to fluoridation at aol.com that's nice cough at aol.com
[2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:50.380]  she's the point person for New York City so if you've got any contacts if you've
[2:15:50.380 --> 2:15:53.740]  got relatives or friends who live in New York City or if you live in New York City
[2:15:53.740 --> 2:15:59.540]  or if you ever visit New York City this is the campaign to support it because of
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:05.220]  New York falls to Liberty they all fall or they rise to Liberty the tyranny
[2:16:05.220 --> 2:16:09.220]  falls the Liberty rises dr. Connet will talk to you again soon God bless thanks
[2:16:09.220 --> 2:16:13.820]  a lot Alex bye for now thank you what an amazing interview and I just feel so
[2:16:13.820 --> 2:16:17.740]  good knowing I'm scientifically researched knowing I interview the top
[2:16:17.740 --> 2:16:23.140]  experts knowing we're right and knowing we're having victory V for victory
[2:16:23.140 --> 2:16:28.020]  ladies and gentlemen you know I actually did even more research on where the V
[2:16:28.020 --> 2:16:33.140]  came from in England and because always knew it was used in the in the French
[2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:36.460]  resistance of the Nazis and simple V for victory against tyranny and letting
[2:16:36.460 --> 2:16:39.980]  people communicate that hey we're awake to what's happening outside the Nazi
[2:16:39.980 --> 2:16:44.900]  control it actually goes back to runny mead and before that the Norman
[2:16:44.900 --> 2:16:50.380]  invasions and other things when they captured Anglo-Saxon archers this goes
[2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:55.140]  back to the time of Robin Hood he's really an art type of that they would cut
[2:16:55.140 --> 2:16:59.940]  off the index in the middle finger because to pull a longbow it took extreme
[2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:03.780]  force and it was the equivalent of like you know the shotgun of the day to pull
[2:17:03.780 --> 2:17:08.260]  English longbow you had to have those two fingers especially when you release
[2:17:08.260 --> 2:17:11.780]  the arrow for accuracy I myself done quite a bit of bow hunting and enjoy it
[2:17:11.780 --> 2:17:17.460]  incredible weapon back when I would it was good at it I could shoot a sapling
[2:17:17.460 --> 2:17:21.500]  at a hundred yards I'd tell my uncle I'd say watch this I'm gonna shoot that
[2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:26.300]  black knot on that sweet gum I remember out in his front yard he goes all right
[2:17:26.300 --> 2:17:30.260]  I bet you 20 bucks you can I said watch this of course I had a compound bow so
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:33.820]  it's easier it's once you draw back it it's you know there's no force once
[2:17:33.820 --> 2:17:36.620]  you've pulled it it's harder with the classic bow because you've got to hold
[2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:40.020]  it while you've got that force but and just and I knew how to you know with the
[2:17:40.020 --> 2:17:44.340]  sight with with distance raise it a bit and it just went right in the knot and
[2:17:44.340 --> 2:17:48.060]  he goes you can't do it again I go a hundred and of course it's only in
[2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:52.980]  competition I can be that good boom the arrow went down of course it was a metal
[2:17:52.980 --> 2:17:57.660]  arrow and scraped it down and went into the knot again of course I can't do that
[2:17:57.660 --> 2:18:01.500]  now back when I was more of a woodsman and hunted and fished constantly I could
[2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:06.580]  shoot the same hole at 200 yards with a 30 odd six Remington 700 with a good
[2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:14.500]  Leopold scope I do I did buy a Remington 700 308 that was owned by the head of the
[2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:19.620]  Dallas SWAT team about 15 years ago that was the bought from a gun shop where
[2:18:19.620 --> 2:18:24.980]  he had it on consignment I did buy that and I even not being the best shot I
[2:18:24.980 --> 2:18:27.940]  could shoot a deer at 600 yards with it alright I'm now getting off into things
[2:18:27.940 --> 2:18:31.500]  I like doing it's not that I like killing the deer it's the primitive thing of
[2:18:31.500 --> 2:18:35.340]  doing the hunting you get into that mode then you butcher it and you eat it and
[2:18:35.340 --> 2:18:39.060]  it's just what's what humans do I know you like to go buy it at the store and
[2:18:39.060 --> 2:18:44.780]  you know it's gonna wrapped up in plastic but now I'm digressing off into a
[2:18:44.780 --> 2:18:49.620]  bunch of other issues that really don't matter but that's where the V thing
[2:18:49.620 --> 2:18:54.540]  really originates with the British and then why it got picked up because I don't
[2:18:54.540 --> 2:18:57.260]  want to say it on air with children listening but it's kind of like the
[2:18:57.260 --> 2:19:02.740]  middle finger to the French whenever the French or others were invading the
[2:19:02.740 --> 2:19:08.340]  archers would you see it in Braveheart similar they would moon them that's a
[2:19:08.340 --> 2:19:12.100]  military thing that the British and Scots would do it was very insulting they
[2:19:12.100 --> 2:19:16.900]  would pull their pants down and then they would dangle their fingers in front
[2:19:16.900 --> 2:19:20.700]  of them their two fingers and just go we are gonna kill you we're good so I guess
[2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:24.940]  the media could spin that and say it's violent but I mean it as peaceful as v
[2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:28.740]  for victory against tyranny awakening and coming together I'm gonna talk about
[2:19:28.740 --> 2:19:32.700]  that towards the end of the hour I got to get into the really scary news I just
[2:19:32.700 --> 2:19:35.460]  want to be happy and have freedom I can't believe it I knew they were gonna
[2:19:35.460 --> 2:19:38.420]  do it give said he was and then he did in the state of the Union they have a

[2:24:23.540 --> 2:24:28.260]  but during the break the producers showed me an article on drudge and it's
[2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:32.140]  also on Fox News and it's calling it taking liberties in your face New
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:36.900]  Hampshire Supreme Court to decide if mother too religious to homeschool
[2:24:36.900 --> 2:24:40.540]  children you can't even have your own religion in this country there it is
[2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:46.220]  from the AP group asked court to consider removing girl from homeschool
[2:24:46.220 --> 2:24:50.900]  what a California rule three years ago I got overturned that parents do not have
[2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:55.940]  control their children that the state is the ultimate guardian and that
[2:24:55.940 --> 2:24:58.980]  homeschooling would then be illegal unless you have a teaching certificate
[2:24:58.980 --> 2:25:03.820]  and then would have to have approved curriculum now if you want to homeschool
[2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:06.500]  and don't want earth worship talk to your children that's the new religion in
[2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:10.620]  schools all over the country they're saying you're not allowed to teach
[2:25:10.620 --> 2:25:14.580]  Christianity to your children I mean you cannot make this up my children are
[2:25:14.580 --> 2:25:20.500]  homeschooled they're taught a Christian curriculum this has nothing to do with

[2:25:34.820 --> 2:25:41.780]  New Hampshire and they're trying to say that you can't teach your children what
[2:25:41.780 --> 2:25:47.420]  you want and teach things from a Christian perspective I mean I'm
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:50.900]  speechless but I'm not this is par for the course I mean look at this article

[2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:26.220]  the day before but Monday before the state of the Union he said yes the
[2:26:26.220 --> 2:26:30.780]  president will call for new gun legislation and then he didn't and NBC and

[2:27:00.900 --> 2:27:03.980]  weeks the administration will unveil a campaign to get Congress to toughen
[2:27:03.980 --> 2:27:08.820]  existing laws we already do an instant check and are registered in they're

[2:27:56.340 --> 2:27:59.940]  happening now's the time to put up or shut up and I mean that respectfully now's
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:04.700]  the time to use your power and your treasure and your name whoever you are
[2:28:04.700 --> 2:28:11.020]  to start speaking out or there's no future this is a scientific plan for
[2:28:11.020 --> 2:28:14.940]  authoritarian control it's publicly been deployed it's pretty much a Rand
[2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:18.380]  corporation CFR hybrid they've done it in the third world over and over again
[2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:22.900]  our government is illegitimate it has funded more than 50 times that we know
[2:28:22.900 --> 2:28:28.580]  of the overthrow of governments to put dictators in I mean that's what the
[2:28:28.580 --> 2:28:32.340]  people that run this country want so they can steal and get away with all the
[2:28:32.340 --> 2:28:38.580]  crimes they've already committed Arizona congressman Jeff Flake and Raul
[2:28:38.580 --> 2:28:42.260]  Garavelle bus sit next to the empty seat representative Gabrielle Giffords on
[2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:45.740]  Capitol Hill before Obama's recent state of the union well she's not anti-gun
[2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:49.180]  and the father of the poor little dead girl and the mommy have said don't use
[2:28:49.180 --> 2:28:53.340]  her death to take people's guns we've already lost so many rights after 9-11
[2:28:53.340 --> 2:28:57.220]  with the with the airports I have to travel and it's horrible what the TSA
[2:28:57.220 --> 2:29:01.700]  does that's the father they don't care they don't care we need to get the father
[2:29:01.700 --> 2:29:07.700]  and others now who don't want to politicize this to stand up and fight at
[2:29:07.700 --> 2:29:11.660]  the beginning of the state of the union address president Obama tipped his hat
[2:29:11.660 --> 2:29:14.980]  representative Gabrielle Giffords who's now recuperating he didn't tip his hat he
[2:29:14.980 --> 2:29:19.220]  said it's all good to have parties and arguments but then we got a congresswoman
[2:29:19.220 --> 2:29:24.620]  shot remember that when he quoted that the message was your guns caused this
[2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:28.580]  and they're gonna use Mexico you watch they're always trying to blame the guns
[2:29:28.580 --> 2:29:32.260]  from here on that when they're a small part of it and they know that the
[2:29:32.260 --> 2:29:35.220]  cartels are buying it internationally and buying it from the military they got
[2:29:35.220 --> 2:29:38.780]  fully auto they got rocket launchers you know they just caught a Navy SEAL a month
[2:29:38.780 --> 2:29:42.620]  ago trying to sell stuff to the Mexican cartel rocket launchers and grenades you
[2:29:42.620 --> 2:29:46.700]  don't buy that at the gun shop we need our guns to protect ourselves with this
[2:29:46.700 --> 2:29:50.060]  collapsing economy we'll be right back
[2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:57.580]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[2:29:57.580 --> 2:30:04.420]  network Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is
[2:30:04.420 --> 2:30:09.100]  over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find
[2:30:09.100 --> 2:30:13.340]  work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government
[2:30:13.340 --> 2:30:17.060]  employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse gold and
[2:30:17.060 --> 2:30:21.020]  silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey
[2:30:21.020 --> 2:30:24.540]  to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and

[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:58.900]  11 year old from a Christian perspective and it's just amazing to see this type of stuff going on in America where is where is America where has America gone we know where it's gone it's fallen to the new world order and by admitting that we have a
[2:37:58.900 --> 2:38:11.900]  world government upon us we can reverse what's happened by rediscovering the bill of rights culture rediscovering liberty and freedom but if we don't do that if we don't speak up see we have this image in our minds at least I see the media pushing it
[2:38:11.900 --> 2:38:22.900]  we're all fighting with each other it's left right black white old young north south east west and that if there was a solution to what's happening they never illustrate what the real problems are the mainstream media gives you false
[2:38:22.900 --> 2:38:31.900]  problems and gives you false solutions to give them more power and they also send out these archetypal images that you've got to have a hero that does it all for you
[2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:41.900]  and no it's all of us together doing little things every day that are going to save this republic and that message goes out around the world with great patriots that are fighting the globalist in the eugenics
[2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:59.900]  assist in chili mexico canada europe africa the middle east asia there are people everywhere standing up you know they have a top u n official came out in the last two days and say that you know there's evidence that
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:11.900]  nine eleven's an inside job and they're calling for his firing I mean this stuff is out there and there are citizens out there in groups fighting back against the court trying to force this woman to put her kid in public school
[2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:25.900]  so they're testing us they're trying to overwhelm us they're trying to wear us out they're trying to break our will but it's so incredible that they've introduced legislation same guy who's been out there supporting the emergency centers act
[2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:42.900]  New York republican peter king homeland security chairman for the democrats to see something say something campaign they want quote good citizens report suspicious activity not facing consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as extremist or terror
[2:39:42.900 --> 2:40:01.900]  and we get the training manuals ron paul stickers bob bar stickers in the fed type stuff it's just just just just unspeakable I mean I don't I don't have words to describe how serious this is and now we have newsweek today this is up on info wars dot com
[2:40:01.900 --> 2:40:14.900]  white house to push gun control Obama intentionally did not mention gun control in the state of the union yeah he did he said it's okay to have parties fight with each other until the congresswoman got shot that was the first thing he said the speech
[2:40:14.900 --> 2:40:20.900]  you can just pull up his speeches the first thing he said was demonizing the second amendment
[2:40:20.900 --> 2:40:35.900]  it's all well and good for us to argue and fight with each other until you see something like happen with the shootings in Tucson Arizona the tragedy there that fake voice he uses
[2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:41.900]  and we see everybody here sitting together that's what we need more of
[2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:55.900]  we sit down shut up follow their agenda as they launch the citizen spies and see they admitted in this article they talked to insiders at the wine house newsweek reports CBS reporting the same thing that they said well we didn't want to energize the the pro gunners we
[2:40:55.900 --> 2:41:08.900]  didn't want to make this a big public thing we understand how much anger there is yeah they know in polls now upwards of 70% or pro gun they're losing people are getting into guns all the liberals I know under bush started buying guns
[2:41:08.900 --> 2:41:20.900]  they're figuring out that it's about being free a slave is disarmed and so they're in trouble on their abortion agenda on their gun grabbing agenda on their North American Union agenda on their fluoride agenda on their war agenda
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:36.900]  what two weeks ago it was in the New York Times 76% of Americans want to end the Afghan war now and that's even a spun pole it's probably higher and what it gates the head of the defense department say secretary defense said we don't care what the people are saying
[2:41:36.900 --> 2:41:47.900]  you see it's not our country they're telling us this is going to continue even though I've had Colonel Anthony Shaver and countless other that have actually been over there saying our presence is making it worse
[2:41:47.900 --> 2:42:03.900]  but that's the plan create extremists that are angry it continues but throughout the hour long speech he never addressed the issue at the core of Giffords tragedy gun control
[2:42:03.900 --> 2:42:24.900]  and what lawmakers would or should do to reform American farm access laws and they're going to claim the government with no judge or jury you watch can just say you're mentally ill
[2:42:24.900 --> 2:42:42.900]  you know they've already been trying since under Clinton to just say that troops have PTSD when they don't and grandpa goes to buy his grandson a gun I've talked to grandpa's no criminal record and they say we're not going to tell you why but you can't buy guns no judge no jury it's like the no fly list which they want to be a no gun buy list
[2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:58.900]  they just put you on a list they're going to say they've got to ban the more than one purchase of a quote assault weapon at a time that's any semi automatic handgun or rifle or shotgun because I know what they've already been pushing I know what their agenda is you watch that's what's going to happen
[2:42:58.900 --> 2:43:10.900]  they're announcing these legislations coming they don't say what it is they just say oh so this stuff doesn't happen again and then every time there's a shooting they blame the second amendment and say more more more more more they can't stand it
[2:43:10.900 --> 2:43:25.900]  but now that they've got the instant check they have the instant denial with no proof now they want to codify that in the law and claim well we think you're an extremist or we think you're dangerous and they're also going to try to bring back in the assault weapons ban and ban many types of firearms
[2:43:25.900 --> 2:43:32.900]  I mean this is it this is the big gauntlet being thrown down declaration of war against liberty
[2:43:32.900 --> 2:43:42.900]  so there was no mention of gun control this was intentional according to the White House and administration officials as Obama didn't mention guns in his speech because of the omnipresent this is the one thing that wakes Americans up
[2:43:42.900 --> 2:43:56.900]  because of the omnipresent controversy surrounding the second amendment gun control Tuesday's speech was designed to be more about the economy yeah so they can keep robbing us and how as Obama repeated nine times the U.S. could win the future
[2:43:56.900 --> 2:44:07.900]  sit down shut up do what they say and it'll be alright but in the next two weeks the White House will unveil a new gun control effort in which it will urge Congress to strengthen current laws which now allow some
[2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:27.900]  many unstable people such as alleged Arizona shooter Jared Loeffner to obtain certain assault weapons a handgun in some cases without even a background check they did a background check on him that's a lie that he did the next Tuesday night after the speech
[2:44:27.900 --> 2:44:47.900]  Obama's advisor David Ploef said in NBC news that the president would not let the moment after Arizona shootings pass without pushing for some change in law to prevent another similar incident it's very important issue and one I know there's going to be to debate about on the hill
[2:44:47.900 --> 2:45:07.900]  and it just goes on from there and Kurt Nemo's got a report on this for dealing with it at info wars dot com giving you the real breakdown of what's happening on that front Obama deliver gun grabbing speech soon
[2:45:07.900 --> 2:45:18.900]  and you know I'll go a few weeks now without doing Google bombs on air which reach in some cases millions of new people always tens of thousands even if it's not a big success resistance is success
[2:45:18.900 --> 2:45:34.900]  but we launched one at the beginning of the broadcast from the article shocker citizen spy networks to be given immunity we want you to search the term citizen spy networks please continue doing that it should be number one in the next hour or so on Google
[2:45:34.900 --> 2:45:48.900]  trends then a lot of other media picks up on it reports on it and it links back to our stories or if you copy our stories your website to you I don't care I want the word to get out it's why I make expensive video productions and fly people around I got guys flying to Alaska right now
[2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:58.900]  because I'm in an info war I'm going to fight for liberty I don't have any future if we don't expose these people and the truth is the weapon in the info war
[2:45:58.900 --> 2:46:15.900]  but I want to do another search term and if you'll put that info wars dot com memo article back up I will I will extract a term from it and give that out as another search term that hopefully here in the third hour
[2:46:15.900 --> 2:46:29.900]  well we can get out there to everybody the article is Obama to deliver gun grabbing speech soon let's make gun grabbing number two search today we've already got one that's certainly going to be number one thanks to your efforts against the globalist gun
[2:46:29.900 --> 2:46:47.900]  grabbing g u n g r a b b i n g and that will lead them to everybody else that's got gun grabbing in their headlines that are anti victim disarmament and will lead them to our articles just another move against them gun grabbing gun grabbing in fact let's
[2:46:47.900 --> 2:47:03.900]  not just make a gun grabbing let's make it obama gun grabbing you can do three words obama gun grabbing search term obama you know how to spell Barry Sitaros fake name oba m a obama gun grabbing let's strike back now will it save us
[2:47:03.900 --> 2:47:23.900]  no but the overall resistance will resistances victory v for victory obama gun grabbing hit them and hit them hard now I had an epiphany Wednesday morning after watching obama's speech his state of the destruction of the union
[2:47:23.900 --> 2:47:33.900]  and that was the globalist have always hated this country they've hated it because it's an example of liberty private property the family the second amendment they hate it and they can take it over they're going to win
[2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:45.900]  now everybody knows that that simple but the epiphany or the deep understanding I was there in the shower and I was actually almost shaking with understanding and just the desire to warn people and resist and have victory against these people
[2:47:45.900 --> 2:47:58.900]  because I know we've got it in us if we just take action and it hit me they hate this country that's why they love stealing tens of trillions of dollars that's why they want another hundred trillion Bloomberg and AP reporting to the private bankers 100 trillion
[2:47:58.900 --> 2:48:15.900]  oh yeah we covered that yesterday those numbers are so incredible which they can then leverage against us but if they can't get our guns they can at least destroy our economy ship our jobs to China set up one way trade deals that destroy us they can at least poison our water
[2:48:15.900 --> 2:48:26.900]  they can at least dumb us down they can at least try to force vaccines on us they can at least turn our neighbors against us and turn us all against each other so we're all paranoid don't talk about politics like it's dirty and a bad word a chilling effect
[2:48:26.900 --> 2:48:42.900]  and that's why they're doing all of this these are control freaks who hate goodness who hate honor their criminals they need to protect what they've built what they've stolen and for anybody who is sitting on the fence don't forget Reuters Bloomberg last year
[2:48:42.900 --> 2:49:01.900]  we'll just put it on screen type it into the search engine great crew to such a wonderful job pulling the stuff up and give the exact headline insurance company made secret deal with veterans affairs to take death benefits 11 years ago this is a meeting with one big insurance company
[2:49:01.900 --> 2:49:13.900]  but the all the big ones got in there not just potential and they made a deal they said well we have troops paying in for death benefits if they die insurance we haven't signed up for we push on them can we just keep that money and they said yeah just take it
[2:49:13.900 --> 2:49:26.900]  but you'll have to do a procedure where you send them paperwork that tricks them when they sign it tell them they're about to get the money and then they don't get it veterans agency made secret deal over benefits I mean guys criminal pure scum
[2:49:26.900 --> 2:49:41.900]  last night I'm gonna come back and get into the really key issues but I think I'm gonna tell this story every day when I get gas or buy stuff at the corner store all these guys I've known for a couple years

[2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:18.900]  and I don't think that's inherently bad but they're gonna hurt them and use them I told them about Project Shad and how they nerve gas and spray the troops of radiation and kill them and the guy said well that's why we're that's why we're honorable we do it for our country and I said it's not honorable to have the government nerve gas troops with VX nerve gas
[2:50:18.900 --> 2:50:38.900]  see I mean you got these young 20 year old guys who think they're bulletproof and I think it's cute and funny to take experimental vaccines that's illegal to be used as guinea pigs to have chemical sprayed on them to have biological sprayed on them and the two guys he's gotten a sign up though they're always asking me questions down they're all freaked out
[2:50:38.900 --> 2:50:48.900]  and he's there like I'm trying to cut in on his bevy of girls or something that he's about to ship off to Shanghai just going oh they're gonna like it come on they're gonna like it
