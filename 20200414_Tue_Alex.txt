[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.240 --> 00:22.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a feeling today's Alex Jones show is going to be pivotal information
[00:22.800 --> 00:27.240]  dispersed today.
[00:27.240 --> 00:31.240]  Yeah, it will be important for you to hear this and share this, but most of it you already
[00:31.240 --> 00:39.880]  know it's going to be more pivotal for the White House to hear this, for President Trump
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.240]  to hear this, and understand it's time to make a move.
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.160]  The traders among us have been fully exposed.
[00:48.160 --> 00:53.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, now look, I'm going to tell you what's going on here at Info Wars
[00:53.920 --> 00:56.840]  today and what you could expect coming up.
[00:56.840 --> 01:05.080]  Alex Jones meant to take a short trip, get out of the hurricane for a minute, recharge
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.080]  the batteries.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.080]  We all need that.
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.720]  Quite frankly, I wish Alex could do it, but wild horses couldn't drag him away.
[01:11.720 --> 01:14.960]  They're actually dragging him back into studio.
[01:14.960 --> 01:21.040]  So Alex Jones is on his way back into studio and he's got breaking news.
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.520]  Now I don't even know what his breaking news is.
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.640]  I've been like a busy beaver last night and tonight with a lot of the new information
[01:29.640 --> 01:36.240]  that was coming in yesterday, but then this morning tying it into what we already know
[01:36.240 --> 01:42.240]  and then it was like, you know how when you're driving down a highway like six, seven in the
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.160]  morning and the fog is there, but the longer you drive and maybe you get the higher ground
[01:47.160 --> 01:53.280]  and then the fog clears and it's a beautiful sunny day and you can see the dew on the blades
[01:53.280 --> 02:01.040]  of grass and the crisp air with the sun beaming down.
[02:01.040 --> 02:12.840]  It was so clear to me and what I discovered with mainstream media, American academia and
[02:12.840 --> 02:21.400]  the Democrat Party, 110%, never been clearer, never been more exposed, Chinese communist
[02:21.400 --> 02:29.680]  agents at worst, colluding with the Chinese Communist Party at best, 110% connections
[02:29.680 --> 02:36.360]  have been made, it's all out there, deep state, fully exposed ties to China.
[02:36.360 --> 02:42.200]  And then I'm getting more intel coming in today that I'm trying to back check that not
[02:42.200 --> 02:49.560]  only are we sitting here watching the full rollout of Bill Gates, seven and a half billion
[02:49.560 --> 02:55.480]  vaccines for the whole world, everything goes on to his Zoom platform and how that all ties
[02:55.480 --> 03:06.920]  into China, but also how Fauci was using Bill and Melinda Gates models and Bill and Melinda
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.960]  Gates propaganda to roll out his entire response to this.
[03:11.960 --> 03:17.520]  And again, I'm checking on this, this would be breaking now, the White House is now pulling
[03:17.520 --> 03:23.560]  away from those models and using real time data, but that's probably going to be a story
[03:23.560 --> 03:27.200]  for tomorrow, quite frankly, the way this news is developing.
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.040]  But folks, they're not even hiding it anymore.
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.800]  Direct Democrat connections to the Chinese Communist Party fully exposed and they're
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.440]  still trying to go with it.
[03:40.440 --> 03:50.920]  You have media connections to the Chinese Communist Party fully exposed after yesterday's lambasting
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.520]  Scorchfest President Trump against the anti-American mainstream news.
[03:55.520 --> 04:08.520]  And then the ties from the Obama administration selling these bio weapon research viruses to
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.600]  the Chinese government.
[04:10.600 --> 04:12.880]  And I got it all right here, folks.
[04:12.880 --> 04:15.120]  I got it all tied together.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.560]  It cannot be denied.
[04:16.560 --> 04:18.280]  It's time for the president to take action.
[04:18.280 --> 04:23.760]  Now I'm going to do my due diligence and hopefully I can even get to that with whatever
[04:23.760 --> 04:31.240]  breaking news Alex Jones has coming up as well as he has canceled yet another trip to
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.200]  come in here and deliver the breaking news that he has for you today.
[04:36.200 --> 04:43.600]  But folks, the average American that wasn't involved in politics or red pilled or knew
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.360]  about any of this stuff is now looking squarely at Bill Gates, looking squarely at the CDC
[04:49.360 --> 04:59.240]  and the WHO and the Chinese Communist and their middle finger is starting to get exposed.
[04:59.240 --> 05:04.880]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.080]  the worst is that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[05:09.080 --> 05:12.240]  But I'll tell you this.
[05:12.240 --> 05:18.080]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[05:18.080 --> 05:19.080]  forms of media.
[05:19.080 --> 05:22.320]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.800]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.080]  and everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[05:31.080 --> 05:33.840]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[05:33.840 --> 05:38.920]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't, but it's up to all
[05:38.920 --> 05:42.800]  of us to not let them silence any of us.
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.840]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.720]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.720]  come.
[05:54.720 --> 06:02.840]  So be the polar veers you are.
[06:02.840 --> 06:08.240]  Thanks Jones here on this Tuesday, April 14th, Worldwide Broadcast, Owen Schreuer is
[06:08.240 --> 06:09.240]  about to take over.
[06:09.240 --> 06:11.920]  I'll be back in studio live next hour.
[06:11.920 --> 06:17.840]  But as predicted, the globalist takedown of the West in America is proceeding according
[06:17.840 --> 06:18.840]  to their plan.
[06:18.840 --> 06:25.840]  As we've been telling you since before, the artificial shutdown, when Trump tries to reopen
[06:25.840 --> 06:31.240]  the economy, the leftist controlled states of California, in New York and their satellite
[06:31.240 --> 06:39.280]  neighbors, their axis of blue state corruption, will then hold the states hostage and say
[06:39.280 --> 06:41.600]  we're not going to reopen.
[06:41.600 --> 06:50.160]  Major globalist corporations will also refuse to reopen along with blue cities in red states.
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.480]  This has been called an alliance of the West Coast and the East Coast.
[06:54.480 --> 07:02.920]  This is a globalist financed, globalist run civil war inside the United States.
[07:02.920 --> 07:04.080]  America was almost done.
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.080]  We've been sold out to China.
[07:05.080 --> 07:06.080]  We're industrialized.
[07:06.080 --> 07:08.880]  We're being set up for a race war.
[07:08.880 --> 07:09.880]  American people rally.
[07:09.880 --> 07:10.880]  We got Trump in.
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.560]  He turned the economy back on, showed people it was an artificial suppression.
[07:14.560 --> 07:18.240]  They tried to remove him as a Russian agent and as the Ukrainian corruption.
[07:18.240 --> 07:23.480]  And as impeachment they knew was failing, they launched COVID-19 that is a engineered
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.080]  bio weapon, but still not as deadly as they're saying it is.
[07:27.080 --> 07:30.960]  They know the trajectory of it and they know it will come back year after year so they're
[07:30.960 --> 07:35.680]  saying it's a permanent shutdown that has to be cycled by the global government, by
[07:35.680 --> 07:39.440]  the UN, by China that then set the parameters.
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.280]  And so when Governor Cuomo and Governor Newsom say we will not let politics but science decide,
[07:45.280 --> 07:52.160]  they're saying the NIH, Rumbabila Melinda Gates and the United Nations setting the precedent
[07:52.160 --> 07:58.400]  for the individuals that will decide and are the groups that will decide when and if you're
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.920]  ever able to leave your house or have your job again and they're all saying in unison,
[08:02.920 --> 08:06.520]  you must have the vaccine that's a year, year and a half out.
[08:06.520 --> 08:11.440]  You must have the vaccine before you're even allowed to basically operate freely.
[08:11.440 --> 08:15.760]  But big major corporations, they're allowed to stay open because they're essential.
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.160]  First they maneuvered us into being a post industrial country, a service economy.
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.280]  Now they're telling you the service economy does not exist.
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.240]  So the power to control the economy is the power to destroy.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.640]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.880]  And we are seeing America and the West brought to its knees by the globalists.
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.280]  How dare you want sovereignty?
[08:36.280 --> 08:38.160]  How dare you want prosperity?
[08:38.160 --> 08:40.680]  How dare you want all of this?
[08:40.680 --> 08:42.600]  How dare you not turn your guns in?
[08:42.600 --> 08:45.920]  How dare you not sterilize your sons?
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.120]  And so now they're moving ahead, the next phase will be trying to remove the president
[08:51.120 --> 08:54.720]  during the depression that they'll blame on him because he still doesn't control the
[08:54.720 --> 09:01.560]  Justice Department and they will then also accelerate the prosecution of talk show hosts
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.680]  and people loyal to the president.
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.840]  I've obviously been told, as I've been telling you the last few months, that I will be indicted
[09:07.840 --> 09:13.640]  by federal and state grand juries in the near future.
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.320]  I've been told you will roll over against Trump or we will destroy you either with these
[09:18.320 --> 09:22.120]  lawsuits or we will find a way to indict you.
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.200]  And Democrats walks me in the street and they go, you're going to get arrested because these
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.280]  are authoritarian folks and they can have a grand jury indict a hand sandwich.
[09:31.280 --> 09:37.240]  So understand they think you're cowards and they think that when you see talk show hosts
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.840]  indicted and you see more Trump supporters like Senator Paul with his ribs kicked in
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.240]  and you see Congressman Scalise shot up at that baseball game and you're going to see
[09:47.240 --> 09:49.960]  a lot more of that by the left.
[09:49.960 --> 09:58.680]  They think that as all of that unfolds, that you're just going to roll over in total abject
[09:58.680 --> 10:00.080]  fear.
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.280]  They think you're a bunch of cowards and then you're going to be overwhelmed by the quote
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.240]  authorities at the UN, the World Health Organization, telling you when you can leave your house
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.320]  and what you can do and then as you see the tyranny roll in behind this that you'll stand
[10:14.320 --> 10:23.480]  down during the unending crisis, the unending emergency that with it carries a depression.
[10:23.480 --> 10:29.960]  But you see those that are loyal to the bureaucracy controlled by the foreign megabanks and the
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.320]  bureaucrats the UN backed up by the industrial giant China, you will still have your jobs
[10:35.320 --> 10:42.360]  for now because you will subserve, you will, you will bow, you will grovel like good slaves
[10:42.360 --> 10:48.000]  and then we're off the edge of the cliff and real tyranny and the Venezuelanization, the
[10:48.000 --> 10:56.480]  North Koreaization, the Chai Khanization, the Sovietization, the true tyranny can begin.
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.560]  So make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, read the headlines for yourself, States Unite
[11:01.560 --> 11:10.040]  on Reopening Economies, perfect double-speak from NPR, Science, not Politics, will guide
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.160]  decisions, the scientific dictatorship that Eisenhower warned of that tells you the way
[11:15.160 --> 11:16.160]  it is.
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.720]  The governors of New York and California, two of the largest economies in the U.S. have
[11:20.720 --> 11:28.680]  formed alliances with respective alliances with states and neighbors to coordinate an
[11:28.680 --> 11:35.040]  eventual easing of COVID-19 shutdowns, posing a new political obstacle to President Trump's
[11:35.040 --> 11:38.200]  plans to restart the national economy.
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.200]  That's right, the president isn't in charge, the globalists and the UN, the WHO and Fauci
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.320]  that literally engineered the bio weapon that literally under Obama allowed us to transfer
[11:49.320 --> 11:50.320]  to China.
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.320]  That's mainstream news.
[11:51.320 --> 11:53.160]  Now, China's come on and said, don't blame us.
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.800]  Obama and the NIH and Fauci gave it to us 2012, 2015.
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.600]  If we don't listen to the very people that are holding us hostage, if we don't listen
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.680]  to the very people that have taken over our society, well, then the economy will never
[12:05.680 --> 12:06.680]  reopen.
[12:06.680 --> 12:12.120]  With separate announcements, the governor said they agreed to let science, not politics,
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.640]  determine when to lift the social and business restrictions.
[12:16.640 --> 12:22.800]  Any plan to reopen society must be driven by data and experts and not opinion and policies
[12:22.800 --> 12:27.040]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, and of course Newsom said the exact same thing.
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.480]  Of course, remember that Cuomo just came out a couple days ago and said that all the projections
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.640]  were wrong and were 9, 10, 15 times higher than what's really died.
[12:37.640 --> 12:38.880]  But they don't care.
[12:38.880 --> 12:42.880]  They're still going ahead with all this, even if it was 100,000 dead by now, we shouldn't
[12:42.880 --> 12:44.640]  allow the total shutdown as unconstitutional.
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.520]  And the First Amendment violations shut down the churches.
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.040]  But that's where all this is going, so America is fighting for its very heart, fighting for
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.040]  its very soul.
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.120]  I'm going to play the Cuomo clip here in a moment, but first I'm going to play Bill
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.280]  Gates saying just a few days ago that we're going to vaccinate everybody on the planet.
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.960]  That's going to hurt in Maine and you know, obviously kill 700,000 people.
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.920]  So it'll leave government to indemnify the companies and corporations to carry out the
[13:12.920 --> 13:13.920]  inoculations.
[13:13.920 --> 13:17.840]  So they're telling you, they're coming at you with his numbers of a vaccine that only
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.440]  hurts one in 10,000, anybody that's had vaccines knows that it hurts a lot of people and lowers
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.440]  everybody's immunity and has a lot of Trojan horse garbage added to it.
[13:26.440 --> 13:28.840]  So this is a tyrannical takeover.
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.200]  I am proud to have stood against these individuals.
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.000]  I am proud to have stood against their takeover.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.640]  We've rallied a lot of people together and I salute the listeners and I say God bless
[13:39.640 --> 13:40.640]  you all.
[13:40.640 --> 13:44.640]  But these are the times that try men's souls, so please pray for him for worse.
[13:44.640 --> 13:46.280]  Please pray for myself and the crew.
[13:46.280 --> 13:47.280]  Please pray for America.
[13:47.280 --> 13:48.760]  Please pray for President Trump.
[13:48.760 --> 13:49.760]  Trump is the real deal.
[13:49.760 --> 13:53.640]  He's totally surrounded, the globalists created the fear.
[13:53.640 --> 13:55.600]  He tried to back it down.
[13:55.600 --> 13:56.600]  People wouldn't listen.
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.200]  He tried reasonable restrictions on China.
[13:58.200 --> 13:59.200]  They didn't want that.
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.480]  No, they want to sell us all being personally locked down on our homes, living under these
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.480]  tyrants.
[14:05.480 --> 14:06.480]  You wanted martial law, folks.
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.480]  You got it.
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.480]  All you left is the wanted tyranny.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.480]  You got it.
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.400]  And it means depression and poverty and true sadness and America can only come up from here.
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.880]  We've got to start saying no to this mind control.
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.320]  We've got to start saying no to the endless emergency, the permanent martial law.
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.520]  We've got to find our soul again and find out who we are and find our courage.
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.320]  They can't take you all down.
[14:28.320 --> 14:30.320]  They can't arrest you all.
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.360]  While they let the murderers and rapists out of jails and try to put the patriots in jail,
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.040]  they can't intimidate everybody and somebody's got to stand up to them.
[14:38.040 --> 14:39.040]  And I'm not intimidated.
[14:39.040 --> 14:41.840]  I'm going to do the right thing until the end and I will not be silenced.
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.720]  I will expose the deep state to produce this bio weapon and transfer it to China to do exactly
[14:46.720 --> 14:47.720]  what they're doing now.
[14:47.720 --> 14:50.080]  I plan to do this whether Trump got in or not.
[14:50.080 --> 14:51.080]  This was the takedown.
[14:51.080 --> 14:52.080]  This was the global government.
[14:52.080 --> 14:54.000]  This was the worldwide medical tyranny.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.040]  Everything we exposed, please, please, please take action.
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.840]  Please don't ever want to tune in right now.
[14:59.840 --> 15:02.760]  This is the modern Paul Revere transmission.
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.680]  And if you're watching and listening, you are the hope.
[15:04.680 --> 15:05.680]  You are the future.
[15:05.680 --> 15:07.520]  You are the resistance.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.880]  You are the spirit of 1776.
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.480]  The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge.
[15:14.480 --> 15:19.520]  You know, it turns out the flu vaccine isn't that effective in older people.
[15:19.520 --> 15:26.120]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk
[15:26.120 --> 15:27.120]  of that.
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.520]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.920]  side effects.
[15:33.920 --> 15:43.520]  You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know, way more 700,000
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.280]  you know, people who will suffer from that and that actual decision of, OK, let's go
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.680]  and give this vaccine to the entire world.
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.560]  Governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.560]  needed.
[15:57.560 --> 16:01.320]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[16:57.640 --> 17:02.200]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:02.200 --> 17:04.120]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:04.120 --> 17:05.800]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:05.800 --> 17:11.280]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:11.280 --> 17:12.400]  my life.
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.640]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[17:59.640 --> 18:06.520]  The ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[18:06.520 --> 18:10.240]  that could possibly hurt them, and that's the globalist plan.
[18:10.240 --> 18:14.840]  And now, Mr. Fauci at the NIH, last night in the press conference standing right next
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.320]  to the president, said, we're going to have a global lockdown because he talked to world
[18:19.320 --> 18:27.120]  leaders until not one more person is dying or one more person is infected.
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.760]  The video is posted on infowards.com.
[18:29.760 --> 18:34.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu.
[18:34.560 --> 18:37.080]  Not one person can die from a cold.
[18:37.080 --> 18:41.880]  Everyone will be surveilled in live time by their cell phones and apps and drones and
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.560]  an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny.
[18:45.560 --> 18:49.680]  And remember, it's a big pharma that has on the level four bio weapons labs that keeps
[18:49.680 --> 18:52.280]  leaking all these man-made viruses.
[18:52.280 --> 18:53.800]  They're holding us all hostage.
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.320]  Oh, and he talked about forced inoculations.
[18:58.320 --> 19:05.280]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[19:05.280 --> 19:09.480]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[19:09.480 --> 19:13.920]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[19:13.920 --> 19:19.360]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[19:19.360 --> 19:22.680]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[20:02.120 --> 20:23.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.560 --> 20:32.640]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:32.640 --> 20:41.040]  What a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:41.040 --> 20:54.120]  The enemies of America have been fully exposed and they've exposed themselves by fighting
[20:54.120 --> 21:02.000]  back or trying to stymie or stop this American Revolution 2.0 that's happening, this resurgence
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.240]  of patriotism under President Donald Trump that's happening, this re-ignition of the
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.640]  U.S. economy under President Trump, they're trying to stop all of it, they've pulled
[21:12.640 --> 21:20.040]  out all the stops, and now they've been fully exposed.
[21:20.040 --> 21:31.480]  And I'm about to lay out for you how academia, media, and politics have all been corrupted
[21:31.480 --> 21:37.480]  by the Chinese communists and it's sitting right in front of our face and we have at
[21:37.480 --> 21:44.600]  least one senator who is ready and willing to act.
[21:44.600 --> 21:57.680]  But let's take a look at this, cut and dry, how Chinese agents are trying to manipulate
[21:57.680 --> 22:04.840]  the will and the fate of the United States of America.
[22:04.840 --> 22:11.440]  Let's start in politics with Adam Schiff.
[22:11.440 --> 22:21.560]  Now we all know Adam Schiff, the dirtbag, pencil-necked demon, fraud liar who is friends
[22:21.560 --> 22:30.000]  with Ed Buck who has a rape drug orgy where dead men turn up, yeah, Adam Schiff hangs
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.560]  out with that guy.
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.920]  Yes, the Adam Schiff that made up Russian collusion, yes, the Adam Schiff that has committed
[22:36.920 --> 22:43.920]  every fiber of his being to destroying America and President Trump, well, Adam Schiff has
[22:43.920 --> 22:50.160]  now fully exposed himself, ladies and gentlemen, let me explain.
[22:50.160 --> 22:54.840]  Headline from Michael Izikoff, now again, it's key to know all these names and players.
[22:54.840 --> 22:56.200]  Who is Michael Izikoff?
[22:56.200 --> 23:01.960]  Deep state agent working inside the media for decades, spiked the Monica Lewinsky story
[23:01.960 --> 23:09.680]  for the Clintons, started the Russian collusion story which was then used to get a FISA warrant.
[23:09.680 --> 23:12.520]  Yes, same guy.
[23:12.520 --> 23:17.840]  And then he publishes this for Yahoo just, I think two days ago or even yesterday, Adam
[23:17.840 --> 23:25.160]  Schiff says intelligence committee may conduct Zoom hearings during coronavirus pandemic.
[23:25.160 --> 23:26.360]  So what is Adam Schiff saying?
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.320]  Well, we can't meet in person, we shut down everything and we're making people social
[23:30.320 --> 23:31.320]  distance.
[23:31.320 --> 23:32.720]  We have digital meetings on Zoom.
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.720]  Well, what is Zoom?
[23:33.720 --> 23:37.720]  Of course, it's a Microsoft product that Bill Gates is now pushing to further enrich himself
[23:37.720 --> 23:45.760]  and empower himself in his attempt at a 100% totalitarian surveillance grid.
[23:45.760 --> 23:55.560]  But so why now is Adam Schiff shifting intelligence committee meetings to the Zoom platform?
[23:55.560 --> 24:03.040]  Well, let me go through a series of headlines here that are all actually from before Adam
[24:03.040 --> 24:05.080]  Schiff's announcement.
[24:05.080 --> 24:13.000]  So Adam Schiff made this announcement after all of this has already been exposed.
[24:13.000 --> 24:21.000]  Chinese spies are trying to snoop on Zoom conversations, US Intel experts say.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.840]  Zoom under fire for security vulnerabilities ties to China.
[24:25.840 --> 24:30.760]  Zoom CEO acknowledges security missteps in live streams.
[24:30.760 --> 24:37.840]  Zoom encryption not suited for secrets has surprising links to China researchers discover.
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.000]  Zoom security fears prompt Taiwan government ban.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.680]  So it's been banned in Taiwan, which China is trying to take over right now.
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.480]  Zoom is giving paid users more control over where their calls are routed after it got
[24:49.480 --> 24:54.080]  slammed for mistakenly using data centers in China.
[24:54.080 --> 25:00.080]  Now again, post all of that.
[25:00.080 --> 25:05.720]  Adam Schiff says the intelligence committee will be conducting Zoom hearings during the
[25:05.720 --> 25:07.920]  coronavirus pandemic.
[25:07.920 --> 25:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Schiff is openly trying to host US intelligence classified
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.280]  meetings with China in the room.
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.040]  Now I'd like to get up here and start screaming and shouting and smashing things because this
[25:23.040 --> 25:29.200]  is open treason against this country by Adam Schiff committed again and he hasn't faced
[25:29.200 --> 25:30.960]  a single day in jail.
[25:30.960 --> 25:33.360]  He deserves to rot in jail.
[25:33.360 --> 25:34.880]  His corpse rotting.
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.200]  He doesn't deserve a funeral.
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.520]  He doesn't deserve a burial.
[25:37.520 --> 25:38.720]  He doesn't deserve water.
[25:38.720 --> 25:39.920]  He doesn't deserve food.
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.520]  He deserves to sit in a cell and rot until he's dead.
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.040]  And here he is showing you his true colors, folks, because you see Adam Schiff has nothing
[25:50.040 --> 25:51.160]  left to lose.
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.360]  He's already been exposed as an anti-American agent with the Russian collusion investigation,
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.520]  the total hoax that he knowingly went along with his connections to Ed Buck and his little
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.800]  drug dungeon, drug sex dungeon where people turn up dead.
[26:05.800 --> 26:07.760]  Adam Schiff has nothing left to lose.
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.520]  He's openly showing you he's an agent of China.
[26:10.520 --> 26:17.040]  He's openly trying to have meetings with China in the room.
[26:17.040 --> 26:19.120]  Let's move on.
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.240]  Now we're going to go back in time, but it's very important to make these connections now.
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.000]  Remember Chinese researcher tried to smuggle biological material out of US.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.680]  That is Zhang Xiaosong back in December.
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.440]  Who is a Xiaosong connected with?
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.960]  A university professor and two Chinese nationals charged in three separate Chinese related
[26:40.960 --> 26:41.960]  cases.
[26:41.960 --> 26:42.960]  That was in January.
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.480]  Dr. Charles Lieber of Harvard, who was working with China, working with Obama, and working
[26:49.480 --> 26:58.840]  with them studying and testing with the COVID virus, the bat virus, he's been arrested.
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.960]  Even Snopes basically is admitting, was Charles Lieber arrested for selling COVID-19 coronavirus
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.640]  to China?
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.360]  This is only defense, they're saying yes he was arrested, yes he was transferring biological
[27:09.360 --> 27:17.800]  material, but we don't know that the COVID-19 came from a bat.
[27:17.800 --> 27:19.600]  But they already knew all this, folks.
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.600]  Remember Fauci in 2017 saying Trump will face a global pandemic?
[27:24.600 --> 27:30.560]  Well the US State Department warned of potential SARS-like pandemic after visiting Wuhan lab
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.040]  experimenting with bat coronavirus.
[27:33.040 --> 27:39.080]  Now let's continue down this line, so there you go, Harvard, Chinese agent, transferring
[27:39.080 --> 27:42.560]  biological materials, already been arrested.
[27:42.560 --> 27:47.160]  But here's the Obama-Fauci deep state connection.
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.520]  Fauci's NIAID funded Wuhan lab scientists to research bat coronavirus.
[27:52.520 --> 27:54.680]  All the data is published.
[27:54.680 --> 28:01.400]  Here's even the statement and the data from the official NIH website from October 16, 2014
[28:01.400 --> 28:07.400]  under Obama, statement on funding pause on certain types of gain of function research.
[28:07.400 --> 28:10.760]  What did we have Dr. Francis Boyle talking about back in January?
[28:10.760 --> 28:15.840]  Gain of function in this bioweapon lab made virus.
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.840]  And so that all happened, US government gave 3.7 million grant to Wuhan lab that experimented
[28:20.840 --> 28:25.440]  on coronavirus source bats and they can deny it, but it became a national story at the
[28:25.440 --> 28:26.720]  time, very controversial.
[28:26.720 --> 28:29.800]  That's why the NIH published this story.
[28:29.800 --> 28:32.160]  Here were some of the headlines at the time.
[28:32.160 --> 28:38.360]  Lab made coronavirus triggers debate, engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research.
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.200]  So you see the players, you see the game, you see the Chinese connection, you see the
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.320]  treason and the anti-American agenda right in front of your eyes.
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.640]  It's all exposed.
[28:48.640 --> 28:50.080]  Will Trump act?
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.240]  Josh Halley, senator from Missouri is ready to act.
[28:53.240 --> 28:56.040]  We are ready to act, but that's not all the Chinese connections.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.320]  They're in the mainstream media too.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.320]  That's next.
[28:58.320 --> 28:59.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:03.240 --> 29:04.800]  I sued the IRS in one.
[29:04.800 --> 29:07.760]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:07.760 --> 29:11.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[29:11.040 --> 29:13.280]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[29:13.280 --> 29:14.600]  I can help you too.
[29:14.600 --> 29:17.600]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[29:17.600 --> 29:19.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[29:19.840 --> 29:27.800]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[29:27.800 --> 29:33.160]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[29:33.160 --> 29:34.160]  the world.
[29:34.160 --> 29:37.200]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[29:37.200 --> 29:43.160]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[29:43.160 --> 29:46.960]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[29:46.960 --> 29:47.960]  Was there ever a vote?
[29:47.960 --> 29:49.520]  Who do we fight for?
[29:49.520 --> 29:56.080]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[29:56.080 --> 29:59.400]  at Amazon Books.
[29:59.400 --> 30:04.680]  It's staggering to realize that the real COVID target is not a complete view and nobody's
[30:04.680 --> 30:05.680]  pointed out.
[30:05.680 --> 30:11.480]  Even the U.N. that's hyping all this hysteria admits that half a million people have gone
[30:11.480 --> 30:17.680]  from extreme poverty to borderline starvation just the last two months and that 2 million
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.360]  plus people will starve to death extra this year.
[30:21.360 --> 30:27.360]  You know, I mentioned it to a colleague who cares, but they said, oh, it never got wholeway
[30:27.360 --> 30:28.360]  starving?
[30:28.360 --> 30:32.360]  That's the reality of what's happened when we fred over a few hundred thousand dead
[30:32.360 --> 30:33.360]  in the West.
[30:33.360 --> 30:37.400]  Millions and millions and millions with a shutdown on this economy are conscripted to
[30:37.400 --> 30:43.360]  a slow agonizing death by starvation and nobody's putting that talking point out because that's
[30:43.360 --> 30:44.360]  reality.
[30:44.360 --> 30:47.360]  Big pharma and big tech are involved in the takeover.
[30:47.360 --> 30:51.360]  They're using our phobias for control, and that's the bottom line.
[30:51.360 --> 30:58.360]  Anybody who signs on this is in the vast death of the global population, so choose a sign.
[30:58.360 --> 31:08.360]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[31:08.360 --> 31:16.960]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[31:16.960 --> 31:23.960]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[31:23.960 --> 31:24.960]  in males.
[31:24.960 --> 31:30.960]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[31:30.960 --> 31:35.960]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[31:35.960 --> 31:43.200]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[31:43.200 --> 31:48.200]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[31:48.200 --> 31:49.200]  So what are you waiting for?
[31:49.200 --> 31:51.200]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[31:51.200 --> 31:54.200]  Never been a better time than right now.
[31:54.200 --> 31:59.200]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:59.200 --> 32:02.200]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[32:02.200 --> 32:06.200]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word,
[32:06.200 --> 32:10.200]  if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[32:10.200 --> 32:11.200]  But you get that.
[32:11.200 --> 32:13.200]  You are patriots.
[32:13.200 --> 32:17.200]  You are people that live and work in the real world of erase color and create and understand
[32:17.200 --> 32:18.200]  what's happening.
[32:18.200 --> 32:21.200]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[32:21.200 --> 32:23.200]  Thank you for what you've done.
[32:23.200 --> 32:24.200]  We're all of this together.
[32:24.200 --> 32:26.200]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[32:26.200 --> 32:27.200]  We believe in families.
[32:27.200 --> 32:28.200]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[32:28.200 --> 32:32.200]  We believe in capitalism and America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[32:32.200 --> 32:34.200]  And we believe in free speech.
[32:34.200 --> 32:39.200]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're
[32:39.200 --> 32:40.200]  doing does everything in the world.
[32:40.200 --> 32:45.200]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this
[32:45.200 --> 32:47.200]  whole planet sewn up by now.
[32:47.200 --> 32:48.200]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[32:48.200 --> 32:49.200]  They thought they would have won.
[32:49.200 --> 32:53.200]  But they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[32:53.200 --> 33:20.200]  So God bless you all.
[33:24.200 --> 33:31.200]  Facing the greatest threat since our founding and the Civil War, the United States is now
[33:31.200 --> 33:35.200]  in a form of high tech civil war.
[33:35.200 --> 33:40.200]  It's soft but being escalated and turned up now.
[33:40.200 --> 33:46.200]  This is a multinational corporate criminal takeover between the Chai comms, the EU, the
[33:46.200 --> 33:51.200]  corrupt blue states, the cities with major global corporations and big tech surveilling
[33:51.200 --> 33:54.200]  the population with AI control.
[33:54.200 --> 33:58.200]  This is a mass breaking of the American people's will.
[33:58.200 --> 34:00.200]  They want you to submit and roll over.
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.200]  If you roll over, it will only get worse.
[34:04.200 --> 34:07.200]  Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday.
[34:07.200 --> 34:10.200]  This is a new world war.
[34:10.200 --> 34:14.200]  This is next-generational warfare.
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.200]  The criminals engaged in this believe you're weak and believe they can break your will.
[34:19.200 --> 34:21.200]  We can defeat them.
[34:21.200 --> 34:23.200]  But this is the main assault.
[34:23.200 --> 34:25.200]  President Trump is the target.
[34:25.200 --> 34:27.200]  President Trump is the target.
[34:27.200 --> 34:32.200]  Once he's removed, they are going to clamp down full martial law forever and release
[34:32.200 --> 34:35.200]  even more deadly viruses.
[34:35.200 --> 34:37.200]  This is the truth.
[34:37.200 --> 34:39.200]  This is the reality.
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.200]  And the credibility of IPFOL wars, reading globalist documents on air is so high, they
[34:43.200 --> 34:46.200]  are not going to allow us to be on air much longer.
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.200]  America must let Congress, the courts and the state governors know an alliance of the
[34:51.200 --> 34:56.200]  people, an alliance of the republic must be formed against the globalists that seek to
[34:56.200 --> 34:59.200]  end the republic and the nation's very existence.
[34:59.200 --> 35:04.200]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is my emergency message to the people of the world, the president
[35:04.200 --> 35:06.200]  and the people of America.
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.200]  And those in the government must now choose which side they're on.
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.200]  It's here, toe-to-toe with the new world order, toe-to-toe with the globalist.
[35:15.200 --> 35:23.200]  The United States is now under soft martial law being carried out by the NIH, the World
[35:23.200 --> 35:29.200]  Health Organization, the United Nations, the blue cities in blue states.
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.200]  The alliance that's been announced by the West and East Coast against Trump and against
[35:34.200 --> 35:40.200]  the flyover country is a giant criminal power grab.
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.200]  They have full-page articles of the New York Times saying Trump's crazy because he's
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.200]  questioned the NIH saying we need this giant lockdown when it turns out their projections
[35:51.200 --> 35:56.200]  were way overblown and that they themselves have been intimately involved in the level
[35:56.200 --> 36:03.200]  four bioweapons labs that transferred this very virus and systems to the communist Chinese.
[36:03.200 --> 36:11.200]  The globalist want total submission and they are about to move against President Trump
[36:11.200 --> 36:15.200]  because he's trying to block the permanent shutdown and the depression.
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.200]  America is under economic siege.
[36:18.200 --> 36:24.200]  I can tell you that Fox News is now turning against President Trump and different major
[36:24.200 --> 36:30.200]  talk show hosts on Fox News are so loyal to America and common sense are being threatened
[36:30.200 --> 36:33.200]  and not just threatened with their jobs.
[36:33.200 --> 36:36.200]  They're being threatened with more than that.
[36:36.200 --> 36:41.200]  The globalists are making their move to take down the country forever.
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.200]  They are devastating flyover country while keeping the mega corporations open.
[36:46.200 --> 36:50.200]  It is time to contact Governor Abbott.
[36:50.200 --> 36:54.200]  It is time to contact President Trump and other patriot governors and they must form
[36:54.200 --> 37:00.200]  a public alliance against the chai comms and against the globalist in Hollywood and the
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.200]  leftist governors who are enemies of the republic ladies and gentlemen.
[37:05.200 --> 37:12.200]  First they denied there was a problem with the virus to lull Trump into a sense of complacency.
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.200]  Then they announced it was the end of the world and demanded he clamp total controls on.
[37:17.200 --> 37:20.200]  When you went along with that they said okay you've done a good job.
[37:20.200 --> 37:24.200]  Now they're going to move into the phase of saying he's done a terrible job and needs to
[37:24.200 --> 37:28.200]  be removed from office and they're going to then go after everybody.
[37:28.200 --> 37:32.200]  They're going to get your second amendment, your children, everything.
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.200]  And again I'm not at liberty to tell you what's going on behind the scenes ladies and gentlemen.
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.200]  But in the last few months I've broken it down here that the globalists are pissed and they're
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.200]  mad that all their fake lawsuits against us are failing so they run fake news saying that
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.200]  they're winning or not so now they're going to move into other realms.
[37:50.200 --> 37:54.200]  And that's okay because I've understood what the globalists are up to.
[37:54.200 --> 37:59.200]  I've understood their operations and I've known what I was getting into fighting these
[37:59.200 --> 38:00.200]  tyrants and monsters.
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.200]  So it's not about Alex Jones, it's about all of us.
[38:03.200 --> 38:05.200]  Here's my message to the president.
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.200]  Mr. President, your instincts are dead on.
[38:08.200 --> 38:11.200]  You've done a great job fighting these people but you haven't had enough folks that had
[38:11.200 --> 38:14.200]  courage around you to carry out the restoration of the republic.
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.200]  But you got the economy restarted, you showed the people that globalism was an artificial
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.200]  system meant to shut us down.
[38:22.200 --> 38:27.200]  So now they're involved in total economic warfare and siege against the republic and this
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.200]  country is facing its greatest threat since its founding of the Civil War.
[38:31.200 --> 38:38.200]  We are in the middle of a world war, an economic cultural war, and they're using
[38:38.200 --> 38:47.200]  warfare and they're using seized areas of the Justice Department and to carry out these
[38:47.200 --> 38:48.200]  operations.
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.200]  Just as I warned in the last few years they would do that their next phase when Russia
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.200]  Gate failed would be to use the southern district of New York and the feds, to again
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.200]  go after the president, but these folks are not feds.
[39:02.200 --> 39:07.200]  On the east coast, a place like Boston, the feds protected Whitey Bulger who carried out
[39:07.200 --> 39:08.200]  wars for them.
[39:08.200 --> 39:13.200]  It's the same thing in New York and they want to project that tyranny they already have
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.200]  over those areas to the rest of the country and so now with allied criminals inside the
[39:17.200 --> 39:23.200]  federal government, allied criminals inside state governments in blue city areas and
[39:23.200 --> 39:29.200]  blue state areas, they are moving with their blockade against the constitutional republic.
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.200]  America, rolling over to this will only get you enslaved and destroyed.
[39:34.200 --> 39:39.200]  President Trump, you must come out like you did, your instincts are right last week and
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.200]  expose the WHO as being communist Chinese hell.
[39:42.200 --> 39:47.200]  You must expose Diane Feinstein, the communist Chinese agents inside her Senate offices.
[39:47.200 --> 39:54.200]  You must hit them with everything you've got yourself now and expose that they are globalist
[39:54.200 --> 39:56.200]  working to destroy the country.
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.200]  You must devastate them with the truth now or they are going to trigger a hot civil war.
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.200]  This is their plan and they try to drive you from office hoping your cabinet is scared
[40:07.200 --> 40:10.200]  and being threatened behind the scenes so that they will stand down.
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.200]  I think your cabinet is smart enough to understand that you finally got some decent people in.
[40:14.200 --> 40:16.200]  They can't play both sides of this.
[40:16.200 --> 40:20.200]  They have to join with the republic and they have to do the right thing and have courage.
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.200]  I have courage, our listeners have courage, the American people have courage and they
[40:24.200 --> 40:30.200]  stand with you President Trump and I stand with you no matter what they are doing to
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.200]  myself and my family behind the scenes that of course obviously will soon be revealed
[40:34.200 --> 40:35.200]  to the world.
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.200]  I understand the cost and I know what our forbearers had to go through and what our
[40:39.200 --> 40:44.200]  veterans had to fight and die for and so I've done the best job I could trying to mobilize
[40:44.200 --> 40:50.200]  the American people and they now are moving against me to ensure that I won't be there
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.200]  when they try to take you down in the next three to six months.
[40:54.200 --> 40:59.200]  This is the real coup, the global civil war being launched against America by the axis
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.200]  of evil, communist China, the EU, Hollywood in the blue states and captured blue cities
[41:05.200 --> 41:08.200]  are now throwing their full force against us.
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.200]  Everybody pray for America, pray for President Trump, pray for a global awakening and pray
[41:12.200 --> 41:13.200]  for him full wars.
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.200]  I now challenge faithfully defending the constitutional republicans enemies far and
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.200]  domestic, faithfully trying to help people be prepared for what's happening and I trust
[41:22.200 --> 41:28.200]  in God and put my providence in God and I turn things over to God now and recommit my life
[41:28.200 --> 41:34.200]  more than ever that my life is in God's hands and I commit my destiny into God's hands and
[41:34.200 --> 41:36.200]  his son Jesus Christ.
[41:36.200 --> 41:38.200]  God bless and good luck.
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.200]  So we've seen the connections ladies and gentlemen with the Democrat Party and Diane Feinstein
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.200]  and her Chinese by openly acting for China.
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.200]  We've seen it on social media where they censor American communications but promote Chinese
[41:50.200 --> 41:51.200]  propaganda.
[41:51.200 --> 41:56.200]  Now if being exposed in the media you see some of these media members during the press
[41:56.200 --> 42:00.200]  meetings heckling President Trump, trying to get under his skin, attacking him, making
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.200]  him look weak and bad.
[42:02.200 --> 42:08.200]  He wins every time but he shows a video montage of all the fake news media back months ago
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.200]  saying oh don't worry about the coronavirus nothing to see here then they tell him wow
[42:11.200 --> 42:18.200]  it's your fault thousands died but then Paula Reed one of the news hags heckling President
[42:18.200 --> 42:20.200]  Trump has been totally exposed.
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.200]  She is married to a Chinese government operative.
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.200]  Yes, can you believe it?
[42:27.200 --> 42:37.200]  Paula Reed from CBS married to a known Chinese government operative and an agent of China
[42:37.200 --> 42:42.200]  in DC and you look at him you look at her and you say yeah I think we know why she married
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.200]  that guy and is now working in the White House but the scary part is the scariest part is
[42:47.200 --> 42:48.200]  this folks.
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.200]  China takes advantage of USS Roosevelt being crippled by coronavirus and sends jets close
[42:54.200 --> 42:55.200]  to Taiwan.
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.200]  Wow was that a strategic move?
[42:58.200 --> 43:02.200]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[43:02.200 --> 43:08.200]  The success is simple versus that if you're paying attention you know we've done together
[43:08.200 --> 43:15.200]  but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying
[43:15.200 --> 43:21.200]  to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.200]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.200]  and everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true so it's
[43:30.200 --> 43:35.200]  now that your credibility is way up the power structures of the silence those of us that
[43:35.200 --> 43:41.200]  they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[43:41.200 --> 43:47.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[43:47.200 --> 43:52.200]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't
[43:52.200 --> 44:21.200]  come so be the polar bears you are.
[44:22.200 --> 44:48.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[44:48.200 --> 45:14.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[45:14.200 --> 45:42.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[45:42.200 --> 45:59.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[45:59.200 --> 46:27.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[46:27.200 --> 46:56.200]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity
[46:56.200 --> 47:01.200]  and setting on free speech.
[47:01.200 --> 47:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.200 --> 47:27.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:27.200 --> 47:36.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:36.200 --> 48:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[48:02.200 --> 48:28.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[48:28.200 --> 48:57.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[48:57.200 --> 49:23.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[49:23.200 --> 49:49.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[49:49.200 --> 50:18.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[50:18.200 --> 50:45.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[50:45.200 --> 51:11.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[51:11.200 --> 51:38.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[51:38.200 --> 52:07.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[52:07.200 --> 52:33.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:26.200]  Spending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:40.200]  Nearly 2400 years ago in ancient Greece, Plato discussed the importance of population control. Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and infanticide.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:56.200]  In 1798, an essay on the principle of population was written by Thomas Malthus. He outlined the idea of positive checks, which are diseases, wars, disasters, famines, and genocides.
[2:06:56.200 --> 2:07:07.200]  Malthus believed that these things should be utilized to increase the death rate and believed that human misery was an absolute necessary consequence.
[2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:21.200]  In 1859, Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species. In it, Darwin only hinted at the implications of human populations, but his cousin, Sir Francis Galton, became obsessed with the idea.
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:38.200]  In 1883, Galton published inquiries into human faculty and its development, wherein he wrote that his intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race or, as we might call it, with eugenic.
[2:07:38.200 --> 2:07:44.200]  The term comes from the Greek word eugenus of noble birth.
[2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:54.200]  In the early 20th century, eugenics became an academic discipline in universities. Organizations were formed and funded to win public support.
[2:07:54.200 --> 2:08:09.200]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Cold Spring Harbor Institute rejected the idea that all humans are born equal and began selling the idea of cultivating a new master race of noble bloodlines.
[2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:15.200]  Planned Parenthood was formed in America by racial eugenics advocate Margaret Sanger.
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:27.200]  President of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, established a special subsidiary in Poland called Watson Business Machines to assist in the Nazi invasion of Poland.
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:35.200]  This business continued throughout the war, and IBM managed the entire operation from their headquarters in New York.
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:43.200]  During the Nuremberg trials, the Nazis quoted US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in their own defense.
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:48.200]  They claimed that their eugenics program was being run from the United States.
[2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:54.200]  The Nazis were rightly admonished for war crimes, but not Thomas Watson.
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:09:00.200]  He went on to create the IBM World Trade Corporation and passed IBM onto his son.
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:05.200]  His granddaughter ended up marrying Margaret Sanger's grandson.
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:16.200]  Bill Gates' father worked on the board for Planned Parenthood, and his mother worked on the corporate board for IBM, who Bill partnered with to create Microsoft.
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:26.200]  With no medical background, Bill Gates then went on to become the world's foremost pusher of vaccines and population control.
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:30.200]  Do you think this is all coincidence?
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:39.200]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funds the WHO, the NIH, the CDC, and the UN.
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:46.200]  And now he's saying that until we get mass vaccinations, we might never be able to gather in groups.
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:59.200]  And which activities, like mass gatherings, may be in a certain sense more optional, and so until you're widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:05.200]  The president's coronavirus response team are all pushing the Bill Gates vaccination agenda.
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:10.200]  Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:20.200]  In January of 2017, Anthony Fauci told a crowd at Georgetown University that there would be a surprise outbreak during the Trump presidency.
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:34.200]  There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that.
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:37.200]  But also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:50.200]  Deborah Birx is a board member for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which was founded by the Gates Foundation and known for millions of dollars of fraudulent misuse of funds.
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:11:01.200]  In October of 2019, Bill Gates sponsored Event 201, a simulation that estimated 65 million people killed by coronavirus.
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:18.200]  In November of 2019, the Peer Bright Institute, funded by Bill Gates, was granted European patent number EP3172319B1 for a coronavirus vaccine that may be used to treat humans.
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:26.200]  Today, Dr. Fauci says the virus will keep coming back, and he says the ultimate game changer will be a new vaccine.
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:39.200]  In Australia, the Prime Minister is telling people the shutdown will last months, that it's the new normal, and that the only way out of your homes is to accept the vaccine.
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:42.200]  There is no proof that vaccines are the answer.
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:51.200]  In fact, the CDC admitted in federal court that it does not have studies to support the claim that vaccines do not cause autism.
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:57.200]  A top UN scientist admitted that vaccines are killing people.
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:00.200]  It is time to do some hard thinking.
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:05.200]  Will you allow your government to impose forced vaccinations?
[2:12:05.200 --> 2:12:13.200]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Ries.
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:26.200]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[2:12:26.200 --> 2:12:40.200]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit after four months of denial that the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:50.200]  and was paid for by the U.S. National Institute of Health, run by none other than Anthony Fauci during the Obama administration.
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:13:09.200]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China, thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome and found evidence that COVID-19 is a man-made hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:25.200]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University of North Carolina, and a moratorium was enacted to end gain of function research in the United States.
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:47.200]  Gain of function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly pathogens. Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:59.200]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain of function coronavirus experimentation on bats.
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:13.200]  The Wuhan Institute lists the NIH as a partner, as well as the University of Alabama, the University of North Texas, Harvard University and the National Wildlife Federation.
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:33.200]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments may have gotten out of control, but the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan laboratory and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH.
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  The very same Fauci, who is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:58.200]  As the world increasingly blames China for the COVID-19 virus, the CCP has fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the bow of their American deep state accomplices.
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:06.200]  A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:31.200]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:37.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:15.200]  You need survivalist camps. The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer. Bold statement, you bit.

[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:08.200]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:21.200]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[2:17:54.200 --> 2:18:03.200]  Oh, hi. I'm a liberal professor here, yeah. We're bringing in fours of messages to stop the extremism.
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:15.200]  Sure, it's true the science publication five years ago and public documents that Obama and Fauci transferred COVID-19 to China.
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:24.200]  But you know what? There's too many people like the pub saddened. This has been popular even since capitalism last sent.
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:31.200]  You didn't really say you'd defeat Xi Jinping and Sexy Devil, did you? Yeah. Yeah.
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:40.200]  And look at your media so laptop and supporting the takedown Americans celebrating it because you put up with it. That's right.
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:48.200]  And you're going to keep day in, day in, day in. And remember, pedophile story time is going to happen too.
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:55.200]  You don't have any free speech either. So drink your fluoride and die, stupid Americans.
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:19:05.200]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:12.200]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality.
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:21.200]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:32.200]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:38.200]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[2:19:38.200 --> 2:19:45.200]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:50.200]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[2:19:50.200 --> 2:20:06.200]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:21.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:25.200]  I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives.
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:29.200]  The argument is that you bought yourself some time and you didn't use it to prepare hospitals.
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:36.200]  You didn't use it to ramp up testing. You're so disgraceful. It's so disgraceful the way you said it.
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:46.200]  Listen, I just went over it. I just went over it. Nobody thought we should do it.
[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:57.200]  And when I did it, you know we did. What do you do when you have no case in the whole United States?
[2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:04.200]  Excuse me. You reported it. Zero cases, zero deaths on January 7th.
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:10.200]  February. I said in January. On January 30th.
[2:21:10.200 --> 2:21:14.200]  What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bounced off?
[2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:19.200]  A lot. And in fact, we'll give you a list of what we did. In fact, part of it was up there.
[2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:24.200]  We did a lot. You know you're a fake. You know that.
[2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:28.200]  Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake. And most of it. And not all of you.
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:35.200]  But the people are wise to you. That's why you have a lower approval rating than you've ever had before, times probably three.
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:42.200]  And when you asked me that question, let me ask you this. Why didn't Biden apologize?
[2:21:42.200 --> 2:21:49.200]  Why did he write a letter of apology? No, that's very important. Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly?
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:53.200]  You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly.
[2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:58.200]  We have done a great job. Now, I could have, I could have kept it open.
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:04.200]  And I could have done what some countries are doing. They're getting beat up pretty badly.
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:12.200]  I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody's ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America.
[2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:19.200]  But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead.
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:24.200]  We've done this right. And we really, we really have done this right.
[2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:28.200]  The problem is the press doesn't cover it the way it should.
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:45.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, the press in this country, the corporate press is bought and paid for by multinational corporations.
[2:22:45.200 --> 2:22:54.200]  I love the comments China. We all know that. And as it all begins to come out and unfold, they're going to get more desperate.
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:23:04.200]  They're going to get more out of control. And what they're doing right now is in blue states, they control and in U.S. attorney's offices, they control.
[2:23:04.200 --> 2:23:09.200]  They're going around. Everybody's bank records, their tax records over the decades.
[2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:20.200]  And they are calling up people saying, if you don't come out against Trump and if you don't support the destruction of the country, we're going to indict you.
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:31.200]  And because Trump hasn't gotten control of the Justice Department and it just operates still run by Hillary and Obama in the deep state, they are allowed to terrorize the American people.
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:38.200]  And most people, when they get threatened with indictments or worse, back down.
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:46.200]  And so it's a real miracle that members of Congress, after being lied about, having people come to their houses threatened to kill them.
[2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:55.200]  Like the Senate Majority Leader, after having their ribs broken, like Rand Paul, after being shot with bullets on Congressman's police, that they're holding the line.
[2:23:55.200 --> 2:24:01.200]  But you see, they're holding the line instead of ever going on the offense against these criminals.
[2:24:01.200 --> 2:24:11.200]  And so because all those indictments we heard about from people that committed massive crimes, because that never happened, by extension,
[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:17.200]  Trump and the Justice Department at the top are authorizing this scorched earth policy that's being carried out.
[2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:23.200]  That's now a stay at home order for most Americans and a death sentence for small businesses.
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:26.200]  And now the Democrats are putting strings on all the money.
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:30.200]  And so we're going into economic depression.
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:34.200]  And so as bad as the persecution has been against Info Wars, I expected this.
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:38.200]  I even predicted they'd use a bio weapon to carry it out.
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:42.200]  But now people ask, well, how are you handling it?
[2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:47.200]  Well, I know how the president's handling it. He's completely surrounded.
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:49.200]  And so are the American people.
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:25:05.200]  I criminals who've never gotten in trouble and who are like spoiled three year olds throwing fits and overturning the dinner table and kicking their parents in the shins because they've never been put in their place.
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:19.200]  And they are collections of soft, stupid, corrupt, blackmailed individuals in corporate America and in Main Street America and in Wall Street America and in Washington DC.
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:22.200]  And so this country really has cancer.
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:24.200]  And we've seen a lot of good happen.
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:28.200]  A lot of this has been turned around a lot of what the globalists have been up to is being exposed.
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:36.200]  But that's only elicited them to come charging out of their rat's nest, attacking even more ferociously.
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:43.200]  See, America for the last 50 years or so has just been going along to get along while we were being robbed blind.
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:47.200]  And a lot of adults, a lot of older people think, well, if you just go on to get along, it'll be like last time it'll be okay.
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:51.200]  No, we're up to slaughtering the pig time at Christmas.
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:55.200]  The pigs been out there for a couple of years, growing, getting fattened up.
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:26:03.200]  And the next time it gets a lot out of the gate, it doesn't know it's being led to be, you know, hauled up by its feet and its throat slit and be cut up into pork chops.
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:10.200]  We're now at the pork chop level and they're walking over with the knife to reach down and pat us.
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:17.200]  You know, they usually give you a carrot or a tomato or something or maybe a radish or an apple.
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:23.200]  But this time it's just a quick knife with razor sharp across the crowded arteries.
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:26.200]  And I'm sitting there watching history, knowing what's happening.
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:32.200]  And I'm watching them sharpen the knife up on the front porch.
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:34.200]  And they're saying, yeah, I'm going to go slit them.
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:36.200]  I'm going to go butcher.
[2:26:36.200 --> 2:26:43.200]  I'm going to go butcher candy or Brady or whatever the pig's name is.
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:46.200]  And they do it.
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:48.200]  You know, that's part of growing up on a farm.
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:53.200]  But my grandparents were on a farm and my dad's parents and you know, it wasn't a big deal.
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:55.200]  But a few times I have to be there when they were slaughtering an animal.
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:01.200]  They're like, yeah, we like old such and such, but it's time to chop them up, put them in the deep freeze.
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:03.200]  Lots of good steaks tonight.
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:04.200]  You should go out and shoot them.
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:06.200]  Shoot your cow right in the head of the 22.
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:07.200]  Just walk up and shoot.
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:13.200]  It falls right over, haul it up with a tractor on chains, slit its throat, bleed the meat out and butcher it right there.
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.200]  You spend like five hours butchering the cow and eat fresh steaks that night.
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:20.200]  This meat goes to hamburger and you grind that up and this goes to that.
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:29.200]  And this is just a process of rendering down America, breaking your will, making you desperate, absolutely teaching you total submission.
[2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:41.200]  So I have a lot of sorrow to the fact that we're run by these psychotics, but if America doesn't stand up and say no, it's really what we deserve.
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:44.200]  So I'm going to cover some of this news when we come back.
[2:27:44.200 --> 2:27:53.200]  I was going to take two days off. It was like every time I would take off, take my children fishing or something out of that very farm.
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:55.200]  I was talking about having been there in years, family farm.
[2:27:55.200 --> 2:28:01.200]  The minute I'm going to go do something like that, this all happens and stuff breaks loose.
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:08.200]  And you know, behind the scenes, the establishments like, okay, well, you defeated this, you defeated that, you stood up to this and that.
[2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:11.200]  How about we put your ass in prison?
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:14.200]  Well, the whole country's in prison.
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:16.200]  You know, what's next? We'll put a bullet in your head.
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:18.200]  I mean, you're putting the bullet in the country's head.
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:22.200]  You want to put a force fact scene in all of us that Bill Gates admits will kill a bunch of people.
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:25.200]  I mean, it's like, what do you think is going on here?
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:34.200]  Just because organized crime took this country over and you think every place is New York or LA or Baltimore, Maryland, it's not.
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:36.200]  And they've taken our restraint as weakness.
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:38.200]  That's not what's happening.
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:39.200]  They're going to lose.
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:43.200]  They are losing. But for those of us at the tip of the spear, it's going to be hard.
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:46.200]  But you know what? I'm glad to be here and I'm proud to be in this position.
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:49.200]  I'm more happy than I've ever been. I'm more fulfilled.
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:29:18.200]  I can face God. You can.
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:24.200]  Fire your flies, water. Get your bug assault today.
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:29.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:34.200]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:29:34.200 --> 2:29:39.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[2:31:32.200 --> 2:31:36.200]  And it's not about this virus, folks. That's only the trigger, the detonator.
[2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:39.200]  It's about what's coming in the future with elections. It may be canceled.
[2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:46.200]  But with the globalists trying to implode the economy, this is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end.
[2:31:46.200 --> 2:32:13.200]  So get prepared now while you still can at infowarstore.com and please be Paul Ramirez and spread the word.
[2:32:16.200 --> 2:32:21.200]  It's China to create fear to shut down our economy and the corporate media and the blue cities and the blue states.
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:30.200]  And all said, America's never reopening, never, never, never, because you have to be taught that you're bad and that America's dead.
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:37.200]  Yeah, China was supposed to win the trade war, but since they didn't, working with the deep state, they just launched a bio weapon attack that Obama and Fauci cooked up.
[2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:44.200]  And now Fauci's your god. Doesn't matter if he's all over the news, engineering the whole attack. He is the boss. He is the king.
[2:32:44.200 --> 2:32:51.200]  Do not leave your house, American trash. It's over. America's over. Your children, your guns and your money belong to us.
[2:32:51.200 --> 2:33:19.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:25.200]  It's free.
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:31.200]  It's lost and never found.
[2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:43.200]  You got to turn loose your fear, but it's fear.
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:59.200]  Beware. Look out.
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:10.200]  You go out looking for dragons to slay someday. You'll find them and you'll get what you wanted. Your destiny.
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:21.200]  I got up this morning and there was the headline. Governors on the West and East Coast form an alliance against Trump.
[2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:30.200]  They said science. That means the UN, the Chai comms, Fauci that allow the NIH to transfer the bio weapons to China on record.
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:41.200]  The scientific dictatorship will dictate not the president, not Congress, but the governors interpreting what scientists they want to hear from.
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:54.200]  But we have Cuomo saying just two days ago that all the projections were wrong between 9, 10, 15, 20 times higher in their death rates than what really happened.
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:35:04.200]  You look at the governor of Michigan walking around like a crazed jack-o'-lantern loon and Cuomo all jacked up and crazy.
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:14.200]  Cuomo's brother Chris Cuomo came out in an interview that we should hear in the next segment and he said, you know, people hate me out in public now, but I let them know I hate them too.
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:20.200]  But this isn't what I wanted. I mean, I want to be nice. I want to be bipartisan. Yeah, right.
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:31.200]  They're feeling the heat, folks. They think they're going to break all the rules and commit all these crimes and do all these things and that it won't come back on them.
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:47.200]  They're nothing but scared little puppets. They go to other little puppets and they have these round tables, these committees of corrupt mainly men and big corporations that sit around and do deals with dictators and do deals with authoritarian regimes.
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:36:00.200]  They don't like open free countries. And they've decided to get rid of the checks and balances because they believe their multinational corporations can play the countries off against each other and the people off against each other and be the new robber barons, the planet.
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:14.200]  It's not going to go that way. You go to any Cuomo comment page that's open. You go to any place where they're talking about Bill Gates and it's 99% negative.
[2:36:14.200 --> 2:36:22.200]  Look at their champion. He can't even talk. Joe Biden. He's so emblematic of their delusion.
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:33.200]  And so they peck and scrape in the dust trying to find some plan, some idea to blackmail or intimidate their opposition. And now they're noticing it isn't working anymore.
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:43.200]  So they have to up the intimidation. They have to up the threats. They have to up the scams in a hope that people will finally bow down to them again.
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:58.200]  This country is in a civil war with one faction that hates the country, doesn't want to exist and that has literally been feeding off it for decades and another faction that just wants to stop being bullied and lied about.
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:07.200]  So you have the states on the West Coast, the East Coast that don't believe countries and borders even exist coming out and saying, we're going to block Trump reopening the country.
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:15.200]  How many times did I say the last 8, 9, 10 weeks that they'll say Trump didn't do enough, even though he's the one doing something?
[2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:23.200]  Then they'll say that he's doing a good job when he finally shuts things down completely. See, they wanted to get bad first.
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:29.200]  First, like, oh, everything's fine. Don't block the borders. Don't block Chinese flights. Once they have some death, oh, my God, it's your fault.
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:33.200]  You got to shut everything down completely. And then, by the way, you're never going to reopen it.
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:44.200]  Even though all the metrics show it's already causing millions of people to be at starvation and to starve to death, half a billion people sliding into absolute near starvation levels.
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:51.200]  But they won't be memorialized or humanized or focused on. They won't be spotlighted.
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:38:00.200]  Those actually starve to death. The mother has to decide which one of her three children to feed and which other to allow die. That's confirmed.
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:08.200]  Now, there's the New York Times. Death by coronavirus or hunger? Well, millions of dead from hunger. They're saying like 2 million about to die.
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:13.200]  More than double the normal. But that's okay. 10 plus million die a year anyways, right?
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:19.200]  They're saying tens of millions. If it continues, there's a global depression, which is already in most areas.
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:27.200]  But it's about the corporations grabbing power and control. They're essential. Your business, your home, your right to travel, your right to whatever does it.
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:37.200]  They decide with an app they've already got for you with Google and Apple merging to carry that out.
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:43.200]  Because it turns out those companies weren't separate all along, folks. That was a con game for the stockholders that was to get around the monopoly laws.
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:50.200]  They're not going to need that anymore because they're all unifying just like China did five years ago, making Gigi Ping dictator for life.
[2:38:50.200 --> 2:39:03.200]  He's already a dictator, but it always consolidates down demanding more fealty, more subservience, more slavery in any system until you vertically integrate into an absolute top-down North Korean nightmare.
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:08.200]  What did President Trump say about this this morning and probably one of his most epic tweets?
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:25.200]  Tell the Democrat governors that mutiny on the bounty was one of my all-time favorite movies, a good old-fashioned mutiny, every now and then, is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the captain, too easy.
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:35.200]  Well, I hope that's the case, Mr. President, because they still think they're going to remove you and then they'll charge stone and throw them in jail for 20 years.
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:41.200]  They still think they're going to remove you and then shut down what's left at Fox News.
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:49.200]  They still think they're going to remove you and then be able to throw my ass in prison for no reason.
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:59.200]  And have a reign of terror against the American people who the globalists hate because the idea of our spirit, if we ever realized our birthright and rediscovered it, could defeat them.
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:08.200]  So we need bold action, Mr. President. You try to play ball with these people, you try to be nice to them, share power with them, they take it as weakness.
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:14.200]  Why haven't you pardoned Julian Assange that you told to release the WikiLeaks?
[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:17.200]  Why?
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:26.200]  Why have you sat there and allowed the globalists to commit all these incredible crimes?
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:31.200]  I understand you're surrounded by a bunch of cowards. They tell you one thing and do another. That's come out.
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:35.200]  We understand you signed an executive order. They think you forget about it and put it under a piece of paper.
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:42.200]  That disdain they have for you, that seizure of power, that the managerial role is criminal mutiny.
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:55.200]  So I'm glad you talk about mutiny, Mr. President, because I've called it mutiny within the federal government by the bureaucracy and a coup, not just against you, but against the American people and the very rule of law.
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:41:03.200]  That's where we are right now. We are not going over the edge of the cliff. We've gone over the edge of the cliff.
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:11.200]  And listeners and viewers of this broadcast seem to know you are not spectators. You are men and women in the arena.
[2:41:11.200 --> 2:41:27.200]  And now that hypothetical medical tyranny, world government, complete with forced inoculations and implantable microchips isn't a thing of the future. It's a thing of the now.
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:34.200]  And I cannot be allowed to be on air much longer when everything we've talked about is now becoming manifest reality.
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:43.200]  It was already reality behind the scenes. You ever seen the old films of a big ship or a battleship or a frigate, a submarine, and it's on the blocks?
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:51.200]  And they unveil the curtains and they cut the blocks and the big ship slides into the water?
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:59.200]  I was behind the curtain. I saw the attack ship. I saw the armies. I saw the globalist. I saw their plans beta tested on innocent populations.
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:10.200]  I came out and told you, hey, behind those curtains is this, a medical tyranny forced inoculation, robots controlling you, forced sterilization of your children if you want to get your universal income.
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:18.200]  And now they've unveiled it, cut the blocks, it hit the water, and now it swings guns around, it's firing at us right now.
[2:42:18.200 --> 2:42:23.200]  And I'm just here going, wow, ladies and gentlemen, what are we going to do?
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:33.200]  They pulled back the curtains, they cut the blocks, they launched the ship, and now it's running us over.
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:42.200]  They're not busting a bottle of champagne on the bow of it to christen it. They're busting over our head and people ask, how are you handling it, Alex? How are you handling it?
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:53.200]  I mean, I've already prepared to die. I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about our children, folks. They're coming with sterilization, cancer, vaccines. They're coming to kill us with a soft-kill weapon.

[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:05.200]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:12.200]  But you get that. You are patriots. You are people that live and work in the real world of erase color and create and understand what's happening.
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:18.200]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke. Thank you for what you've done.
[2:44:18.200 --> 2:44:23.200]  We're all of this together. We believe in the rights of the unborn. We believe in families. We believe in the right to self-defense.
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:29.200]  We believe in capitalism, America, and Jesus Christ, number one. And we believe in free speech.
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:36.200]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:43.200]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:49.200]  They thought they'd be in charge. They thought they would have won. But they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:45:00.200]  So God bless you all.
[2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:29.200]  I'm with Obama, who serves us well and fouching, who transferred the bio weapons to communist China so we could now release the weapon.
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:43.200]  But without the loving liberal media scaring you into submission and the corporate press, worshiping corporations shut down all access as well as blue city governors and peers.
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:52.200]  We would never have been able to give you a depression that will destroy your future forever and starve the third world.
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:55.200]  Well done, American colleagues.
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:03.200]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back in stock.
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:12.200]  Winter sun. In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body when you're not getting sunlight on the skin does not produce vitamin D3.
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:17.200]  So it's important to ingest it, but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:21.200]  So you take this formula under the tongue. It tastes sweet naturally.
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:28.200]  Let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute and then you swallow the rest and it's just amazing.
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:35.200]  It's back in stock and yes, we're going to offer it 50% off because that's the right thing to do during this crisis.
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:42.200]  So winter sun, 50% off. We also have Ultra 12, highest quality B12. It is also available.
[2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:44.200]  Take it out of the tongue, 50% off.
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:49.200]  MFullWarsStore.com and we have X3, even though it's going to sell out, super high quality for a vitamin.
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:53.200]  It is 60% off because I want you to have it right now.
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:47:06.200]  MFullWarsStore.com
[2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:30.200]  Well, if you're driving down the highway through New Mexico, you come up to a rise.
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:36.200]  And you've got a roadmap that tells you Albuquerque is right over those hills as you go down into that basin.
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:45.200]  And sure enough, you may have never been there in your life, but you crest the top and there's the city at night down beneath you.
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:54.200]  Sure enough, it's there. But that's a happy thing, a nice destination you're going to.
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:48:03.200]  Well, imagine if you're looking at the roadmap and you know it leads to depopulation, human slavery, a post-human world,
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:12.200]  a medical tyranny that takes control of civilization and then slowly poisons the population to death while posing as their saviors.
[2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:24.200]  What would you do if you were on a bus being taken to that place and you'd been there before and you'd escaped it?
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:33.200]  And now you're warning people on the bus that they're not being taken to a seaside resort or to a mountain retreat or to a pretty basin.
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:36.200]  They're being taken to a very bad place.
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:44.200]  What would it be like to know your wife, your children, your culture, your country, the whole world was being taken to a horrible place?
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:51.200]  You wouldn't care about yourself because there's not going to be a world to live in by yourself if this thing wins.
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:55.200]  And it's so frustrating to know this thing is so evil and so bad.
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:05.200]  And it's got so many cowards following its orders that it ensures our destruction at least for a long time to come.
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:07.200]  And there's no point in going there.
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:14.200]  All we had to do was have our showery, have our honor, have our courage, have our truth, and then exercise it.
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:20.200]  I can follow trajectories like anybody can that road we're on.
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:29.200]  And if you look at the attacks that the election was illegitimate and then that Trump was a tyrant and all that,
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:35.200]  that was the beta test because they thought, well, if this works, it doesn't destabilize things as bad.
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:40.200]  And then we can carry out our plans later to shut down the world economy and bring the public to their knees.
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:44.200]  We need to get rid of Trump first because if he's in there, we don't want to carry this out yet.
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:55.200]  They had the white papers and the blueprints and the Event 201 things on the drawing board and operations like Lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:59.200]  And they were intending right around this time, 2020, to be launching the virus scare.
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:05.200]  And that's when they cooked it up in China and got it all ready and Fauci oversaw those operations.
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:17.200]  But they were so feverish about getting Trump out of office and isolating him because they wanted to carry this out with him not in power.
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:28.200]  Because now having him there, even surrounded by a bunch of cowards and dunces, they're using the media and the big corporations to coordinate the lockdown,
[2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:30.200]  but he's there challenging it.
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:34.200]  When he realized the public had been caught in the hysteria, he went with it,
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:46.200]  but only to have credibility to be able to try to turn it back as he's now doing with an alliance of Republican governors led by folks like Mr. Abbott, Governor Abbott.
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:58.200]  So if you follow this trajectory, this is the time they'll kill Trump in the next couple of weeks, the next few months.
[2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:06.200]  And this is the time that they'll drug, even say he had a stroke, that's another road, and then have his cabinet bring in a new president.
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:09.200]  But they're not sure they've got pinch.
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:16.200]  There's been a lot of whisper campaigns against Pence from the fake right wing, because Pence looks like it's actually good.
[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:20.200]  And Trump daily is gaining more control over the executive branch, so they don't know what to do.
[2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:26.200]  But I can tell you that the establishment is losing power and they're really scared.
[2:51:26.200 --> 2:51:36.200]  They know they've committed all these crimes and they launched COVID-19, which they already have again on the drawing board and off the shelf ready to go later to bring in world government,
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:45.200]  bring in medical tyranny, bring in forced inoculation, bring in depopulation, bring in the digital global idea to attract you, the implantable ink microchip.
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:49.200]  I mean, it's all now here.
[2:51:49.200 --> 2:51:58.200]  But they've now executed it to hold the country fully hostage and to have the Democrat governors say we're going to hold you hostage.
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:06.200]  And we're going to run a blockade, a naval blockade. You know, Trump's using mutiny on the bounty as a naval analogy.
[2:52:06.200 --> 2:52:09.200]  So I use the naval analogy of big ships on their blocks.
[2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:24.200]  But how about the analogy of a blockade, a naval blockade where you lay siege to say Gibraltar, or lay siege to Tripoli.
[2:52:24.200 --> 2:52:29.200]  You've got the, or Kennedy's naval blockade of Cuba, the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:42.200]  The Democrats are now saying they're going to block, if Trump doesn't do what they say, they're going to block ships with food and material coming in, an act of war.
[2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:47.200]  So what the Democrats are really saying is we're going to lay siege to America.
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:55.200]  It's like, the media's like, well, look out, Trump, you say you'll stand up to the Democrat governors on the east and west coast. We control all the ports.
[2:52:55.200 --> 2:52:59.200]  We'll cut America off like happened in the Civil War against the south.
[2:52:59.200 --> 2:53:07.200]  I mean, you see how this rapidly day by day is escalating into insane times.
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:11.200]  But you could argue who was in the right in the Civil War.
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:20.200]  And some said, oh, they thought Obama would have a Civil War and be Lincolness and dominate America. But no, instead, the real Abraham Lincoln, I mean, one that you could actually believe in is Donald Trump.
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:26.200]  I mean, he's really trying to unify the country. I guess an outside foreign threat, not just breakaway states that weren't happy with what was happening.
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:29.200]  And he's really battling for the heart and soul of the nation.
[2:53:29.200 --> 2:53:36.200]  And he is a Yankee. And he's got the South support and the Midwest support.
[2:53:36.200 --> 2:53:42.200]  And so the east and west coast have declared war on him.
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:45.200]  And I kept saying the chai comms are running a Civil War.
[2:53:45.200 --> 2:53:50.200]  They're running a breakup of the country. They're wargaming it through the media. They're financing. They own almost all of Hollywood.
[2:53:50.200 --> 2:53:54.200]  And people say, really, the chai comms are funding a Civil War. Well, you're here now.
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:54:03.200]  The governors, the big tech companies, the blue cities, the 40 million illegal aliens they control.
[2:54:03.200 --> 2:54:11.200]  Chai comm funded. And now I've talked to a lot of national talk show hosts, some of the biggest, the biggest.
[2:54:11.200 --> 2:54:20.200]  And they're like, man, we're now getting the threats or you get the threats and my phone's been ringing off the hook.
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:28.200]  And people are showing up and like, you know, dudes in like vans will just say something really threatening to their wife.
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:33.200]  And then, you know, somebody will call their house and say, oh, sorry, a little dog in the back there.
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:36.200]  They're like, yeah, a little spotted dog. We're going to cut your head off.
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:41.200]  I mean, that's what's been going on, folks. And a lot of people just go, whoa, I'm out.
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:45.200]  Listen, they're going to cut the whole country's head off and our freedom, you give into this.
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:50.200]  You can't give in to this intimidation. They're doing this because they're losing.
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:55:01.200]  But that's why I called for Trump, like Lincoln, but Lincoln facing a real threat that wants to destroy the children and the country itself.
[2:55:01.200 --> 2:55:10.200]  To understand we're already under globalist imposed martial law and siege and economic blockade.
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:15.200]  And we're facing a military operation. He pointed out this is criminal mutiny.
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:20.200]  And they're saying they're going to blockade our shores. It has to stop, Mr. President.
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:24.200]  I understand you thought you could back them down, beating Russia, getting beaten Ukraine, getting beaten all the other stuff.
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  You can't, sir. They're not going to stop. Now, this is their military move.
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:32.200]  And so people are all asking me, I had to tell the crew today what was going on behind the scenes.
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:36.200]  And I'll be able to talk about it soon on air.
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:48.200]  But when I learned they're imminently trying to arrest the leadership of the hardliner resistance movement, it's going to chill out my spine.
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:58.200]  You understand, they're giving their orders in their deep state and their partially controlled justice department, other areas to move against the American people.
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:08.200]  When they kill Trump, see, they want the country shut down. You're in your house. You don't know what to do. Your new bosses are Bill Gates and Fauci.
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:13.200]  And then Trump has a stroke or Trump dies. And then, by the way, all these people get arrested or whatever for crimes they've committed.
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:18.200]  This is called a hot coup.
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:28.200]  So these criminals love to brag, too, like Fauci 2017. Oh, Trump's going to get hit with a big bio event.
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:32.200]  Well, Trump didn't know about that clip. Once he found out about it, he's that close to being fired.
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:37.200]  And, you know, Bill Gates is acting friendly. Trump doesn't understand all that. He hasn't studied his whole life.
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:42.200]  But Trump gets it now. That's what the New York Times is. Trump's crazy. He doesn't trust the deep state.
[2:56:42.200 --> 2:56:52.200]  The first there was in a deep state. Now he doesn't trust them. So this is it, folks. This is the battle for the Republic, the New World Order, the whole nine yards.
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:57:03.200]  And the Republican arms of the Justice Department are paralyzed and scared and blackmailed.
[2:57:03.200 --> 2:57:09.200]  And the Democrat ones work for MS-13 and, you know, the Jihadi terrorists and the Chai comms are on the payroll already.
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:20.200]  So they're all going to prison if we ever get the country back. So they're fully committed, like, crazed criminals of the most savage type you've ever imagined in your life.
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:25.200]  And they'll follow any orders once the takeover is complete. And they're not going to stop there. They're going to finish the job.
[2:57:25.200 --> 2:57:33.200]  They're going to bankrupt every one of you. They're going to break your will. They're going to come take your sons, especially, because we're going into bondage just like an ancient Egypt.
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:43.200]  It's all a repeat. But you know, God is going to send the Angel of Death. Not delivered by men, but by God. I pray the Angel of Death.
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:58:00.200]  Listen, there's a show from PBS called It's OK to Be Smart. So everyone who's been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted, it's OK to finally be smart.
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:08.200]  That's right. There's not two sexes and families are bad. And the right thing to do is to sterilize your son so he doesn't become an evil war monger.
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:12.200]  I mean, a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government passed laws that mail embryos that count.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:19.200]  But what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is to convince them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off.
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:24.200]  And again, global warming's real. We've got to pay Lord Rothschild all of our money and the pandemic's all real.
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:30.200]  We've got to be locked up in our houses. We've got to use the language the universities say. We're not a culture or anything.
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  Oh, no, no, we're not. We're good people. We're good people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us.
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:44.200]  No, no, they enlightened us how to censor and how to rule and how to control.
[2:58:44.200 --> 2:58:54.200]  Oh, hi. I'm a liberal professor here. Yeah, we're bringing in fours of messages to stop the extremism.
[2:58:54.200 --> 2:59:06.200]  Sure, it's true the science publication five years ago and public documents that Obama and Fauci transferred COVID-19 to China.
[2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:14.200]  But you know what? There's too many people like the pubs and this isn't the popular either. It's capitalism or less.
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:22.200]  You didn't really say he'd defeat Xi Jinping and Sexy Devil. Did you? Yeah. Yeah.
[2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:31.200]  And look at your media. It's so laptop and supporting the takedown of Americans celebrating it because you put up with it. That's right.
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:39.200]  You're going to keep taking, taking, taking. And remember, pedophile story time is going to happen, too.
[2:59:39.200 --> 3:00:05.200]  You don't have any free speech either. So drink your fluoride and die, stupid Americans.
[3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:14.200]  Because the God of nature established the universe and its limits, its boundaries, its laws.
[3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:22.200]  So this long sick rotting of our republic and our planet is nearing its climactic battle of the gods.
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:32.200]  So when I pray for God to send justice, I don't even mean death upon our enemies, but a death to their system, a death to the worship of death.
[3:00:32.200 --> 3:00:40.200]  I want abortion and the murder of children, that horrible practice to be seized and put to death.
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:50.200]  I look at all folks that serve evil become dead in the ice. And how they lose their soul, they lose their connection to the universe.
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:01:01.200]  It's a fate worse than death. And so someone's got to call them on their plan. Paul Watson's about to take over, then the war room's coming up.
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:10.200]  I just have to tell you, this is a spiritual battle. And America is now in a civil war officially.
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:26.200]  When governors from, guys, pull up a map of the Democrat-Governor alliances. What is it? Four states on the West Coast.
[3:01:26.200 --> 3:01:33.200]  And it's a bunch of states on the East Coast, and they just announced a blockade.
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:41.200]  And Trump says, well, I'm going to stop it. Oh, we'll control the ports. So the Chinese, I mean, I have the articles right here that are so surreal.
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:50.200]  It's like reading about the start of the Civil War, the early 1860s and blockades and all this. And it's just right there.
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:02:07.200]  But because people haven't lived through this before, they don't know what they're facing.
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:21.200]  Tell Democrat governors to mute on the bounding was one of my all-time favorite movies, a good old-fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the captain.
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:30.200]  My administration is committed to protecting the homeland from the scourge of narco-terrorists and traitors, seeking to stabilize the United States and our hemisphere, our military deployments, the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific.
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:42.200]  Well, sure, these threats are neutralized. And yeah, Trump can nationalize those ports like that and take them back from Cuomo and the governor out in California.
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:52.200]  But think about them saying that and doing how crazy that is. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says he would refuse and challenge New York from Trump to reopen New York's economy if it puts residents health at risk.
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:03:02.200]  And Fauci said one death's too many. And they test everybody that has the common cold and say it's COVID-19. States unite on reopening economies.
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:08.200]  Science, not politics, will guide our decisions. That means the scientific dictatorship will tell us, not the president.
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:17.200]  Governor's coronavirus pact could thwart Trump's goal of reopening the country, Politico. Democrats holding COVID-19 bill hostage over unrelated demands.
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:26.200]  We're being held hostage. We're under siege. We're under blockade. I've got articles here. Just type the things. I couldn't find it in my stack. I had it earlier.
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:36.200]  Democrats threaten to close ports, block shipments into the U.S. I mean, that's an actual headline. Here, I'll find it.
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:47.200]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:04:08.200]  But just remember in this critical historic time, your word of mouth and however you can get people to tune in to m4s.com.
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:13.200]  If you see what's happening, you understand how dangerous it is, then get the word out because this is the globalist revolution.
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:21.200]  They prepared us. They got us ready. They beta tested. Now they're launching on every single front.
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:32.200]  And we just can't let this continue. We just can't roll over to this. We cannot bow to this. We cannot let the home of the free land of the free home of the brave turn into this.
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:38.200]  But I can tell you that they're they're preparing to make their move.
[3:04:38.200 --> 3:04:46.200]  The country is going into depression. The food shortages are stopping and the Democrats are announcing they're going to block the ports from being open.
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  And emergency supplies getting into the U.S. We are under attack. We are under military attack with the globalist.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:05:00.200]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:03.200]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:09.200]  But I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really upping their game.
[3:05:09.200 --> 3:05:13.200]  And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[3:05:13.200 --> 3:05:16.200]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:21.200]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:24.200]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[3:05:24.200 --> 3:05:27.200]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:36.200]  The power structure should have silenced those of us that they can. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:42.200]  We have the power. But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[3:05:42.200 --> 3:05:48.200]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come.
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:50.200]  So be the polar bears you are.
[3:05:50.200 --> 3:06:03.200]  Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom.
[3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:09.200]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:17.200]  Everybody is wondering when everything is going to reopen if life indeed will ever get back to normal.
[3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:24.200]  If indeed there will be anything left to reopen after the absolute damage that's been done to the economy
[3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:29.200]  and will continue to be done to the economy over the next two, three, four years going forward.
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:31.200]  The World Health Organization.
[3:06:31.200 --> 3:06:37.200]  The same organization that helped China cover up the outbreak of coronavirus from the very beginning.
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:42.200]  The amplified fake news Chinese propaganda via Twitter which allowed it.
[3:06:42.200 --> 3:06:47.200]  That there was no human to human transmission of coronavirus back on January 14.
[3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:50.200]  That told countries not to lock down their borders.
[3:06:50.200 --> 3:06:56.200]  That told countries not to profile Chinese people because that might be racist and hurt their feelings.
[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:04.200]  That organization is now saying that things will never get back to normal until Americans,
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:10.200]  until Brits, until everybody affected by this accepts the new norm.
[3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:17.200]  In their own words, except being educated or reeducated on exactly what that new norm is.
[3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:21.200]  Could it be a government app on your phone which is mandatory?
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:23.200]  Could it be a government vaccine?
[3:07:23.200 --> 3:07:26.200]  Could it indeed be a government microchip?
[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:31.200]  What exactly is the new norm and will the old norm ever be put back in place?
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:38.200]  I'm going to go through some articles over the past week because there's literally been probably about two dozen.
[3:07:38.200 --> 3:07:40.200]  I've written about half of them myself.
[3:07:40.200 --> 3:07:45.200]  The kind of increasingly draconian enforcement measures that police,
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:50.200]  mainly in the United Kingdom also across Europe and Australia too,
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:54.200]  have been imposing as a result of this coronavirus lockdown.
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:57.200]  Let's bear in mind that the polls show here in the UK,
[3:07:57.200 --> 3:08:04.200]  the vast majority of people still support the coronavirus lockdown, the quarantine, the entire thing.
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:09.200]  People have been psychologically prepared from bits and pieces that have come out,
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:13.200]  that that's all going to end at the end of this month or the start of May,
[3:08:13.200 --> 3:08:16.200]  and that everything is gradually going to get back to normal.
[3:08:16.200 --> 3:08:18.200]  It doesn't look like it.
[3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:23.200]  And now Ron Paul over in the US is warning about a health care patriot act,
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:28.200]  and that appears to be what we're about to be dealing with because this is going to come back.
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:31.200]  This is going to be a rolling thing where on the proviso of any threat,
[3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:34.200]  any perceived threat from any virus, they can bring these measures,
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:38.200]  which have already been established back in on a whim.
[3:08:38.200 --> 3:08:44.200]  And just to see some of the effects of this in the UK, I mean, let's start from last week.
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:52.200]  They're literally inspecting people's shopping baskets to check if they've made purchases which are deemed essential.
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:54.200]  Now, that's not even in the law.
[3:08:54.200 --> 3:09:01.200]  Bear in mind, the only stores that are open are selling food. Those stores are deemed essential.
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:06.200]  So by proxy, everything being sold in those stores is essential.
[3:09:06.200 --> 3:09:12.200]  Now, now in Spain and places like that, they actually, my parents, because they're obviously on lockdown,
[3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:15.200]  they're in their 60s, if anyone's at risk, it's them.
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:19.200]  They wanted to paint their house while they couldn't leave it.
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:25.200]  So they went to the supermarket which sells food and it sells paint, they roped off the paint.
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:27.200]  Can't buy paint for some reason.
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:30.200]  In the UK, I don't think that's the case from what I've seen.
[3:09:30.200 --> 3:09:34.200]  But the police, and bear in mind, the government had to come out and say,
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:36.200]  no, you don't even know the law.
[3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:43.200]  It's not in the law that you can set up roadblocks and patrol supermarket aisles to check what people are buying.
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:51.200]  But that's happening across the country and these stories are only getting increasing in density over the past couple of weeks.
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:54.200]  I mean, I've written about 12 stories about this over the past couple of weeks.
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:10:02.200]  One from last week, headline, second UK police force threatens to check if public are making non-essential purposes.
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:10.200]  This is Cambridge Police just north of London who tweeted they were monitoring non-essential supermarket aisles in a branch of Tesco,
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:16.200]  which is a supermarket, to make sure people weren't purchasing frivolous items.
[3:10:16.200 --> 3:10:19.200]  And again, they got the law completely wrong.
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:27.200]  But again, it was the threat despite the fact that the vast majority of people have been completely obedient following these quarantine rules.
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:35.200]  They're now saying they may set up roadblocks to stop people from buying what they think non-essential items.
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  Another story from yesterday, police find UK shopper for buying wine during coronavirus lockdown.
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:46.200]  Again, they're tracking people as they come out of the supermarket and checking what they've bought.
[3:10:46.200 --> 3:10:49.200]  And these are just the stories that have come out.
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:52.200]  These are just the tweets that people have picked up.
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:58.200]  This is going on across the country and we're not even finding out about most cases.
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:08.200]  UK police issued a fine to a shopper who bought wine and potato chips or crisps, as we call them, during the coronavirus lockdown claiming that these were non-essential items.
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:12.200]  This happened in Edinburgh, Scotland last weekend.
[3:11:12.200 --> 3:11:18.200]  Somebody tweeted, I was walking through Holyrood Park on my way back from Morrison's, the supermarket.
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:25.200]  Two officers asked to look inside my bag and then find me for only having snacks and a bottle of wine.
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:30.200]  So they're going to determine what's a non-essential item, despite, again, the fact that that's not even in the law.
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:33.200]  The police don't even know the law.
[3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:40.200]  In fact, added to this article, there's probably about eight other individual cases of similar incidents.
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:46.200]  Another person in West Lothian tweeted to report a nurse in uniform being fined after leaving a patient's house
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:52.200]  and someone who'll have to shop after purchasing a bottle of wine, both were fined £30.
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:58.200]  Another man reported that his friend's daughter had also been fined £30 for buying wine and snacks.
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:08.200]  Another London resident claimed he had been fined simply for taking his dog for a walk late at night, which, again, is perfectly within their rules.
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:13.200]  Now, bear in mind, they may get even more stringent if people misbehave more.
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:18.200]  They literally said, when they made the announcement, you can exercise and take your dog for a walk.
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:26.200]  Oh, well, now we've got some arbitrary curfew where the police can decide, no, you can't walk your dog after 8pm or whatever.
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:33.200]  A woman who had finished walking her dog and was about to buy groceries for a 74-year-old mother was also fined.
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:37.200]  So, again, it's all arbitrary. They have no idea what they're doing.
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:40.200]  We had this one from yesterday, too.
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:45.200]  UK police force brags about hiding in the shadows to catch picnic goers.
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:57.200]  They literally put out a tweet saying, watch out, we're going to be monitoring remote countryside, rural locations for people having picnics with their family.
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:13:00.200]  Like, how is that even going to impact social distancing?
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:10.200]  You're in a field somewhere in the middle of frigging nowhere having a picnic with your family and the police are hiding in the bushes waiting to catch you.
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:17.200]  Bedfordshire Police tweeted out an ominous message that sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the pages of Orwell's 1984.
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:24.200]  If you think that by going for a picnic in a rural location, no one will find you, don't be surprised if an officer appears from the shadows.
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:26.200]  We are covering the whole county.
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:32.200]  In fact, there's a meme which I retweet, I think, or liked earlier.
[3:13:32.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  And it says, grooming gangs with a stationary police car, and then it says something like buying non-essential items with the police car zooming to the location to arrest the dissident.
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:53.200]  And again, it's different to countries like Spain and Italy, because their police forces have a reputation of being more fearsome, more jacked.
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:14:04.200]  The reputation of the police in the United Kingdom, thanks to decades of them being figuratively castrated by laws, which favored criminals, is Benny Hill.
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:13.200]  Where they're literally chasing around mental deranged patients on the streets trying to catch them, falling over, rolling over because they're all overweight.
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:15.200]  It's ridiculous.
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:18.200]  People don't respect the police, and that's a different problem.
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:26.200]  But now they're getting their revenge, apparently, by hiding in the bushes for families having picnics in rural locations.
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:34.200]  Again, the whole idea of this lockdown, by their own rhetoric, it can only work with the consent of the governed.
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:45.200]  If people stop respecting the police because they're enforcing it in these petty, arbitrary draconian ways, then everyone's not going to respect it, and it's going to be a complete failure.
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:47.200]  There's going to be no point.
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  Another story, UK police break into a man's house to check he's not having a social gathering.
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:59.200]  Again, people said, when I posted this video and they started, oh, but he was being mean to them, he swore at them.
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:07.200]  Yeah, does that give them the right to smash down his door because they think he might be having a party when there's nobody in the house?
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:12.200]  No warrant, they just smash down his door and search the house.
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:18.200]  Is that going to increase if these lockdown measures on put under control?
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  Another article, COVID-19 police threatened neighbor who cut disabled man's lawn.
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:25.200]  It goes on and on and on.
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:39.200]  In Australia, they're using a surveillance helicopter, normally used to rescue people in remote locations to track down people who are camping, like a husband and wife team who went camping on the Easter weekend.
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:42.200]  Apparently, that's going to defeat coronavirus.
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  Meanwhile, in London, flights are coming in from Wuhan, China, but you might get arrested for having a picnic in the fields.
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:52.200]  No, no way. We'll be back.
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:03.200]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[3:16:03.200 --> 3:16:11.200]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[3:16:47.200 --> 3:16:54.200]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:17:00.200]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.

[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:44.200]  With the real time out of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks.
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:53.200]  Cobra thanks you for what you've done. Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet. Hail Cobra!
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:19:00.200]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[3:19:00.200 --> 3:19:03.200]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[3:19:03.200 --> 3:19:06.200]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:08.200]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  Look, in January 2016, I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:23.200]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:31.200]  Let me tell you something, man, I had an internal digestive problem and I was suffering with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[3:19:31.200 --> 3:19:33.200]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:39.200]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:42.200]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:47.200]  But I ordered it, it shipped to me. I got it, I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man.
[3:19:47.200 --> 3:20:04.200]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[3:20:04.200 --> 3:20:18.200]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:18.200 --> 3:20:36.200]  This is an article out of AbleToUK.com, Police Threatened Neighbour Who Cut Disabled Man's Lawn. And it's Darbyshire Police once again.
[3:20:36.200 --> 3:20:42.200]  It's the same police force that used a surveillance drone to publicly shame people who walked their dogs.
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:50.200]  God forbid, in remote locations, in fields in the Peak District, where obviously millions of people congregate, don't they know?
[3:20:50.200 --> 3:20:58.200]  Literally nobody does. And then they put it on Twitter and bragged about it and said, look, we tracked down their addresses via their number plates.
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:05.200]  This is the same police force who died a blue lagoon black to prevent people from gathering there.
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:13.200]  So all their most invasive enforcement measures are in places where social distancing naturally exists anyway.
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:21.200]  And it's completely unnecessary over the top draconian out of control to do this kind of thing. And here we have another example.
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:27.200]  Darbyshire Police have used threatening behaviour to a neighbour who cut the grass for a disabled man again.
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:38.200]  These areas all had massive problems with Islamic grooming gangs. Nothing was done. The people blowing the whistle on the Islamic grooming gangs were often targeted by the police.
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:44.200]  But if you cut the grass for your disabled neighbour, they're going to bang on your door within hours.
[3:21:44.200 --> 3:21:54.200]  Adrian Remington from Chesterfield received a visit from a friend who lives next door to him offering to help with the kind deed on March 31st a week after the lockdown was put in force.
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:22:01.200]  Remington, 63 years old, told the Darbyshire Times after my friend went on his way to police officers knocked on my door.
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:09.200]  One said, we've had a report from someone that your gardener entered your house in order to plug in your lawn mower. God forbid.
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:16.200]  Adrian corrected the officers telling them my friend never entered the house. I opened the window, my friend reached in with a lawn mower plug.
[3:22:16.200 --> 3:22:24.200]  Despite being explained the situation, the police went to the neighbour's house, issued them a warning and threatened the Good Samaritan with a fine if it happened again.
[3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:33.200]  And you know that all this is being done through neighbours snitching on other neighbours because of all their little petty resentments over the years.
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:39.200]  You know, maybe they've had a couple of house parties that were too loud or something. Can't really snitch on them for that.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:51.200]  But now it's free reign and the cairns of the world get to empower themselves with the power of something similar to what the stars he had back in East Germany.
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:59.200]  Now, obviously I'm not saying it's anywhere near that bad yet, but it's the same kind of mentality, this tattletale society.
[3:22:59.200 --> 3:23:07.200]  Another example, video, journalist gets home visit from UK police after he reported mosques flouting lockdown law.
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:21.200]  This was a radio host who filed a complaint with West Yorkshire police after he saw reports in local media that Muslims in Bradford and Leeds were gathering at mosques for Friday prayers in violation of COVID-19 isolation rules.
[3:23:21.200 --> 3:23:35.200]  Which by the way is happening across the Muslim world. In Egypt, they literally had a giant march down the street protesting against coronavirus, literally demonstrating against a viral infection.
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:43.200]  In Pakistan, the health authorities there tried to shut down a mosque. That was the law. They tried to shut it down under quarantine rules.
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:51.200]  A giant mob of a thousand people chased them away. We had that article a couple of weeks ago. In India, the same thing happened a couple of days ago.
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:24:05.200]  There's the one out of India, which is up on some of our news today, where again they found a local imam who was thought to have been infected with coronavirus along with about two dozen other people.
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:16.200]  They tried to go and talk to them about quarantining themselves and then 300 screaming Muslim worshippers came running out onto the street and chased the authorities away.
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:21.200]  But again, it's not just in Pakistan. It's not just in India. It's in Berlin, Germany.
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:29.200]  And I had the footage in my video from last week. We're outside one of the biggest mosques in Berlin.
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:37.200]  Not only crowds of people around the mosques engaging in worship, not social distancing as the Islamic call to prayer rings out.
[3:24:37.200 --> 3:24:44.200]  The streets were all crammed with people and then at the end of the prayer, they all got in their cars and drove home.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:52.200]  Even though the mosque was supposed to be closed, again, these measures aren't being enforced on certain demographics across Europe.
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:25:04.200]  So this radio host in the UK saw reports about that in local media, made a complaint to police that Muslims at these mosques were violating quarantine rules.
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:09.200]  What did the police do? They visited him.
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:15.200]  Similar to how people who report Muslim grooming gangs often get visited and targeted themselves by the authorities.
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:21.200]  They visited him, told him that he couldn't drive around, told him that that wasn't an essential journey.
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:26.200]  So again, the guy reporting the crime got investigated by the police himself.
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:31.200]  And that's just a few examples of what's been happening in the UK over the past week.
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:39.200]  Again, if these continue to build in severity and intensity and if these lockdown measures don't end,
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:47.200]  or at least are beginning to be scaled down in the next two, three weeks, the resentment is going to build and people are just going to start flouting the lockdown measures
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:55.200]  because they're going to see them not being enforced against some groups and they're going to see them being overly enforced to a draconian degree
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:03.200]  against people having picnics, people buying a bottle of wine at the shop and the police are no longer going to have the public support.
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:12.200]  So Downing Street was actually right and correct to come out and say, no, this is not in the law that you can only buy certain items in the supermarket.
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:20.200]  But some of these police chiefs are so idiotic and so power mad, they think they can make up the rules as they go along.
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:28.200]  Meanwhile, sticking in the UK, NHS hospitals have four times more empty beds than normal.
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:38.200]  Tens of thousands of NHS hospital beds remain unoccupied amid the coronavirus crisis, about four times the normal number due to huge ongoing efforts to free up space
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:41.200]  and a slowdown in admissions from other causes.
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  This is one of the problems with what some people may see as over preparation or over exaggeration of the dangers of coronavirus overwhelming the NHS and healthcare systems
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:27:07.200]  because people with other conditions, some of them may turn out to be life threatening in the longer term, are not going to hospital because they think they will be a burden on hospitals, on nurses and doctors.
[3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:11.200]  Some of those people, unfortunately, are going to die.
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:25.200]  So now we've got tens of thousands of empty beds, four times more empty beds than normal throughout the United Kingdom, despite the fact that we were told for weeks that this would overwhelm the NHS and the healthcare system,
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:29.200]  which is why we needed these quarantine lockdown measures in the first place.
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:36.200]  Turns out that hasn't happened and seemingly we have more empty hospital beds than ever before.
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:46.200]  Now part of the reason for that is, of course, because they built some of these temporary hospitals in major cities across the country, just as they did in the United States of America
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:51.200]  and with things like the ships coming into New York Harbor to take the over spill.
[3:27:51.200 --> 3:27:59.200]  So then we see this headline out of Sky News, coronavirus, New Washington Nightingale Hospital may never open, says NHS chief.
[3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:07.200]  A New Nightingale Hospital being built in Tynan, which is in the northeast of England, may never need to open, and AHS bosses said.
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:16.200]  The 460 bedside in Washington could be ready to take patients at the end of the month, but only if hospitals in the northeast are unable to cope during the coronavirus pandemic.
[3:28:16.200 --> 3:28:29.200]  So it's proven that they have been able to cope and even most of these over spill hospitals that have been built throughout the country are completely empty and not being used.
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:41.200]  Again, you could argue that was over preparation. You could argue that that's partly because people with other health conditions aren't going to hospital and that may indeed end up being fatal for some of them.
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:49.200]  Or you could argue that the coronavirus pandemic was exaggerated. Take your pick for many empty hospital beds in the United Kingdom.
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:29:12.200]  Don't go away, summit on news, we'll be back.
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:31.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:37.200]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:29:37.200 --> 3:29:55.200]  In the former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:30:06.200]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[3:30:06.200 --> 3:30:13.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the empire.
[3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:32.080]  3139-885-33139-885-33139 is the info war store hotline

[3:31:48.800 --> 3:31:55.520]  this special today at infowarstore.com it's wednesday morning i was just in a local Austin business
[3:31:55.520 --> 3:32:01.280]  that was basically empty and there were three motorcycle police in there and i said what do
[3:32:01.280 --> 3:32:07.760]  you think of this whole coronavirus thing they're like it looks like it's a hoax and i said yeah
[3:32:07.760 --> 3:32:14.080]  you're absolutely right the way it's been handled is a hoax taking everybody that dies who happens
[3:32:14.080 --> 3:32:20.560]  to test positive even though they die of a heart attack or cancer or diabetes as dying from coronavirus
[3:32:20.560 --> 3:32:24.640]  is the big one and then of course they're also classifying everybody that test positive for
[3:32:24.640 --> 3:32:32.640]  coronavirus period not just covered 19 as having it so they're they're upping a number of cases
[3:32:32.640 --> 3:32:36.480]  they're upping a number of deaths but still more people died this week and last week
[3:32:36.480 --> 3:32:41.680]  then died from the coronavirus from suicide so if anything is causing divorces and suicide
[3:32:41.680 --> 3:32:47.200]  and stir craziness and basic insanity and a giant power grab with big pharma preparing a force
[3:32:47.200 --> 3:32:55.520]  inoculation which they even admit will not protect you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus
[3:32:55.520 --> 3:32:58.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:06.080 --> 3:33:11.520]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:33:11.520 --> 3:33:22.560]  so nhs hospitals in the united kingdom have four times more empty beds than normal than usual
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:28.720]  times bear in mind we're coming out of a normal flu season the over spill hospitals that have been
[3:33:28.720 --> 3:33:34.960]  built in major cities throughout the country are empty and now sky news is reporting that one of
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:41.840]  them in the northeast of england may never open meanwhile if you look at the graphs total number
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:50.640]  of deaths in england and wales from 2010 to 2020 including up until week 13 of that year
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:58.240]  so for 2020 the number of deaths is 150 000 people now if you look at 2018 up until this point in
[3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:08.000]  2018 it was 164 000 people 2017 it was 153 000 people 2019 it was slightly below 146 000 people
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:17.360]  2015 it was higher 160 000 people so in most of the previous years over the past five six years
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:24.640]  in england and wales more people have died up until this point bear in mind they're treating deaths
[3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:28.960]  of people who already had underlying health conditions many of whom would have probably
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:37.040]  died anyway as covid deaths just because they call covid so the graph shows that in fact it's
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:44.480]  an average or below average first 13 weeks of the year in england and wales in terms of deaths
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:34:50.640]  and yet still headline out of bright bar coronavirus rather expected to announce lockdown
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:56.800]  will last three more weeks minimum they're not even going to address it they're not even going to
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:02.640]  talk about it for another three weeks in the uk senior minister dominick robb is expected to
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:07.200]  announce that the coronavirus lockdown will continue for another three weeks the first secretary
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:11.920]  of state is deputizing for prime minister borris johnson his report to be planning to announce on
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:16.720]  thursday that the government enforced social distancing measures will go on until may 7th
[3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:22.480]  bearing in mind austria which is one of the countries that closed its border early and took
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:28.480]  strong measures is reopening everything today not everything all at once but starting to reopen
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:35.680]  businesses today in fact over the next two weeks will it looks like have reopened everything yet
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:40.880]  here in the uk we're not we're saying we can't even have a discussion about opening anything for
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:46.800]  another three weeks the war cabinet of mr robb health secretary matt hankock cabinet office
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:52.000]  minister michael galvin chancellor of the ex jecker rishi sunak is anticipated to agree to
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:56.320]  the extension on thursday according to the times with the next review expected by the time the
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:36:04.560]  prime minister is recovered which is not likely to be soon so again despite the four times more
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:11.360]  empty hospital beds than normal these overspill hospitals across the country may never open
[3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:16.320]  because there's no demand for them the number of deaths in the united kingdom for 2020 or england
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:23.200]  and wales for 2020 the first 13 weeks of 2020 are below average compared to previous years yet
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:32.080]  we're still not talking about reopening anything for at least three weeks interesting given this
[3:36:32.080 --> 3:36:38.400]  headline out the financial times uk economy faces 35 quarterly plunge if lockdown lasts
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:46.160]  and again we know long-term economic decline leads to depression leads to suicide these
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:53.840]  depoverty leads to more death will absolutely devastating the economy lead to more deaths
[3:36:53.840 --> 3:36:59.120]  than coronavirus would have killed if you include the people with those pre-existing health conditions
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:06.400]  that would have died anyway the uk economy faces a 35 plunge in output in the second quarter of 2020
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:10.640]  if the lockdown to fight the spread of coronavirus remains in place for three months the country's
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:16.000]  fiscal watchdog has warned rather than this scenario government borrowing would rise by
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:23.120]  218 billion to 273 billion taking the deficit to 14 percent of gross domestic product the highest
[3:37:23.120 --> 3:37:31.120]  since the second world war well above the financial crisis peak of 10 percent the imf is also warning
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:38.720]  the world will very likely experience the worst recession since the 1930s given this given that
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:44.480]  the hospitals don't seem to be overwhelmed is it time to stop talking about relaxing these
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:50.640]  lockdown measures way earlier than they're telling us that they're even going to begin to discuss it
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:58.080]  that's going to be a big question meanwhile also in britain Reuters reports britain's itv
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:04.160]  under fire over presenters 5g coronavirus comments britain's biggest free-to-air broadcaster itv came
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:09.680]  under fire on tuesday after one of its leading presenters said no one knew whether a conspiracy
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:15.520]  theory that 5g mass helped spread the novel coronavirus was true or not now this is aim
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:21.440]  and homes a veteran presenter on itv a presenter in fact of this morning which is one of the
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:29.120]  biggest shows in the entire country he said it's very easy to say it's not true because it suits
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:34.000]  the state narrative and he basically said what i don't accept is mainstream media immediately
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:39.440]  slapping that down is not true when they don't know that it's not true now to be clear i don't
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:44.480]  think that 5g towers are linked to coronavirus they may be linked to a number of other health
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:51.200]  complaints probably not coronavirus what's interesting is the very fact that the media
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:57.840]  is editorializing by saying these ridiculous conspiracy theories about 5g they're dangerous
[3:38:57.840 --> 3:39:03.680]  we need to shut them down because people don't trust the media to such a great extent the fact
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:09.120]  that the media is putting that in their articles in their news clips makes people believe the
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:16.880]  conspiracy theory more for example skynews headline coronavirus attacks on 5g mobile
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:22.560]  mass surge over easter weekend attacks on mobile mass surged over the easter weekend
[3:39:22.560 --> 3:39:29.760]  with a further 20 suspected arson cases being reported then listen it says the attacks come
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:35.600]  as a deeply flawed and scientifically ignorant conspiracy theory is spreading linking the
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:41.520]  deployment of 5g antennas to the covid-19 outbreak that's not a news report that's
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:46.800]  editorializing so because the media and it's a similar situation in the u.s but because the
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:53.040]  media in the uk is not a trusted institution hasn't been a trusted institution for so long
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:58.960]  the fact that they editorialize and say these horrible dangerous ignorant conspiracy theories
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:04.720]  and put that in their articles there's so such little trust for them that makes people believe
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:11.840]  the conspiracy even more so the more the media talks about this the more videos youtube deletes
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:20.480]  on this like they did with the david ike interview the more they claim that this is bs the more 5g
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:25.920]  towers are going to be attacked because people hate the media and don't trust the media in fact
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:34.960]  i've got this poll up from you gov do britains trust the press says less than half of britain's
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:39.680]  44 percent now say they trust the institution to tell the truth despite his public charter to
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:45.920]  remain politically neutral talking about the bbc and again this holds true generally for the other
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:55.280]  mainstream news channels so if the media wants to stop people from attacking 5g towers probably best
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:01.600]  to stop reporting on these conspiracy theories about the link between coronavirus and 5g because
[3:41:01.600 --> 3:41:07.840]  they don't trust you when you say it's debunked people then believe it because you have such
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:13.520]  little authority remaining because you've lied about so many other things by the way the reason
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:20.240]  this amon holmes guy is talking about it is because he's friends with david ike who basically started
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:26.000]  the conspiracy theory you want to call it that back a few weeks ago in fact there was a broadcast
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:32.880]  of his one of his interviews on london real which is another semi-mainstream television channel in
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:38.800]  the united kingdom that's now being investigated by offcom and there's going to be further punishment
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:43.040]  for that so this story is just going to drag on and more 5g towers are going to get attacked
[3:41:43.040 --> 3:41:49.520]  not because people not because the conspiracy theory is true because but because the media is so
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:56.560]  distrusted and they continue to talk about it that people believe the opposite very interesting
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:04.400]  social phenomenon meanwhile chinese spokesman that blamed us army for coronavirus calls
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:11.680]  who objective and just i'm going to get into this after the break because the the who has come out
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:17.520]  with a new list of provisions that need to be in place before life gets back to normal but then
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:23.120]  they say basically life is never going to get back to normal and that people need to be re-educated
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:28.640]  into the new way of doing things what is the new way of doing things well it could be a government
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:34.240]  app on your phone which tracks your location to protect other people from coronavirus it could
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:40.560]  be the vaccine is that going to be mandatory is it going to be the chip is that eventually going
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:45.040]  to be mandatory we'll talk about that and other news stories on the other side breaking news at
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:55.920]  summit.news don't go away we'll be right back it doesn't matter how hard i want to fight if others
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:43:00.640]  human beings don't resonate with what i'm saying you don't spread the word if you don't buy the
[3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:05.440]  products to fund our operation the dog doesn't like when you get that you are patriots you are
[3:43:05.440 --> 3:43:10.400]  people that live and work in the real world of erase color and create and understand what's happening
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:14.640]  and that's why when you call in and thank me for what i've done it's really a sick joke thank you
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:19.200]  for what you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the unborn we believe
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:24.320]  in families we believe in the right to self-defense we believe in capitalism america and jesus christ
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:30.320]  number one and we believe in free speech and so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that

[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:54.400]  and i and others coming together so god bless you i don't need to remind you how four years ago i
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:59.760]  told you the polls against trump or fake he was winning by a giant margin but election fraud
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:04.720]  almost stole the election from trump and the american people well now they're pushing the
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:11.760]  idea that oh cancel the republic and democrat conventions maybe cancel the election a year
[3:44:11.760 --> 3:44:16.880]  like the olympics that's because they know trump in every internal scientific poll
[3:44:16.880 --> 3:44:23.440]  is 20 points ahead of the brain damage by so they can say sir you look big like the olympics
[3:44:23.440 --> 3:44:28.960]  let's back it off a year and then you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis no they need
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:34.560]  more time to cook up an assassination an economic collapse a new virus trump needs to say no in
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:40.000]  america we keep elections on time have the elections win by a landslide and not give the
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:45.760]  globalists what they want hillary biden they all want to suspend the election we shouldn't give
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:50.560]  them what they want we need to have a vote in america and reelect trump 2020

[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:14.800]  surgeon general coronavirus could force residents to continue social distancing for a year state's

[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:31.360]  normal so again when they talk about opening things up isn't really going to happen that quickly
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:36.800]  from what they're saying cnn a new study from harvard researchers published today in the journal
[3:49:36.800 --> 3:49:43.520]  science finds that prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:49.520]  harvard researchers say under current critical care capacities the overall duration of the
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:55.360]  covid epidemic could last into 2022 requiring social distancing measures to be in place
[3:49:55.360 --> 3:50:03.280]  between 25 75 of that time so again it's this whole idea of intermittent and they can just
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:09.600]  roll it back in at any point they like do you think that may be exploited for political purposes
[3:50:09.600 --> 3:50:15.760]  especially as we come up to a presidential election yes i think it probably will meanwhile
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:22.400]  breitbart reports unfathom unfathomable barely to the word australia hits who support for china
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:29.120]  wet markets and coronavirus epicenter the who has literally come out and said that it supports
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:36.240]  keeping these wet markets open now if you believe it came from the wet market then fair enough it's
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:41.920]  interesting isn't it how they've made this narrative that if you say it came from the wet market if you
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:48.560]  say these disgusting places unhygienic dangerous places need to be closed down if you say that
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:55.280]  eating bats is disgusting you're called racist you're called a bigger but then if you say oh okay
[3:50:55.280 --> 3:51:01.920]  then leave that let's say it came from a certain lab located in wuhan given that the bat that this
[3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:08.160]  coronavirus supposedly came from was the horseshoe bat which they say was never even sold in the
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:12.640]  wuhan meat market no you can't say that either because that's a dangerous conspiracy theory
[3:51:13.200 --> 3:51:19.360]  you can't talk about it from wherever it came just shut up don't say anything okay well australia now
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:25.920]  has confronted the world health organization which helped china cover up the outbreak of coronavirus
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:30.880]  for months on end but there the authority that we'll need to bow down to don't question them
[3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:36.160]  australia confronts them on tuesday of the claims it supports the so-called wet markets
[3:51:36.160 --> 3:51:40.160]  reopening in the chinese city of wuhan the source of the global coronavirus outbreak
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:44.320]  prime minister scott morrison demanded answers about the market saying it was unfathomable for
[3:51:44.320 --> 3:51:50.720]  the wi cho to back live animal markets at a time when the chinese coronavirus pandemic is sweeping
[3:51:50.720 --> 3:51:56.560]  the world so they've literally come out and said yep you can continue running these wet markets
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:52:03.120]  despite the actual state of them with literal rats crawling all over everything people eating
[3:52:03.120 --> 3:52:08.560]  diseased bats which cause global pandemics but you can open them up again americans though
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:14.960]  they'll still be locked inside the houses as the flights literally land from wuhan china meanwhile
[3:52:15.920 --> 3:52:21.840]  fox news reports coronavirus stay at home orders to protest nationwide amid fears of economic collapse
[3:52:22.400 --> 3:52:29.040]  we're now starting to see and i saw one of these in toronto very very small but there's one in
[3:52:29.040 --> 3:52:35.840]  michigan a couple of days ago protests against this lockdown at least 15 000 cars and trucks
[3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:40.320]  are expected to descend on michigan's state capital on wednesday to protest what they're
[3:52:40.320 --> 3:52:45.280]  calling governor gretchen whitmer's tyrannical new guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus
[3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:51.520]  in the state the so-called drive by demonstration in order to maintain social distancing aims to
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:57.680]  bring traffic to a gridlock and protest the stay at home stay safe executive order by whitmer a
[3:52:57.680 --> 3:53:03.600]  democrat mandating what businesses could stay home what some businesses could sell and ordering
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:09.680]  people in our state against any gatherings no matter the size or family ties one of the organizers
[3:53:09.680 --> 3:53:14.480]  said quote quarantine is when you restrict movement of sick people tyranny is when you restrict the
[3:53:14.480 --> 3:53:19.760]  movement of healthy people so we're going to see more of this and again if they lose the consent
[3:53:19.760 --> 3:53:26.880]  of the governed to be obedient to these lockdown measures then nobody's going to obey them so if
[3:53:26.880 --> 3:53:32.640]  you see if you keep pushing this tyrannical draconian measure and like individually targeting
[3:53:32.640 --> 3:53:38.640]  people for having picnics or for buying bottles of wine then the rest of the population is going
[3:53:38.640 --> 3:53:44.800]  to lose your trust right bar reports chinese spokesman that blamed us army for coronavirus calls
[3:53:44.800 --> 3:53:52.080]  who objective and just again the circle jerk between the who and china continues which is no
[3:53:52.080 --> 3:53:57.600]  surprise given that they helped each other cover it up given that the leader of the who is basically
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:54:03.760]  a chinese puppet who was once a member of a violent revolutionary communist party in ethiopia
[3:54:03.760 --> 3:54:10.640]  that literally denied health treatment to certain ethnic groups no surprise that those two are still
[3:54:10.640 --> 3:54:17.600]  joined at the hip meanwhile national file reports china restricts research into covet 19 origin as
[3:54:17.600 --> 3:54:24.000]  corona virus cases reappear so they're covering it up yet again as the world has begun to point
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:28.960]  the finger at china over the origin of covet 19 beijing has announced tightening restrictions
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:34.880]  over academic publications addressing the origin of the current global pandemic and again one of
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:41.760]  those academic publications that came out of china pointing the finger at the wuhan laboratory
[3:54:41.760 --> 3:54:46.000]  was deleted by the chinese authorities as well and now they're saying they're going to do more of
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:52.400]  that going forward but don't worry you can trust them and the who says that you can trust them and
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:58.880]  says that they've got corona virus under control okay the manual macron extends french coronavirus
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:04.480]  lockdown until may 11th these announced the emergency measures to send spread of wuhan virus
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:09.200]  will be kept in place for an additional month while admitting the government was not prepared
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:16.640]  for the pandemic those measures aren't in place in some areas of france and as we reported a couple
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:23.760]  of weeks ago in the migrant ghettos of paris french officials even suggested just letting them keep
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:29.280]  all the shops open and go about their business as normal because some cultures are evidently
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:34.560]  better than others the reality of course is that those people don't obey lockdown measures because
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:41.280]  they have a streak of criminality in many areas of those sensitive regions and so it's easier to
[3:55:41.280 --> 3:55:47.440]  just let them do what they want because in the words of this french official he wanted to prevent
[3:55:47.440 --> 3:55:54.640]  riots so you have to stay home you have to have the police check your shopping basket you have to
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:55:59.520]  have the police knock on your door if your family's out in the front garden if you're mowing the lawn
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:06.320]  for your disabled neighbor but in certain areas they don't even go near them india a huge crowd
[3:56:06.320 --> 3:56:11.200]  stops islamic cleric from being quarantined talked about this earlier video footage shows a huge
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:16.160]  crowd of muslims in india flooding the street and by the way before this incident even began they
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:24.160]  were all just milling around as normal it's just a complete joke there's literally no social distancing
[3:56:24.160 --> 3:56:31.360]  in that country at least out of these videos here report turkey plans to send fresh wave of corona
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:37.280]  infected migrants to europe of course we're constantly told that mass migration is cultural
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:43.440]  and richman meanwhile the european union literally had to pay turkey and its dictator leader
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:50.720]  six billion euros to stop migrants coming into europe because they're such they're such a helpful
[3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:56.480]  form of cultural enrichment you have to literally pay six billion in blackmail money to stop them
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:02.400]  from coming but now the turkish leader wants more concessions and voice of america reports that
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:06.880]  urdogan is planning to send a fresh wave of migrants to europe with officials fearing many
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:13.360]  of them will be infected with corona virus so the greek air force navy have stepped up patrols
[3:57:14.240 --> 3:57:18.160]  against what they see as another organized effort to unleash thousands of migrants
[3:57:18.160 --> 3:57:25.200]  as a political weapon again you pay six billion euros to keep them away the turkish dictator
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:31.360]  continues to use them as a political weapon yet culturally we're told continually that they're so
[3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:35.680]  very enriching doesn't really seem to be the case does it that's going to wrap it up for now
[3:57:35.680 --> 3:57:41.280]  current next is war room with our inshraya breaking news summit.news don't go away we'll be back
