[01:31.840 --> 01:39.120]  something but it's official human activity can cause earthquakes and this is
[01:39.120 --> 01:48.320]  a statement by the USGS the New York Times and Lawrence Berkeley laboratory
[01:48.320 --> 01:51.920]  and there's a nice boil down by Washington's blog that we've got linked
[01:51.920 --> 02:00.800]  at info wars.com and yesterday I read buried in a Denver Post article they
[02:00.800 --> 02:09.880]  had the USGS mentioning the fact that earthquakes can be triggered by human
[02:09.880 --> 02:13.880]  activity so we'll go over the different types of that also more cracks found in

[03:24.400 --> 03:29.960]  handed it off to Paul Watson to try to codify it because I ran out of time and

[08:32.760 --> 08:37.120]  admitted crimes committed by Goldman Sachs selling fraudulent derivatives into
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.880]  the world market to private investors and government alike she's going to be
[08:41.880 --> 08:44.720]  joining us coming up about an hour and a half from now and then Dr. Paul Craig
[08:44.720 --> 08:51.880]  Roberts via video Skype will also be joining us former head of policy at the
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.200]  Department of the Treasury former Wall Street Journal editor he's written a new
[08:56.200 --> 09:05.360]  article today that appears at info wars.com and it's titled 911 after a
[09:05.360 --> 09:11.880]  decade have we learned anything again dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us
[09:11.880 --> 09:18.240]  here's the article by Nomi Prince could blank fine face prison so that is coming
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.480]  up today Ron Paul was on Lou Dobbs last night and real clear politics has it and
[09:25.480 --> 09:32.080]  we may play the clip later if not it's also up at info wars.com and he was
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.760]  asked by Lou Dobbs on Fox Business whether he thinks there's going to be
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.240]  riots in this country because of the inflation tax because of dollar
[09:40.240 --> 09:45.240]  devaluation and Ron Paul goes on to say yes the inflation tax will end up
[09:45.240 --> 09:49.680]  triggering he believes civil unrest in this country mainly from the welfare
[09:49.680 --> 09:57.440]  class when their welfare checks are still delivered but are devalued and of
[09:57.440 --> 10:01.080]  course over the weekend we wrote an article and it got a lot of attention
[10:01.080 --> 10:05.680]  with Ron Paul talking about the fact that the FEMA camps are for the
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.640]  imploding of society and that that's basically what homeland security wants
[10:10.640 --> 10:17.640]  so Ron Paul has basically commented more on that issue Ron Paul is as Lou Dobbs
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.040]  pointed out last night is number one number two or number three in all the
[10:21.040 --> 10:27.360]  polls but Rick Perry in a new Gallup poll has surged with a big lead into the
[10:27.360 --> 10:32.600]  first place which shows with a lot of Americans they still go off quote looks
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.640]  I mean I guess to some people the captain Morgan asked look of Rick Perry
[10:37.640 --> 10:44.440]  looks better than Dr. Ron Paul it just shows you that you shouldn't judge a
[10:44.440 --> 10:48.760]  book by its cover but there's no doubt that in the last few months of the media
[10:48.760 --> 10:55.000]  as pure research documented has totally ignored Ron Paul when they do cover him
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.080]  and he gets the least coverage of any candidate it's almost all negative
[10:59.080 --> 11:08.080]  unless it's a Lou Dobbs or an Alex Jones or a judge Andrew Napolitano and that
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.480]  it shows how the image makers are still trying to cram their candidates down our
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.280]  throat but Ron Paul is getting a lot more attention than he did three and a
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.960]  half years ago so that is extremely positive and we've got to get the word
[11:20.960 --> 11:26.160]  out about Rick Perry I told you he was gonna run for president I told you the
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.520]  pledge was fake that he would break it he always intended to I told you he would
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.120]  go into the lead and that's what the top Republican strategists believe and
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.960]  that's what some of them have told me I live here in Austin Texas where Rick
[11:39.960 --> 11:45.120]  Perry has been the governor for 10 years I live in the Capitol I do have a lot
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.560]  of sources and I'm told that not only is he gonna be the front runner which he
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.040]  is now that he would run be the front runner and that he was designed to knock
[11:54.040 --> 11:59.520]  Ron Paul out he's a weapon system to co-op the Tea Party and true conservatives
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.000]  and libertarians and constitutionalist ideas that's why he's taking on the
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.040]  Federal Reserve that's why he's talking about the New World Order and stuff it
[12:08.040 --> 12:13.080]  is pure pure camouflage for what he really is and what he really stands for
[12:13.080 --> 12:18.640]  and we've got to get the real record of Rick Perry out now but if mainline
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.680]  Republicans embrace Mitt Romney or Rick Perry as some of them are doing you've
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.680]  got to say they get what they deserve the problem is though they're dragging us
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.320]  all along with them I mean we have got to continue to reach out to people with
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.080]  the fact that Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare and that his model that he wrote
[12:38.080 --> 12:45.080]  from Massachusetts well was adopted by the White House that's confirmed we've
[12:45.080 --> 12:50.160]  got to get the word out that Romney openly supports carbon taxes and paying
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.200]  the Rothschilds Rockefellers and Al Gore money to drive a car or to have
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.360]  electricity a indulgence tax to them we've got to get the word out about
[12:59.360 --> 13:03.960]  Rick Perry on forced inoculations and the fact that he knew it was killing
[13:03.960 --> 13:06.480]  people and still went ahead with it we've got to get out the fact that he
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.200]  went to Bilderberg then was anointed we've got to get the fact out that he
[13:10.200 --> 13:15.080]  tried to hand over 8,000 miles of Texas roads to Centro of Spain and that it
[13:15.080 --> 13:19.640]  violated the law we've got to get the word out that he gave illegals in state
[13:19.640 --> 13:25.280]  tuition and got awards from the Mexican government this guy is a monster and
[13:25.280 --> 13:31.200]  even if you support some of those things maybe you're a socialist or hate
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.480]  this country and think it's fun that we're being bankrupted and somehow buy
[13:35.480 --> 13:39.440]  into the fact that open borders is good and handing our roads over to foreign
[13:39.440 --> 13:43.400]  corporations to rape us and rob us is good you need to understand Rick Perry
[13:43.400 --> 13:50.680]  is a person who will do and say whatever he's paid to do and say and that's the
[13:50.680 --> 13:55.080]  issue now I'm gonna open the phones up because I've been striving to get to
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.760]  more of your calls and while the phones calls stack up I'm gonna cover some of
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.760]  the news but any issue you want to discuss Libya the economy Rick Perry
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.760]  being the leader I told you was gonna run told you was gonna pledge not to run
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.360]  told you he'd immediately be the front runner I mean that's not just our
[14:16.360 --> 14:19.640]  inside information it was obvious when Limbaugh and Doris Steeman said I'm
[14:19.640 --> 14:26.520]  drafting you are reluctant hero the whole thing is is is horrific and I
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.360]  have to put up with the emails and comments and calls by Rick Perry
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.520]  supporters saying that I'm an Obama supporter and then I'm going after Rick
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.200]  Perry because I'm a communist there's really no end to these people's want and
[14:40.200 --> 14:46.840]  ignorance a lot of them are political operatives but I have learned some more
[14:46.840 --> 14:58.280]  things about Rick Perry that just add a little more weight to all the wild
[14:58.280 --> 15:03.560]  stories about him but then I don't even know if I should dignify any of it
[15:03.560 --> 15:07.200]  because that's not the type of issues I get into but at the same time it just
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.600]  shows how the guy is the opposite of what you're told he is and what he
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.920]  presents and that's why the establishment likes Rick Perry because
[15:14.920 --> 15:20.840]  they can blackmail him yeah even of all the sex stories aren't true they can
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.920]  blackmail him with his record and anytime they want they can bring him
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.960]  down with his MF or comments that have been recorded and that's not
[15:31.960 --> 15:36.440]  presidential it can be running ads with his being stopped by the police and
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.680]  saying get out of here I'll do what I want I'm the governor that's not very
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.920]  presidential with his forced inoculations that's not presidential or
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.800]  American with his toll road activity in imminent domain they were gonna try to
[15:51.800 --> 15:56.240]  take hundreds of thousands conservatively of people's property and not pay
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.920]  them even what it was worth I mean it just goes on and on and so the biggest
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.800]  obstacle to Ron Paul winning is the dinosaur corporate whore media
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.160]  ignoring him but when they're forced to cover him lying about him or saying he
[16:11.160 --> 16:19.800]  can't win and then of course it's Rick Perry and he is their Ron Paul
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.440]  political lookalike that they're trying to basically insert into the race and we
[16:25.440 --> 16:30.120]  called it from the very beginning it wasn't hard to call people marvel that
[16:30.120 --> 16:36.240]  we can call all this stuff this is what I do I study this information the toll
[16:36.240 --> 16:46.920]  free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 well the council on
[16:46.920 --> 16:51.480]  foreign relations Richard and Haas their president this is a group sworn to get
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.360]  rid of the US sovereignty has come out and said Libya now needs boots on the
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.200]  ground they talked to you like your children separately the associated
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.680]  press Reuters London Guardian and Curt Nemo's written about this last night
[17:04.680 --> 17:10.560]  have all come out and admitted okay six months ago before the rebel uprising
[17:10.560 --> 17:18.120]  even started US British and other NATO special forces were in the country
[17:18.120 --> 17:22.120]  giving them weapons and advising them and it wasn't a demonstration or a

[18:30.520 --> 18:34.760]  main compound who knows if that's true we'll probably find out soon they could
[18:34.760 --> 18:39.640]  also killing throw his body down a mineshaft or put it in a vat of acid and
[18:39.640 --> 18:44.800]  then claim for decades that Gaddafi is creeping around staging terror attacks
[18:44.800 --> 18:49.480]  and then you know in 2020 claim the Navy Seals killed him and then of the Navy
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.320]  Seals talk they'll just blow their helicopter up but by the way that is
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.960]  what the Navy Seals think I've actually talked directly to the father of a Navy
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.880]  Seal a person I've known well I'm not gonna even say how long that could give
[19:03.880 --> 19:06.800]  it away and then I've talked to others that know Navy Seals and that's the
[19:06.800 --> 19:10.760]  word so they're they're living in reality that's good Libya's deadliest
[19:10.760 --> 19:14.480]  weapons not yet corralled again they're saying he's got all these secret weapons

[19:18.440 --> 19:23.720]  war and then they'll claim that Gaddafi they could claim the Gaddafi is still
[19:23.720 --> 19:26.880]  alive and you know that way they're not just fighting Libyans that don't want
[19:26.880 --> 19:30.920]  to be slaves and then other fighting Gaddafi that's only a possibility I'm
[19:30.920 --> 19:33.200]  not saying they're gonna go with that but I'll guarantee you that's being
[19:33.200 --> 19:40.280]  waived that being weighed they could kill him they could kill him and again say

[24:34.760 --> 24:39.080]  maybe a fire chief and a police chief but that's it because the firemen and
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.600]  police officers and others cannot be trusted there at the event to not say
[24:43.600 --> 24:47.680]  something about the deadly dust or 9-11 being an inside job they are now
[24:47.680 --> 24:52.880]  basically al-qaeda and have to go through a terror database Patriot Act

[25:11.520 --> 25:17.360]  relay in written form and here on the radio TV show to them all right let's
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.080]  go to Angel Curtis Verna Barney Scott and many others Angel in Tennessee
[25:23.080 --> 25:29.400]  welcome hi thank you I just have a quick question I just saw a clip from the
[25:29.400 --> 25:34.080]  O'Reilly Factor maybe it was last night saying that Fox News invited Ron Paul on
[25:34.080 --> 25:38.160]  and he declined I'm just wondering if you heard anything about that well that's
[25:38.160 --> 25:44.040]  just obviously ridiculous Ron Paul is on Fox News two or three times a week
[25:44.040 --> 25:50.080]  generally on Fox Business where they'll have him Ron Paul does most of the
[25:50.080 --> 25:57.600]  interviews he can Fox has been caught doing things like playing tapes from a
[25:57.600 --> 26:04.240]  year before with people booing Ron Paul when he won the CPAC poll this year he
[26:04.240 --> 26:10.680]  wanted the year before and a small group of Republicans that were for another
[26:10.680 --> 26:16.040]  candidate admittedly were given the microphone to boo two years ago into it
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.480]  so that was a hoax too and it came out that they'd been given the microphone
[26:20.480 --> 26:24.560]  whenever he was announced so they could boo a small group because there were so
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.800]  many people cheering and but still the cheers were louder than the booze but
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.840]  but Fox basically cranked it up to sound like he was being booed well this year
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.600]  when he won and they had to quote apologize and said it was a mistake they
[26:37.600 --> 26:44.920]  aired the tape from the year before and said oh look he got booed and so I would
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.200]  imagine I haven't seen this so I don't want to accuse him but you're saying you
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.960]  saw this they probably called and said can he do it right now or can he do it
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.880]  in two hours and if he already had I know for a fact Ron Paul before has
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.600]  turned down TV interviews because he scheduled on this show and I've you know
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.160]  had him pop on and say all right I got a vote in ten minutes sorry I can't give
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.560]  you 30 Alex or I got to go in 15 because I've got to squeeze another interview in
[27:09.560 --> 27:17.560]  so I'll guarantee you that if they did say that it's probably not true so now
[27:17.560 --> 27:20.480]  I know he doesn't really trust the O'Reilly factor and he's called Glenn
[27:20.480 --> 27:26.360]  Beck a demagogue so I know that he may have had the stipulation that hey it's
[27:26.360 --> 27:30.760]  got to be live but again I don't want to speculate for Ron Paul what did Lord
[27:30.760 --> 27:36.560]  O'Reilly say it was well he was saying it was actually a response to when Ron
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.320]  Paul was on with Megan Kelly and they were talking about him being ignored by
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.440]  the media and so on and so he was saying well they're you know he was whining
[27:45.440 --> 27:49.920]  because he was being ignored so we invited him on and he ignored us you
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.320]  know I'll say this about sure I'll say this about Bill O'Reilly he had a lot
[27:53.320 --> 28:02.560]  better show until the reports that he reportedly settled on of his sexual
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.520]  bullying and pervert talk came out and we got a totally new O'Reilly after that
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.720]  but he kept his job and suddenly O'Reilly supports VAT taxes and I've seen him
[28:14.720 --> 28:20.920]  support carbon taxes so I mean this is our great independent Fox News leader
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.080]  telling us how great value-added taxes are you know to get us out of debt Bill
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.000]  O'Reilly is a really smart guy Bill O'Reilly knows that we could have a
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.040]  hundred percent taxes and it wouldn't pay off these derivatives that we've been
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.760]  fraudulently signed on to how do I know Bill O'Reilly's really smart well when
[28:39.760 --> 28:46.840]  he worked at some of the weeknight news shows and of course some of those famous
[28:46.840 --> 28:50.880]  clips have been leaked where he says bleep it I'll do it live I've talked to
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.200]  reporters that worked with him and shot packages I talked to a guy that was one
[28:56.200 --> 29:00.880]  of his producers and he laughed and said oh yeah that's Bill Bill was a big
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.160]  conspiracy terrorist like you and then I went and found the news clips of him
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.240]  saying JFK was murdered by the government he Howard Hunt did it here's the
[29:09.240 --> 29:13.240]  proof and you could he was a totally different O'Reilly really seeming
[29:13.240 --> 29:17.120]  friendlier and nicer and really excited to be reporting it Bill O'Reilly when I
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.800]  first saw him on Fox I don't know it had to be 10 12 13 years ago he would talk
[29:21.800 --> 29:29.680]  about the Illuminati and have Tony Brown on okay so he Bill O'Reilly is a smart
[29:29.680 --> 29:35.680]  guy okay you know he knew this stuff when I was in high school that there are
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.800]  newscasts of him when I was in high school and reportedly he could never get
[29:40.800 --> 29:45.560]  really bigger jobs because he knew the truth Bill O'Reilly is a sellout he is
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.760]  disgusting we'll be right back thank you

[33:32.120 --> 33:38.920]  these people but when folks ask me about them I will tell you what I really think
[33:38.920 --> 33:43.400]  I mean I'll be honest with you to see all these old news reports of 15 20 years
[33:43.400 --> 33:49.440]  ago with Bill O'Reilly on news shows doing whole news packages about the
[33:49.440 --> 33:55.680]  Illuminati and the New World Order and secret government operations oh I ran
[33:55.680 --> 34:03.200]  Contra drug dealing JFK being murdered and by who you actually watch those
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.920]  newscasts 20 years later they're all very accurate and reportedly and the proofs
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.320]  there O'Reilly was chomping at the bit always fighting to get these type of
[34:13.320 --> 34:18.400]  stories on the air and now look at him all these conspiracy theorists think
[34:18.400 --> 34:24.000]  there's a move for a world government oh these 9-11 truthers are dangerous and
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.600]  you're looking at somebody who you know it is awake and is consciously up there
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.320]  doing this and I guess what happens is these guys get older they want success
[34:35.320 --> 34:40.120]  or somebody who they know that they're more talented than has gotten the
[34:40.120 --> 34:46.600]  promotion and they just say that's it I'm joining the dark side and I understand
[34:46.600 --> 34:54.000]  that I don't care about money fame fortune things like that but I am
[34:54.000 --> 35:03.360]  competitive and to see lesser men you know people like that sit up there and
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.680]  attain incredible success and notoriety by compromising that's one of the few
[35:08.680 --> 35:14.000]  areas that you know makes you just think just for a moment wow I you know could
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.480]  sell out and absolutely dominate all these people but why gain the whole world
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.200]  and lose your soul that's really gonna be my message to Steve Jobs it's not too
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.520]  late to turn back buddy boy I know all about you all about your co-founder
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.360]  bunch of transhumanist I know all about the big suicide operations there in
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.680]  China your horrible factories I know all about your carbon tax ideas I know all
[35:41.680 --> 35:49.000]  about IBM I know all about Bill Gates I know all about you boys and yeah most
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.320]  people don't live more than a year with the type of pancreatic cancer you had you
[35:53.320 --> 36:04.680]  have lived what seven years or longer and they've sure kept you alive but by the
[36:04.680 --> 36:07.960]  way they say they found the bill O'Reilly I told them go to YouTube and
[36:07.960 --> 36:14.560]  type in bill O'Reilly on JFK and I we hadn't found it by the time I went live
[36:14.560 --> 36:23.960]  again is it old what newscast is it because he worked a bunch of different
[36:23.960 --> 36:31.880]  places is it hard copy extra is it is it a local news station there's a whole
[36:31.880 --> 36:42.920]  bunch of them well I tell you what I'll just wait till later I'll come in and
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.080]  look and see what it is because the one I'm talking about you can tell which one
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.880]  it is I don't want to just sit here and say that Bill O'Reilly did all these
[36:52.880 --> 36:56.720]  countless newscasts about government assassinations government drug dealing
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.120]  JFK being murdered by the government and then not prove it to you well let's just
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.760]  blind play it I don't know what they're about to play what they found but here
[37:04.760 --> 37:11.480]  it is we have covered their tracks for almost 28 years with the most
[37:11.480 --> 37:16.080]  comprehensive study of the assassination found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.640]  and as Jeff Cole tells us in this special report the government stands by
[37:20.640 --> 37:31.280]  that study they're making a movie in Dallas
[37:31.280 --> 37:37.040]  movie about the crime of the century some say it's never been solved others
[37:37.040 --> 37:42.280]  claim they know the truth the course of American history was forever changed in
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.560]  a matter of seconds but what happened is still being questioned 28 years later
[37:47.560 --> 37:54.400]  who really shot president John F. Kennedy
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.200]  simpsons assassination conspiracy theories have captured the attention of
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.320]  the American public could it have been a mafia hit was it ordered by Fidel
[38:04.320 --> 38:10.320]  Castro or was it a coup a subversive element of our own government it was
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.240]  the responsibility of the specially appointed Warren Commission to find out
[38:14.240 --> 38:20.200]  in a 26-volume report they concluded only one gunman 24-year-old Lee Harvey
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.440]  Oswald assassinated the president but critics over the years have branded
[38:24.440 --> 38:29.000]  that report as a blue ribbon cover-up I think the people that alleged that this
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.800]  has been a major cover-up basically are intellectually dishonest attorney David
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.520]  Bellin was counseled to the Warren Commission it was his investigation that
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.520]  led to many of the findings that are still under fire today there is not one
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.240]  claim that any one of them makes that I cannot answer completely if given the
[38:48.240 --> 38:50.960]  opportunity
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.520]  no I've not been charged with that in fact nobody has said that to me yet there
[38:57.520 --> 39:02.440]  have been claims that Lee Harvey Oswald was a pansy set up by others to take the
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.400]  blame but one little-known discovery uncovered by the Warren Commission
[39:06.400 --> 39:10.880]  suggests that this was not the first time Oswald tried to commit a political
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.480]  assassination okay that's one I've never seen and looks even earlier he looks
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.560]  like he's 28 years old I've got some others from the early 90s where he
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.560]  comes right out and basically shows who killed Kennedy and talks about E. Howard
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.040]  Hunt and things but that's just what the guys found in a quick search there's so
[39:31.040 --> 39:34.480]  many of these you can look up Bill O'Reilly on CIA drug trafficking and
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.240]  they're hard-hitting reports now I've digressed I love taking calls but that's
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.920]  what always happens when I take them I'll run down rabbit trails but that makes
[39:41.920 --> 39:44.920]  the show more interesting and more informative who would have known we'd
[39:44.920 --> 39:50.240]  go in that direction let's go to Curtis in Virginia Curtis you're on the air
[39:50.240 --> 39:59.480]  thanks for holding hey Alex how are you today good all right I'm interested in a
[39:59.480 --> 40:13.480]  couple things one is direct protest and non violent action but I would like to
[40:13.480 --> 40:18.600]  see your listeners as well as yourself especially with you being such a strong
[40:18.600 --> 40:26.080]  example why don't we cut all our credit cards destroy all credit cards that's in
[40:26.080 --> 40:34.200]  the global system actually destroy them and focus more on credit unions and so
[40:34.200 --> 40:38.320]  forth and so forth I think that's a great idea you know I myself end up using
[40:38.320 --> 40:41.920]  big banks with our business system because it makes it easier to operate
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.920]  and get things done and it's approaching the point then I use smaller
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.400]  banks privately it's approaching the point where I won't even be able to use
[40:50.400 --> 40:53.800]  small banks of this continues and so we're getting to that point where they're
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.640]  trying to force everybody into mega banks and they're trying to force everybody
[40:58.640 --> 41:03.640]  into a cashless system and they're always demonizing cash and demonizing
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.200]  local banks and the private federal reserve controls the federal regulators
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.880]  that are harassing credit unions smaller local and regional banks so
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.160]  absolutely that that is a big thing you can do is get your money out of the big
[41:18.160 --> 41:23.160]  mega banks and get it into smaller banks and that's something we need to do
[41:23.160 --> 41:30.280]  here I mean I've done that to a great extent but still I've gots we've got
[41:30.280 --> 41:33.840]  some funds here in a big Texas bank that's really connected to some big
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.400]  ones are go ahead well now I just I just think that that can have an immediate
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.080]  impact if you could imagine you you have millions of listeners if only ten
[41:44.080 --> 41:49.080]  percent of your listeners destroyed all their credit cards they would see a
[41:49.080 --> 41:56.960]  drastic impact within a 24 40-hour time frame you know I just think it's time
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.520]  for us to start attacking right now we're on the decent if we attack by
[42:02.520 --> 42:08.160]  cutting the money line to the giant that we're feeding they're going to have to
[42:08.160 --> 42:11.400]  react they're going to have to change their game plan we got to get off of the
[42:11.400 --> 42:15.400]  defense and get on the offense and that's one strategic way that each
[42:15.400 --> 42:20.920]  individual can can can have some type of input I've already destroyed all my
[42:20.920 --> 42:26.320]  credit card if I do anything is dead and it's money that I already have in the
[42:26.320 --> 42:33.840]  bank that I'm spending well that is a good point that credit cards are bad to
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.400]  begin with unless you have one for an emergency it's good to live within your
[42:38.400 --> 42:44.080]  means this look when I was going to college I got credit cards in the mail
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.680]  sometimes three four times a week but always at least one a week offering me
[42:48.680 --> 42:55.000]  you know a new credit card but without rages interest now as soon as I became
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.960]  solvent I don't get all these credit cards in the mail anymore but I talked
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.880]  to college students and people that are broken others they get them all the time
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.240]  because it's all made up fiat currency to explain what fractional reserve
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.040]  banking is a Bank of America a Wells Fargo you know both of those war and
[43:13.040 --> 43:18.520]  Buffett outfits he's a large part of each one of them when you have one of
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.840]  those credit cards they are loaning you money that doesn't even exist they're
[43:22.840 --> 43:27.120]  getting interest they get $1 of a depositors money they can loan out 10
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.320]  but since the end of Glass-Steagall they can loan out a trillion dollars out of
[43:32.320 --> 43:36.440]  nothing if they can get away with the fraud that's what's happening with the
[43:36.440 --> 43:41.480]  too big to fail derivatives they've been caught and instead of going to jail our
[43:41.480 --> 43:45.920]  credit and faith and our tax money's pledged to them and they have Bill O'Reilly
[43:45.920 --> 43:50.200]  come out and say oh I I think we may need to get some more taxes
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.040]  Mitt Romney came out yesterday and said he's not adverse to new revenue streams
[43:54.040 --> 43:59.840]  meaning new taxes they doubled the size of Texas government got a bunch of new
[43:59.840 --> 44:03.160]  taxes passed when Rick Perry was governor for 10 years and I've got to
[44:03.160 --> 44:09.640]  hear idiots outside Texas when I've covered Texas you policy closely you
[44:09.640 --> 44:13.040]  down at the Capitol all the time when it's in session and they'd lecture me
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.920]  about Rick Perry made Texas great what I mean these people are really
[44:17.920 --> 44:21.760]  collectivist they're like these idiot Obama supporters that think he was going
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.680]  to give them free gas in a car in a house remember all those people going oh
[44:25.680 --> 44:28.840]  thank you mr. president right when he got elected before he was actually in
[44:28.840 --> 44:32.440]  office when he was president elect saying all my problems are solved and
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.800]  Obama didn't say whoa whoa whoa I'm not gonna be able to wave a magic wand they
[44:36.800 --> 44:42.560]  believe it they believe Rick Perry is gonna go into office and magically fix
[44:42.560 --> 44:47.160]  everything for him my friend what do you think of that right I'm it's all it's
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.600]  all BS it really is what one last point hours because I know you got other
[44:50.600 --> 44:56.320]  college the same giant that we're complaining about every day when you show
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.960]  it's the same giant we're feeding every time we use a credit card I agree with
[45:00.960 --> 45:07.800]  you we got a stop feeding the giant it we're ever gonna fight back as long as
[45:07.800 --> 45:13.160]  they have power and money our money and keep putting us in debt they're winning
[45:13.160 --> 45:18.000]  so we can complain to we're blue in the face we got to cut off the money supply
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.240]  Curtis Curtis well said we've got to come out of Babylon and that doesn't
[45:23.240 --> 45:26.480]  mean you have to do it a hundred percent nobody can do that unless you're
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.640]  independently wealthy and just want to go hide out in Montana we've got to do
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.760]  what we can do we've got to do as much as we can do or if we do something hit a
[45:36.760 --> 45:42.440]  hypocritical point out we're doing it you know when I criticized Steve Jobs
[45:42.440 --> 45:49.280]  later I'm gonna stay on record I'm a hypocrite I have used Apple products for
[45:49.280 --> 45:56.840]  20 years I have I mean it's all made in slave facilities to it's all assembled
[45:56.840 --> 46:00.920]  in in in slave style facilities there's some smaller companies that aren't
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.040]  based in the US Canada other areas but at the end of the day when we buy goods
[46:06.040 --> 46:11.600]  made by slaves we move ourselves a degree closer to those slaves it's the
[46:11.600 --> 46:18.280]  giant sucking sound it's it's the it's the problems that Ross Perot talked
[46:18.280 --> 46:22.520]  about and got laughed at by Al Gore a guy that sold the public that carbon
[46:22.520 --> 46:30.280]  dioxide is gonna kill him you know we're gonna send reporters out today for the
[46:30.280 --> 46:34.960]  special report tonight in Austin to ask folks if carbon dioxide is evil and
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.520]  we'll see if how many Austinites get scared when they even hear the word
[46:39.520 --> 46:43.640]  good because I've seen other newscasters do it I've done it before you can come
[46:43.640 --> 46:48.720]  up and say should we ban dihydrogen monoxide it's in a lot of things should
[46:48.720 --> 46:52.280]  we ban it and over 90% of the people when I've done it say ban it right now
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.880]  of course dihydrogen monoxide is water ladies and gentlemen nine out of ten
[46:56.880 --> 47:06.400]  people or more will say banned sodium chloride stable salt stable salt so they
[47:06.400 --> 47:10.880]  just they just prey on people's ignorance and I'm tired of it when you've
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.080]  got a group of people totally ignorant and you got a bunch of criminals running
[47:15.080 --> 47:18.880]  them through a high-tech slick media with political prostitutes that'll sit up
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.400]  there and say whatever they're told off that teleprompter for 30 pieces of
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.720]  silver your society goes over the edge see this is what this is my message to
[47:26.720 --> 47:32.160]  to mid-level corrupt people the big social engineers know this but my message
[47:32.160 --> 47:34.920]  to mid-level people who never really think about it you're just getting the
[47:34.920 --> 47:43.360]  money and running corruption doesn't just sit at one spot you don't just buy
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.000]  into a little bit of corruption and that's the end of it there's always
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.200]  somebody willing to do something even more corrupt more out of control and
[47:52.200 --> 48:00.080]  it's a race to the bottom I've seen sociological reports on pornography and
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.400]  how it just gets more disgusting more degenerate more dehumanizing to the
[48:04.400 --> 48:12.280]  women more circus oriented because nothing shocks people anymore until it's
[48:12.280 --> 48:17.720]  just the most horrible things you can imagine because we've been dehumanized
[48:17.720 --> 48:24.680]  we've been programmed and this has been done consciously consciously to make us
[48:24.680 --> 48:30.480]  more easy to control and more dumb down let's go ahead and talk to Verna in
[48:30.480 --> 48:34.960]  Canada thanks for holding her on the air oh hi Alex thank you for taking my
[48:34.960 --> 48:41.040]  call listen a while ago I had a chance meeting with a young Canadian soldier
[48:41.040 --> 48:46.120]  right and it turned to politics and I asked him and he heard of the New World
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.600]  Order and he said oh sure and he said do you know about the camps and I said
[48:51.600 --> 48:57.000]  what camps and he said well the Canadian government built 12 of them in the north
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.640]  of Canada right he said there were three in the Yukon six in the northwest
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.080]  territories and three in Labrador so I said under whose watch did they build
[49:07.080 --> 49:12.800]  those and he said Pierre Trudeau well any Canadian worth his salt knows that
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.440]  Trudeau was an ardent communist right and I said are they still functioning and
[49:17.440 --> 49:21.920]  he said oh yeah he said I flew supplies into them and he said and I could go to
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.680]  jail for telling you this he said I had to sign a sworn statement on it well
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.680]  of course they do but let me add we have the congressional hearings and it's the
[49:29.680 --> 49:34.120]  same program in every industrialized nation just like for 39 years all babies
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.880]  at birth have their blood taken whether it's Australia or the US you're told the
[49:37.880 --> 49:41.320]  same cover story oh the health department does a blood test notice we all
[49:41.320 --> 49:47.800]  have health departments they were set up under eugenics 1910 through 1925 or so
[49:47.800 --> 49:54.400]  England Germany Canada Mexico had them Australia New Zealand northern Europe
[49:54.400 --> 49:59.840]  it's all standardized and now they just admit with the emergency centers
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.800]  establishment act what we already knew it's the old military bases they list
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.320]  them it's just further funding and going public with it because these are for
[50:08.320 --> 50:11.720]  your own good during emergencies don't you want to go to a government camp
[50:11.720 --> 50:17.560]  verna no no not a chance you know what my my newfoundland
[50:17.560 --> 50:22.120]  fisherman father taught me it's better to die on my feet than live on my knees
[50:22.120 --> 50:26.880]  absolutely that's a true credo of any free human did he say anything else
[50:26.880 --> 50:33.240]  about the loving facilities yes he said that they each one accommodates 15,000
[50:33.240 --> 50:38.040]  people right and you know when I was a kid my father was a Newfoundland
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.800]  fisherman and when I was a kid he used to fish in Labrador and we'd go up
[50:42.800 --> 50:48.400]  there in the summertime and let me tell you Alex when you cross the Straits of
[50:48.400 --> 50:54.240]  Belisle and you hit Labrador about two miles past there the earth dropped off
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.320]  it is the most desolate God forsaken place on earth it's like a Soviet
[50:59.320 --> 51:04.160]  gulag you've been lied to lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine the
[51:04.160 --> 51:07.680]  government and the talking heads in the media the market has proven that's more
[51:07.680 --> 51:12.160]  like a casino than an investment and if you've had enough and want to keep your
[51:12.160 --> 51:16.360]  hard-earned money safe this message is for you my name is Brett kitchen and
[51:16.360 --> 51:20.240]  after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed several years ago I

[55:15.720 --> 55:20.760]  ever say his name he's just as evil
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.560]  that was weird I was doing a little bit about the FEMA camps and suddenly my
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.880]  microphone everything went I thought they were like playing thunderstorms in
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.440]  the distance and it's some technical difficulty guess I'm not allowed to who
[55:52.440 --> 55:54.640]  knows if the listeners are even hearing that maybe I'm not allowed to talk bad
[55:54.640 --> 56:00.080]  about Big Brother here maybe I've committed some type of thought crime you
[56:00.080 --> 56:10.720]  guys hear that yeah he heard you heard the rumble to John oh well whatever we
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.880]  got a rumble in the background of the show now let's go ahead and talk to
[56:14.880 --> 56:19.840]  Barney in Texas Barney good to hear from you welcome thanks for having me on Alex
[56:19.840 --> 56:26.280]  I wanted to bring up about the 9-11 memorial coming up and it seemed really
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.720]  strange to me that they announced that Obama would be there you know like a
[56:30.720 --> 56:35.080]  month ago in the news on a Google article aren't you glad that the terrorists
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.400]  firefighters and police aren't allowed to be there the first responders well
[56:39.400 --> 56:42.640]  yeah that's kind of sick but it just felt kind of strange like that same
[56:42.640 --> 56:45.720]  feeling I had you know that gut wrenching feeling you were talking about
[56:45.720 --> 56:51.400]  yesterday that I had on 9-11 and when and during Obama's and his speech his
[56:51.400 --> 56:54.960]  first speech when he got elected that's the same feeling I got when I saw this
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.400]  article so it seems like that would be a perfect time for them you know I just
[56:59.400 --> 57:02.680]  saw an article today that they said it would be about 300,000 people at this
[57:02.680 --> 57:07.320]  memorial that'd be a perfect time for them to stage a false flag attack the
[57:07.320 --> 57:13.360]  other thing I wanted to mention was it now listening to you since 2009 you
[57:13.360 --> 57:16.520]  should let people know they can't enjoy movies anymore that's what I used to do
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.960]  and enjoy just go into the movies and forgetting about everything but now like
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.360]  I went and saw that about six months ago I saw that movie limit list about where
[57:25.360 --> 57:29.160]  the guy takes the pill and can do anything it opens up his mind or whatever
[57:29.160 --> 57:35.200]  and before the whole Libya thing started with the oil and the Libya in the news
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.200]  it mentioned down there about Libya is the key and the oil so it's really
[57:39.200 --> 57:44.840]  freaky the insiders love to also brag to each other but also precondition the
[57:44.840 --> 57:49.000]  subconscious mind because if your mind's already seen it you then expect it
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.040]  most of the big modern warfare video games that come out will a year or two
[57:54.040 --> 57:59.840]  before have the exact conflict and the real battles in it precisely in order
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.400]  and they do that in all the movies and then there's hundreds of examples but
[58:03.400 --> 58:09.040]  six months before 9-11 they aired the lone gunman spinoff of the X files where
[58:09.040 --> 58:12.680]  the government hijacks a jumbo jet to fly it in the World Trade Center using
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.880]  remote control technology and uses a drill to make NORAD stand down and then
[58:17.880 --> 58:22.680]  that exactly happened on 9-11 and even attack Afghanistan that's the target in
[58:22.680 --> 58:28.440]  that episode and then Dean Haglin the star of the show contacts me shows up
[58:28.440 --> 58:36.240]  my house and says it's really weird the CIA planted that story on us I mean yeah
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.520]  they just love to let everybody know hey we did it
[58:43.360 --> 58:51.920]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network when you're out on the

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:30.280]  Alex Jones okay we're continuing with your phone calls know me Prince former
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.440]  managing director of Goldman Sachs he's gonna be joining us because there's a
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.760]  lot of even mainstream media discussion about the head of Goldman Sachs
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.280]  will he be indicted for the admitted crimes he's hired the former in Ron
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.320]  defense attorney so we're gonna be breaking all of that down also we've
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.480]  got under Paul Craig Roberts joining us I've got a lot of other news I want to
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.120]  get into dealing with Libya obviously as that unfolds we got some interesting
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.920]  earthquake news that I'll also get to where even the New York Times and the
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.720]  USGS the Geological Survey admits human activity is causing earthquakes thought
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.240]  that was the stuff of conspiracy theories but right now let's go ahead and
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:18.280]  go to Scott in Idaho welcome Scott thanks Alex just about those earthquakes I was
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.160]  wondering if you've ever seen the Navy the map that was done by the Navy that
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.480]  shows the east and west coast flooded and basically the United States broken
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:34.800]  in half along the New Madrid fall line yeah I've I've seen different simulation
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.240]  maps yes I don't know if I've seen the one you're talking about yeah it's you
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.720]  can just Google a name a future Navy map and it was actually a map done by the
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.960]  United States Navy but that what I want to talk about was another way that we
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.680]  can cut off the money supply to the New World Order and that would be by way of
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.960]  curtailing the law enforcement growth industry and learning exercising our
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.120]  rights knowing our rights in the courts for instance the Rossum food raid I
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:14.400]  read where they had to pay quite a substantial amount in bail and nobody
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.440]  in this country is it has to pay bail Alex unless they've committed a capital
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.560]  crime there's a law in all the court rule books of all the states it's called
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.920]  the bail rule no sir I know but the public doesn't I'm glad you raised that
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.520]  I have been arrested before for political protest here in Austin and they
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.440]  come to you and say well a bail bondsman can get here or you can sign this form
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.240]  and both are fraud because it's for a misdemeanor and when you sign the form
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.160]  you waive your rights and agree you're guilty and agree to a deferred
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.400]  judification right there if they choose and agree to go to all these classes for
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.280]  drug alcohol abuse violence and so and the general public's not taught any of
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.120]  this they just fill the form out I mean it's all just done by compliance
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:16.160]  comply you know retina scan to get into your business hand scan to get into
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.600]  places like SeaWorld or Disneyland we've got to start saying no to this
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.080]  garbage not just like cattle going into the going into the gas chambers it's
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:35.320]  actually a battleground and the judge and your lawyer and the prosecutor none
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.920]  of them are on your side and the Supreme Court decided many years ago that
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.040]  any rights not timely demanded are deemed to be waived so unless we're in
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.200]  court demanding our rights we're continually waiving those rights and
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:57.160]  one of those rights is to be adjudicated to be innocent until proven guilty it's
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.920]  simply a matter of going into court and demanding your right to be released on
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.360]  your own recognizance due to the fact that you have substantial ties to the
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.240]  community you're you have family in the community you're employed in the
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.920]  community and and you've never failed to miss a court appearance those four
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.760]  things alone would qualify anybody in any criminal court in this country to be
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:26.000]  released on their OR but the judge is not going to tell you about that option
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.840]  no it's all it's all a racket it's all a scam and they get judges do little
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.520]  corrupt things at first and if they'll agree to it they move up they get support
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.200]  they get they get nominated they get elected depending on what type of court
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.360]  system it is you're absolutely right we've got to rediscover the law not say
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.600]  all this courts a corrupt well yeah they are corrupt and you've got to learn
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.520]  just how corrupt they are and to continue to educate the public about it
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:05:04.280]  they can't stop all of us more calls a ton of news straight ahead stay with us

[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.960]  and hired the high-powered criminal defense attorney that represented in Ron
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.600]  and Ken lay we're gonna be going over that with her coming up at about 23
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.200]  minutes from now I want to go back to your calls but first let me get into
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.200]  some really interesting news because I've seen a lot dealing with these new
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.080]  chips hospital patients now being microchip with electronic tattoos and
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:24.480]  many of these are so thin that you can't even see it and obviously IBM is
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.600]  coming out with systems that do go under the skin and are so small they can't
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.520]  be seen if they're telling you they're coming out with it you know they've had
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.000]  it for quite a while now they're also coming out with neural net systems that
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.400]  are so small they can't be seen with a naked eye that can be put into the brain
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.800]  via a vaccine all of that is being announced being microchipped is now
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:52.080]  being spun as a method of protecting the health of hospital patients to help
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.920]  mask the practice of this bodily invasion with a trendy high-tech
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.200]  appearance microchipping sensors are being referred to as electronic tattoos
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.320]  that can even attach to human skin and stretch and move without breaking they
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.520]  also have the physical barcodes and high-tech barcodes that are being
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.040]  physically tattooed on and they're talking about making the military do it
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.720]  you can even pull up mainstream news articles about tests with the US Army
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.080]  where they've had them in planet with chips supposedly the comparisons of this
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.760]  hair thin electronic patch like to the chip of an electronic tattoo are being
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.560]  made because of how it adheres to the skin like a temporary tattoo using only
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:40.920]  water the small chip is less than 50 micrometers thick which is thinner than
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.440]  the dynamometer of a human hair it is being marketed as safe and easy way to
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.400]  temporarily monitor the heart and brain and patients while replacing bulky
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:56.640]  medical equipment currently being used in hospitals and again all of this has
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:04.400]  positive uses the problem is that it also has oppressive uses and I'll get to
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:10.440]  some of those in a moment the devices use micro electronics technology called
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.800]  epidermal electronic systems or EES's and is said to be a development that will
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.960]  quote transform medical sensing technology computer gaming and even spy
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:27.200]  operations according to a study published last week yeah they've had some
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.960]  of the big video game heads come out and say soon if you want to play on our
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.080]  platforms you'll have to have a chip including one in your brain and it'll
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.880]  be so quick so easy because it won't be brain surgery it'll be an injection and
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.480]  it will go to that area of your brain this is what they're coming out with and
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.320]  as long as it's trendy and cool and he won't be part of that community and who
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.760]  the rock stars get it and the supermodels get it and you get to interface
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.840]  in game with your favorite supermodel or at least a simulation of her you're
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:06.120]  going to do it oh you get in the VIP area with the bimbos at the club they've
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.200]  had that now for 10 years gotta take the chip at the Baja Beach Club in
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:17.040]  Barcelona Spain or we're in Miami Florida this is how they're going to
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:22.360]  sell it the Pentagon back in the 70s was declassified in 2001 said we're gonna
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.080]  make troops take it make prisoners take it but also sell it as a security
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.240]  function for children and we're then going to basically make it trendy and
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:36.960]  then make it the law and they predicted that by 2020 2025 that almost all
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.560]  Americans will have brain ships that's actually in my book to sent into
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.680]  tyranny now out of print but I have the government documents but it's available
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:50.140]  with the PDFs and documents at prisonplanet.tv if you'd like to read
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:55.120]  9-11 descent in to tyranny and print that off and show people a lot actually has
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.400]  the URLs to the Federation of American Scientists who released the quote
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:08.520]  declassified document then the army requested them to reclassify it kind of
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.920]  like the Sunshine Project got a declassified document about the Marine
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:18.960]  Corps testing lethal and non-lethal sprays out of helicopters to wipe out the
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.920]  population or knock out the population and the Sunshine Project was asked to
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.560]  take it down off their website by the Marine Corps and the Marine Corps
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.920]  threatened them and they published the letters and wrote about the phone calls
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:38.560]  and then finally under other threats and pressure they did remove it not before
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.240]  it went on the different digital archives out there and we dug that back up
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.760]  again a few weeks ago and I meant to do a report on it but that's the type of
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.960]  stuff all these hundreds of reports that I've mentioned or barely covered on the
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.400]  radio it's not just going to be whatever the big news of the day is it's not
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.000]  just going to be on the show you know the latest information though that will be
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.240]  there too with my analysis my view my take in my my guest analysis but it's
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.600]  going to be a lot of big key issues that aren't getting attention that's what
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.960]  we're going to be covering on the show as well analyzing media propaganda and
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.040]  so much more I'm so excited about it and it's your membership at prisonplanet.tv
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.160]  that is the financial support to grow and build this system that's just going
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.160]  to get better and better we're going to have a special report tonight seven
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.520]  o'clock central at prisonplanet.tv so if you're not a member please become one
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:36.240]  today and starting next week we're going to roll out some new features on
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:45.960]  prisonplanet.tv as well now continuing imagine it says the hair thin chip was
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.400]  developed by an international team of scientists researchers from the United
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.080]  States China and Singapore and is described in the Journal of Science and
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:00.840]  then it goes through it imagine the spy capabilities of this you think there's
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:08.320]  already problems with perverts that own salons or tanning places or gyms where
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.160]  good-looking women are working out who are videotaping women in the shower or
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.440]  getting dressed you think there's a problem with public schools under
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:22.280]  federal grants watching kids over their laptops at home and admitting it or
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.200]  putting them in the school bathrooms just to see if they can get away with it
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.200]  and in most places they do yeah we're watching your sons and daughters shower
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:36.280]  it's for their security and then it from Tennessee to California it's come out in
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.120]  mainstream news that it's hooked into federal nets and the feds are watching
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.400]  your kids I think it's just stick their hands down your pants at the airport
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.960]  microwave you it's all about pimping it's all about the pimp game it's all
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.360]  about dominating breaking your will training you to accept more and more
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.360]  moving the overton window what's the overton window we've talked about it
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.400]  for more than a decade and Beck's got a book out about it
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.600]  why I'm mad at Glenn Beck because the book is so accurate and so good how can
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.560]  he then not tell the whole truth once he's on the air well I guess he did
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.640]  start telling the truth and got fired I'm so I don't want to get off into Glenn
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:25.160]  Beck the point is is that the overton window is what is politically acceptable
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:32.160]  50 years ago America was a different safer place in many respects but the
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.520]  family's a thing of the past in many cases it's under assault where it's left
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:42.780]  crime has exploded society degenerated they have moved the overton window they
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.680]  have gotten you to accept anything and that's why they're going yeah there are
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.160]  some camps for your safety now but you're still a conspiracy theorist if you
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:59.240]  think they're bad they're there to help you okay now speaking of drones
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:13.160]  Big Sis gives green light for drone that tases suspects from above many chopper
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.680]  and we have some video of this for Prison Planet TV viewers let's let's
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.480]  let's let's roll that in the background Big Sis gives green light for drone that
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:28.080]  tases suspects from above now I remember a decade ago in Jane's weapons
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.240]  quarterly seeing these drones that look like flying saucers it's just a
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:38.760]  helicopter blade inside a protective dome that have long-distance taser
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:46.480]  rockets they fire at you similar what police have fired out of shotguns nerve
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:53.880]  gas knockout gas regular shotgun rounds poison darts you name it now they've
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.240]  got a new helicopter out that Big Sis is belling up to and saying they're
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.600]  gonna purchase some of remember a couple years ago a company came out with
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:08.200]  taser bracelets for all air traffic for for all commercial flyers every man
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:14.600]  woman and child will wear a taser bracelet around their their wrist and
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.680]  homeland security actually had meetings and said they would like to adopt this
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.400]  so they can sell to the public but first they got to stick their hands down
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.320]  your pants the shadow Hawk is a 50 pound mini drone chopper that can be fitted
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:32.320]  with the X ERP taser with the ability to fire four barbed electrodes that can
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.680]  be shot at a distance of 100 feet delivering the neuromuscular incapacitation
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.440]  of the victim the drone can travel a top speed of 70 miles per hour and can
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:50.320]  operate for 3.5 hours over land and sea and it shows them chasing the
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.840]  evil Patriots here in the video is the company video is very proud of it
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:00.520]  chasing them down and catching them that way the officers don't have to get
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:05.280]  in danger ah yes but is it a crack dealer selling government crack shipped in
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:11.520]  no it's not that type of criminal no it's the person who was trying to run to
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.360]  the hills to get away from the system they didn't want to take the chip they
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.520]  didn't want to turn their kids over for the new behavioral injection that they
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.480]  are now rolling out announcing that you'll take these shots and never get
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.400]  angry at the government again never be depressed again times of London
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.720]  associated press he doesn't want to take the shot oh you better believe those
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.840]  operating the helicopter or the computer systems that'll operate him in the
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.520]  future without the need of man you know they've had their injections in this
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:43.600]  near future dystopia but did the near future dystopia deliver the life
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:51.080]  extension that Steve Jobs was looking for no it didn't deliver it you can keep
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.800]  somebody alive for seven years that would normally die in one year from that
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.960]  form of cancer so see all the evil arrived but all the goodies that were to

[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:25.520]  the original since 1976 I would warn people 16 years ago about the military
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.840]  training police working with police secretly being involved in law
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.600]  enforcement activities and folks would say that's insane we're not a third
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.160]  world country we're not Soviet Russia come on that's crazy and I'm like well
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.680]  here's the proof here's the Rand Corporation here's documents here's
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.040]  eyewitnesses here's an emergency manager from Kingsville Texas who's a veteran
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:53.640]  who was approached about martial law preparations I mean this stuff is going
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.880]  on and it's been going on for a long time as the bankers I taken this country
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.760]  down they're making great profits creating the derivatives in the last 15
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.000]  years to buy the world up through their fraud but in the final equation if they
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.440]  don't then put in a dictatorship of the military industrial complex then the
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.160]  oligarchs will end up getting in trouble for wrecking the society but if they
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.280]  wreck it then they get to take it over if they stay in charge it's very simple
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.640]  that's why they will bring in hardcore tyranny because they know you've woken
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.880]  up they know you're only gonna get more and more awake so they're racing to try
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.480]  to find police and military that will engage in thugism and they know a lot
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.920]  of police and military won't do it in person to person so they're going to
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:48.800]  robots they're going to drones they're going to combat remote control many
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.480]  tanks with that pack incredible firepower and they're now moving towards
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.800]  pre-programmed or if you're not if you don't have the right transponder code
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.880]  they just send these weapons in and send these robots in and they've been using
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.000]  them for at least eight years in Iraq in Fallujah and other areas I mean here
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.400]  come robots that kill you deader than a hammer and they're only showing the
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.080]  public 30 year old technology I'm gonna tell you again I had family involved in
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:24.520]  development 40 plus years ago in robots for crowd control my grandfather was
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.520]  given a government contract for it but they only bought the prototypes this is
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:36.120]  what they've been obsessed with they do not want to have to rely on humans
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.240]  they're moving into systems where robots work on the robots where a remote
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:47.360]  control robot 18 wheeler goes out and picks up the broken down robot drives
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.560]  it back to a robot facility with robots working on robots they don't have it
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.000]  down yet they've got the truck that'll go they've got the assembly line that
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.120]  works they've got robots that work on the robots but they still got to have
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:04.280]  humans that then work on that but they're getting very close to not needing
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:09.040]  us and that's why the founder of Apple talked about we're going to be
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.280]  computers pets we're going to be the elites pets who've programmed the
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.840]  computers to program us it's come out the computer games TV all these iPads
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.960]  they're programming us they're changing the way we think that's why they call it
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.800]  programming this is the reality and so of course at an instinctive level and
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:36.800]  at an intellectual level I see the balance of power way out of whack I see
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:44.640]  predatory anti-human very sadistic psychopathic elites bare minimum
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:55.040]  sociopathic and they enjoy their work I see them coming in and amassing this
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:02.000]  giant arms race against humanity weaponizing the food building in
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.760]  systems to reduce fertility and increased cancer on record every major GMO
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.600]  crop has had that engineered into the back door you you think the function is
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:16.040]  to use less water or be able to live in this certain herbicide uh-uh that's
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.560]  only one of the functions it has multiple traits they go it's a side effect
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.440]  it's killing honeybees it's a side effect it's reducing fertility it's a side
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.880]  effect BT corn being eaten all over the world soon it'll be the majority corn
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:36.200]  that you're eating is causing birth defects is causing massive cancer increases
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.720]  don't believe me just type in BT corn linked to cancer infertility you'll get
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:51.080]  mainstream news it's a trait engineered on purpose this is the situation that
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:56.240]  we're facing this is the situation that we're dealing with as a society and a
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.960]  civilization we're under attack you know I told you years ago that they're
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.480]  putting different radioactive isotopes in the water supplies I beat the drum
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.840]  loud enough suddenly I saw newscast all over the country going we don't know
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.720]  why there's radiation in the water the government covered it up Rick Perry
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.520]  covered it up in Texas and they go oh gee it must be in the aquifers ladies and
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.760]  gentlemen it's in the sodium fluoride they mine it out of phosphate mines where
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.920]  comes from that alone does it tell you they've been doing this for 50 something
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:34.920]  years the IQ's have dropped the diseases have gone up this is that that one
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.480]  piece of evidence does it give you an idea how evil they are and so they're
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.880]  amassing all this firepower against us right now they're gearing up for their
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:51.280]  war against humanity the globalist with the machines will be right back we're
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:59.800]  on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.720]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:09.720]  supply folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.560]  it's important for my listeners to do three things right away number one
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:19.640]  study the past history really does repeat itself number two learn to spot the
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:26.160]  dangerous food shortage trends number three take decisive action a perfect
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.200]  storm is brewing or a global food crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.400]  read the new book rising prices empty shelves warning signs that trigger the
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:41.360]  deadliest famines in history don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits

[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.760]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:17.680]  Americans at home turn members influence on our president in Congress and
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.600]  they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.720]  American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.760]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.760]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.560]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:44.400]  we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care right now in

[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:17.320]  corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:37.760]  all right we are back ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us coming
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.800]  up the last 30 minutes of the next hour
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.600]  Paul Craig Roberts is going to be on for those of you that are holding I
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.320]  promise I'll get to your calls at the start of the next hour if you don't want
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.200]  to hold the 30 minutes 27 minutes technically you can hang up and call
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:57.240]  back later 800 25 992 31 is the toll-free number to join us I haven't
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.960]  gotten to this news yet but I'll also cover it in the next hour it's official
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.840]  human activity can cause earthquakes excellent boil down at info wars dot
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:13.840]  com by the USGS New York Times Lawrence Berkeley laboratory I mentioned this of
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:19.240]  course yesterday and the day before that that the Denver Post quoted USGS
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:24.640]  admitting that humans can trigger earthquakes you can trigger earthquakes
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.840]  with pretty small explosives if they're drilled in at a key computer model
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.880]  juncture and I mentioned this well I'll cover it next hour I should do a
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.960]  special report on this actually an Israeli company bragged and has proven
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:45.640]  that they can drop little bomblets on the ground that then detonate and then
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:51.920]  they've got systems that then measure the bomblets as they like sonar bounce
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.560]  down through the earth into the fault lines and show them the absolute
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.800]  computer model or even a couple hundred pounds of plastic explosives if drilled
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.520]  they've got a drill like an oil well sometimes tens of thousands of feet but
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.960]  normally it's it's it's more shallow they there's diagrams on all this they
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.840]  drill in the Russians can do it but the Israelis are more open about it they
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.080]  drill in detonate the plastic explosive wallah earthquake now they've got
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.720]  systems where smaller nukes can be placed that could cause above tens on the
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.680]  Richter scale I'm talking into the world type stuff mountain shooting up you know
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:36.880]  in them in seconds a wild stuff going on now that's only with explosives and the
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.440]  USGS admits this I'm gonna get to it later as I said that's only with
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.760]  explosives what you can do with these harp systems and that's the in the
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.880]  original patents from the 50s is it's just like banging a metal barn you find
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.080]  the perfect oscillation bang bang bang you can get the whole building shaking
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:01.000]  I've done it before on accident earlier I was you know making some funny voices
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.720]  into the microphone and it caused some weird heart harmonic thing and made the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.920]  equipment go crazy I've seen you the party and opera singer break a crystal
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.160]  glass hitting that perfect note and that's what harp does and well they can
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.200]  just energize the atmosphere and then bounce it back at the earth and do a lot
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.240]  of crazy stuff so I'll be covering that for 10 minutes or so in the next hour
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.600]  after I take your phone calls we're tracking what's happening in the economy
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:31.400]  there's been a massive plunge as you know in the last day or two of Bank of
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.800]  America but now it's gone up a bit today because the consument insider the
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:42.160]  Rothschild agent Warren Buffett has been running around saying that he's
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.680]  investing heavily in it and bought a bunch of stock in it so now it's gone
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.800]  up so mr. Wells Fargo now running over to one of the other big six megabanks and
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.680]  trying to prop it up and a real expert on this is no me friends author of it
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.200]  takes a pillage behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:04.720]  Washington the Wall Street and she's got a new book coming out no me friends
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:10.360]  people keep calling me going it's Naomi no it's no me in oh am I Prince PR INS
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:18.160]  she of course was a managing director at Goldman Sachs and also ran a lot of the
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:25.680]  key groups breaking down global trends and actuaries so quite the brain and she
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.840]  joins us to go over the Bank of America situation but also her article that's
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.160]  gotten a lot of attention out of the Daily Beast I've seen other mainstream
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.120]  reports saying is blank fine about to be indicted because there's been some
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.840]  subpoenas and things he's hired the biggest criminal defense lawyer you can
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:50.920]  hire for corporate fraud and corruption the former big Enron lawyer and so he
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.040]  may not just be worried about an SEC risk slap she'll break that down for us
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.200]  as well so Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests $5 billion in Bank of
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.520]  America we're gonna get that inside take from her and could blank fine she used
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.280]  to again be one of the big head honchos in the power structure over there at
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.120]  Goldman Sachs and no me friends no me thank you for joining us thanks a lot
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.760]  for having back Alex okay you've got the floor well what do you want to tackle
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.720]  first Bank of America and all of those gyrations the global economy meltdown
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.760]  gold or do you want to get into blank fine is he gonna be going to meet up
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.640]  with a maid off in the big house it's all up there let's start with Buffett
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.680]  because you know this this idea she started with five billion dollar deal
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:39.920]  with Bank of America of course it's related to Goldman Buffett put a ten
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.480]  billion dollars deal together with Goldman Sachs which is very similar to
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.680]  this when a Goldman was facing the abyss of bankruptcy before the Fed turned
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.280]  it into a bank holding company instead of an investment bank and infused it with
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.680]  tons of capital which has done quite well for it since then Buffett knew that
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:03.680]  and you know it seems right now he is doing the same thing the same thing not
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.720]  just putting money into Bank of America for preferred stock meaning a Bank of
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.640]  America fails he's there first he gets his money out first that that's how
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.000]  that deal works and he's going to get six percent dividend interest on it in
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.040]  the meantime he's betting really that the government will not let Bank of
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:28.840]  America fail again now this is after the government has cropped up Bank of
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:34.480]  America had forced a deal where Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch which
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.720]  no one hears about anymore which had a ton of toxic assets in it is dealing with
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.280]  the countrywide investigations and everything else and the government had
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.600]  infused Bank of America with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of guarantees
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.320]  and subsidies and bailouts and everything else a lot of which has
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.000]  gone away or been paid back but that is why Bank of America's floated so long
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.120]  Buffett is coming in right now and saying you know what even with those
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.760]  billions of dollars even with the fact that Bank of America stock is back down
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.840]  to where it was in early 2009 when the Fed started opening up coffers and they're
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.760]  starting all this extra guarantee after tarp coming from the government to help
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.000]  it even even now that it's back at those levels down back at those levels he's
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.280]  betting the government won't let us fail again but after all that money that
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:22.040]  was put in there will be more put in if need be or more rules sort of fuzzied in
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.040]  order to get this firm which is a zombie which is a disaster financial
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.240]  institution you know waiting to implode to keep it propped up that's his bet and
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.720]  you know what given what the government has done so far
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.520]  unfortunately for the rest of us it's a pretty good bet for Buffett now even
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.640]  though that being said the market went out Bank of America stock went up on
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.880]  Buffett's thing and then it basically it kind of faltered a bit after that so
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.840]  that shows us that even given that logic even given Buffett even given the fact
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.440]  that the government will not let this big bank fail though it should that the
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.040]  market doesn't believe it that just like a question what was going on back in
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.640]  fall 2008 and spring of 2009 there's a lot of pain that will still be inflicted
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.760]  upon us by these banks as they continue to show us that they are not stable that
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:24.360]  they don't do business appropriately and if they are zombie banks and that's
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.440]  what's going on right now so Buffett came in but I think that's gonna the bet
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.160]  will be bad for us I think and good for Buffett of course is also going to be
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.920]  hosting a big fundraiser for Obama going forward so I mean I think he knows
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:44.260]  very well that the government won't let this institution fail and that's why
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.280]  he's in there sure so they're they're just loading more of their stolen loot
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:54.000]  from derivatives and things into the bigger zombie banks and at the same
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.400]  time they think that'll prop them up know me how do you see this global
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.560]  financial meltdown unfolding because you know the German stocks are way down
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:08.480]  today and gold of course one above 1900 in the last few days clearly we're
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:15.200]  sliding deeper into the global abyss but the parasitic central banks they're
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.640]  getting record bonuses so I guess they're doing okay
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:24.520]  central banks you know from the Fed to the CB these are these are institutions
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:31.400]  that are continuing to prop up the illusion that these banks are doing
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.200]  something good for for the rest of us or are viable or should be helped and
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.040]  what's what we're seeing in Europe and and what we're seeing with Bank of
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.120]  American Other Things here is that you can throw in all the money you want at
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.120]  some point the illusion of puffiness that that cheap money creates that those
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.000]  guarantees and backing creates because it isn't real will implode and what's
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  being seen right now in in Europe is that the European banks and they have
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.240]  the same issues that the US bank had you know for different reasons different
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:03.960]  timing it unfolded sort of more slowly but what we're seeing there now is that
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.520]  these institutions are simply not viable and yet the central banks continue to
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:13.960]  dump money into them extracting it with deals against populations you know
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.120]  inflicting austerity measures on populations in order to fund and create
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.360]  more debt in order to float these countries and their banking system so
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.240]  that investors in these banks and senior executives in these banks will
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.200]  continue to get paid that's what's going on here that transfer of wealth to
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:34.320]  investors and to senior executives of banks by central banks by federal
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.680]  institutions continues to go on we're now into year three of this it's it's
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.280]  it's completely a disaster what we're seeing unfold will continue to unfold
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:45.960]  I've talked about this on your show I continue to believe it I saw a clip of
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.920]  myself talking about this three and a half years ago that this is 1929 going
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:55.480]  into the 30s this is what we're dealing with right now and our government and
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.520]  the European government are playing into that and it's very negative for
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:06.480]  main populations and I don't see them changing what they're doing which just
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.440]  means it will continue to get worse there's a definite disconnect and as long
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.440]  as the money isn't yours as long as you're creating out of thin air that
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.920]  disconnect will continue to be there and what gold is showing us is that
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:22.800]  individuals understand this that if you're creating a currency that has no
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.880]  value behind it out of air and it's being used to prop a valueless financial
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:33.760]  institutions that's a big problem and so in that event you're better off going
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:42.240]  with a value that is attached to some actual real commodity which is gold and
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.760]  then that's why we're seeing the gold price go up and that's why we'll continue
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:51.600]  to see the gold price go up because there is no viable solution coming from
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.400]  those that have the money to print or the money to spend throwing good money
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:03.840]  or good printed money after bat well know me it's very annoying it's very you
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.040]  know we talk about it could be so simple and and what is happening and the
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.120]  decisions being made and in the way that money is being printed in the way that
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:18.080]  it's being used to float in on viable financial system is is continues to
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.680]  implode before our eyes and yet those in power do nothing and recognize none of
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.240]  this as it continues to unfold well they consciously understand what they're
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.480]  doing it's not just that they failed to recognize it they plan on imploding the
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:36.600]  global economy consolidating it of setting up tax systems to destroy
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:43.440]  industrial bases in the West and then basically making us all welfare slaves to
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:50.400]  their larger largesse and they intend to get away with their great crimes by
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.640]  installing a paramilitary tyranny over us the only question is will they get
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:01.880]  away with that are we going to let them get get away with this now now let's
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.440]  talk about that the head of Goldman Sachs the guy that says he's doing God's
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.440]  work or was that Jamie Diamond was it blank finds that he's doing yeah so
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.600]  he's doing God's work here and they've had Senate committees as you know come
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:21.600]  out and say yes this is all illegal they knowingly created and packaged up that
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:28.040]  was totally worthless and sold it to the world and then hell everybody hostage
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:32.600]  saying prop us up or or we'll take you down with us and then now they've gotten
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.920]  the bailout money and they've continued the same old activities and are saying
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:42.000]  well bail us out again while we get record bonuses I mean somebody has got
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.960]  to take the wheel of this car of this train away from these people know me
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.760]  so let's go over your article and the reports that he's hired this big
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:01.040]  lawyer yeah so basically this April the Senate permanent subcommittee on
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.840]  investigations the PSI came out with a report 650 page report it mentions
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:12.280]  Lloyd Blank final CEO of gold been about 79 times and about 250 270 pages of
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.120]  this report is just on Goldman the report supposed to be about all of the
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:20.200]  abuses and crimes of the banking system at large but but it is about a third to
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.840]  more than that specifically on Goldman so fairly large chunk falls upon three
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:28.920]  major deals that Goldman did and their practices in general whereby they
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:33.280]  knowingly and their ports very damning I mean I encourage people to look at it
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.400]  it's long but it's damning you know they basically knowingly took crappy assets
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:44.000]  and stuff them into client investment vehicles into things called CDOs and
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.680]  they basically didn't give all the information to their clients it's what
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.160]  was going on on the other side which is that they were shorting or betting
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.760]  against not just the market which is what Lloyd Blank fine continues to say
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.880]  that we are just market makers we are doing our job if some people want to
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.880]  short the market we'll short it if someone want to go long we'll go long
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.720]  if some investors wanted to take more risk they knew what they were doing they
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.120]  paid for that risk back then they took it their big boys you know we're just
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  doing our job but but the problem is that only works if you're not committing
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:19.120]  fraud or misleading your investors by not indicating the true value that you
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.320]  attribute to those assets you're stuffing into their security and the
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:29.520]  report and in a lot of different details shows emails and exchanges and
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.200]  internal documentation going on at Goldman that is in direct contradiction
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.680]  to the things that Lloyd Blank fine said in front of the Senate subcommittee
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:42.400]  investigations last April which is that he was just a market maker which is that
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:45.760]  Goldman didn't have a big short on which is that they didn't bet against their
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:51.520]  clients well this report begs to differ this report shows what we know is that
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:58.680]  this institution knew the value not a hundred percent as Blank fine they were
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.640]  not fortune tellers but they had more information on the value of the assets
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.840]  they stopped that they were that they were called cats and dogs at the Senate
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:10.160]  subcommittee into these securities that they did not tell their clients and
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.920]  that that's fraud you know someone tells you a car and the engine doesn't work
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.720]  and they don't tell the brakes don't work and they don't tell you to get out
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.840]  of the lot and maybe you didn't try the brakes and you shouldn't but all of a
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:24.480]  sudden you tried and you slam into a truck that that's a criminal and that's
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.000]  what we have going on with Goldman and Lloyd Blank fine was the CEO and he
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.720]  also blatantly said to Congress last year that none of this was the case and
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.600]  that's the crux of I think why he ultimately under subpoena for the
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.600]  Department of Justice went and hired a big time defense lawyer a guy who has
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.920]  represented Bernie Ebers who by the way is in jail world com CEO for 25 years
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:53.320]  25 year sentence Richard Cawsey who was the senior accountant in Ron home who
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:00.560]  was also in jail and a number of other big high-profile criminals and that's
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.240]  the guy that is now representing Lloyd Blank fine that's not a good path to be
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.600]  with well we know he's been subpoenaed the problem is as you've state in your
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.480]  article the SEC is a revolving door made up of crooks from Goldman Sachs JP
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:23.080]  Morgan Bank of America you know all these big insiders and so it came out
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.920]  what last week that they destroyed thousands of documents anytime a
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.040]  whistleblower brought them stuff about you know the big guys being corrupt it
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.280]  got shredded it got destroyed we know for 11 years they covered up for Bernie
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:39.320]  Madoff and Madoff is rightly said hey I did this because that's how business is
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:44.200]  done here and to be competitive I had to engage in fraud this is all Ponzi
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.200]  schemes why am I the one going to jail well he was lower down the totem pole
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.640]  sure he found it Nasdaq and was high-powered but not at that super big
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.560]  six bank level so only Lloyd Blank fine and people like that are allowed to do
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:02.320]  this in member-naki not made off for the ride back did you know nuclear radiation
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.600]  is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in Fukushima Japan and making

[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.520]  dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here as a result radiation

[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.960]  Coming up in the last 30 minutes of the next hour
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.960]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is joining us
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.960]  He's got a great article out that was published at
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.960]  infowars.com last night
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.960]  9-1-1 after a decade, have we learned anything
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.960]  We'll talk about the anniversary coming up
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  Then we'll shift gears into the economy
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.960]  In the meantime, I'm going to take some of your phone calls
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.960]  that have been holding and get into this earthquake news
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.960]  where the mainstream media and the USGS admits
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.960]  that government private institutions can trigger earthquakes
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:01.960]  Really, also Secretary of Defense Cohen
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:05.960]  was being truthful in 1997 when he gave a press conference
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.960]  and it was in the Army times that our government
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.960]  and other governments can trigger earthquakes
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  Really, I've got documents that can do it
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.960]  The 50s, the 50s
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.960]  Okay, going back though
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:19.960]  they even had geologists working on it in World War II
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:23.960]  They were thinking about using a tsunami bomb on Japan
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.960]  Oh yeah, that's the 40s
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]  So that is coming up
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]  Also, we have an article
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  and really it was going to be an open letter
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.960]  but it turned into an article
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.960]  We're going back to Nomi here in a moment
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.960]  at infowars.com
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.960]  and it asked the question, is Apple evil
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.960]  now that Steve Jobs is leaving
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  and I'll probably shoot a video in the next few days
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.960]  it's an open letter to Steve Jobs
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.960]  because I know a lot about Apple
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.960]  a lot about Microsoft, a lot about Google
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.960]  and let me tell you
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:56.960]  it is not as trendy and liberal as they would have you believe
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  it's a big part of the conditioning of the population
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.960]  so the article's up there, is Apple evil
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.960]  Going back to Nomi Prince
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.960]  a former managing director at Goldman Sachs
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.960]  something's got to give Nomi
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.960]  just in your gut or in your political savvy
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  Do you think they're going to get away with this?
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:16.960]  I mean, sure they've got the military, the government
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:18.960]  the so-called mainstream media
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.960]  but at a certain point, is the system at large
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.960]  just going to let a handful of banking families
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  completely wreck the entire global economy?
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.960]  The optimistic side of me wants to say no
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.960]  but the problem is that to get to a point
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.960]  where we are so wrecked because of this
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:41.960]  that there is absolutely no alternative
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  but to slap these banks back
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:46.960]  to let the ones fail that need to fail
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.960]  to break up the speculative aspects of them
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.960]  to the ones that actually deal with real people
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.960]  and real mortgages and real small business loans
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.960]  and actually create productive capital
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.960]  to grow this country
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:00.960]  I think we're not at that point where it's so fractured
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.960]  and that's a crazy thing to say
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.960]  I know after what we've seen over the last two years
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:06.960]  but I think it's going to get a lot worse
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.960]  when you don't fix the problem
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:10.960]  you continue to throw money at it to gloss over it
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.960]  to make it seem as if it's gone away
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.960]  and how fractured and bad these banks are
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.960]  for the rest of our economy
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  it continues to fester
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:19.960]  and unfortunately I think it's going to get worse
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:22.960]  before it even has the possibility of getting better
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.960]  I would like to believe that the more that we know
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.960]  as individuals about what is actually going on
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:28.960]  the less we will stand for it
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.960]  and that between that being armed with information
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:35.960]  and anger and a desire to change this
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:38.960]  with things unfortunately getting worse for us
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.960]  that somewhere we reach a situation where it does change
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.960]  but I'll tell you the guys in Washington
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.960]  both parties, whoever is running what
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.960]  they are so invested
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.960]  and I mean invested with their own money
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.960]  invested with their philosophies
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  invested with who they do business for
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.960]  and how
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.960]  but I don't see that changing anytime in the near future
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.960]  and going back to Bank of America and Buffett
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:01.960]  again Buffett was the guy who invested also in Goldman
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.960]  and today in Bank of America
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.960]  well and the other things that happened today
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.960]  in Bank of America is that the one attorney general
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.960]  who was looking into
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.960]  all the fraud that was committed with respect to foreclosures
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:15.960]  the robo-signing and everything else
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  that not just hurts people facing foreclosure
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.960]  but anyone who is trying to sell a house
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.960]  this documentation stuff isn't even just about foreclosures
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.960]  but all the stuff banks have lost and defrauded people of
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:28.960]  has just gotten removed from dealing with settling the case
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.960]  so those kind of signs show me that this is still
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.960]  unfortunately going on and getting worse
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:37.960]  that's right anybody that tries to oppose these people gets destroyed
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:41.960]  Naomi thank you
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.960]  You are listening to GCN

[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.960]  and it's a real eye-opener
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:29.960]  I can't stress this enough

[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.960]  Now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.960]  Alex Jones
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.960]  Alright finishing up with former managing director
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.960]  Goldman Sachs, Naomi Prince
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.960]  Naomi you got a new book coming out in October
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.960]  talking about Black Tuesday and you're saying we could end up
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.960]  having one of those by October
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.960]  but you were finishing up by saying
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.960]  we need to stand behind investigators at state and federal level
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.960]  that do try to go up against the incredibly arrogant creatures
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:47.960]  I mean we've seen a couple years ago
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.960]  on Lair News Hour
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.960]  Greenspan say we're above the law
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.960]  government has no jurisdiction
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:54.960]  we can do whatever we want
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.960]  we're our own branch of government when they're not government
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.960]  we've seen Bernanke say gold is not money
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.960]  we've seen Bernanke say I won't tell you where the trillions went
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.960]  some of it to him himself
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  just like with Paulson
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.960]  we've seen on top of that
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.960]  Bernanke say we'll just print money
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.960]  we've seen Greenspan go and meet the press
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.960]  and say we won't default we'll just print money
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.960]  and that's why even Ghoulsby
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.960]  big skull and bones Obama globalist
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.960]  started to turn red
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.960]  he actually blushed and smiled
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.960]  and looked like he was about to cough or spit something up
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.960]  because it was so outrageous
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:33.960]  they're telling the Chinese we're not going to hyperinflate
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.960]  they are hyperinflating
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.960]  and here he is just arrogantly saying it
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  I mean these guys act like they are God
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.960]  I mean they just waddle around
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.960]  a bunch of chicken neck corrupt old men
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:48.960]  ruining our dollar, ruining our future
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  and I've had enough of them
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960]  I think we all have
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:56.960]  and that's why I was saying before
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.960]  I think everyone out there who is looking for information
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.960]  and wherever it comes from
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:06.960]  whoever is providing the truth
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:08.960]  whether they call themselves in a certain party
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.960]  but they're different from their party
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.960]  whether they're individuals
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.960]  whether they're attorney generals
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.960]  or out there relative to the other 49
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.960]  that are basically continuing to support
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.960]  this corrupt financial system
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.960]  whatever it might be
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.960]  I feel it's our obligation
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.960]  to support those individual voices
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.960]  because they don't get support
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  obviously the mainstream isn't really supporting this
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  they're supporting the notion that what's good for Wall Street
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  is good for Main Street which we know is in the case
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.960]  the notion that what's going to go happen
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.960]  is Jackson Hall tomorrow with Ben Bernanke
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:42.960]  is he going to do a QE3 or not
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.960]  and putting so much emphasis on what that could mean
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.960]  when any of the other QEs have done nothing
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.960]  having zero rates have done nothing
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.960]  because if they're not used to create
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:52.960]  productive capital for the rest of the Main Street economy
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.960]  they are not helpful
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.960]  they are only floating the financial system
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.960]  in the corrupt manners in which it operates
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.960]  and that is something that has to stop
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:02.960]  for all of our goods
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.960]  and so I just continue to feel
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.960]  that the people who are out there
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.960]  talking about this stuff
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.960]  bringing up these issues
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.960]  really should be listened to
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.960]  agree or not agree at least examine what they're saying
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.960]  and realize that there are alternative opinions
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.960]  on any spectrum
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.960]  in any belief that are at least showing
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.960]  the corruption that's in the financial system
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.960]  and the devastation that it does
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.960]  for most of the general people
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:28.960]  in the country and in the world
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:30.960]  and that that has to change
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.960]  and that has to stop and we unfortunately
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.960]  have to be the voices from the ground up
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.960]  the voices in Washington
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.960]  and the voices of the people
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.960]  that are running the show
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.960]  don't care
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.960]  well that's the truth
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.960]  and then some they actually love wrecking society
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.960]  love consolidating it
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  and think their police state is going to save them
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.960]  they can just blow something up
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.960]  say terrorist did it
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.960]  everybody grandstand around them and say
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:58.960]  oh please save me Bernanke from the terrorist
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.960]  it's truly disgusting
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.960]  how transparent they are when you're aware of them

[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:04.960]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.960]  number one new climate legislation
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.960]  could easily double or triple your electric
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.960]  bill number two our new
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.960]  energies are wants to control how much
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.960]  power your electric company allows you to
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.960]  have it's true total government

[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.960]  is only compounding the problem
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:30.960]  number four dangerous weather is

[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:26.960]  man-made earthquake news
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:28.960]  that's even in the New York Times
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:30.960]  we're going to get into
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.960]  Use Apple
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.960]  Evil article that we just launched
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.960]  at infowars.com
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.960]  and prismplanet.com that is very important
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.960]  don't forget tonight 7 o'clock
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.960]  a special report
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.960]  how is that different than a newscast
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.960]  a newscast is
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.960]  30 minutes every week
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.960]  night starting September 1st
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.960]  a lot of nights though there's going to be
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.960]  a special report that's an extended interview
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.960]  or report or a documentary
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  we're going to be premiering
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.960]  documentaries we've been quietly working on
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:02.960]  in the next few months
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.960]  live on the show
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.960]  and the real reason we're doing it is
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.960]  we need to have our own media system force ourselves
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.960]  to boil information down
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.960]  so it can be even more effective
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.960]  than just the long form radio show
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.960]  that's also extremely effective
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.960]  it's effective in a different way
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.960]  we've had
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.960]  here's an example
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.960]  a year ago and then again six months ago
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.960]  and then a month ago I've had a sky television channel
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.960]  in England potentially reaching
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.960]  millions a month that one channel
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.960]  hundreds of thousands a day
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.960]  is the viewers that channel has and they said
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.960]  we want you to edit
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.960]  your TV show every day
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.960]  because this radio show is also slash a TV
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.960]  show sitting here video taping
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.960]  and it's not just a webcam
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.960]  the five camera shooting here with video clips
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.960]  and I said you can edit pieces of it
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.960]  and put it on if you want
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.960]  I know some channels do do that
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.960]  but I don't have the time, the energy, the money
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.960]  I said but I am planning
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  my own
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.960]  weekday news show
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.960]  and so that's what it is and it's going to be good up front
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:04.960]  you've seen these special reports
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.960]  they're similar to what it's going to be like
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.960]  and they're just going to get better and better
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.960]  and we've really been working hard here
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.960]  putting a lot of work, a lot of investment
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.960]  a lot of time, a lot of money
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.960]  if you want to support us becomeaprisonplanet.tv
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.960]  remember you'll get it first
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.960]  you'll get it exclusively
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:22.960]  until it goes on television but still
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:24.960]  that's going to be spotty on this channel
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:26.960]  or that channel
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.960]  we're going to be relegated to channel
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.960]  1000 or whatever
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.960]  but still get on a lot of channels around the world
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.960]  it starts reaching some people
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.960]  so it's just another venue
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.960]  another outlet really it's just news for the internet
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.960]  and we couldn't have done
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:42.960]  any of it without you
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:44.960]  and we're going to cover and tackle the big topics
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:46.960]  not just the latest news
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.960]  it's going to be power packed
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.960]  so prisonplanet.tv
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.960]  if you're not a member
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.960]  or you were a member and aren't anymore
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.960]  we've had a lot of new features, prisonplanet.tv
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:58.960]  let's go ahead
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.960]  and talk to Jason
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.960]  who's been holding the longest
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:04.960]  let's talk to
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.960]  John in Maryland
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:08.960]  John you're on the air
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.960]  Hi Alex
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.960]  I'm wrong about this
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:14.960]  but I may know where and when
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:16.960]  the next false flag terrorist attack
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.960]  is going to take place
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.960]  on September 2nd through 4th
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:22.960]  Baltimore City is going to host
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:24.960]  its first ever indie car grand
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.960]  pre-race
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:28.960]  and Pitt Row for the race is going to be located
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:30.960]  directly in front of a branch
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.960]  of the Richmond Federal Reserve
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:34.960]  I think the Fed Bank
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.960]  and the crowds full of thousands of children
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:38.960]  throughout the event could be targeted
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.960]  well that's right
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:42.960]  because I've said when they target a Fed Bank
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.960]  when the Federal Reserve shareholders target themselves
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:46.960]  they will try to target
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.960]  kids
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:50.960]  and there's not usually children at the Federal Reserve building
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.960]  so look for the bombs to be
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:54.960]  in the daycare area
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.960]  just like Oklahoma City
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.960]  they really like to kill kids
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:00.960]  and so I've analyzed their attack pattern
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:02.960]  I said you're going to have riots, shootings, bombings
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:04.960]  and more and more
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  the system will target itself
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.960]  they will have riots to target the general public
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.960]  so the public comes running to the system
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.960]  to take their rights
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.960]  but you know what I hope that's not the case
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.960]  please don't give them any ideas
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.960]  Poland Powell of all people
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.960]  is going to be the grand marshal
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.960]  of this race
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.960]  so he would be there to shape the narrative
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:26.960]  and grandstand absolutely
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.960]  oh that is
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.960]  oh and the other little chiblets
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:32.960]  well they've got
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.960]  special areas specifically designated
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:36.960]  for 12 years of age and younger
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:38.960]  one is called the family fun zone
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:40.960]  please look at this online
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:42.960]  because it's really spooky
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.960]  the other is called the interactive racing zone
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:46.960]  it's going to be full of go kart racing
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:48.960]  remote control, car racing
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:50.960]  rides, games, people dressed up like giant
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.960]  Hershey kisses
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.960]  I cate on this because I was listening
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:56.960]  to what you were saying last week
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:58.960]  that it's going to be something like a daycare
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:00.960]  in a Federal Reserve building
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.960]  well I mean I get inside their head
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  and that's the kind of sick stuff they do
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.960]  I mean they follow that because then
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.960]  they'll have again camera people waiting
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:10.960]  when the firemen have got a bloody kid
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:12.960]  but let's not say it's going to happen there
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.960]  we don't have any proof of any evidence
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.960]  there's a lot of other permutations of events
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.960]  where they could do something similar
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:20.960]  I just look at all the White House
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.960]  memos and advisors saying
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:24.960]  we need a terror attack
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:26.960]  boy it would sure help us
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:28.960]  I mean they operate out in the open like we're morons
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:30.960]  and so to get the banks to look like victims
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.960]  this
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.960]  is something that's in the constellation
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.960]  of events they could stage
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.960]  but they could just
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:40.960]  bomb a Federal building and then say
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:42.960]  the guy that did it didn't like the Federal Reserve
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.960]  I mean there's a lot of different
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.960]  things they can do
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:48.960]  it's just if you're like Jane Graham
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.960]  who we've interviewed many times
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.960]  who was the head of HUD they're in the building
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.960]  and she saw McVay and other feds
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.960]  planning plastic explosives she thought
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.960]  they were gray sticks of butter
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:00.960]  or the telephone company
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.960]  she was told we're the telephone company
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.960]  the day before
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.960]  and it's just if you ever see something like that
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.960]  if you see something say something
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  the problem is if you report
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:12.960]  the feds about to bomb themselves
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:14.960]  they're not going to stop it
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.960]  the only thing you can do is do a YouTube video or something
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:18.960]  because that's the problem
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.960]  see something say something
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.960]  also in case you catch them
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:24.960]  planning bombs they can have the police stand down
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  that's really what the NSA is used for
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.960]  anti terror operations that way they knew about
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.960]  FBI agents that were on the trail
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.960]  of the decoy hijackers
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960]  and other things I appreciate your call
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.960]  okay let's go ahead
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.960]  and take another one here
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.960]  let's talk to Diane and Louisiana
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:42.960]  Diane you're on the air go ahead
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:48.960]  okay I'm first time caller
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:50.960]  and new member of Planet TV
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.960]  I have two questions on the comment
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.960]  do you think with all this
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:56.960]  shenanigans going on with Obama
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:58.960]  body of Obama
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.960]  do you think that he would
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.960]  dare declare
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.960]  martial law to stop the
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.960]  presidential election in 2012
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.960]  I don't know
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.960]  I mean
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.960]  the globalist
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.960]  could simply remove him
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:16.960]  and put a new puppet in like Rick Perry
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:18.960]  and then Rick Perry will get demonized and attacked
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.960]  in the narrative
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.960]  and then they'll put another puppet in
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:24.960]  in Obama deception
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:26.960]  in fact we had a re-air of the first 10 minutes
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:28.960]  of Obama deception I said he will
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.960]  plunge he will be destroyed
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.960]  he will be like toilet paper
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:34.960]  use toilet paper absolutely
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.960]  political garbage
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:38.960]  but that's how it works
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.960]  the office of the presidency
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.960]  already operates as a dictatorship
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.960]  wars without congressional approval
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:46.960]  carbon taxes
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:48.960]  without congressional approval
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:50.960]  selective enforcement of laws
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:52.960]  gun control
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.960]  without laws
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:56.960]  amnesty they're saying well
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:58.960]  the 300,000 illegals
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:00.960]  we'll just go ahead and release most of them out of prison
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.960]  and we might keep a few
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:04.960]  of the felons back but
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.960]  most of them we're just going to release on the streets of America
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.960]  we're not going to deport them well that violates
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.960]  federal immigration law
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:12.960]  so he's already a dictator
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:14.960]  but he's a
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:16.960]  power slave just like George W. Bush
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.960]  was he's got all this power
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.960]  but he's like a
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.960]  switch that a trillion watts
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.960]  is running through he's still just a switch
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.960]  he's not the power
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:28.960]  he's like a power line carrying the power
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.960]  he's not the electricity itself
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.960]  he's a front man
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.960]  who's meant to be billed up and then destroyed
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:36.960]  instead of
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:38.960]  Obama canceling election
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:40.960]  I've said many times in the
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:42.960]  in the constellation of things I see them
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:44.960]  I mean I know their hand of cards
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.960]  I know them I eat, drink and sleep
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:48.960]  the globalist operation
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:50.960]  tracking it
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:52.960]  so I'm inside the operation because I'm tracking it
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:54.960]  I'm watching it I'm looking through their eyes
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:56.960]  and in their fist
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.960]  of cards in their little hand
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:00.960]  their grimy little hands
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.960]  is the assassination of Obama
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.960]  to be blamed on a
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:06.960]  patriot
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.960]  or what the establishment calls a
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.960]  paltard and so that's in
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:12.960]  their grimy fist and let me tell you that's
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:14.960]  that's that that can happen
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:16.960]  so that's in the cards
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:18.960]  staging a failed assassination
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:20.960]  attempt against Obama that's really
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.960]  in the cards
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.960]  staging other events I mean
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.960]  it's all there ma'am does that answer your question
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:28.960]  Yes I keep having this
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.960]  recurrent dream that I feel Obama being
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:32.960]  walked out of the White House in handcuffs
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.960]  I hope that happens real soon
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:36.960]  but my comment is that
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.960]  I know that you have inspired
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.960]  me and opened my eyes so has
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:42.960]  Dr. Savage and Reverend Manning
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  and the other night two nights ago
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:46.960]  I was listening to Dr. Savage
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.960]  and he's on
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:50.960]  you know he's trying to analyze people
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.960]  and he's pretty good at it but
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  he's got it in his head that Rick Perry
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.960]  seems to be
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.960]  a great candidate to lead
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:00.960]  this country and
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:02.960]  turn it around and I couldn't
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.960]  get through on the line I wanted to warn him
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:06.960]  and maybe you need to talk to him
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.960]  and pull his coat tail and
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.960]  I've tried to talk to Michael
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.960]  Savage and I was critical of him
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.960]  years ago when he was pushing a police state
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.960]  you know for the Muslims
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:18.960]  folks it's going to be used against everybody
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:20.960]  and it is now
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:22.960]  he has talked about false black terror
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.960]  that really makes the respect level
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:26.960]  for him go up
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:28.960]  but
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:30.960]  he doesn't live in Austin, he doesn't know Rick Perry
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:32.960]  but he'll get educated
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.960]  forced inoculations
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.960]  imminent domain power grabs for foreign
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:38.960]  companies of farms and ranches
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:40.960]  I mean to go over Rick Perry
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:42.960]  but again Rush Limbaugh
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:44.960]  asking this hey Savage
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:46.960]  you're always attacking Limbaugh
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.960]  and calling him an empty suit and a front man
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:50.960]  and all this stuff
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.960]  I mean this guy's being totally
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.960]  endorsed
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.960]  by Limbaugh
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:58.960]  I mean Rick Perry ladies and gentlemen
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.960]  is as phony as a $3 bill
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:02.960]  I mean the guy is an absolute
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.960]  joke and just like
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:06.960]  people thought oh Obama he's real he'll save us
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.960]  oh
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.960]  Rick Perry he's going to save us no
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:12.960]  the only person who's real
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:14.960]  and it doesn't mean he can save us but he'll
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:16.960]  certainly get us in the right direction is Ron Paul
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.960]  I appreciate your call good to hear from you
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.960]  alright those callers
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:22.960]  have been holding the longest
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.960]  and I got Dr. Roberts coming up and I've got to
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  get to these other news items
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.960]  so I'm going to come back to the earthquake news
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.960]  mainstream media and government admitting
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:32.960]  earthquakes can be man made
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.960]  and I think I'm going to have a special comment
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:36.960]  at the end of the news tonight
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:38.960]  really tonight's
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:40.960]  uh
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:42.960]  special report format
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:44.960]  is
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.960]  really a kind of a beta test for the nightly news
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:48.960]  there'll be some differences and we're going to
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.960]  the nightly news we're going to try different variants
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.960]  of what I end up thinking is most effective
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:54.960]  to get the word out
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:56.960]  but again seven o'clock tonight
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:58.960]  seven o'clock prisonplanet.tv
[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:02.960]  attention gardeners this is an urgent
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:04.960]  GCN self-reliance update
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.960]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.960]  superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.960]  it's called proto-grow and it's so effective
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:12.960]  at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.960]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:16.960]  under practically any soil and light conditions
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:18.960]  now here's the best part for our listeners
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.960]  who garden for self-reliance proto-grow's
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:22.960]  unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:24.960]  mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.960]  bloom set creating maximum plant growth
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.960]  in minimum time proto-grow works
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:30.960]  by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:32.960]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.960]  uptake in plants proto-grow's full spectrum

[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.960]  we are in an information war
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:32.960]  and we are losing that war
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:34.960]  the globalist are scared
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:36.960]  they've overreached
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:38.960]  the future of the info war
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.960]  is in your hands

[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:54.960]  and every other globalist propaganda platform
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.960]  to use their system against them
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:58.960]  the info war now goes into high gear
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.960]  what you're about to hear
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.960]  are the real experiences of women over 40
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:04.960]  who finally lost weight
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:06.960]  by becoming hormonally balanced again
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.960]  I lost 20 pounds
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.960]  I lost 40 pounds
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.960]  I lost 55 pounds
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.960]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.960]  their secret is amberin
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.960]  the revolutionary formula for women over 40
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.960]  that balances hormones naturally
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:22.960]  the leading cause of weight gain over 40
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:24.960]  is hormonal imbalance
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:26.960]  until you balance your hormones
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:28.960]  losing weight can be practically impossible
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:30.960]  but amberin restores hormonal
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:32.960]  balance naturally
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:34.960]  so the weight can just fall right off
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.960]  even that stubborn belly fat
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:38.960]  plus amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.960]  like hot flashes
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:42.960]  night sweats, low libido
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:44.960]  difficulty concentrating and more

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.960]  with a 30 day supply
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:52.960]  call 1-800-737-9107
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.960]  that's 1-800-737-9107
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:12.960]  please
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:19.200]  Okay, it's official human activity can cause earthquakes.
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:25.040]  A great boil down article that's really what Washington blog excels at is linked up at
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:27.560]  infowars.com today.
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:30.840]  It's official human activity can cause earthquakes.
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:34.480]  Human activity is officially acknowledged to cause earthquakes.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:40.080]  The United States Geological Survey is America's official expert on earthquakes.
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:47.600]  It's the federal agency charged with monitoring, reporting on, researching, and stressing preparedness
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:49.760]  for earthquakes.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:55.480]  So I was surprised to read the following statement on the USGS, and again this was reported last
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:00.640]  few days by the Denver Post as well, that's why we covered it the day of the quake.
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:05.400]  Earthquakes induced by human activity have been documented in a few locations in the
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.600]  United States, Japan, and Canada.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:13.760]  The cause was injection of fluids into deep wells for waste disposal and secondary recovery
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:18.760]  of oil, fracking, and the use of reservoirs for water supplies.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:22.800]  Most of these earthquakes were minor, the largest and most widely known resulted from
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:28.200]  fluid injection at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, Colorado.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:35.240]  In 1967, an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 followed a series of smaller earthquakes.
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:41.760]  One had been discounted at the site in previous years, once the link between the fluid injection
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:47.240]  and the earlier series of earthquakes was established, so they discontinued it once
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:49.120]  they confirmed it was happening.
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:55.840]  Nicholas Craig and Weston RL 1990 earthquake hazard associated with deep well injection
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:02.920]  a report to the US Environmental Protection Agency US Geological Survey Bulletin 1951
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:03.920]  page 74.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:06.320]  And again, I should do a report on this.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:12.120]  This is the type of thing I'll do on the nightly news, little nuggets of info.
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:16.560]  I'll go pull the Israeli companies bragging that they can inject explosives and cause
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.200]  big earthquakes, or I can pull up the Russians admitting they can do it.
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.480]  I can pull up the tsunami bomb from the 1950s out of the Australian newspapers.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:38.000]  I can pull up then the Eastman Harp patent where they admit using these systems to oscillate
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.280]  the atmosphere and bounce back to the earth and just then tag it all off with the Secretary
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:50.640]  of Defense William Cohen 1997, April 28 saying, yes, we can create earthquakes and other
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.920]  governments can as well.
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:58.280]  As the New York Times noted in February, researchers with the Arkansas Geological Survey say that
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:02.400]  while there is no discernible link between earthquake and gas production, there is strong
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:08.520]  temporal and spatial evidence for relationship between these quakes and the injection wells.
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:13.120]  So they may just try to use these tremors caused by shifting what's going on over the
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.280]  ground with gas and oil wells to restrict everybody.
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:20.720]  See that'll be another thing to keep us from developing our own oil.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:29.280]  For decades, scientists have been researching induced seismicity or how human activity can
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:31.760]  cause earthquakes and it goes on.
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:36.040]  There's a Lawrence Berkeley laboratory points out that ever since the 1930s this has been
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:42.080]  observed and then it goes through the different maps of water injection and fracking will show
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:46.600]  folks a document cam shot of that if they're watching on PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:58.480]  But again, you can go read this article, it's pretty darned detailed and you can see it
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.840]  there on the site.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.480]  But again, we'll be covering that more.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.600]  Now, this is just a mild, mild admission.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.440]  The point is this stuff does exist, it can happen.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.160]  And I saw reports in the Washington Post, Associated Press and others in the last few
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:22.200]  days saying, well, this is a very rare earthquake that has hit Virginians surrounding states.
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:28.400]  Then they had aftershocks, a 4.5 magnitude aftershock.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.960]  Now more cracks found at the Washington Monument.
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:36.680]  This is probably a natural earthquake, but if it continues or more happens and we continue
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:39.600]  to see major population centers hit, that's the thing.
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.960]  So many of these big quakes now are hitting major population centers where before it hit
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:48.160]  a major center and then out in the middle of nowhere, then it hit another major population
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.600]  center and then out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:53.440]  of nowhere, then it hit a major population center.
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:55.800]  Now it's population center, population center.
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.080]  I was looking at analysts breaking this down the last few years that so many of the big
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:05.640]  quakes now are right there in key areas, right there in major population centers.
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:10.320]  And a lot of that's because people do tend to build on coastlines that tend to be a long
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:11.560]  tectonic fault line.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:17.280]  So you don't want to get caught up in the same thing like they do with Al Gore when
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.280]  there's a hot day.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:19.280]  It's global warming.
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:23.800]  When it's a cold day, it's global warming because there's thousands of microclimates
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:27.280]  around the world and there's always going to be extreme weather happening somewhere.
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:30.840]  I mean, we know 150 years ago there was a drought in Texas.
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.600]  In the 50s there was a drought and there's a drought now.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.640]  And there's a reason a lot of Texas looks like the desert.
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:45.000]  It's not like, it's the jungle and suddenly we've got a drought from central Texas out
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  to the west.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.600]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up, stay with us.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:52.880]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:55.320]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:58.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:05.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:06.280]  Terany is here.
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:10.160]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.880]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:17.400]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:18.640]  on earth.
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:23.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:25.280]  expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:29.560]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:31.360]  powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:36.440]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen, prepare
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:41.560]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:45.680]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:49.200]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:51.240]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:52.240]  It's here.

[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:21.840]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:12.200]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.400]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:16.400]  You want answers?
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.240]  Well so does he.
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:25.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:34.240]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and last night we posted an article written
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:39.840]  by Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, 911 after a decade.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:41.840]  Have we learned anything?
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:46.040]  We have him joining us via video Skype if you happen to be a prison planet.tv viewer
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:49.280]  and for all of our great radio listeners out there.
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:55.600]  I also want to get his take on Mr. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, hiring the Enron
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:03.200]  criminal defense attorney and his view on what now two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan, saying
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:07.680]  we're not going to default, we'll just print money.
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:12.480]  Austin Goldsby of the Obama administration just double taking and actually blushing.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:17.920]  It was so, so incredible to hear that statement because that's obviously another form of default
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:21.520]  is to inflate and devalue the currency.
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:26.360]  But joining us to break down, 911 after a decade is Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, best-selling
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:32.960]  author, former Wall Street Journal, editor, and of course, former head of policy at the
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:34.640]  Department of Treasury.
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:36.840]  Doc, good to have you here with us.
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:39.680]  So here we are a decade after 9-11.
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:40.680]  Right.
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:47.520]  A decade later, well, Alex, what I did, I just did a little reporting.
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:54.400]  I didn't express my opinion and I asked the question, how well has the US government's
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:01.760]  account held up over the decade and it looks like not very well.
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:09.440]  For a number of reasons, we've had the chairman and vice chairman and the senior legal counsel
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:16.800]  of the 9-11 commission write books in which they say that the commission was set up to
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:28.600]  fail, that information was withheld, that Pentagon and FAA officials lied to them, that
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:33.760]  Bush and Cheney refused to testify under oath.
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:41.400]  And this didn't arouse any curiosity, people never wanted to know why the Pentagon would
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:48.040]  lie or why the FAA would lie or why information was withheld or why the president was afraid
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:49.640]  to testify under oath.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:53.000]  None of this ever came up.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.640]  It just sort of came out and dropped into the memory hole.
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.640]  And then, of course, we had had prior to that one of the commission members, Max Cleland,
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:10.400]  had resigned from the commission on the grounds that the constraints placed on it by the White
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.080]  House meant that the commission was compromised.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:20.440]  And so he simply resigned.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:30.640]  And then, of course, we've had, now let me be clear, none of these people said or implied
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:40.200]  that they thought the U.S. government was involved in causing 9-11.
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:45.480]  The legal counsel and the chairman of the commission simply say that they don't know
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:48.200]  why the government lied to them.
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.560]  But the question is, why would the government lie?
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.800]  If it's lying to cover up its incompetence, that's one thing, but we at least should find
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:01.920]  out, but nobody bothered to find out.
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:13.280]  Then, the other thing that's happened, it's sort of major, is that a whole slew of 9-11
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:16.880]  truth organizations have grown up.
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:25.800]  And it's fashionable in some circles to present these people as kooks, but they consist of
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:33.640]  1,500 architects and engineers who put their professional reputation on the line.
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:41.680]  They consist of firefighters, including those present at the towers.
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:50.120]  They consist of pilots for 9-11 truth, both commercial and military pilots.
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:53.360]  These organizations also include scholars.
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:38:03.200]  So there's all kinds of educated, knowledgeable, professional people who have brought serious
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:07.080]  doubts about the explanation.
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:14.240]  And yet still, there's been no response from the government except for the one member of
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:22.360]  the Obama administration that proposed to infiltrate the 9-11 truth groups in order
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.200]  to discredit them.
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:30.880]  So why can't you discredit them publicly on the basis of the facts?
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.960]  No, Sunstein says infiltrate and then put out outrageous conspiracy theories to discredit
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:37.840]  all the rest.
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:41.340]  This was not invented by Obama.
[02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:43.880]  This has been going on for a very long time.
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:46.760]  But he's a member of the Obama administration.
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:57.440]  So what it should strike us is, why is it that the administration, this is a successor
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:58.440]  administration.
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:03.760]  This is not the administration during whose term 9-11 happened.
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:09.360]  Why is it they feel they can't confront the architects and engineers and the pilots and
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:14.760]  the firefighters and the scholars publicly with evidence?
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:22.600]  Why do they think that they have to infiltrate them and discredit them surrepetitiously?
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:25.840]  All of these things raise questions.
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:35.400]  And to me, what the importance of this is, it shows that an amazing lack of inquisitiveness,
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:41.600]  not just on part of the American people, but a part of the media, the Congress, the government
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.280]  itself, even the securities agencies.
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:46.320]  You would think the securities agencies.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:54.240]  Doc, this is not a lack of curiosity, like your cat there in the background.
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:56.760]  This is fear.
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:02.440]  People deep down know this is scary and I've talked to big reporters who are debunkers
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:09.080]  and I tell them, I say, I heard local CBS and ABC radio that day, say they were going
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.240]  to blow up Building 7, I even have the tapes now, a cop saying get back, they're blowing
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:14.240]  it up.
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:16.560]  And I said, and now NIST has been proven wrong.
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:21.280]  They have to admit that there was freefall and there are other five reasons didn't happen
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:25.520]  and there was a norad stand down and the hijackers were trained at bases.
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:32.000]  And every one of the reporters says, I just can't believe the government is that evil.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.680]  And we've seen liberal academics in the Toronto Star and other places say, even if it's true,
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:40.880]  it'll bring down the whole system so we can't go there.
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:44.560]  So at the end of the day, Dr. Roberts, these people are cowards.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:59.600]  Well, that may be, but if you, I just kind of raise this question in a very mild way.
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:08.840]  And I think that what we are faced with and what you're really saying is that facts are
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:12.640]  no match for emotions.
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:18.760]  And so when the facts threaten our emotions, we just sweep the facts under the rug.
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:23.600]  And it does look like that that is what's going on.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:35.040]  But you see, the point that I make in here is that 9-11 is the determinant event, the
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:43.200]  defining event of our time, and it's led to this decade of ever-expanding wars, to
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:49.760]  the economic deficits, the pending bankruptcy.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.200]  It's led to a police state.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:42:03.320]  You're aware that Justin Romondo and nrwar.com are being monitored by the FBI as possible
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:08.920]  of threats to national security working in behalf of a foreign power.
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:15.840]  We know the distinguished attorney, Francis Boyle, is placed on a terrorist watch list
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:24.240]  because he refused to violate the attorney clown privilege and spy on his clients for
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:26.760]  the FBI CIA.
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:33.680]  These are all Gestapo operations, as you emphasize many times.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:42.160]  And one would think that if the consequences of 9-11 is open-ended war and a police state
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:50.440]  and an economic bankruptcy, that this would be a bigger threat, a more fearful thing,
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:43:00.840]  that this should drive some sort of demand for accountability as to what actually happened
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:03.320]  on 9-11.
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:09.600]  If we simply, the implication of the chairman and vice chairman and legal counsel's books
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:17.440]  or that the government knew a lot more about the operation than it said.
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:26.680]  And what they seemed to mean is that the various intelligence agencies were so much in competition
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:29.720]  with one another that they wouldn't share any information.
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:39.440]  And so even though they knew about these alleged al-Qaeda guys, nobody would share his information
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:40.440]  with the other.
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:43.000]  And so they weren't able to put the picture together.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:57.080]  That seems to be what the commission doubters, we now have, soon we'll have the 9-11 commission
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:44:01.800]  for 9-11 truth.
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:09.720]  But once you start looking into it, it may be a can of worms.
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:17.600]  And so no one has looked into it, the media hasn't, and the Congress hasn't.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:23.480]  And even if it did involve the U.S. government, it probably did not include the Congress.
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:27.560]  And yet no one wants to take this on.
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:32.520]  In fact, I get hate mail from the right wing just for reporting on it.
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:37.080]  You know, I've never made any independent finding about 9-11.
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:43.880]  I've just simply reported what people are saying, experts say.
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:50.480]  And you've got this critical event that our entire change in civilization for the worse
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:55.760]  is built on, and you're not supposed to look at it, and they want to infiltrate groups
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:03.000]  and destroy them from within if they dare talk about it because it strikes at the heart
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.360]  of everything.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:08.040]  If this comes out, it's going to bring these people down.
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:13.160]  But if it doesn't come out, it's going to lead them to Pax Americana that Dick Cheney
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:14.660]  wrote about.
[02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:21.080]  America is a global enforcer for these megabanks and this inner coterie of corporations.
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.880]  And if it ever comes out that these guys were U.S. government minions, which they were,
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:30.240]  taking part in drills, which they were, just like the underwear bomber, and we have the
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:34.340]  witnesses there, if it ever comes out, this will bring them down.
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:38.520]  So it's a double-edged sword, but look at Fast and Furious.
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:43.040]  Thousands of guns shipped into Mexico for two years, over 3,000 dead confirmed connected
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:48.240]  to those guns alone, and the government knew and did it on purpose, and nobody gets in
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:51.880]  trouble, and it's admitted the Attorney General lied to Congress.
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.040]  Well, that's true.
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:04.320]  You can find so many of these examples now, I mean, so it looks pretty dark.
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:15.440]  And I agree with you, the government is actually going to bring us down just from all its overreach.
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:23.880]  We are not capable of being a world hegemon and other areas of the world seeing what's
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:28.400]  happening and what we're doing is starting to organize against us.
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:33.240]  And once that happens, the power of distribution changes.
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:43.600]  So what we really are facing is these people in Washington eventually resorting to nuclear
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:45.800]  weapons.
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:52.560]  And so this is, of course, a far greater threat than having to face the possibility that the
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:56.320]  government lied about 9-11.
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:57.320]  It'd be much better.
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.000]  And you know how they'll do that, Dr. Roberts?
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:05.960]  They'll blow a city up, say that a Muslim country did it with Russian support, they'll
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:11.640]  track the isotope to Russia, and then they'll have a stalemate and say, totally capitulated,
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:15.920]  we're going to nuke you, we're in underground bases, we don't care about the general population,
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:17.680]  and Russia may roll over.
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:22.200]  Now these same globalists are somewhat teamed up with China, but whenever you look at, and
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:27.640]  this is my next question, with bizarre statements like Greenspan saying, we'll just print money
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:33.320]  and other things, and there was a certain doddering craziness in his eyes, and even the host of
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:42.760]  the show, and even insider Goolsbee were clearly shocked by such a statement, and as an economist
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:49.240]  who understands these things, why do you think Goolsbee and the host were so shocked by the
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:56.200]  almost nattering, giggling, childlike way Greenspan said it?
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:05.000]  Well, I don't know, but I think Greenspan is right, the United States government cannot
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:11.320]  default because it's bonds are in its own currency, and it can always redeem the bonds
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:13.600]  by printing money.
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  So I do not think there's any possibility of defaulting on paying the bonds.
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:27.000]  Now of course, if they print enough money to redeem enough bonds, and that money finds
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:33.720]  its way into the economy and circulates, then it can drive up prices, and it can drive them
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:43.400]  up very high, but there's nothing unusual about the use of inflation to grow debts.
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.520]  But before they would never talk like that, at least when I've seen them now, now they're
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.880]  getting more and more out in the open, and he just said it like Alex.
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:52.120]  It's what they're doing, isn't it?
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:57.440]  I mean, that's what quantitative easing one was, that's what quantitative easing two was.
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:04.000]  It was printing money to purchase the newly issued debt of the Treasury.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  Do you think they'll announce QE3 at that event with Bernanke tomorrow?
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.480]  I don't know whether they'll announce it, but I'm fairly confident they're going to
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:20.480]  do it, and whether they will decide if they announce it, it's more troublesome than not
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:23.520]  announcing it and just doing it.
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:31.960]  I don't know how they'll judge that, but if they start buying the bonds, you have to ask
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:35.040]  yourself who's going to buy them.
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:41.240]  Now if the stock market keeps tumbling and going down, then you will have a lot of flight
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:45.720]  from stocks to bonds, and that will finance the deficit.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.760]  As long as that flight goes on, there's a tremendous amount of money in the stock market
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:50:01.440]  that can exit, or if the top is taking off a goal and everybody starts saying, oh my
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.240]  gosh, it's going down, then you may have a flight from gold into bonds.
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:10.600]  So different things like that can finance it, or if they get the rumor established that
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:14.960]  the euro's going to collapse because of sovereign debt problems, then you'll have all the flight
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:18.840]  from Europe into bonds, to American bonds.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:24.320]  So there are other ways that they can finance this, at least for several years.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:25.320]  Sure, they're juggling.
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:28.360]  How long can the juggling last?
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:36.280]  The juggling can last until the rest of the world deserts the dollar.
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:42.720]  That might take high inflation, or it might just result from people saying, look, they
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:49.280]  can't get their deficit under control, and they're going to continue to print money,
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:54.600]  and we're holding all these huge numbers of bonds, and we need to start getting out of
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:55.600]  them.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:57.360]  Let's finish up with the end game on the other side.
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:58.560]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:01.400]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:04.600]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:07.960]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:12.040]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:18.480]  to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:23.880]  diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:26.200]  In all, at least 68 diseases.
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:30.160]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:31.160]  production?
[02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:34.580]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:39.240]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market.
[02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:43.600]  All other whey proteins are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:48.960]  One World Whey is now the standard by which all other whey protein powders can be measured.

[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:31.920]  The dollar being devalued, QE1, QE3 is already causing increased inflation worldwide, but
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:38.080]  the banks are hoarding the bailout money most of it, so it's not really causing the hard
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.520]  core inflation, but we do see the Chinese lecturing us.
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:45.280]  We do see Putin saying, America's a parasite.
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:48.040]  How about the parasites took over America?
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:52.680]  I mean, that's more like it, but I guess we are parasites at the end of the day if we
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.400]  let these parasites run us and control us.
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:02.080]  So Dr. Roberts, am I right in your view that we're really starting to get closer to the
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:07.560]  point of where it's almost a foregone conclusion that the dollar is going to die, the unthinkable
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:11.720]  is now thinkable, the only question is, how will that transition happen?
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:19.560]  I think that's right, you know, the only way they can save the dollar, they would have
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:27.440]  to be able to greatly reduce the trade deficit, and they can't do that because of all the
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:34.160]  offshoring of jobs, and to get the budget deficit under control, they would have to be
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:41.320]  able to stop the wars and dramatically cut the defense budget, but the power of the military
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:48.960]  security complex is just too high, and the propaganda and terrorist scare has been effective
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:51.520]  for so much of the population.
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.880]  So if you can't get your trade deficit under control, and you can't get your budget deficit
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:01.640]  under control, there's no way the dollar can survive.
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:07.920]  Now the train rent can be slow and gradual, or just one day everybody could wake up and
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:13.480]  say, my God, what am I doing, holding all these dollar denominated assets, and it could
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:14.480]  be fast.
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:19.880]  I have no way of knowing, no one has any way of knowing, but I think it is true that they've
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:26.320]  got no way to control the budget deficit or the trade deficit, and therefore there will
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:30.280]  be a train wreck.
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:34.160]  So just a few years ago you were saying that there were some things we could do to reverse
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:39.280]  this, are you saying that this couldn't be reversed, even if the right policies were
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:43.280]  put in place because we've just been too deindustrialized?
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:51.640]  If I was in charge, I could reverse it still, but the powers that be will not let politicians
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:59.160]  reverse it, you know, offshoring the benefits of corporations and shareholders because it
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.960]  increases profits, and so if you go in there and say, well we're not going to let you increase
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:11.320]  your profits this way anymore, you're going to be up against the powerful financial interest.
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:16.560]  Similarly if you say, okay, we've had enough of these wars, we can't afford them, they're
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:21.520]  undermining us, and so we're stopping the wars and we're cutting back defense, you'd
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.520]  be up against the military security complex.
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:27.280]  Yeah, they'll just send hit men to kill a few people to scare Congress, or they'll blow
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:31.120]  up a new building and say, guys with turbines did it, everybody will fall down and worship
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:33.520]  them.
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:40.880]  Similarly they're either of these private interest groups are stronger than the president,
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:46.080]  and unless the president had a movement behind him, which included the security, the security
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:52.680]  agencies, you know, if the CIA and the FBI and all this are going to stand behind the
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:57.840]  president, then he could get away with it, otherwise he hasn't a chance.
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:04.320]  And there'd still be a war, I mean, these entrenched bureaucracies and corporate interests,
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:05.320]  they're not going away.
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:08.680]  They're not going to just give up, you're right.
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:16.680]  They would test the strength of the president, and in my opinion, the way things stand, the
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:22.320]  president would not prevail, and anybody in the office knows that, and so it's not going
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:23.320]  to try.
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:27.280]  Plus they're brought up through politics from the beginning as a stable whores of these
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:30.160]  people, so they've got them on both ends of it.
