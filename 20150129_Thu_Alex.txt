[00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.591]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:08.351]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:10.112]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:11.693]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:13.253]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:17.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:26.574]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, January 29, 2015.
[00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:27.495]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:28.295]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:31.378]  We're going to be talking about a wide variety of issues.
[00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:36.221]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK in the bottom of this hour.
[00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:43.586]  In the third hour, we have Rosa Corey, who has published the book Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:46.027]  She's an expert on Agenda 21.
[00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:49.970]  She's somebody who's coming to it from the left, and she has a very important perspective
[00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.775]  I think these two things are really coming together in one area in particular that we're seeing this happen and that is in transportation.
[00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:11.403]  We're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about his article talking about how the UK is going to start developing the government controlled network using what they call M to M, machine to machine.
[00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.685]  Here it's going to be called V to V, vehicle to vehicle.
[00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:18.388]  That's been mandated by Obama to take place in just a couple of years and of course
[00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:23.972]  Every bit of your movement is going to be tracked and controlled by the government.
[00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:27.014]  They want to call this self-driving cars.
[00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:32.138]  Let me tell you, they're computer-driven cars and they're controlled by the government.
[00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:33.440]  That's the point of it.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.307]  And it's also a part of Agenda 21 because, of course, Agenda 21 is about limiting where we can live, limiting where and when we can travel.
[00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:45.769]  They need to take control of transportation.
[00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:49.171]  That's a very important aspect of government control.
[00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:52.973]  It's not just knowing everything about you, tracking you wherever you go.
[00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:58.556]  It's also about controlling where you go, controlling where you live, controlling how you live.
[00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:05.140]  It's an absolute total control grid that they want to put in place, and transportation is a very important part of that.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.521]  So we're going to be talking to Rosa Corey about that.
[00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.123]  I just got this flyer this last week.
[00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.914]  About one of the Agenda 21 meetings that were being held to push...
[00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.680]  The Texas Corridor that they're trying to create.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.585]  Of course, they want to merge the large cities, Austin, San Antonio, and eventually Dallas and Houston will be brought into a triangle if you look at their long-term plans.
[00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:29.687]  And pretty much everything else will be off limits.
[00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:32.009]  The government wants to take back control of all that.
[00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.811]  So, there's a real fight going on in the country right now.
[00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:43.696]  Utah and western states are saying, we want to have the land back that the government owns, has kept control of, they've kept
[00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:51.918]  In many cases, well over 90% of the land in some of the states, they never turned that back to the individual states as they became states.
[00:02:51.918 --> 00:03:00.881]  As Ken Ivory pointed out when he was visiting with Alex a couple of weeks ago, that was a situation that happened even in western states like Florida.
[00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.401]  See, when Florida became a state,
[00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:11.962]  Lands that were territories were controlled and owned by the federal government, but they turned that over to the state, to private individuals.
[00:03:11.962 --> 00:03:17.406]  We saw that happen in Texas, of course, because Texas was an independent republic before it ever joined the Union.
[00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:22.189]  But after the Civil War, the government had a major change in many areas.
[00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.632]  One of the things that they did was decide that they're just going to retain control of the land and never turn that back.
[00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:30.093]  Now they're going a bit farther.
[00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:39.216]  With Agenda 21 they want to not only not turn over the land that's out west, but they also want to seize control of the private property that we have here.
[00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:48.540]  And of course it's all being sold as sustainable, as environmental, as something that's going to help you to live a more
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.121]  Green life.
[00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:52.943]  And so she points that out in Behind the Green Mask.
[00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:54.304]  This is what I got in this flyer.
[00:03:54.304 --> 00:04:02.831]  It says, the Regional Rail Project is proposed to improve mobility, mode choice, accessibility, and transportation reliability.
[00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:03.411]  Well, you know what?
[00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:03.752]  I have.
[00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:04.793]  No, I don't.
[00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:23.857]  Monitor the license plates of people that were at gun shows.
[00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:27.799]  Now this was something that was leaked to the ACLU and then the DEA said, oh, don't worry about it.
[00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.040]  We never did that.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.740]  We promise.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.881]  We never did that.
[00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.081]  Do you really believe that?
[00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.622]  We're going to be back.
[00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:33.962]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:35.543]  We're going to talk about Obamacare.
[00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:37.844]  There's a discrepancy between the left and the right.
[00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:41.386]  Is it really more expensive than we were told or is it actually cheaper?
[00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:44.331]  I think there's some grubbering of the data going on here.
[00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:51.545]  We're going to look at that, as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership meetings on Capitol Hill were interrupted by protesters.
[00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:52.367]  Very important video.
[00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:52.767]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:53.348]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:03.987]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:10.409]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:19.772]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:32.956]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:37.238]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:39.018]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:46.881]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.021]  But for how long?

[00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:02.061]  Year after year, we watched the threats steadily increase.
[00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:07.688]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.

[00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:17.334]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:25.939]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, January 29th, 2015.
[00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.860]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.502]  It's amazing how quickly January has passed.
[00:08:30.502 --> 00:08:33.044]  We're already one month into 2015.
[00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:37.167]  We have today Rosa Corey is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:40.089]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us at the bottom of this hour.
[00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:54.757]  I think a common theme between what Paul Watson has talked about this last week, of course he's been talking about Davos, we're going to talk to him about that as well, but he also talked about the UK government announcing plans to remotely control vehicles.
[00:08:54.757 --> 00:09:02.261]  And of course, this is something we've been pointing out for quite a while here at InfoWars, and Alex Jones has been talking about it for a very long time.
[00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:10.348]  The key portion of controlling the population, of course, is going to be getting control of transportation.
[00:09:10.348 --> 00:09:20.496]  And that plays into both Agenda 21 as well as what we see being rolled out very rapidly in all the Western countries, Europe, the United States as well.
[00:09:20.496 --> 00:09:24.480]  They are all rushing to what they call driverless cars.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.523]  Let me tell you, these self-driving cars is the other way they refer to them.
[00:09:29.224 --> 00:09:30.904]  I have a self-driving car right now.
[00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.825]  I can drive myself anywhere I want to go.
[00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:39.086]  That's not going to be the case once we have computer-driven, government-controlled cars.
[00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:46.107]  They're going to determine where you go, how fast you go, and they're going to determine where you go, and they're going to track everywhere you go.
[00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:51.648]  And that's something that we should all be very concerned about, especially when we look at articles that have just come out this last week.
[00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:56.529]  Look at the air passengers' bank details that they want to see in the EU.
[00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.599]  They want to know all about your banking details before they allow you to travel.
[00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:07.772]  We also saw in the United States that the TSA is planning to scrutinize social media posts of travelers.
[00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:10.190]  So they want to know about your bank details.
[00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.951]  They want to know about what you're saying on social media.
[00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:20.094]  What do you think they're going to do once they control even internal travel within the country, controlling the cars?
[00:10:20.094 --> 00:10:21.494]  We've already gotten a glimpse of this.
[00:10:21.494 --> 00:10:30.338]  Of course, we know the government has an insatiable appetite for information about what we're doing, what we're thinking, if we're a possible threat at all to them.
[00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.799]  We had this story that we talked about yesterday.
[00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.659]  Alex talked about it some.
[00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:40.825]  Where the DEA was planning to take license plate scans of people that had gone to gun shows.
[00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:44.208]  This was something that was leaked to the ACLU.
[00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.110]  It was a plan that they had back in 2009.
[00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.134]  And this was something that was being done by the Drug Enforcement Agency.
[00:10:51.134 --> 00:10:51.935]  Not the ATF.
[00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:55.374]  But the Drug Enforcement Agency.
[00:10:55.374 --> 00:11:01.460]  See, of course, they've been on the cutting edge of destroying the Constitution for a very, very long time.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.463]  They were the ones who gave us civil asset forfeiture.
[00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:06.364]  They destroyed the rule of law.
[00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:08.406]  They set up the surveillance state.
[00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:12.089]  They did things to corrupt the police using civil asset forfeiture.
[00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:13.771]  They've been on the forefront of this for a long time.
[00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:14.712]  It was six years ago.
[00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:20.696]  They were planning on using automatic license plate readers to record everybody at a gun show.
[00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:31.822]  And the ACLU at the time said, well, we saw this and so we concluded these agencies were collecting the information, but we've now been reassured by the DEA that they never did it.
[00:11:31.822 --> 00:11:35.605]  And so it alleviates some concerns, says the ACLU.
[00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:38.766]  Do you really believe that they didn't do it?
[00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:41.906]  I mean, is people credible in any way whatsoever?
[00:11:41.906 --> 00:11:50.128]  Do you think that perhaps if they didn't do it, it's probably because they just found a better, more covert way to do it?
[00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:51.309]  Using Stingray.
[00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:53.069]  Using your cell phone to track you.
[00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:57.950]  Probably somebody said, guys, we don't need to drive around the parking lot taking pictures of cars at gun shows.
[00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.371]  We can just track them using their cell phones.
[00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:02.391]  Haven't you heard?
[00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.232]  We just got this great program from the NSA.
[00:12:05.632 --> 00:12:06.192]  They're doing it.
[00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.073]  They're looking to see everything that you're doing.
[00:12:08.073 --> 00:12:10.615]  They're following everything that you're doing.
[00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:13.816]  It's about total government control.
[00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:17.058]  It's about turning our planet into a plantation.
[00:12:17.058 --> 00:12:21.120]  And our overseers and our slave masters want to know everything that we're doing.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.141]  Now in the third hour we're going to talk to Rosa Corey.
[00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:31.225]  One of the things, guys, see if you can get a shot of this map for the people who are looking at a video feed of this.
[00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:32.626]  This is a flyer that I got.
[00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.935]  Telling me that I could go to a meeting and that's something we're going to talk to Rosa Corey about.
[00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:40.618]  This is not just about a Texas corridor.
[00:12:40.618 --> 00:12:44.042]  That same thing is going on where she lives in San Francisco.
[00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:50.950]  The same thing is going on wherever you live if you're listening to us because this is part of a UN global agenda.
[00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.672]  This is a global agenda.
[00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:55.834]  This isn't just a problem with Texas or California or the United States.
[00:12:55.834 --> 00:12:57.776]  This is going to go on everywhere.
[00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:03.881]  This is about containing everybody into a small area, restricting their movements.
[00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:10.306]  And right now, we're looking at this flyer that I've got and what they're saying is, well, of course, one option that could be studied
[00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:13.248]  Would be to provide passenger rail service.
[00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:14.129]  What do you think?
[00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:15.750]  I mean, we could study that.
[00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.032]  You could come to the meeting and give us your input.
[00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:20.194]  I mean, that's just an idea we had.
[00:13:20.194 --> 00:13:22.356]  They know exactly what they want to do.
[00:13:22.356 --> 00:13:32.404]  This meeting is something that's carefully controlled and plotted by the RAND Corporation to try to make you feel like you're part of a consensus buying into this sustainable program.
[00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:34.846]  The whole thing is a very elaborate lie.
[00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:37.595]  And I think people are starting to wake up to this.
[00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:44.019]  We see that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is being given a fast track by the Obama administration.
[00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:47.221]  Republicans want to get this done very, very badly as well.
[00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.742]  It's very likely that it's going to happen.
[00:13:48.742 --> 00:13:50.263]  Obama wants it.
[00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:52.705]  Both houses of the Republicans want it.
[00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:56.387]  They've signaled that they want to do this very early, very quickly.
[00:13:56.387 --> 00:13:57.748]  Why should you be concerned about this?
[00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:03.263]  Well, because it's the next step in global corporate governance.
[00:14:03.263 --> 00:14:14.627]  It's being negotiated in secret, and even if you don't have an issue with what's there, you think you know what's there and you don't have an issue with it, you should have an issue with the process that they're going through.
[00:14:14.627 --> 00:14:20.229]  The fact that they are negotiating this in secret, that none of our elected representatives are allowed to see this,
[00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:26.733]  That they're going to be given this massive document with no time to look it over and no capability of changing it.
[00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.034]  Some people have had enough.
[00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:32.838]  Let's roll this tape guys of the TPP protesters interrupting the U.S.
[00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.239]  Trade Representative's presentation.
[00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:35.019]  This is on C-SPAN.
[00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:46.092]  By knocking down barriers to U.S.
[00:14:46.092 --> 00:14:50.434]  exports and leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses of all sizes.
[00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:51.414]  Oh, it's going to be great for us, isn't it?
[00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:56.136]  As we work to open markets around the world... You're not telling the American people the truth.
[00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:59.957]  We know that the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been negotiated with the U.S.
[00:14:59.957 --> 00:15:00.298]  for five years.
[00:15:00.298 --> 00:15:01.958]  You said you're not telling the American people the truth.
[00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.639]  They're exporting this protester out.
[00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:06.140]  We know the things that they're doing to hurt the American people.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.822]  They're buying our offshore right now to lower our wages.
[00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:10.422]  Let's have water.
[00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:13.521]  All right, remove this person from the show.
[00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:28.752]  We're saying stop FastTracks!
[00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:29.112]  No TPP!
[00:15:29.112 --> 00:15:29.252]  No!
[00:15:29.252 --> 00:15:30.373]  We don't want supersized hackers!
[00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:50.297]  We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want... We don't want...
[00:15:51.937 --> 00:15:58.142]  If you want free trade, you don't need multi-thousand page documents to do it.
[00:15:58.142 --> 00:15:59.984]  Negotiated in secret.
[00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:03.327]  With only corporate lobbyists attending.
[00:16:03.327 --> 00:16:04.608]  It's not free trade.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:06.789]  It's anything but free trade.
[00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:09.071]  And this is not simply about trade.
[00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:10.793]  This is about much more than trade.
[00:16:10.793 --> 00:16:13.135]  This is about a global corporate governance.
[00:16:13.135 --> 00:16:14.956]  They're going to change copyright laws.
[00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:17.058]  They're going to force GMOs on people.
[00:16:17.058 --> 00:16:17.638]  They're going to
[00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:19.659]  Take over the internet.
[00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:22.500]  This is another means of internet control that they're going to use.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.062]  I'm very, very disappointed to see many Republicans who should know better, Republicans like Rand Paul saying that he's going to support this.
[00:16:29.062 --> 00:16:33.543]  I think if he does, it is going to gut his support with a lot of people.
[00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:35.884]  I think a lot of people are going to say, that's it.
[00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:40.945]  He's sold out to private, secret, corporate interests because anybody that votes for fast track
[00:16:41.843 --> 00:16:42.643]  Has done that.
[00:16:42.643 --> 00:16:51.165]  That's something we should be very, very concerned about, and it's good to see people standing up, taking the risk, and even getting arrested for that.
[00:16:51.165 --> 00:16:52.506]  Now, Obamacare.
[00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:55.046]  We're told that this is the Affordable Health Care Act.
[00:16:55.046 --> 00:17:05.329]  We had headlines just the last couple of days from Bloomberg, as well as from Media Matters, saying that the right wing is lying to you about Obamacare.
[00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.890]  Affordable health care, it turns out, is affordable after all.
[00:17:08.663 --> 00:17:14.305]  We've got this headline from Bloomberg, says Obamacare will cost 20% less than initial projections, says the CBO.
[00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:24.329]  Then we've got another one that's a bit stronger for media matters, says right-wing media won't tell you that the CBO's new Obamacare costs estimates are lower than expected.
[00:17:25.149 --> 00:17:32.360]  Oh, but meanwhile, we're seeing that actually they have gone up to 1.93 trillion dollars.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.308]  Actually, that's a 12% increase over just three years ago.
[00:17:37.308 --> 00:17:38.189]  So what's going on?
[00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:38.950]  Who's telling the truth?
[00:17:39.938 --> 00:17:41.739]  Again, they're groubering the data.
[00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:46.080]  You can make the data say anything you want if you massage it enough.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.821]  The CBO has done a 10-year projection.
[00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:52.342]  They did one back in 2012, and they did one just recently.
[00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:55.483]  Now, we reported on this when it happened back in 2012.
[00:17:55.483 --> 00:17:57.663]  If you look at this article that we had, it was in
[00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:06.228]  March 22, 2012, 10 years of Obamacare would cost $1.76 trillion.
[00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:09.070]  Far more than originally claimed.
[00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:15.093]  That was 2012, they were saying, that it was going to cost $1.76 trillion.
[00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:22.557]  Go forward to this last October, and we had an article on Infowars.com from RT, Obamacare likely to cost $300 billion more than thought.
[00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:29.036]  They say it's gone up $300 billion since the summer of 2012.
[00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:32.198]  So that was back in October.
[00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:35.040]  Just this last week we saw articles all over the internet.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.462]  We saw $2 trillion to cover just half of the uninsured.
[00:18:39.462 --> 00:18:41.163]  Actually a little bit less than half of the uninsured.
[00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:43.765]  That was the headlines from New American.
[00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:44.726]  We also saw other
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.741]  Outlets talking about this.
[00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:52.245]  We had the Daily Mail saying that it was going to be 1.993 trillion.
[00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:55.768]  That's two or three hundred billion dollars more than they had expected.
[00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:57.829]  So that's a 12% increase in just
[00:18:58.663 --> 00:19:00.304]  Three years.
[00:19:00.304 --> 00:19:01.064]  So what's the difference?
[00:19:01.064 --> 00:19:12.251]  Well, the difference is one of those is looking at a 10-year cost, and then the one that Media Matters and Bloomberg is cherry-picking, that they are grubering, is only looking at four years.
[00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.712]  They're looking at 2015 through 2019.
[00:19:13.712 --> 00:19:16.114]  So by picking the endpoints, they can come up with a 20% decrease.
[00:19:21.477 --> 00:19:29.799]  Why is it going down 20% but over a 10 year period it's going up 12%?
[00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:34.739]  Well, it's because Obama has arbitrarily extended so many of these things.
[00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:41.261]  If it looks like it's going to hurt the economy before the election, he pushes this out or he grants arbitrary restrictions with executive orders.
[00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:44.301]  So by doing that, he's pushing the costs out a few years.
[00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:48.402]  Then the liberal media goes in and looks at a shorter period of time at the front and says,
[00:19:49.142 --> 00:19:54.106]  It's 20% less because he's pushed these things out than they say the right-wing media is lying about it.
[00:19:54.106 --> 00:19:59.230]  We can't afford Obamacare, but it's more than just the efficiency.
[00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.971]  It's about freedom.
[00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.992]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.094]  What's the best way to keep a secret from somebody?
[00:20:03.094 --> 00:20:07.377]  Well, you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding.
[00:20:07.377 --> 00:20:12.642]  The year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real estate.
[00:20:12.642 --> 00:20:17.746]  We live in a capitalistic nation of kings and prey upon the greed of the selfish pawns.
[00:20:18.246 --> 00:20:19.747]  Based on a true story.
[00:20:19.747 --> 00:20:24.009]  We created the American Dream, where everybody can qualify for one of these loans.
[00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:32.809]  It's no secret that government and big business buy in bulk and get huge discounts.
[00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:34.429]  Not available to the little guy.

[00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:22.426]  Unlike US dollars, there is a limited number of Bitcoins.
[00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:24.567]  The government cannot simply decide to print more.
[00:21:24.907 --> 00:21:30.414]  Eight million people are already using Bitcoin anonymously, with 90,000 retailers accepting them.
[00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:35.580]  Investors have put four billion dollars into Bitcoin, with millions more being invested daily.

[00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.092]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:20.695]  We're going to be joined in the next segment, Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:22.816]  And of course, he had a story out yesterday.
[00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:27.599]  The UK government announces a plan to remotely control vehicles.
[00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:30.260]  That's something we've been seeing coming for a long time.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.243]  As a matter of fact, Obama has mandated devices on American cars.
[00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:37.024]  I forget exactly what the time frame is.
[00:24:37.024 --> 00:24:38.265]  Guys, maybe you can look that up.
[00:24:38.265 --> 00:24:40.727]  But it's only about five or six years out that we're looking.
[00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.989]  This is something that is coming.
[00:24:43.989 --> 00:24:47.131]  They're selling it as safety, as convenience.
[00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:55.196]  You know, you can just get in these cars and they'll drive themselves and you can just sit back and play on social media or do whatever you want.
[00:24:55.196 --> 00:24:57.318]  You don't have to be concerned about driving your car.
[00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:06.882]  I think it's a very dangerous thing because it illustrates the continuing movement towards a total control grid of your movements.
[00:25:06.882 --> 00:25:09.364]  They're not just concerned with tracking your movements.
[00:25:09.364 --> 00:25:17.811]  Of course, we had the report earlier this week about the DEA saying that they, back in 2009, they were going to record everybody's license plates at gun shows.
[00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:19.072]  And they said, don't worry, we didn't do that.
[00:25:19.072 --> 00:25:21.914]  They probably found a better way to do it, as I mentioned in the last segment.
[00:25:21.914 --> 00:25:26.738]  But we also saw this week that the TSA wants to look at your social media posts before they let you fly.
[00:25:27.478 --> 00:25:31.982]  They also want to look at your bank details in the UK.
[00:25:31.982 --> 00:25:34.604]  And now they say, we want to control your car.
[00:25:34.604 --> 00:25:36.566]  Don't worry, it's for your own safety.
[00:25:37.463 --> 00:25:40.364]  Believe me, they're going to hit that number hard.
[00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:42.464]  But it's going to be for your own safety.
[00:25:42.464 --> 00:25:44.924]  Just before we went to the break, we were talking about Obamacare.
[00:25:44.924 --> 00:25:50.725]  Affordable care, you know, that has gone up 12% in just three years, according to the CBO's estimates.
[00:25:50.725 --> 00:26:00.467]  And of course, the liberal media is goobering the data, looking at a very short section of that, not 10 years, but looking at four years, and saying, no, no, no, it's going to go down 20%.
[00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:05.368]  Well, it's going to go down 20% because they have pushed the cost farther out.
[00:26:05.908 --> 00:26:09.269]  But of course, we've got Republicans who don't want to do anything about it either.
[00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:14.731]  One of them, of course, is not just Boehner, but we've got Governor Kasich of Ohio.
[00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:18.413]  He says, if you oppose Obamacare, you're a bad Christian.
[00:26:18.413 --> 00:26:20.513]  This is something that comes from Campaign for Liberty.
[00:26:20.513 --> 00:26:24.575]  They point out that he's been going around the country stumping for a balanced budget.
[00:26:25.762 --> 00:26:28.085]  Can you feel the cognitive dissonance there?
[00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:32.853]  He's going around stumping for balanced budget and Obamacare at the same time.
[00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:40.704]  Something that we now see from the Congressional Budget Office is going to add $2 trillion to the debt over
[00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:42.346]  A 10-year period?
[00:26:42.346 --> 00:26:51.192]  I mean, we're looking at a total debt that's about $17 trillion right now, $17-18, so we're looking at a pretty big increase.
[00:26:51.192 --> 00:27:01.420]  That's about one-ninth, that's about an 11% increase just for that one program, just for only about half of the people to get insured.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.723]  And of course, these are going to be largely in the forms of subsidies.
[00:27:05.723 --> 00:27:08.605]  Well, hey, subsidized insurance is great, isn't it?
[00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.911]  Where's that money gonna go, that subsidy?
[00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:20.173]  We've been saying from the very beginning this is nothing but a massive transfer of wealth from the American people to the insurance companies.
[00:27:20.173 --> 00:27:23.454]  You're going to pay for that subsidy in taxes.
[00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:25.735]  And where is that money going to go?
[00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:32.277]  It's going to go to the insurance companies that write the checks for the Democrat and Republicans in office.
[00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:36.719]  Now this is what Kasich is saying as he's going around talking about a balanced budget amendment.
[00:27:36.719 --> 00:27:41.542]  First thing he did to explain it was he said, well, hey, it's not going to cost Ohio any money.
[00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:42.923]  We're going to get that money for free.
[00:27:42.923 --> 00:27:45.244]  We're going to get it from the federal government.
[00:27:45.244 --> 00:27:48.666]  I guess they're just going to run the printing presses a little bit over time.
[00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:56.371]  But of course, we all know that eventually it's pretty easy to point out that that's going to have to be paid back with interest by us or by our children.
[00:27:56.371 --> 00:28:01.554]  So then he changes tack and he starts talking about the compassionate side of it.
[00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:08.079]  Washington said that government is not compassion, it's not eloquence, it's not persuasion, it's not any of those things.
[00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:10.240]  It's simply force.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.363]  But he puts it out in terms of, this is our Christian duty to provide Obamacare.
[00:28:15.363 --> 00:28:18.064]  Government provided health insurance.
[00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:19.445]  Because it's not even health care.
[00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:20.486]  Okay?
[00:28:20.486 --> 00:28:21.606]  It is health insurance.
[00:28:21.606 --> 00:28:24.928]  You're buying insurance and hoping that you're going to get health care.
[00:28:24.928 --> 00:28:31.092]  But just because you've got health insurance, as so many people have found out in this country, doesn't mean that you're going to get health care.
[00:28:31.952 --> 00:28:36.074]  But he says this, he says, well I think I want to feed the hungry and I want to clothe the naked.
[00:28:36.074 --> 00:28:43.076]  And I have to tell you, I read a horrible story in the Wall Street Journal on the weekend about people, one man in particular, freezing to death over in Montana.
[00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:49.058]  And they've turned down about half a billion dollars of help, I'm told, and that disturbs me.
[00:28:49.058 --> 00:28:52.400]  So, you know, it's about helping your fellow man.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:59.102]  But, you know, God never said anything about practicing charity with other people's money.
[00:28:59.102 --> 00:29:00.723]  That's one of the first problems with this.
[00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:08.447]  And God never said that you need to go create a giant government bureaucracy to help people.
[00:29:08.447 --> 00:29:13.171]  Part of helping people is to make sure that you are doing it one-on-one.
[00:29:14.528 --> 00:29:16.189]  That's the real important thing.
[00:29:16.189 --> 00:29:18.531]  To step up and help people yourself.
[00:29:18.531 --> 00:29:22.694]  You can't depend on government agencies and bureaucracies to do that.
[00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.755]  They won't even allocate the money to them.
[00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:27.417]  They're going to keep more than half of the money for the bureaucracy.
[00:29:27.417 --> 00:29:30.639]  It's not even a good charity if you want to support that charity.
[00:29:30.639 --> 00:29:33.461]  But they can't tell who really needs it.
[00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:34.542]  And it's a faceless...
[00:29:35.462 --> 00:29:55.235]  Giving of money it has nothing to do with being a good Christian stay with us We're gonna be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, and we're gonna talk about making the trains run on time stay with us We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:06.441]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots.
[00:32:06.441 --> 00:32:07.882]  All at the same time.
[00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:10.304]  NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[00:32:10.304 --> 00:32:15.006]  And right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:20.109]  Former CIA director James Woolsey says two-thirds of US population could perish.
[00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:23.591]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:25.352]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:32:25.832 --> 00:32:27.473]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:32:27.473 --> 00:32:29.635]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.

[00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:36.186]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.186 --> 00:33:38.526]  I'm David Knight on this Thursday, January 29, 2015.
[00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:43.028]  Joining me in this segment is Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:33:43.028 --> 00:33:48.590]  Before we go to that, I want to let you know that we have a special right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.111]  We have two X2 nascent iodines.

[00:34:10.299 --> 00:34:16.901]  Again, get two X2 Iodine, you get one Ancient Defense for free, a savings of $20.
[00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:18.442]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[00:34:18.442 --> 00:34:20.083]  I wanted to talk to you before we go to this.
[00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:24.007]  Global control of transportation that we see developing.
[00:34:24.007 --> 00:34:34.094]  There's been a lot of stories this last week, and in the next hour, or the third hour, we're going to be talking to Rosa Corey about the Agenda 21 aspects of this, because this is a global issue.
[00:34:34.094 --> 00:34:37.697]  The crackdown on our movements.
[00:34:37.697 --> 00:34:40.139]  Not just the tracking of our movements, but the control of our movements.
[00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:45.002]  But before we do that, you've got a story up today about George Soros linking him to
[00:34:46.403 --> 00:34:52.586]  The Davos group where they're essentially panicking over social unrest but at the same time they're fomenting it.
[00:34:52.586 --> 00:35:04.711]  We know that George Soros is pushing billboards that are trying to foment the unrest in Ferguson and then they are also looking for their bug out places in New Zealand and elsewhere.
[00:35:06.385 --> 00:35:07.946]  Yeah, that's the theme, isn't it?
[00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:20.973]  That they know these revolutions, these uprisings are coming, and they want to hijack them, co-opt them towards their own ends, while having the insurance policy, as you said, of these secret hideaways, which Robert Johnson
[00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:35.284]  This economist revealed during the recent Davos Economic Forum saying that people are basically buying huge tracts of lands in remote locations like New Zealand as a hedge against this instability which they see coming.
[00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:41.188]  But as we've reported for years, David, as long as five years ago people were doing this.
[00:35:41.188 --> 00:35:41.629]  I mean, we had
[00:35:42.461 --> 00:35:48.345]  John Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media, he announced that he was buying a retreat on the Quebec border.
[00:35:48.345 --> 00:35:56.350]  We had James Cameron, the Hollywood director in 2012, announce that he was moving his entire family out of America to New Zealand.
[00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:03.031]  We also had the Bush family buying 100,000 acres in Paraguay as far back as 2006.
[00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:16.618]  And in fact, I was told by a very prominent person who knows a lot of insiders around a year ago that the elite were buying huge tracts of lands, airstrips, etc.
[00:36:16.618 --> 00:36:17.819]  in South America.
[00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:20.781]  So this is a trend that's been going on for several years.
[00:36:20.781 --> 00:36:25.223]  In the recent article, and in an article that's coming out in about an hour or so,
[00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:49.013]  I pick it up from the point where Zbigniew Brzezinski gave this big CFR speech back in 2010, and he followed it up with similar comments in 2012, where the elite know that this, quote, global political awakening, those are his words, global political awakening, is coming and that it poses a direct threat to the elite's bid to centralise power.
[00:36:49.013 --> 00:36:51.094]  And you were talking just then about the control grid.
[00:36:52.077 --> 00:37:07.340]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote the, you know, America's Role in the Technotronic Era, this book in 1970, in which he heralded the arrival of this control grid under which everybody would be under mass surveillance.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:19.982]  It's important to know that during this CFO speech in 2010, he was lamenting the fact that this political awakening, this uprising, posed a direct threat to that technotronic era.
[00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:26.570]  So this is something that they've known that it's been coming for at least five to ten years.
[00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:33.659]  We've now seen expressions of it in the 2011 London riots, of course, Ferguson, Missouri last year.
[00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:36.302]  So they're talking about wealth inequality.
[00:37:36.302 --> 00:37:38.906]  This is what it's arising out of, is this
[00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:52.405]  Depression of wages in the Western world where people, especially younger generations, are finding it increasingly harder to meet this consumer culture, to maintain this kind of lifestyle.
[00:37:52.405 --> 00:38:03.949]  Now that we've got, you know, religion, family, social mobility on the decline, that's being replaced by this consumer culture, which because of income inequality,
[00:38:04.705 --> 00:38:08.429]  Younger generations are finding it increasingly harder to maintain.
[00:38:08.429 --> 00:38:12.873]  So that's why we're starting to see these riots, like the London riots in 2011.
[00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:20.921]  And of course then we have the perceived widespread injustice, the complete collapse in confidence in political leadership.
[00:38:21.401 --> 00:38:26.682]  As well as police brutality, which led to the Ferguson, Missouri riots last year.
[00:38:26.682 --> 00:38:30.103]  So we've got all these factors colliding together.
[00:38:30.103 --> 00:38:33.584]  The elite see this as instigating riots and civil unrest.
[00:38:33.584 --> 00:38:36.125]  That's why they're buying these insurance policies.
[00:38:36.125 --> 00:38:47.428]  But as he said, this is where the involvement of Soros comes in, because they need to not only get ahead of that, but control and co-opt those riots as they did with the Arab Spring, as they did in Ukraine.
[00:38:47.748 --> 00:38:50.030]  Well of course they rushed to get the U.S.
[00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:54.092]  taxpayer to subsidize and insure their derivatives.
[00:38:54.092 --> 00:38:58.415]  One of the first things they did when they came back from the election.
[00:38:58.415 --> 00:39:01.057]  So they're very concerned about this whole system breaking down.
[00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:05.640]  But in terms of the long term prognosis, of course, we know that with
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:13.902]  AI with robotics coming into so many different areas, they're predicting massive unemployment.
[00:39:13.902 --> 00:39:20.103]  45% unemployment by the early 2020s, according to some of the AI experts and economists who have looked at this.
[00:39:20.103 --> 00:39:30.305]  If you look at that kind of massive unemployment and displacement, that is something that is up to the level of the Great Depression or worse, and that is going to cause massive unrest.
[00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:32.486]  So of course, they're kind of hedging their bets.
[00:39:33.906 --> 00:39:37.489]  And you talk about them seeing this coming.
[00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:40.111]  Ten years ago, yeah, they started making their moves.
[00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:49.098]  I went to New Zealand back in 1998 because I was reading Doug Casey and James Davidson and they were talking about what was going to be coming down.
[00:39:49.098 --> 00:39:51.099]  At that time, I had the money to make the move.
[00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.820]  I went there and looked.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.424]  It's a beautiful country, but I went there and it made me homesick for America.
[00:39:57.424 --> 00:39:59.005]  I just have to fight this here.
[00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:00.787]  I can't go somewhere else and fight it.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.183]  Well, I mean, that's the point.
[00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:08.331]  I don't see this, David, as, you know, the elite relinquishing power and...
[00:40:09.062 --> 00:40:12.565]  You know, saying the stuff's gonna hit the fan and we're gonna have to get out of here.
[00:40:12.565 --> 00:40:33.640]  At the moment, it's an insurance policy, but if there is massive political unrest, which is born out of those factors that I mentioned, you know, social alienation, the lack of community, increased corruption in government, and those declining wages, that income inequality, then they want, you know, an insurance option, and that's what this is about.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.542]  But in terms of the economic picture,
[00:40:36.262 --> 00:40:49.348]  A major factor, and this is what Brandon Smith wrote about in his article which we posted, which is linked from my article today, the next economic downturn, the next financial collapse, in whatever form that may take,
[00:40:50.376 --> 00:40:52.918]  They're going to blame it on capitalism.
[00:40:52.918 --> 00:41:00.763]  This is the narrative that they're pushing at the IMF, at the ECB, that capitalism is the biggest threat to capitalism.
[00:41:00.763 --> 00:41:03.345]  And of course, what is the solution going to be?
[00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:11.211]  Well, surprise, surprise, it's going to be for them to centralise more power and create this economic world government.
[00:41:11.211 --> 00:41:15.594]  So now you have Mario Draghi, the ECB head, and Christine Lagarde of the IMF,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:33.534]  Both penning very similar editorials earlier this month saying that when this next economic downturn really hits, they're going to blame it on sovereign economies and the solution will be what they call multilateralism, which is basically a world economic government.
[00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:43.142]  Centralization of economic power into fewer hands, less autonomous control over economies by sovereign countries,
[00:41:43.842 --> 00:42:00.094]  So even though it was their regulation, their policies that caused the 2008 economic collapse in the first place, their solution is going to be more of the same, but also a completely revamped economic system which is directly under their control.
[00:42:00.094 --> 00:42:02.196]  So again, they're using the same trick.
[00:42:02.196 --> 00:42:06.739]  We've also focused on the past, David, on these IMF riots in places like Argentina.
[00:42:07.541 --> 00:42:14.886]  They cause these riots by instigating social unrest in the first place by manipulating economies.
[00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:24.853]  Then when it all crashes, they asset strip and seize control over national economies, get them into more debt, get them reliant on the IMF, on the World Bank.
[00:42:24.853 --> 00:42:27.155]  So they're a good couple of moves ahead of the game.
[00:42:27.825 --> 00:42:31.227]  But whether it comes in the next few years or not remains to be seen.
[00:42:31.227 --> 00:42:38.673]  I know that Martin Armstrong, who is somebody we feature quite regularly, he's predicting and he's been very successful with his prior predictions.
[00:42:38.673 --> 00:42:44.377]  He predicted the 87 Black Monday crash as well as the 98 Russian financial collapse.
[00:42:44.377 --> 00:42:51.282]  He's predicting civil uprising within America before 2016 or in 2016.
[00:42:51.282 --> 00:42:54.624]  Again, as a result of this distrust in government and leadership,
[00:42:55.487 --> 00:42:59.270]  Uh, which continues to hover at historical record lows.
[00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:12.298]  So that distrust combined with an economic downturn, again, both of those factors are the fault of the economic elite, will lead to more of these riots, which the elite will then try to exploit for their own purposes.
[00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:16.081]  Well, of course, Paul, crony capitalism is not capitalism.
[00:43:16.081 --> 00:43:17.182]  It's really cronyism.
[00:43:17.182 --> 00:43:18.663]  It's been called graft.
[00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:19.804]  It's been called corruption.
[00:43:19.804 --> 00:43:21.345]  For crony capitalism to work,
[00:43:22.165 --> 00:43:29.948]  Government is actually a tool of these elites who essentially gain control of the government, who take it captive.
[00:43:29.948 --> 00:43:44.372]  And I think one of the things that illustrates that better than anything else, that corporate control and capture of our government, of course, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, something that I think is going to be rammed through by the Republicans and by Obama.
[00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:46.293]  We're seeing a lot of strong signals that that's going to happen.
[00:43:47.073 --> 00:43:56.598]  A perfect example of that where you've got corporations, corporate lobbyists meeting in secret and the government is not even allowed to know what's going to happen with that.
[00:43:56.598 --> 00:44:01.640]  They're not allowed to see the negotiations, they're not allowed to read the documents before they deliver it.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:08.684]  Instead they're going to hand deliver this thing and tell them to rubber stamp it and of course they will, Paul.
[00:44:08.684 --> 00:44:11.045]  Yeah, I mean that's the fundamental issue over and over again.
[00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:23.853]  These economists like Piketty, these socialists, continue to blame capitalism when we haven't had a true system of capitalism in the West for the best part of 50, 60 years.
[00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:25.434]  It just hasn't existed.
[00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:27.336]  It's crony capitalism.
[00:44:27.336 --> 00:44:28.757]  It's corporatism.
[00:44:28.757 --> 00:44:32.380]  It's the revolving door between government and corporations.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.521]  It's favours for favours.
[00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:36.744]  You know, that's what causes the problems in the first place.
[00:44:36.744 --> 00:44:45.595]  And then they blame free market capitalism to justify these regulations that only squeeze the middle class and small businesses.
[00:44:45.595 --> 00:44:52.023]  So then as the middle class declines, this wealth inequality, this income gap only gets wider
[00:44:52.503 --> 00:45:05.979]  As a result of their solutions to the problem, and yet they're still out in the media, Lagarde and George Soros particularly, saying that this wealth inequality will cause major social upheaval.
[00:45:05.979 --> 00:45:12.226]  But their policies, their crony capitalist policies, are what's creating that problem in the first place.
[00:45:12.446 --> 00:45:20.772]  If you look at the Keystone Pipeline, I mean, regardless of what you think of the Keystone Pipeline, the Republicans have pushed this through ten times now.
[00:45:20.772 --> 00:45:23.113]  They're trying to push it through the tenth time.
[00:45:23.113 --> 00:45:28.957]  Even when things hadn't already, hadn't changed, they didn't have a new Senate, they did it for the ninth time when they came back from the elections.
[00:45:28.957 --> 00:45:34.041]  The first thing they did once they got a Republican Senate was, of course, to push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:45:34.041 --> 00:45:41.386]  If you look to see who's going to benefit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you'll know who owns the Republican Party lock, stock, and barrel.
[00:45:41.866 --> 00:45:44.068]  That's why they're not doing any of the stuff that they campaigned on.
[00:45:44.068 --> 00:45:46.510]  They're not stopping open immigration.
[00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.592]  They're not doing anything to defund Obamacare.
[00:45:49.592 --> 00:45:53.155]  They're not doing anything to investigate the illegal actions of Obama.
[00:45:53.155 --> 00:45:56.258]  No, they just want to deliver to their corporate masters.
[00:45:56.258 --> 00:46:00.201]  And from that standpoint, it doesn't even matter to know who the corporate masters are.
[00:46:00.201 --> 00:46:03.583]  It's just important that you know that these people are bought and sold.
[00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:06.486]  And the same thing is going on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:46:06.986 --> 00:46:16.998]  But moving on to this other story, Paul, one of the ways, perhaps, that they won't have to go to their bug outs in New Zealand and elsewhere is if they can affect control of the population.
[00:46:16.998 --> 00:46:19.041]  And of course, one of those things is Agenda 21.
[00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:22.004]  We're going to be talking to Rosa Corey in the third hour.
[00:46:22.665 --> 00:46:28.050]  An important part of that is controlling our movement, controlling transportation.
[00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:37.037]  And we had some really harrowing news this week, of course, reminding us that that's really what's been going on at airports and the TSA, as well as in Europe.
[00:46:37.037 --> 00:46:43.283]  We had these headlines where bank details are going to have to be handed over before you can fly on a plane in Europe.
[00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:46.485]  And then the TSA wants to look at your social media posts.
[00:46:46.485 --> 00:46:50.229]  We learned that the DEA, six years ago, was saying that they were going to look at
[00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:58.272]  Automobile license plates at gun shows so they could put those people in a database as suspects.
[00:46:58.272 --> 00:46:59.212]  That was the DEA.
[00:46:59.212 --> 00:47:01.493]  That wasn't even the ATF.
[00:47:01.493 --> 00:47:03.974]  That was the DEA.
[00:47:03.974 --> 00:47:06.075]  So we look at what they're trying to do.
[00:47:06.075 --> 00:47:09.276]  It's not really about making the trains run on time, Paul, is it?
[00:47:09.276 --> 00:47:12.018]  It's really more like a Nazi-controlled device.
[00:47:12.018 --> 00:47:13.678]  It's not an efficiency issue.
[00:47:13.678 --> 00:47:15.559]  It's really about controlling transportation.
[00:47:17.208 --> 00:47:23.411]  Yeah, it's about embedding this idea that you have to get state permission to do anything.
[00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:32.576]  And if you've been a naughty boy, if you made a negative social media post about the government, then maybe your right to mobility, to travel, will be revoked.
[00:47:32.576 --> 00:47:39.419]  We saw that with this new TSA program, which for the moment they're considering for their pre-check program.
[00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:42.321]  So it will be opt-in on that basis.
[00:47:42.321 --> 00:47:46.043]  Of course, the threat is that it then could be expanded to every flyer.
[00:47:46.483 --> 00:47:59.069]  Which is, not only will they analyse your social media posts before designating you as being not a security threat and able to fly, they'll also analyse your purchase history.
[00:47:59.069 --> 00:48:06.273]  There was a dystopian British TV show where to travel you had to replay the last
[00:48:06.833 --> 00:48:11.417]  We've already had incidents where people travelling from Canada to the United States where the TSA
[00:48:31.435 --> 00:48:42.084]  ...knows their prescription drug record, says that they have depression and may be a threat to the other passengers, so people have been harassed, interrogated over that.
[00:48:42.084 --> 00:48:52.772]  So it's all about creating this culture of having to get permission from the state based on your behavior or your ideological or political viewpoints.
[00:48:52.972 --> 00:49:01.537]  And if you think that that's science fiction, let's play this clip from back in about 2008 of a CNN reporter, Drew Griffin, who couldn't get on a plane.
[00:49:01.537 --> 00:49:07.480]  Let's play that clip.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.781]  Don't think it can happen to you?
[00:49:08.781 --> 00:49:10.682]  It's happening to me.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.020]  So how did I get on this list?
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.422]  Well, the TSA is adamant it's not even me, even though it is me getting stopped at the airport.
[00:49:23.422 --> 00:49:31.763]  So, you know, they've been keeping people from getting on airplanes, and of course the TSA is the Transportation Security Agency, or whatever the S.A.
[00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:39.925]  I mean, I've seen so many different acronyms that are more accurate than that, but they're concerned not with just air travel, they're concerned with all transportation.
[00:49:39.925 --> 00:49:40.745]  And let me tell you,
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.121]  Think about it when you go to the airport.
[00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:46.701]  Are you concerned that they're not going to let you on a plane?
[00:49:46.701 --> 00:49:56.644]  Are you concerned enough that you will go through and let them put their hands on you, subject you to x-rays so that you can then be rewarded with plane travel?
[00:49:56.644 --> 00:50:01.446]  It is a very important tool for them to be able to control your transportation.
[00:50:01.886 --> 00:50:05.348]  And it basically put you under house arrest if they don't like who you are.
[00:50:05.348 --> 00:50:15.532]  I think this is a very dangerous thing, Paul, and it's something that people don't realize how pervasive this is going to be once the government starts controlling the cars electronically.
[00:50:15.532 --> 00:50:23.476]  What they're presuming to do is have Wi-Fi or some other wireless technology that is essentially going to track and control the cars.
[00:50:23.476 --> 00:50:28.258]  Of course, they tell us, don't worry, we're going to get rid of traffic jams for you and it'll be so much safer.
[00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.959]  That's the way they're selling it.
[00:50:31.303 --> 00:50:34.725]  Yeah, and that's the UK government proposal by Ofcom.
[00:50:34.725 --> 00:50:45.790]  They're now saying within 10 years they're going to try and set up this system whereby they can remotely control your car, limit its speed in order to reduce traffic congestion and solve global warming.
[00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:49.132]  So again, it's the government remotely controlling your car.
[00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:50.553]  It's a surveillance nightmare.
[00:50:50.553 --> 00:50:56.396]  But they won't tell you that it's really going to restrict all of your movements in a way that we've never imagined.
[00:50:56.396 --> 00:50:58.297]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:50:59.335 --> 00:51:02.998]  Worried about getting sick and feeling terrible for days or even weeks?
[00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:05.860]  You need Imudine for a healthy immune system.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.002]  Why get sick and bother with products that just don't work?

[00:51:29.642 --> 00:51:30.623]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:51:30.623 --> 00:51:34.084]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:34.084 --> 00:51:35.745]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:51:35.745 --> 00:51:37.706]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:37.706 --> 00:51:43.549]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:44.369]  I know, right?
[00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:45.690]  You love it too!
[00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.111]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[00:51:47.111 --> 00:51:48.151]  Let's go get some!

[00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:03.918]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:52:03.918 --> 00:52:10.881]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.081]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:53:01.081 --> 00:53:06.204]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:14.327]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:53:14.327 --> 00:53:18.849]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:53:18.849 --> 00:53:22.651]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:53:22.811 --> 00:53:28.753]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:28.753 --> 00:53:31.935]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:31.935 --> 00:53:37.297]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:45.480]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:54:01.727 --> 00:54:04.588]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:54:04.588 --> 00:54:08.229]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:18.117 --> 00:54:19.518]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:19.518 --> 00:54:23.780]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and I have Paul Joseph Watson joining me from the UK.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:39.447]  We've been talking about not only the article that he's got today about George Soros, at the same time that in Davos they're talking about how they need to have a backup plan, essentially hedging their bets that society isn't going to break down.
[00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:47.091]  At the same time, they're also fomenting unrest by putting billboards up to foment that kind of unrest in Ferguson.
[00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:50.813]  But we're also talking about how they may try to actually pull this back.
[00:54:50.813 --> 00:54:54.695]  Certainly how the government is going to try to control our movement.
[00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:58.977]  It's going to go far beyond what we have seen up to this point at the airports.
[00:54:58.977 --> 00:55:04.620]  Of course, we've seen the Viper teams that have gone out on the roadways to harass people.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.502]  To inspect them.
[00:55:07.502 --> 00:55:17.751]  We're going to have the government, however, remotely controlling your cars, deciding when you can travel, where you can travel, and they're going to be tracking you completely.
[00:55:17.751 --> 00:55:22.055]  A very, very harrowing thing to contemplate, Paul.
[00:55:22.055 --> 00:55:31.303]  One of the things when I look at this, and of course they're selling this as part of the Internet of Things, something that David Procratis was talking about years ago, the fact that
[00:55:31.903 --> 00:55:42.106]  Appliances in your house that are computerized can be used as a listening device for the CIA and others who are prone to do that sort of thing.
[00:55:42.106 --> 00:55:44.567]  But of course, it presents a lot of security issues.
[00:55:44.567 --> 00:55:47.948]  And I see people talking about the use of this in transportation mode.
[00:55:47.948 --> 00:55:50.789]  They say, well, the Internet of Things is not as secure as the Internet.
[00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:53.330]  It's like, oh, wait a minute.
[00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.951]  The Internet's not at all secure.
[00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:59.312]  And you're pushing something on me that has less security than that?
[00:55:59.312 --> 00:56:00.793]  What are your comments about that?
[00:56:02.014 --> 00:56:11.220]  Well, the FTC came out this week and said that it was vulnerable to hackers, so even the US government admits that the Internet of Things is wide open for abuse.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:20.306]  As he said, Petraeus, the former CIA director, hailed the Internet of Things as a transformational boon for clandestine tradecraft.
[00:56:20.646 --> 00:56:23.228]  Which basically means spying on everybody.
[00:56:23.228 --> 00:56:36.315]  The problem, and this is why we need to educate young people on this, because the people who are children and teenagers now are going to be growing up in this world, they're going to be under this kind of system, is that they have no frame of reference.
[00:56:36.315 --> 00:56:42.018]  They didn't grow up in a society before the internet or before mass surveillance.
[00:56:42.018 --> 00:56:48.802]  So I've got friends in their early twenties who, for example, can't even remember dial-up internet.
[00:56:49.322 --> 00:56:53.047]  So they've literally got no frame of reference for how things were before.
[00:56:53.047 --> 00:56:57.632]  So they've been inoculated that this is how it's always been and this is completely normal.
[00:56:57.632 --> 00:57:08.785]  And then you had a speaker at Davos last week who got up on stage and said, quote, people often behave better when they have the sense that their actions are being watched.
[00:57:09.145 --> 00:57:09.365]  Yeah.
[00:57:28.354 --> 00:57:34.964]  At the moment it seems that they are and this is why we need to educate young people on the fact that it's not always been this way.
[00:57:34.964 --> 00:57:42.113]  The threat that this could pose in terms of hacking and shifting that balance of power over to the government where they're always being watched.
[00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:48.340]  Very concerning because I see the schools today as quite literally being a prison.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:56.205]  I mean, I jokingly referred to it as that when I was in high school because I felt so confined, so restricted by it, so regimented.
[00:57:56.205 --> 00:57:59.728]  But today they actually have metal detectors and police walking the halls.
[00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:03.110]  And they're getting quite rough with the students.
[00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.932]  This is the way that they're conditioning them to live.
[00:58:05.932 --> 00:58:13.078]  Julian Assange, in terms of talking about Barrett Brown's charges against him, he said, social media has all of your friends wearing a wire.
[00:58:13.078 --> 00:58:19.282]  And the other part of that is that they're going to twist things that you say, take them out of context and come after you.
[00:58:19.282 --> 00:58:24.887]  It's just a really Orwellian society that we're growing up, these kids are growing up in, Paul.
[00:58:26.514 --> 00:58:31.719]  Yeah, and, I mean, the iPhone, for example, Snowden came out with another story about that.
[00:58:31.719 --> 00:58:37.504]  Most people don't know that every location you visit, unless you've gone and physically turned on the feature... Hang on, Paul.
[00:58:37.504 --> 00:58:39.566]  We're coming up to a break.
[00:58:39.566 --> 00:58:42.328]  Coming up to a break, can you... Alright, we'll be right back.

[00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:58.175]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[00:58:58.175 --> 00:59:07.241]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.

[01:00:05.256 --> 01:00:06.578]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.578 --> 01:00:08.340]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.102]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.102 --> 01:00:11.684]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.684 --> 01:00:13.226]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.226 --> 01:00:17.431]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.431 --> 01:00:21.477]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:24.919]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.919 --> 01:00:25.620]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.582]  We were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:00:28.582 --> 01:00:32.104]  He's going to stay with us through this segment to finish up what we were talking about.
[01:00:32.104 --> 01:00:40.951]  Of course, Paul, it's very concerning to see the fact that these things, they're admitting that the Internet of Things that they're going to use for our transportation
[01:00:41.531 --> 01:00:43.694]  Are not even as secure as our current internet.
[01:00:43.694 --> 01:00:47.259]  And so that brings up the issue of maliciousness.
[01:00:47.259 --> 01:00:56.493]  Governments can not only control when and where you travel, not only look at everything that you're doing, but of course they can get rid of you and make it look like an accident.
[01:00:56.693 --> 01:01:06.335]  And even if it isn't something malicious like that, anybody who has worked with a computer very much ought to be concerned about the fact that your car is under computer control.
[01:01:06.335 --> 01:01:13.896]  That was something that I would never be comfortable with, with the experiences that I've grown up with, with Microsoft, Google, the rest of these companies.
[01:01:13.896 --> 01:01:17.497]  When you talk about a computer crash, now you're talking about a physical crash.
[01:01:17.497 --> 01:01:21.618]  So I'm not going to be one of the people signing up to get into one of these cars.
[01:01:21.618 --> 01:01:23.218]  I'm going to have to hold a gun to my head to do that.
[01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:37.374]  Yeah, and then even on a personal level, you know, it came out that NSA employees were using the data that they had to spy on ex-lovers and friends and colleagues.
[01:01:37.374 --> 01:01:40.036]  I mean, we saw that in Nazi Germany with the Gestapo.
[01:01:40.036 --> 01:01:46.461]  They used it to get business advantages over people they despised and people who they were in competition with.
[01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:51.865]  So even beyond the level of government surveillance, this could directly impact people's day-to-day lives.
[01:01:52.025 --> 01:02:03.711]  There was just a story from Jonathan Turley, I was going to talk about this later, but since you brought it up, Alabama's first gay legislator declares that she will out adulterous colleagues who oppose same-sex marriage.
[01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:11.755]  She said, if you're going to oppose same-sex marriage on the basis of supporting the family, if I know that you are committing adultery, I'm going to go public with it.
[01:02:11.755 --> 01:02:17.699]  And he talks about it from the standpoint, well, this raises a lot of legal issues as to what they might be able to do to her.
[01:02:18.499 --> 01:02:25.924]  But I look at this as like this is the way the government has been, the NSA and other people have been blackmailing people in government for quite a long time.
[01:02:25.924 --> 01:02:40.775]  We had a story just a couple weeks ago about the disappearance of a Hollywood screenwriter and director, Gary DeVore, who was working on a story that he claimed, of course the storyline was that the entire invasion of Panama was to go down there and to get
[01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:41.875]  I think so.
[01:03:03.137 --> 01:03:12.563]  Yeah, because, I mean, surveillance is not just a weapon to be used to track people, to chill free speech, to make themselves censored, to restrict their mobility.
[01:03:12.563 --> 01:03:14.164]  It's a political weapon.
[01:03:14.164 --> 01:03:19.268]  I mean, we've had many stories about lists of gun owners being published in newspapers.
[01:03:19.268 --> 01:03:23.150]  And, you know, the flip side of that, you know where people who don't own guns also live.
[01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:24.271]  That's a boon for criminals.
[01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:35.020]  You've had a situation in Sweden where they've got lists of people who are anti-immigration in Sweden, and of course that could be collected just off social media posts alone.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:44.888]  Then people, newspaper editors and other political agitators have actually visited people's houses and harassed them because of their political opinions about immigration.
[01:03:45.448 --> 01:04:05.474]  So if you've got a total surveillance society where everything is open to data mining down to the minutiae of people's political opinions, not only does it make them more likely to self-censor, but it also makes it more likely for this surveillance, this information, to be used as a political weapon to smear people, to castigate people, and to harass people.
[01:04:06.189 --> 01:04:06.629]  Absolutely.
[01:04:06.629 --> 01:04:14.592]  We've seen it happen in the past, and as we see this gay legislator saying that she's going to out-adulterous colleagues if they oppose same-sex marriage.
[01:04:14.592 --> 01:04:28.036]  A lot of people, including myself, believe that Justice Roberts was blackmailed when he handed out the opinion on Obamacare, because he wrote both the opposing and the winning decision.
[01:04:28.636 --> 01:04:38.347]  And he flip-flopped on that issue and everybody was really scratching their head as to why he would go from opposing it as a mandate to supporting it and calling it a tax.
[01:04:38.347 --> 01:04:42.592]  And so a lot of people believed that there was maybe some blackmail going on at that point in time.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.301]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:04:44.301 --> 01:04:47.162]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK and of course the stories.
[01:04:47.162 --> 01:04:51.185]  There's also another story that we're going to talk about we didn't get to that Paul has up.
[01:04:51.185 --> 01:04:54.526]  Obese model hailed as a good example for women.

[01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:04.476]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:07.284]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.987 --> 01:08:21.990]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, January 29th, 2015.
[01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:23.552]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:08:23.552 --> 01:08:26.454]  We were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:08:26.454 --> 01:08:29.817]  In the next hour, we're going to be talking to Rosa Corey.
[01:08:29.817 --> 01:08:34.600]  She wrote the book on Agenda 21, called Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.083]  We're going to talk to her about something that I just saw.
[01:08:39.557 --> 01:08:44.759]  They're enclosing the net on us right now, I think, with transportation.
[01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:49.962]  This is the next big control area that they're putting in place very rapidly.
[01:08:49.962 --> 01:09:02.487]  It was less than a year ago that the UK, the European governments, and the US government got into a competition as to who could change their laws quickly enough to allow quote-unquote self-driving cars.
[01:09:02.487 --> 01:09:03.628]  Of course, those are not self-driven.
[01:09:04.128 --> 01:09:08.749]  They're computer-driven, they're government-controlled, government-monitored cars.
[01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:12.050]  It's a way for them to enact a complete control grid of you.
[01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:15.191]  And of course, this is something that is being done internationally.
[01:09:15.191 --> 01:09:25.974]  Just as we were talking to Paul Joseph Watson about the plans coming out in the UK, we have plans being made in the United States, as well as mandates coming online with vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
[01:09:26.414 --> 01:09:39.045]  But of course this all plays into the UN Agenda 21, trying to limit our scope of movement, trying to confine us to certain small areas where we're all going to live in a very high density.
[01:09:39.045 --> 01:09:42.368]  Essentially making it very easy to control us.
[01:09:42.368 --> 01:09:46.872]  Not only a prison planet, but that's going to be a plantation planet.
[01:09:47.592 --> 01:09:52.235]  It's a way of watching everything we do, keeping us under strict control.
[01:09:52.235 --> 01:09:54.196]  It's something we should all be very concerned about.
[01:09:54.196 --> 01:10:01.420]  And she's going to talk to us about not only what's happening here in Texas, but what's happening in California, what's happening globally.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:06.604]  So wherever you live, this is something that you've already seen to some degree in your area.
[01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:10.886]  They may have already enacted part of it in your area without you understanding what's going on.
[01:10:10.886 --> 01:10:13.608]  But believe me, there is a lot more coming.
[01:10:14.048 --> 01:10:15.909]  We're going to go to some of your calls here in a moment.
[01:10:15.909 --> 01:10:16.569]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[01:10:16.569 --> 01:10:23.972]  I want to take some of your calls about perhaps some of the transportation issues that we talked about or the global trade issues.
[01:10:23.972 --> 01:10:31.216]  Of course, there were people that crashed the Trans-Pacific Partnership meeting in Congress yesterday protesting it.
[01:10:31.216 --> 01:10:33.697]  The fact that we have a massive
[01:10:34.787 --> 01:10:35.867]  Sold as a trade agreement.
[01:10:35.867 --> 01:10:36.828]  It's not a trade agreement.
[01:10:36.828 --> 01:10:38.228]  It is far beyond trade.
[01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:41.709]  It has issues that relate to internet control, to copyright.
[01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:46.811]  It's going to have massive issues as far as GMO goes, as far as pharmaceuticals go.
[01:10:46.811 --> 01:10:49.452]  It is far beyond just a trade agreement.
[01:10:49.452 --> 01:10:51.813]  And of course, it is not a free trade agreement.
[01:10:51.813 --> 01:10:58.735]  You don't need thousands of pages of document negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists to have free trade.
[01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.596]  You can have free trade without that.
[01:11:00.596 --> 01:11:07.040]  What this is, is trade that is managed for the benefit of the corporations that are creating this agreement.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.102]  It's a very dangerous thing and it goes far beyond trade.
[01:11:10.102 --> 01:11:16.386]  And of course, as we saw the people protesting that, still most people don't really understand that it's even happening.
[01:11:16.386 --> 01:11:18.868]  And they don't see it in the bigger picture of things.
[01:11:18.868 --> 01:11:22.190]  It's far beyond just losing our jobs and losing our freedoms.
[01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:27.413]  It's about consolidating the world into regional blocks that are then
[01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:31.016]  That's the next case they've done.
[01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:33.597]  First they create the regional blocs like NAFTA.
[01:11:33.597 --> 01:11:35.398]  They create the European Union.
[01:11:35.398 --> 01:11:39.981]  Then they start consolidating those groups and that's the stage that we're at now.
[01:11:39.981 --> 01:11:43.763]  Of course, this is a secret agreement that we are not allowed to see.
[01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.745]  We're not allowed to make decisions about our lives.
[01:11:46.745 --> 01:11:50.668]  We're not allowed to make decisions about our families, what they're going to have.
[01:11:50.668 --> 01:11:52.509]  Of course, that's a big part of Obamacare.
[01:11:53.356 --> 01:11:55.498]  You can talk about whether or not it's efficient.
[01:11:55.498 --> 01:12:14.171]  You can talk about the data, and you can play games with the data, as we mentioned in the first hour, how they're groovering the data, trying to show that it's actually been a 20% decrease by just looking at a five-year projection, when the 10-year projection from the CBO has increased by 12% in just the last three years, over a 10-year period.
[01:12:14.171 --> 01:12:17.033]  So it's not affordable, but it's not even about that.
[01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:22.157]  It's about having the freedom to make the decisions about our lives.
[01:12:22.617 --> 01:12:26.941]  And of course, one of those things is, what are we going to have in our drinking water?
[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:33.835]  We have a California city saying that black sediment-filled tap water is, quote, safe to drink.
[01:12:33.835 --> 01:12:37.638]  And if you're watching on video, just take a look at this.
[01:12:37.638 --> 01:12:42.002]  Pull this article up, guys, and show them a picture that somebody took of the tap water.
[01:12:42.002 --> 01:12:45.084]  I mean, it looks like crude oil coming out of the tap.
[01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:54.272]  And, of course, the Golden State Water Company claims that this grotesque, foul-smelling, black sludge, quote-unquote, water, is safe to drink.
[01:12:55.032 --> 01:12:57.554]  Well, let's see a picture of them drinking that on video.
[01:12:57.554 --> 01:12:59.575]  I don't think I would want to drink that.
[01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:06.841]  But of course, if you see the black water coming out, you might start to have questions about whether or not this is safe.
[01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:14.966]  But when it is something like fluoride that you can't see, maybe you don't have the same understanding of the danger.
[01:13:14.966 --> 01:13:20.931]  We've just had a year of debate in Dallas about whether they're going to take fluoride out of the water supply.
[01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:28.632]  Looked like they were going to do it for a while, but then they have just taken a vote and they've decided that they're not going to remove fluoride from the water supply.
[01:13:28.632 --> 01:13:32.333]  That's the way it's being reported in the Dallas Morning News.
[01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:38.954]  It's almost as if the fluoride was already there and they decided that they're not going to run everything through a propyr filter to get it out of there.
[01:13:38.954 --> 01:13:41.455]  No, they're putting the fluoride in.
[01:13:41.455 --> 01:13:46.396]  It's not a natural situation and it is not something that you need to do for your health.
[01:13:46.396 --> 01:13:47.836]  Look at what they said in the article.
[01:13:47.836 --> 01:13:48.176]  They said,
[01:13:50.076 --> 01:13:59.979]  $1,060,800 is the contract that they have with Mosaic Crop Nutrition to fluoridate Dallas's water.
[01:13:59.979 --> 01:14:05.280]  So they're going to a crop nutrition company to get this fluoride to put in the water.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.081]  Why would they be going to a crop company to put this in?
[01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:14.662]  Well, I don't know, but they use fluoride as a pesticide on crops.
[01:14:15.714 --> 01:14:22.476]  Maybe that's why they're getting it, because it's not just even the fact that they're putting fluoride in, but it's the form of fluoride that they're putting in.
[01:14:22.476 --> 01:14:31.459]  Of course, it's industrial waste from aluminum companies, from nuclear waste, from the processing of nuclear products, uranium.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:50.786]  They have been taking this industrial waste from the aluminum and nuclear industries, and instead of those people having to dispose of it as a toxic waste and spend the money, they dump it into our water supply and charge us, in the case of Dallas, a million dollars to put this pesticide stuff into the water supply.
[01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:51.206]  But of course,
[01:14:52.116 --> 01:14:53.477]  It's for the children.
[01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:54.757]  That's what they said.
[01:14:54.757 --> 01:15:01.361]  The doctor said, yes, saving a million dollars would be great, but the cost to our youngest citizens would be higher.
[01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:03.142]  They might have a cavity or something.
[01:15:03.142 --> 01:15:09.725]  Listen, if you want to take a supplement for your kids, if you want to put something on their teeth, fine.
[01:15:09.725 --> 01:15:16.309]  Do you think that it's really safe for your children to mass medicate the public by dumping this into the water?
[01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:22.203]  The children are the ones at most risk of getting overexposure to fluoride.
[01:15:22.203 --> 01:15:24.105]  And we've had studies over and over again.
[01:15:24.105 --> 01:15:29.750]  Harvard study most recently showing too much fluoride causes a loss of 20 IQ points.
[01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:30.832]  They found that in China.
[01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:33.174]  20 IQ points.
[01:15:33.174 --> 01:15:34.575]  That's huge.
[01:15:34.575 --> 01:15:35.656]  That's a huge difference.
[01:15:36.544 --> 01:15:41.468]  That's the difference from a normal intelligence to a moron-level intelligence.
[01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:43.450]  20 IQ points.
[01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:49.836]  Now, how do you control the amount of fluoride that anyone gets if you're going to dump it into the water?
[01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:54.840]  If you think that it's safe and effective, you may be under-medicating adults.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.283]  You may be over-medicating children.
[01:15:58.283 --> 01:16:03.067]  Should children have the same dosage of any medicine that adults get?
[01:16:03.067 --> 01:16:03.628]  Of course not.
[01:16:04.485 --> 01:16:13.587]  I mean, it's absolute idiocy, but they can't figure it out because it's not totally black, like the water in California.
[01:16:13.587 --> 01:16:14.627]  And it's not just that.
[01:16:14.627 --> 01:16:15.687]  It's not just the fluoride.
[01:16:15.687 --> 01:16:24.529]  But now they're starting a campaign of demonizing people who don't want to get their children vaccinated because of this measles outbreak in Disneyland.
[01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:28.930]  And of course, Rob Dude did an extensive report on that the other night on the Nightly News.
[01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:43.997]  We now see that a doctor who is educating the public on vaccines traveling through Australia, this is an article that's up on Infowars.com today, that she's actually getting bomb threats and she's had to cancel the tour.
[01:16:43.997 --> 01:16:54.081]  This is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who we've had on the show here several times, announced that she has had to cancel speaking appearances that were scheduled for Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast.
[01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:57.003]  The reason was due to pro-vaccine extremists
[01:16:57.563 --> 01:17:06.325]  Calling for violence and making bomb threats against venue owners and their families in some cities that were originally scheduled for healthy living seminars.
[01:17:06.325 --> 01:17:15.087]  See, we can't even talk about this without the extremists threatening people over vaccines.
[01:17:15.087 --> 01:17:21.808]  Look at the difference in the way they've reacted to this measles outbreak versus the way they reacted to the Ebola outbreak.
[01:17:22.967 --> 01:17:26.330]  They shut down the clinics when they've had people come in with measles.
[01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:27.791]  They shut them down very quickly.
[01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:34.036]  We've got the CDC and all the health officials giving us dire predictions about what's going to happen with measles.
[01:17:34.036 --> 01:17:35.537]  I've had measles.
[01:17:35.537 --> 01:17:37.358]  I'm not afraid of measles.
[01:17:37.358 --> 01:17:41.101]  People my age, all the children were given measles by their parents.
[01:17:41.101 --> 01:17:46.606]  Whenever they found a kid down the street had measles, they sent the kids down to get it because it's a minor childhood disease.
[01:17:46.606 --> 01:17:48.327]  It's more serious if you get it as an adult.
[01:17:48.647 --> 01:17:52.661]  But they wanted the kids to have a good immunity against measles.
[01:17:52.661 --> 01:17:54.788]  Get it when it wasn't going to affect them that much.
[01:17:55.563 --> 01:18:01.125]  It's not the same thing as Ebola, but when Ebola was brought out, they were reluctant to close down places.
[01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.966]  They didn't take precautions for a couple of days.
[01:18:02.966 --> 01:18:04.607]  That's why nurses got sick.
[01:18:04.607 --> 01:18:10.409]  And the CDC was constantly going into the public saying, it's nothing to worry about.
[01:18:10.409 --> 01:18:11.990]  Believe me, we've got this all under control.
[01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:14.051]  You're not hearing that about measles.
[01:18:14.051 --> 01:18:18.733]  They are pushing the hype, the panic, because they want to sell vaccines.
[01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:19.493]  Look at this other story.
[01:18:19.493 --> 01:18:23.735]  The Palm Desert High School sends home 66 unvaccinated students.
[01:18:24.515 --> 01:18:30.100]  This is because they had one student showed up with a suspected case of measles.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.862]  She was cleared to return to class on Tuesday.
[01:18:32.862 --> 01:18:36.204]  So it's not even clear that to me that she even had measles.
[01:18:36.204 --> 01:18:40.308]  And yet we're hearing things from the parents associated with this Disneyland outbreak.
[01:18:40.308 --> 01:18:44.211]  We're hearing there was an article from a parent who was in Alaska.
[01:18:45.779 --> 01:18:50.104]  Her daughter had been vaccinated, vaccinated twice for MMR.
[01:18:50.104 --> 01:18:52.046]  They went to Disneyland.
[01:18:52.046 --> 01:19:02.477]  She came down with measles and she was absolutely convinced that her child got it from these unvaccinated kids, presumably who were at Disneyland with measles.
[01:19:02.477 --> 01:19:04.939]  The vaccine didn't protect her child.
[01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:05.660]  It was never a
[01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:12.443]  They never entertained the thought that her child might have gotten measles from the vaccine.
[01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:20.712]  That patient zero in this Disneyland outbreak could have been a patient who came down with measles after they got vaccinated.
[01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:22.434]  That was never an issue.
[01:19:22.434 --> 01:19:27.739]  But she ended with the absurd statement that my daughter got measles after she was vaccinated.
[01:19:27.739 --> 01:19:29.581]  That's why everybody needs to get vaccinated.
[01:19:30.322 --> 01:19:32.963]  It's like, how can you say that?
[01:19:32.963 --> 01:19:38.205]  If the measles were, the vaccines were effective, you wouldn't get measles.
[01:19:38.205 --> 01:19:42.827]  And to say that you're going to mandate it on everybody else because it didn't work on your child?
[01:19:42.827 --> 01:19:45.068]  Absolute insanity.
[01:19:45.068 --> 01:19:46.489]  Idiocracy.
[01:19:46.489 --> 01:19:47.689]  Maybe it's the fluoride in the water.
[01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:49.050]  We'll be right back with your call.
[01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:49.390]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:02.203]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:20:02.203 --> 01:20:05.746]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:20:05.746 --> 01:20:07.908]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:20:07.908 --> 01:20:17.215]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:20:17.215 --> 01:20:23.219]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:20:59.068 --> 01:21:01.890]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:07.013]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:07.013 --> 01:21:15.139]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:15.139 --> 01:21:19.661]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.661 --> 01:21:23.464]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.624 --> 01:21:29.568]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.568 --> 01:21:32.730]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:38.114]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:38.114 --> 01:21:46.279]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:21:46.279 --> 01:21:46.459]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:21:55.585 --> 01:22:00.689]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:00.689 --> 01:22:04.332]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:22:04.332 --> 01:22:05.673]  A pair of scissors.
[01:22:05.673 --> 01:22:11.477]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:22:11.477 --> 01:22:16.120]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.361]  The phone line.
[01:22:17.361 --> 01:22:22.624]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:22:22.624 --> 01:22:26.547]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:22:26.547 --> 01:22:29.849]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:22:29.849 --> 01:22:32.331]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:22:32.331 --> 01:22:36.673]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:22:36.673 --> 01:22:37.554]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:22:37.754 --> 01:22:39.996]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:44.021]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:22:44.021 --> 01:22:47.504]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.
[01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:48.685]  For half the cost.
[01:22:48.685 --> 01:22:50.688]  Protect your home with the alarm you can trust.
[01:22:50.688 --> 01:22:51.528]  SimpliSafe.

[01:22:58.758 --> 01:23:05.500]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.881]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:13.383]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:23:13.383 --> 01:23:14.523]  Not fun!
[01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:22.905]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:23:22.905 --> 01:23:27.687]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:23:28.007 --> 01:23:29.168]  My name is Errol.
[01:23:29.168 --> 01:23:30.708]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:33.289]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:23:33.289 --> 01:23:41.133]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:23:41.133 --> 01:23:47.436]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:23:47.436 --> 01:23:47.736]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:48.116]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.116 --> 01:23:49.337]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:24:11.078 --> 01:24:12.499]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.499 --> 01:24:14.780]  It's Thursday, January 29th, 2015.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.741]  We're going to go to your calls right now.
[01:24:16.741 --> 01:24:22.525]  I'm going to kind of open this up to pretty much any subject for the next half hour or so.
[01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:27.428]  When Rosa Corey joins us in the next hour, I'm going to talk to her a little bit about, we're going to talk about Agenda 21.
[01:24:28.528 --> 01:24:34.710]  About how it is playing out here in Texas and San Francisco, but of course it is a worldwide issue.
[01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:36.630]  It is something that comes from the UN.
[01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:39.831]  It's hiding, as she points out in her book, behind the green mask.
[01:24:39.831 --> 01:24:45.212]  It's hiding behind a mask of sustainability, of environmentalism.
[01:24:45.212 --> 01:24:50.714]  It's sold as, now these other aspects, the transportation parts, being sold as convenient.
[01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:54.255]  Don't worry, you won't have to drive your car in your daily commute each day.
[01:24:54.815 --> 01:25:03.447]  You're not going to have any problems finding a parking space because these government-controlled, computer-driven cars are going to do all that for you.
[01:25:04.113 --> 01:25:09.457]  But of course, they're going to limit when, where, how you can get around.
[01:25:09.457 --> 01:25:12.218]  And we're going to be talking to her about that in the next hour.
[01:25:12.218 --> 01:25:16.121]  And I want to take some of your calls in that hour about Agenda 21.
[01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:33.533]  If you've seen some of these phony consensus meetings that are being proposed by stakeholders and policymakers, and they would like for you and the community to come meet with them and give them your input about this plan, that they already know exactly what they're going to do.
[01:25:34.553 --> 01:25:37.875]  They're just trying to use it as a control device.
[01:25:37.875 --> 01:25:40.437]  It's something she talks about and exposes in her book.
[01:25:40.437 --> 01:25:45.000]  So if you've had an experience like that and want to make comments about Agenda 21, then we'll take your calls in the next hour.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.542]  Right now, we're going to just kind of open it up for general comments.
[01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.063]  Let's go to Patrick in Florida.
[01:25:49.063 --> 01:25:53.986]  Patrick, you want to talk about the TSA travel restrictions we were just talking about?
[01:25:53.986 --> 01:25:54.806]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:25:54.806 --> 01:25:56.667]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:57.228]  Great.
[01:25:57.228 --> 01:25:59.609]  Yeah, I'm escaping the cold from Michigan.
[01:25:59.609 --> 01:26:03.292]  I'm down here in Florida, and I went to buy a motorcycle.
[01:26:04.481 --> 01:26:11.623]  And we negotiated the price, and we sat down, and we're looking at the paperwork, and there was a $199, you know, admin fee.
[01:26:11.623 --> 01:26:14.123]  And I said, you know, what's in that?
[01:26:14.123 --> 01:26:22.685]  And the guy said, well, $40 of it is what I have to pay to the TSA to see if you're on the no-fly list.
[01:26:22.685 --> 01:26:28.727]  And he said that he had a computer program where you would, you know, enter in my information, come back,
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.381]  Well, you're starting to break up.
[01:26:31.381 --> 01:26:37.065]  You had to pay a fee to the TSA to see if you're on a no-fly list before you could get a motorcycle?
[01:26:37.065 --> 01:26:37.825]  That's correct.
[01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:41.187]  It was buried in his administration fee, but he broke down it.
[01:26:41.187 --> 01:26:49.513]  He said it was $40, but $199 that I was going to pay to get the motorcycle that he had to before he could sell it, see if I was on the no-fly list.
[01:26:49.513 --> 01:26:50.694]  So he had a computer program.
[01:26:52.443 --> 01:27:06.207]  It would say yes or no, and then he said if it flashed red, no, that he was instructed to call the sheriff and make up an excuse to detain the individual until such time as the sheriff would get there and arrest him.
[01:27:06.207 --> 01:27:07.628]  This is just beyond...
[01:27:08.817 --> 01:27:10.197]  This is just beyond belief.
[01:27:10.197 --> 01:27:18.620]  The fact that you would have to get the TSA's approval before you can buy a motorcycle, and of course we know they put a lot of innocent people on the TSA no-fly list.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:25.602]  Right after I started here, back in 2012, fall of 2012, we had a guy who was flying on a military plane.
[01:27:25.602 --> 01:27:26.542]  His wife was in the military.
[01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:27.862]  He was going to meet her in Japan.
[01:27:27.862 --> 01:27:33.464]  They stranded him in Hawaii, saying that they discovered, once he got to Hawaii, that he was on a no-fly list.
[01:27:33.464 --> 01:27:33.904]  And guess what?
[01:27:34.384 --> 01:27:37.866]  You get to Hawaii, you can't get anywhere if you are on a no-fly list.
[01:27:37.866 --> 01:27:42.429]  You can wait around and try to get a slow boat or something like that to get out of there.
[01:27:42.429 --> 01:27:50.095]  But this is also a guy who had been vetted by the TSA's own program to work as a transportation worker.
[01:27:50.095 --> 01:27:51.155]  He had been vetted by them.
[01:27:51.155 --> 01:27:57.740]  He had been vetted by the FBI in terms of firearms licenses somehow, and they would never give him an explanation.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.680]  Of course, they never do.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.744]  They never say why you're on a TSA list, no-fly list, and they won't take you off of it.
[01:28:04.464 --> 01:28:10.986]  This also illustrates, Patrick, what we've been saying, and that is that the TSA is not about airplanes.
[01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:16.287]  It is about total control of your travel and your movement.
[01:28:16.287 --> 01:28:17.067]  Well, it gets better.
[01:28:17.067 --> 01:28:18.448]  Are you ready for the second part?
[01:28:18.448 --> 01:28:19.128]  Oh, go ahead.
[01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.068]  Yeah, what'd they do?
[01:28:21.068 --> 01:28:31.791]  Yeah, he said, uh, so we were talking about how I was gonna pay for it, and, uh, you know, he was gonna put a surcharge if I used a credit card, and, and, and, uh,
[01:28:32.501 --> 01:28:48.230]  Anyways, he said that if I paid in cash more than $2,500, that that was also reportable to TSA, and that the $10,000 deal is just with the IRS, but there's a $2,500 cash reporting requirement with the TSA.
[01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:53.453]  Yeah, if you have cash, you're a criminal, because that takes you out of their surveillance grid.
[01:28:54.213 --> 01:28:58.634]  Anybody that wants to get out of the surveillance grid is automatically a criminal.
[01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.574]  That's what's really, really dangerous about this.
[01:29:00.574 --> 01:29:01.494]  Thank you so much, Patrick.
[01:29:01.494 --> 01:29:02.715]  Well, that is really amazing.
[01:29:02.715 --> 01:29:12.496]  So what he's saying is that he had to pay a fee to the TSA, and they were going to vet to see if he was on the no-fly list before he could purchase a motorcycle.
[01:29:12.496 --> 01:29:16.737]  And if he was on the no-fly list, they had to stall him so the sheriff could get there.
[01:29:16.737 --> 01:29:19.438]  And of course, the TSA wants to know if you're buying anything with $2,500 of cash or less.
[01:29:22.236 --> 01:29:29.087]  Is this a free country, or have we already descended into tyranny that is beyond what we can believe?
[01:29:29.087 --> 01:29:31.270]  And yet, most people don't even realize this.
[01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:34.715]  I didn't know that the TSA was doing this for people buying vehicles.
[01:29:34.715 --> 01:29:36.879]  Stay with us, we're gonna be right back with your phone calls.
[01:29:48.679 --> 01:29:52.602]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.602 --> 01:29:59.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:13.042 --> 01:33:14.763]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.763 --> 01:33:15.183]  I'm David Ida.
[01:33:15.183 --> 01:33:18.124]  We're going to be taking your calls in this half hour.
[01:33:18.124 --> 01:33:20.866]  Pretty much on any topic that you want to talk about.
[01:33:20.866 --> 01:33:22.787]  We've covered a lot of different things here.
[01:33:22.787 --> 01:33:26.269]  In the next hour, we're going to talk to Rosa Corey with
[01:33:27.882 --> 01:33:30.063]  Who wrote the book Behind the Green Mask.
[01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:32.825]  We're going to talk to her about UN Agenda 21.
[01:33:32.825 --> 01:33:41.909]  And of course we're seeing some aspects of that very publicly rolled out with the mass control of transportation.
[01:33:41.909 --> 01:33:45.311]  It's not only in the United States, but it's also in the UK.
[01:33:45.311 --> 01:33:46.752]  It looks like they're going to go beyond
[01:33:47.512 --> 01:33:49.413]  Just these light rail corridors.
[01:33:49.413 --> 01:34:01.121]  The next step is actually to move into a kind of government-controlled grid where they take control of your car and actually drive it wherever they want to, restricting your travel.
[01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:02.242]  And as we just heard from a caller,
[01:34:03.024 --> 01:34:19.115]  The TSA is already telling people when they buy vehicles, he was buying a motorcycle, he had to pay a tax and the TSA looked to see if he was on a no-fly list before he could buy a motorcycle.
[01:34:19.115 --> 01:34:20.976]  And also if he paid more than $2,500, that had to be reported to the TSA.
[01:34:24.787 --> 01:34:27.008]  What do you think they're going to do when they control your car?
[01:34:27.008 --> 01:34:28.129]  Do you really want to see that happen?
[01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:44.316]  And of course, light rail has really been where the Agenda 21 people have hung out in terms of trying to create these so-called corridors, merging cities into concentrated areas for the population so they can get us off of the land.
[01:34:44.316 --> 01:34:45.977]  But it's not just the trains.
[01:34:45.977 --> 01:34:48.498]  They're going to be looking at self-driving cars.
[01:34:48.498 --> 01:34:52.940]  This is an article from back in November, this last November.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.481]  This was from Forbes magazine.
[01:34:55.382 --> 01:35:02.103]  And they were talking, I'm sorry, Fortune Magazine, they said trains and self-driving cars are headed for a political collision.
[01:35:02.103 --> 01:35:10.145]  And of course they say the promise of what they call autonomous vehicles, they're not autonomous, they're part of the hive, if you will, when the government controls it.
[01:35:10.145 --> 01:35:13.185]  I have a self-driving car right now, that's not what I'm going to have in the future.
[01:35:13.185 --> 01:35:17.646]  They say it's becoming a popular talking point for opponents of mass transit systems.
[01:35:17.646 --> 01:35:23.027]  As one person pointed out, it's like they're designing the Pony Express in the world of the telegraph.
[01:35:23.447 --> 01:35:24.227]  That's right.
[01:35:24.227 --> 01:35:33.271]  They already know that they're going to roll out these so-called autonomous vehicles where they put all your cars on the Internet of Things and control them.
[01:35:33.271 --> 01:35:35.891]  So why do you need light rail to go places?
[01:35:35.891 --> 01:35:42.294]  Before they can get these light rail projects built, they're going to have the control of
[01:35:43.894 --> 01:35:48.577]  of your car, and so basically makes it into a buggy whip system.
[01:35:48.577 --> 01:35:52.120]  But of course it was never about transporting people.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.762]  These light rail issues have never been about mass transportation.
[01:35:55.762 --> 01:35:59.045]  It's been about paying off corporate donors.
[01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:08.571]  And we were just talking in the last half hour about the Keystone Pipeline, how that shows how owned our Congress is by special interests, by corporate interests.
[01:36:08.571 --> 01:36:12.074]  And now the Senate has passed the Keystone Pipeline bill.
[01:36:12.734 --> 01:36:15.976]  The House has already passed it nine times.
[01:36:15.976 --> 01:36:21.899]  And so now, the tenth time, the very first order of business when they come back is to pass the Keystone Pipeline.
[01:36:21.899 --> 01:36:29.902]  Whether you're for it or not, what it shows is just how corrupt and how driven by a few corporate interests our government is.
[01:36:29.902 --> 01:36:31.883]  And it's not just the Republicans.
[01:36:31.883 --> 01:36:33.684]  The Democrats are just as guilty.
[01:36:33.684 --> 01:36:41.168]  They're going to push through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is also being run by a few corporations who want to use this as part of a kind of
[01:36:41.528 --> 01:36:42.689]  Global Governance.
[01:36:42.689 --> 01:36:50.574]  They're going to put themselves on a par with governments when it comes to negotiating effects of their legislation.
[01:36:50.574 --> 01:37:04.283]  They can take them to a arbitration effect where they have essentially the corporations will have the same power as a state and we've already seen this happen with NAFTA and with other trade agreements that were smaller.
[01:37:04.283 --> 01:37:07.225]  Now they're combining these into a global governance.
[01:37:07.225 --> 01:37:10.828]  We've already seen how corporations can go to an arbitration process
[01:37:11.568 --> 01:37:19.191]  And get the taxpayers to pay them for damages because their profits have been hurt because of new legislation.
[01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:21.811]  You don't get that kind of protection as an individual.
[01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:26.513]  You don't get that kind of protection as a corporation that just does business within one jurisdiction.
[01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:29.754]  It's only the giant multinational corporations that are going to get that.
[01:37:30.563 --> 01:37:37.289]  And it's just part of the total corruption, the graft, the greed that we see, what we call as crony capitalism.
[01:37:37.289 --> 01:37:41.433]  Of course, they're selling that as a kind of capitalism.
[01:37:41.433 --> 01:37:42.554]  It is not capitalism.
[01:37:42.554 --> 01:37:43.955]  It's anything but.
[01:37:43.955 --> 01:37:44.735]  But going back to this
[01:37:46.209 --> 01:37:46.409]  This is
[01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:06.312]  Because of course that's a trap.
[01:38:06.312 --> 01:38:13.798]  The government is going to give you a little bit of, the federal government will give you a little bit of money to prime the pump and then they'll pull it back just like they're going to do with Obamacare.
[01:38:13.798 --> 01:38:18.162]  But it says that conservatives really like this idea of autonomous vehicles.
[01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:22.015]  Because they don't understand it's part of the control grid.
[01:38:22.015 --> 01:38:29.461]  We're going to be talking to Rosa Corey about how that's going to play out as they move from light rail corridors to controlling your cars.
[01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:43.172]  Before I go back to your calls, I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by the specials that we run at InfoWarsLife.com and the one we got running right now is by two X2 nascent iodines and you get one ancient defense free.
[01:38:43.172 --> 01:38:44.634]  Ancient defense of course is our new
[01:38:45.294 --> 01:38:46.955]  Herbal immunity formula.
[01:38:46.955 --> 01:38:49.316]  This is a limited introductory offer.
[01:38:49.316 --> 01:38:55.038]  You save $20 if you buy two nascent iodines and get that one ancient defense for free.
[01:38:55.038 --> 01:38:58.179]  And of course the supplies are limited and that will be ending soon.
[01:38:58.179 --> 01:39:03.461]  Right now it's a $20 savings if you get two nascent iodine and one ancient defense for free.
[01:39:03.461 --> 01:39:06.923]  And you'll find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:06.923 --> 01:39:08.423]  Let's go back to your calls right now.
[01:39:08.423 --> 01:39:10.544]  Let's go to Ramon in Texas.
[01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:12.985]  Ramon, you're calling from 90.1 right here in Austin, right?
[01:39:14.246 --> 01:39:15.526]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:15.526 --> 01:39:17.767]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:39:17.767 --> 01:39:24.530]  I've got a question, a couple of questions, and then I've got kind of what I'm thinking is a solution.
[01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:30.091]  I've never really heard anybody talk about it, but the questions are kind of simple.
[01:39:30.091 --> 01:39:32.812]  Are you, do you consider yourself a human being?
[01:39:32.812 --> 01:39:34.153]  Do I?
[01:39:34.153 --> 01:39:35.673]  Yeah, sure.
[01:39:35.673 --> 01:39:36.154]  Okay.
[01:39:36.154 --> 01:39:38.434]  Do you consider a robot a human being?
[01:39:38.434 --> 01:39:40.655]  No.
[01:39:40.655 --> 01:39:43.036]  Do you consider a corporation a human being?
[01:39:44.082 --> 01:39:47.445]  No, I disagree with Mitt Romney on that.
[01:39:47.445 --> 01:39:52.208]  Okay, do you consider like a police dog to have human rights?
[01:39:52.208 --> 01:39:54.010]  No, I don't.
[01:39:54.010 --> 01:40:07.540]  Okay, so it's pretty straightforward, you know, they're moving to a singularity and trying to download their consciousness into, we're talking about the 0.001% or whatever, into a robot
[01:40:12.068 --> 01:40:28.533]  The corporations are gaining more and more rights, they're gaining human rights, and essentially they want to incorporate, at least this is my understanding, or my belief, or my made-up, you know, theory, is that they want to be able to be in control of everything.
[01:40:28.533 --> 01:40:33.575]  Speaking of corridors, they want to ship us down the highway like cattle in a corridor.
[01:40:33.575 --> 01:40:34.835]  Absolutely.
[01:40:34.835 --> 01:40:40.457]  You are their slaves, you're their chattel, and as I said before, you know, it's not going to be a planet, it's going to be a plantation if they have their way.
[01:40:41.417 --> 01:40:42.117]  Absolutely.
[01:40:42.117 --> 01:40:46.858]  So, basically, here's the string that ties everything.
[01:40:46.858 --> 01:41:06.483]  If we pull on that string, maybe it'll unravel a good portion of it, but if we were to...if everyone that has an agenda or a program or a voice or whatever, if they're able to...if we were able to
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:18.289]  Unitedly push for legislation creating a human being as a human being, as a genetic, you know, Adam and Eve.
[01:41:18.289 --> 01:41:19.169]  I don't know exactly.
[01:41:19.169 --> 01:41:22.572]  I mean, I can think of a lot of things that would go into that.
[01:41:22.572 --> 01:41:31.500]  And a corporation, which is pretty obvious, is not a human being, does not have rights like a human.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.743]  Then if we were to pull that string and unravel
[01:41:35.487 --> 01:41:48.156]  It would unravel a lot of their structure and a lot of their laws that are allowing them to medicate us without permission, you know, to treat us like animals, essentially.
[01:41:48.156 --> 01:41:54.920]  I don't know if you know... Absolutely, you know, Ramon, there's a lot of prevarication that goes on when they start taking our rights away.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:04.787]  You know, one of the things is going in and playing with definitions, like who is a human, who has rights, as you point out, giving special rights to police dogs while the police will
[01:42:05.647 --> 01:42:11.937]  Shoot your own dog at your house in a heartbeat, even if they're mistakenly on your property, even if the dog is no threat.
[01:42:11.937 --> 01:42:16.764]  But if you, if anything happens to a police dog, it's treated as if you attacked a police officer.
[01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:19.088]  So we have these types of things.
[01:42:19.088 --> 01:42:20.750]  I think we really need to call them on it.
[01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:23.683]  I want to talk to Hugo DeGaris.
[01:42:23.683 --> 01:42:28.707]  We've been trying to reach him as someone who has been involved in trying to create artificial brains.
[01:42:28.707 --> 01:42:32.470]  He's very skeptical of the singularity, and of course I am too.
[01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:41.557]  There's absolutely no way, even if you could transfer a copy of everything that you know into some machine, that is not going to be you.
[01:42:42.383 --> 01:42:44.985]  That's going to be a copy of you.
[01:42:44.985 --> 01:42:46.166]  It may be a good copy.
[01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:47.387]  It may not be a good copy.
[01:42:47.387 --> 01:42:48.067]  Who knows?
[01:42:48.067 --> 01:42:49.788]  It might be something like Multiplicity.
[01:42:49.788 --> 01:42:53.591]  Remember that movie from the 90s, I think it was, Michael Keaton?
[01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:58.915]  He cloned himself and of course the clones come out exactly like him, fully mature, the same age that he is.
[01:42:59.515 --> 01:43:07.459]  And then one of the clones makes a copy of him, of itself, and it doesn't quite... it's pretty stupid.
[01:43:07.459 --> 01:43:15.464]  It's walking into walls and basically points out, well, it's kind of like, you know, when you make a copy of a copy on a photocopier of each successive generation, you lose a little bit there.
[01:43:16.184 --> 01:43:21.286]  Regardless, it gets to the point of whether or not you make a copy, it is still not you.
[01:43:21.286 --> 01:43:24.387]  We need to talk about what consciousness is.
[01:43:24.387 --> 01:43:26.208]  How do you define consciousness?
[01:43:26.208 --> 01:43:27.969]  It's not just about processing power.
[01:43:27.969 --> 01:43:42.594]  When you talk about the multiplication of technology, talk about Moore's Law with computer processing, doubling in power every 18 months, extrapolating that out and saying, yeah, we're going to have the computer power to have self-aware machines.
[01:43:42.594 --> 01:43:44.355]  We need to talk about what consciousness is.
[01:43:45.165 --> 01:43:53.691]  But I'm really concerned about how this is going to be used by the technocratic elite that we were warned about by Eisenhower.
[01:43:53.691 --> 01:43:55.913]  It's not just the military industrial complex, of course.
[01:43:55.913 --> 01:43:57.274]  What he warned us about was how
[01:43:58.635 --> 01:44:03.759]  How research and how the universities would be taken over by the military-industrial complex.
[01:44:03.759 --> 01:44:07.282]  And we see pretty much that they're running all of the research right now.
[01:44:07.282 --> 01:44:10.044]  Them and corporations like Google.
[01:44:10.044 --> 01:44:23.755]  And of course, the potential for this, even if it doesn't become a self-aware machine, the potential for damage, the potential for massive abuse of power using this kind of technology as a leverage is something we really ought to be concerned about.
[01:44:23.755 --> 01:44:25.697]  And before I move on to the next call, there was an article
[01:44:27.256 --> 01:44:28.798]  That I saw not too long ago.
[01:44:28.798 --> 01:44:30.800]  It's called The Knowledge.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.202]  London's legendary taxi driver test.
[01:44:33.202 --> 01:44:36.686]  This is where if you're not from the UK, you don't know anything about what happens in London.
[01:44:36.686 --> 01:44:40.630]  They have an incredibly complex road network there.
[01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:42.352]  Constantly changing names.
[01:44:42.352 --> 01:44:46.537]  It's twisting and turning because it has evolved over several hundred years.
[01:44:46.537 --> 01:44:48.919]  So the taxi drivers there had to do what they call
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.500]  Do the knowledge.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:55.462]  They would get on a motorcycle and they would ride the streets of London until they had it absolutely memorized.
[01:44:55.462 --> 01:45:06.886]  And they say, as these taxi drivers are in the fight for their life against Uber and GPS devices, they say, is there an argument for learning as an end in and of itself?
[01:45:07.793 --> 01:45:16.136]  And they point out that the posterior hippocampus, known to be important for memory, is bigger in London taxi drivers than in most people.
[01:45:16.136 --> 01:45:26.659]  And successful knowledge candidates, they see the hippocampus enlarge as they go through the learning process, through the test.
[01:45:26.659 --> 01:45:37.103]  Maybe we should ask, if instead of being so concerned about developing artificial intelligence, maybe we should start developing human intelligence.
[01:45:38.291 --> 01:45:40.732]  Because the opposite is also happening.
[01:45:40.732 --> 01:45:55.517]  We're also seeing our ability as humans, as we become more and more dependent on electronic media, as we become more and more the vassal slaves of the technology that is supposed to serve us, we find ourselves atrophying.
[01:45:55.517 --> 01:45:57.558]  Not only physically, but mentally.
[01:45:57.558 --> 01:45:59.799]  And I think that's a very dangerous thing.
[01:45:59.799 --> 01:46:06.962]  I think we need to reserve certain areas and understand that if we make ourselves totally dependent on technology,
[01:46:07.662 --> 01:46:10.624]  That's a very dangerous thing in and of itself.
[01:46:10.624 --> 01:46:12.185]  It atrophies even our brain.
[01:46:12.185 --> 01:46:14.446]  Let's go to Karen in Arizona.
[01:46:14.446 --> 01:46:17.288]  Karen?
[01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:34.378]  I know a couple of state senators, and I called them up after they, you know, Alex mentioned about this course at ASU, Haiti, and I'm going to name his name if it's okay.
[01:46:34.378 --> 01:46:37.340]  State Senator Russell Pierce.
[01:46:38.044 --> 01:46:46.409]  I called his office and I said, I don't like the idea of having a course in hating whiting.
[01:46:46.409 --> 01:46:57.937]  And they said, well, you know, if he has a constitution of freedom of speech, and I said, yes, but what this is, is about teaching hate.
[01:46:57.937 --> 01:46:59.738]  And I said, there's a difference.
[01:46:59.738 --> 01:47:06.262]  So people, you got to call state representative Russell Pearson, really hold the line on
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:22.128]  And, you know, and tell them, you know, there's a fine line in freedom of speech, but there's also a fine line, I said, you know, what if they have a course hating, you know, blacks?
[01:47:22.128 --> 01:47:26.310]  I said, there would be an uprising, you know what?
[01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:35.895]  So they said, well, we're going to send a letter, a letter concerning this course.
[01:47:36.923 --> 01:47:39.249]  And I thought, you know, we got it.
[01:47:39.249 --> 01:47:43.159]  I said, no, we have to defend this course.
[01:47:44.929 --> 01:47:55.631]  Well, you know, the universities have for quite some time, the entire education system, of course, is part of a control grid to manipulate the way people think of things.
[01:47:55.631 --> 01:47:57.152]  And this is something that's been going on.
[01:47:57.152 --> 01:48:00.993]  I saw elements of this when I was in college 20, 30 years ago.
[01:48:00.993 --> 01:48:02.213]  How long has it been now?
[01:48:02.213 --> 01:48:04.093]  Maybe it was longer than that.
[01:48:04.093 --> 01:48:07.214]  But it was definitely longer than 20 years ago.
[01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.134]  30, 40 years maybe.
[01:48:08.134 --> 01:48:11.535]  Anyway, I saw elements of that when I was there.
[01:48:12.611 --> 01:48:24.599]  There was a lot of, there was definitely an agenda that's being put out to people and of course we've talked about this extensively but this is just yet one more example of how they try to use divide and conquer and of course
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:33.307]  Speech that is directed towards white people can be very hateful and not tolerated by against any other minority group.
[01:48:33.307 --> 01:48:35.168]  It's something that we need to look out for.
[01:48:35.168 --> 01:48:40.533]  But anybody that has a kid in college, you really need to be aware of this.
[01:48:40.533 --> 01:48:42.454]  You really need to talk to your kids.
[01:48:42.454 --> 01:48:47.719]  Make sure they're grounded before you send them to a college because they're going to come after their faith.
[01:48:47.719 --> 01:48:52.162]  They're going to come after their understanding of the way the world works.
[01:48:52.162 --> 01:48:53.724]  They have a socialist agenda.
[01:48:54.264 --> 01:48:59.287]  That is going to be also a racist agenda that they're going to try to incorporate into that.
[01:48:59.287 --> 01:49:00.308]  Thank you so much, Karen.
[01:49:00.308 --> 01:49:05.771]  And yeah, people need to be aware of that and try to talk to your representatives about it.
[01:49:05.771 --> 01:49:10.615]  But personally, I gave up on the college system a long time ago.
[01:49:10.615 --> 01:49:12.356]  Let's go to John in California.
[01:49:12.356 --> 01:49:12.576]  John.
[01:49:12.576 --> 01:49:15.438]  David.
[01:49:16.781 --> 01:49:21.022]  I want to broach the subject about how to restore the Republic.
[01:49:21.022 --> 01:49:24.223]  We tried the ballot box in 2008 and 2012.
[01:49:24.223 --> 01:49:38.626]  The latest crop of Republican legislators that have come into the Senate have almost immediately renounced their Tea Party roots because they were told to do so by the leaders.
[01:49:38.626 --> 01:49:43.187]  And there's only one way we're going to avoid civil war, and that is to have
[01:49:43.886 --> 01:50:00.019]  A counter-coup against the foreign offshore banks that have taken control of our country and the military must intervene as soon as possible and arrest the entire leadership of the House and the Senate as well as the President.
[01:50:00.759 --> 01:50:05.723]  Well, the problem is I think that you've got an information war that you need to fight.
[01:50:05.723 --> 01:50:10.346]  I think there's also possibilities of peaceful resolution of this at the state level.
[01:50:10.346 --> 01:50:14.089]  We've seen some positive signs out west at the state level.
[01:50:14.089 --> 01:50:17.211]  We have some good representatives if they will exercise their control.
[01:50:17.811 --> 01:50:20.292]  I think we haven't done anything at the jury box.
[01:50:20.292 --> 01:50:26.555]  You know, you've got not only the ballot box and the cartridge box, you've also got the jury box where you can exercise power.
[01:50:26.555 --> 01:50:30.736]  That's a very effective place to shut down laws that are out of control.
[01:50:30.736 --> 01:50:41.401]  I understand that Washington is totally taken over by criminals, and I basically am not looking for some savior to get elected as president or even as a senator or as a congressman.
[01:50:41.401 --> 01:50:45.342]  We have a few good senators, a few good congressmen, not enough to make a difference.
[01:50:45.342 --> 01:50:47.163]  I think we have to work outside the system.
[01:50:47.503 --> 01:50:49.966]  I'm not ready to see it go violent.
[01:50:49.966 --> 01:50:52.009]  And yet, I think there's too many things that we need to do.
[01:50:52.009 --> 01:50:54.492]  We need to build a much larger consensus.
[01:50:54.492 --> 01:50:56.795]  If we have a large consensus, we can do it peacefully.
[01:50:56.795 --> 01:50:57.196]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.196 --> 01:50:57.797]  We'll be right back.

[01:51:58.315 --> 01:52:03.677]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?

[01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:01.173]  Year after year, we watched the threat steadily increase.

[01:54:11.252 --> 01:54:12.352]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:12.352 --> 01:54:12.832]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:12.832 --> 01:54:17.694]  We're taking your calls, and I want to go as quickly as I can to the people who have been holding.
[01:54:17.694 --> 01:54:26.857]  We're going to have Rosa Corey joining us in the next hour talking about Agenda 21, her book, Behind the Green Mask, and we're going to take calls after we talk to her.
[01:54:26.857 --> 01:54:35.319]  We're going to take some of your calls for her about Agenda 21 in the next hour, but right now we're kind of open lines in terms of any subject.
[01:54:35.319 --> 01:54:37.220]  Let's go to Jim in Connecticut.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.480]  You said you wanted to talk about fluoride.
[01:54:40.421 --> 01:54:41.182]  Yeah, good afternoon.
[01:54:41.182 --> 01:54:42.102]  How are you doing today?
[01:54:42.102 --> 01:54:42.663]  I'm fine.
[01:54:42.663 --> 01:54:43.744]  Go ahead.
[01:54:43.744 --> 01:54:44.164]  All right.
[01:54:44.164 --> 01:54:46.606]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about fluoride.
[01:54:46.606 --> 01:54:56.854]  I'm with We Are Change Connecticut, and I actually did a two-year campaign in the city of Waterbury, and we actually get our fluoride from all day at crop nutrition also.
[01:54:56.854 --> 01:55:05.841]  I was actually talking to the chemist down there for a couple of days until she realized what my agenda was, but I actually pulled an FOIA report from the city of Waterbury
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:11.243]  On what the test of the fluoride is before it's administered into the water.
[01:55:11.243 --> 01:55:13.225]  And you already know this.
[01:55:13.225 --> 01:55:17.368]  In the report, lead and arsenic was in the fluoride.
[01:55:17.368 --> 01:55:24.413]  And like you said before, the reason why is how they get the fluoride is how they scrub and produce the phosphate.
[01:55:24.413 --> 01:55:24.793]  Yes.
[01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:27.535]  For their, you know, for their crops and all that beautiful jazz.
[01:55:27.535 --> 01:55:34.640]  So, you know, it's funny how I went through a big, huge campaign in the city of Waterbury and I actually had a newspaper meet with me
[01:55:36.082 --> 01:55:37.522]  With an alderman.
[01:55:37.522 --> 01:55:42.224]  And they had to do a huge damage report a couple weeks later about what I did.
[01:55:42.224 --> 01:55:53.347]  You know, it's interesting when you look at the situation in Dallas where they talked about it for a year and that last minute they pulled out and they didn't stop the fluoridation of the water.
[01:55:53.347 --> 01:55:59.709]  It largely broke down on the word of dentists versus the people who were there against fluoride.
[01:55:59.709 --> 01:56:02.189]  And they said, well, just because a dentist says it doesn't mean you should do it.
[01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:05.230]  So when they get into that kind of an argument, they're going to lose that argument.
[01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:15.159]  Because the people of the Town Council, if they don't know what's going on, if they really aren't doing it because they're being paid to do it, if there's some question about it, you're going to lose that kind of an argument.
[01:56:15.159 --> 01:56:26.609]  I think you need to take it from the standpoint of what you did, doing a Freedom of Information request, looking at the contents of what they're actually putting in, pointing out that this is a very hazardous substance.
[01:56:26.609 --> 01:56:30.892]  We had people here at InfoWars before I ever came on board, went down to the City of Austin
[01:56:31.573 --> 01:56:38.456]  took pictures secretly of the fluoride container that was being dumped into the water supply here.
[01:56:38.456 --> 01:56:40.316]  It was a class 4 toxin.
[01:56:40.316 --> 01:56:45.098]  They had it marked on the tank and you could see the corrosion on the pipes.
[01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:47.139]  It was absolutely amazing.
[01:56:47.139 --> 01:56:48.939]  That's what you need to focus on.
[01:56:48.939 --> 01:56:49.780]  This is harmful.
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:51.060]  You can see that it's harmful.
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:53.981]  This is not even the fluoride that should be given as a supplement.
[01:56:53.981 --> 01:56:59.623]  And then talk about, do you really want to try to mass medicate people through the water supply?
[01:56:59.623 --> 01:57:00.664]  Is that an effective way to do it?
[01:57:01.417 --> 01:57:02.738]  How do you control the dosage?
[01:57:02.738 --> 01:57:05.581]  Well, the simple fact is, you can't control the dosage.
[01:57:05.581 --> 01:57:08.924]  And you shouldn't be force-medicating people with anything.
[01:57:08.924 --> 01:57:10.205]  It's not a harmless thing.
[01:57:10.205 --> 01:57:11.507]  No medication is.
[01:57:11.507 --> 01:57:16.231]  You have to watch what you take regardless of whether it is something that is very dangerous.
[01:57:16.231 --> 01:57:17.792]  You can take too much of anything.
[01:57:18.473 --> 01:57:22.615]  So, you don't have any way to control the dosage when you dump it into the water supply.
[01:57:22.615 --> 01:57:25.657]  You certainly don't have any way to protect the children.
[01:57:25.657 --> 01:57:26.597]  Thank you so much, Jim.
[01:57:26.597 --> 01:57:29.098]  I hope you get it out of the water there in Waterbury.
[01:57:29.098 --> 01:57:31.259]  Are they still working on that?
[01:57:31.259 --> 01:57:32.600]  How did that turn out?
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.120]  Oh, he's gone.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.361]  Okay, sorry.
[01:57:34.361 --> 01:57:36.342]  Let's go to Nick in California.
[01:57:36.342 --> 01:57:38.303]  Nick, you also want to talk about fluoride.
[01:57:38.303 --> 01:57:41.405]  You said you're on KOMY 1340 AM.
[01:57:41.405 --> 01:57:43.105]  You can probably tie into it.
[01:57:43.105 --> 01:57:45.787]  But the fluoride... I live near Watsonville.
[01:57:45.787 --> 01:57:46.767]  Hello, David.
[01:57:46.767 --> 01:57:47.087]  Hey.
[01:57:47.087 --> 01:57:47.828]  There?
[01:57:47.828 --> 01:57:47.988]  Yes.
[01:57:49.525 --> 01:57:57.186]  In Watsonville, they voted against a new system to put fluoride in the water.
[01:57:57.186 --> 01:58:02.647]  The state came back and said, we've got a program.
[01:58:02.647 --> 01:58:07.968]  You have to have the system if there's somebody who will finance it.
[01:58:07.968 --> 01:58:12.589]  And that didn't go away until the backer pulled out.
[01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:16.310]  We're in a strawberry area, where you stream against like Methyl Bromide?
[01:58:17.467 --> 01:58:19.850]  And the methyl iodine was sort of the same story.
[01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:21.431]  We're going to have to have it.
[01:58:21.431 --> 01:58:23.773]  They're throwing away everybody's loss.
[01:58:23.773 --> 01:58:30.580]  Until Fukushima came, the Japanese company who was making the product, methyl iodine... Absolutely.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.343]  They're jamming it down people's throats and they don't really care.
[01:58:33.343 --> 01:58:36.586]  If you get it done at the local level, they're going to come in and try to override it.
[01:58:36.586 --> 01:58:36.946]  Stay with us.
[01:58:36.946 --> 01:58:38.728]  We're going to be right back with more of your calls.
[01:58:38.728 --> 01:58:39.809]  Rosa Corey in the next hour.
[01:58:39.809 --> 01:58:41.631]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:56.153 --> 01:58:57.374]  Security alert.
[01:58:57.374 --> 01:58:59.375]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:58:59.375 --> 01:59:00.255]  Analysis.
[01:59:00.255 --> 01:59:00.975]  InfoWars.
[01:59:00.975 --> 01:59:02.956]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:02.956 --> 01:59:07.958]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:07.958 --> 01:59:08.998]  Crime directive.
[01:59:08.998 --> 01:59:10.539]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.539 --> 01:59:13.380]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:16.641]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:16.641 --> 01:59:18.802]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:19.102 --> 01:59:20.462]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:20.462 --> 01:59:23.283]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:23.283 --> 01:59:25.224]  They're never going to stop.
[01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:29.305]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:29.305 --> 01:59:32.905]  Block free iPhone apps at Infowars.com.
[01:59:32.905 --> 01:59:36.226]  Block free podcasts and video feed.
[01:59:36.226 --> 01:59:37.227]  Imperative.
[01:59:37.227 --> 01:59:39.167]  Destroy Britain's Minutes TV.
[01:59:39.167 --> 01:59:43.928]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:43.928 --> 01:59:45.309]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:59:45.309 --> 01:59:46.049]  You can feel it.
[01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:54.361]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.205 --> 02:00:06.506]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.506 --> 02:00:08.287]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.287 --> 02:00:10.048]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.048 --> 02:00:11.628]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.628 --> 02:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.169 --> 02:00:17.372]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.372 --> 02:00:21.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.968 --> 02:00:25.188]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.188 --> 02:00:26.229]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:31.791]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Rosa Cori talking about her book, Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:37.753]  We're going to be talking about the travel aspects a good deal and how they build consensuses.
[02:00:39.113 --> 02:00:44.916]  We just had a situation here locally in Texas, but of course this is something that is global.
[02:00:44.916 --> 02:00:49.998]  You're going to see this everywhere, not just in Texas, not just in the United States, everywhere.
[02:00:49.998 --> 02:00:54.921]  This is a UN agenda sold as environmentalism.
[02:00:54.921 --> 02:01:04.966]  I think it's interesting to look at the news out of New York, this failed snow storm that they had that was predicted to dump quite a bit more snow than actually got.
[02:01:06.015 --> 02:01:22.709]  Now they paid $200 million just in New York City for 7,000 troops, 760 plows, 50,000 pounds of salt, but even more importantly they shut down public transportation subway systems and trains the first time they ever did that.
[02:01:23.670 --> 02:01:26.892]  It wasn't because this was going to be a storm of historic proportions.
[02:01:26.892 --> 02:01:30.014]  It was going to be a big storm, but not of historic proportions.
[02:01:30.014 --> 02:01:35.917]  This says more about the nanny state that we live in than anything else.
[02:01:35.917 --> 02:01:43.021]  The fact that for the first time in New York history, and I don't know how long they've had the subway, it's been over 100 years, that they would shut down the subway, the subway,
[02:01:43.985 --> 02:01:46.187]  For a snowstorm.
[02:01:46.187 --> 02:01:53.092]  You need to think about how these politicians are going over the top, how they're using weather, anything.
[02:01:53.092 --> 02:01:56.595]  A measles outbreak to try to sell their control grid to you.
[02:01:56.595 --> 02:01:59.237]  Look at the agenda that they're pushing forward here.
[02:01:59.237 --> 02:02:04.602]  If they can't predict the weather accurately, they can't predict climate change accurately.
[02:02:05.342 --> 02:02:12.207]  And we've seen that even as CO2 has risen, we haven't seen the rise commensurate with that in temperature that they predicted.
[02:02:12.207 --> 02:02:14.968]  We haven't seen a rise in humidity that they predicted.
[02:02:14.968 --> 02:02:16.349]  That's a key part of that.
[02:02:16.349 --> 02:02:24.535]  And nowhere in any of their models have we seen a 20-year pause in global warming, which is what they're telling us now.
[02:02:24.535 --> 02:02:30.639]  And of course, global warming is such a joke in terms of the actual measurements that they have to now call it climate change.
[02:02:31.803 --> 02:02:40.327]  But we have to be very careful because they were very close in terms of admitting the Senate just admitted to try to get Keystone pushed through.
[02:02:40.327 --> 02:02:41.588]  They would do anything.
[02:02:41.588 --> 02:02:43.849]  This is the 10th time they've tried to push this through.
[02:02:43.849 --> 02:02:45.850]  They would do or say anything.
[02:02:45.850 --> 02:02:48.031]  And so they said, climate change is real.
[02:02:49.465 --> 02:02:52.446]  They said that doesn't really matter because of course the weather is changing all the time.
[02:02:52.446 --> 02:02:53.467]  They tried to pull it back.
[02:02:53.467 --> 02:02:57.169]  They're a little bit too clever with their winks and their nods.
[02:02:57.169 --> 02:03:02.871]  They only missed by one vote saying that there was real climate change and it was made by humans.
[02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:05.332]  Once they do that, all bets are off.
[02:03:05.332 --> 02:03:09.714]  They can put on a carbon tax, which is money that the government is going to collect on you.
[02:03:09.714 --> 02:03:12.916]  They're going to put that on while oil prices, energy prices are low.
[02:03:14.073 --> 02:03:17.034]  Then leave it on, and then raise it.
[02:03:17.034 --> 02:03:26.197]  And they also want to have carbon credits, which basically is nothing but an indulgence that you pay to private corporations run by Al Gore so that you can engage in activity.
[02:03:26.197 --> 02:03:34.259]  Because every activity that you engage in is going to be something that uses energy or produces something like carbon dioxide.
[02:03:34.259 --> 02:03:37.180]  Because when you breathe out, you are using carbon dioxide.
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:40.621]  So you're going to have to pay for the privilege to these corporate masters.
[02:03:40.621 --> 02:03:41.962]  That's the way they're trying to sell this.
[02:03:42.702 --> 02:03:44.924]  You should back off from this alarmism.
[02:03:44.924 --> 02:03:48.166]  And of course, we're going to talk to Rosa Corey, and we're going to take your calls after we talk to her.
[02:03:48.166 --> 02:03:50.908]  But right now, I want to open up the phone lines to just random calls.
[02:03:50.908 --> 02:03:52.469]  Let's go to John in Minnesota.
[02:03:52.469 --> 02:03:55.431]  John, go ahead.
[02:03:55.431 --> 02:03:57.032]  Hey, David.
[02:03:57.032 --> 02:04:01.375]  I think you're the best talk show host in America, and I know you've only been doing it shortly.
[02:04:01.375 --> 02:04:02.436]  Oh, thank you.
[02:04:02.436 --> 02:04:03.677]  Not at all.
[02:04:03.677 --> 02:04:04.498]  What did you want to talk about?
[02:04:04.498 --> 02:04:06.219]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:06.219 --> 02:04:09.281]  Actually, I believe that I'm a radio person myself.
[02:04:09.281 --> 02:04:09.741]  But anyway,
[02:04:11.593 --> 02:04:26.162]  Yeah, you know, the hearing that John McCain held today, where he had Henry Kissinger sitting in front of him, and this Operation Pink, which are people who are apparently against wars, the United States being involved in any wars, because as we know,
[02:04:27.094 --> 02:04:31.258]  I'd say three of the last three wars in American history are based on lies.
[02:04:31.258 --> 02:04:37.684]  So these people, I don't know if they're feminists, I don't know if they're just war haters or whatever, but I'm with them.
[02:04:37.684 --> 02:04:40.147]  But they interrupted the ceremony today.
[02:04:42.977 --> 02:04:48.042]  And, you know, calling Henry Kissinger a war criminal, which he absolutely is.
[02:04:48.042 --> 02:04:49.724]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:04:49.724 --> 02:04:51.586]  We're out of time, John.
[02:04:51.586 --> 02:04:52.427]  Thank you so much for calling.
[02:04:52.427 --> 02:04:54.409]  I'm sorry I got to you so late in the segment.
[02:04:54.409 --> 02:04:58.012]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Rosa Corey, UN Agenda 21.
[02:04:59.404 --> 02:05:04.006]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:05:04.006 --> 02:05:10.408]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[02:05:29.383 --> 02:05:33.045]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:33.045 --> 02:05:37.307]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:37.307 --> 02:05:39.088]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:39.088 --> 02:05:44.431]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:05:44.431 --> 02:05:46.952]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:05:46.952 --> 02:05:48.093]  But for how long?

[02:05:54.736 --> 02:05:56.597]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:05:56.597 --> 02:05:57.538]  Just won't quit.
[02:05:59.033 --> 02:06:07.938]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:06:07.938 --> 02:06:15.063]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:06:15.063 --> 02:06:18.525]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:06:18.525 --> 02:06:20.186]  population could perish.
[02:06:20.186 --> 02:06:23.648]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:06:23.648 --> 02:06:25.409]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:06:25.869 --> 02:06:27.530]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:29.692]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:06:29.692 --> 02:06:33.774]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[02:08:31.322 --> 02:08:37.331]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.102]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:42.102 --> 02:08:44.384]  It's Thursday, January 29, 2015.
[02:08:44.384 --> 02:08:48.868]  I'm David Knight, and we have joining us now in this segment, Rosa Corey.
[02:08:48.868 --> 02:08:53.793]  She is executive director of the Post Sustainability Institute.
[02:08:53.793 --> 02:08:56.036]  Why does she say post sustainability?
[02:08:56.036 --> 02:08:57.177]  Well, she's written a book.
[02:08:57.717 --> 02:09:11.923]  Behind the green mask, UN Agenda 21, showing us exactly what is Agenda 21, how they use tricks to make people think that they are part of the solution, that they're doing something good, something sustainable.
[02:09:11.923 --> 02:09:15.084]  It's a very deceptive mask that they wear.
[02:09:15.084 --> 02:09:21.027]  It's something that has been worked out, a technique these RAND Corporation meetings have been worked out in great detail.
[02:09:21.827 --> 02:09:31.275]  I contacted her because we had one of these come to my house here in Texas talking about the Lone Star Regional Rail Project.
[02:09:31.275 --> 02:09:40.062]  It's one of the aspects of what they do to improve mobility, mode choice, accessibility, transportation reliability.
[02:09:40.062 --> 02:09:41.463]  Who could be opposed to that?
[02:09:41.463 --> 02:09:50.110]  And they say, well, one option that could be studied is to provide passenger rail service from the north of Austin to downtown San Antonio.
[02:09:50.851 --> 02:09:53.133]  That's not just one option that they're going to look at.
[02:09:53.133 --> 02:09:56.135]  That is the only option they're going to look at.
[02:09:56.135 --> 02:10:00.799]  They're bringing you there to sell you on that option, to make you think that you're a part of that.
[02:10:00.799 --> 02:10:03.901]  And so breaking that down with us is going to be Rosa Corey.
[02:10:03.901 --> 02:10:07.264]  And of course, as I mentioned, she's a commercial real estate appraiser.
[02:10:07.264 --> 02:10:09.506]  She specialized in eminent domain valuation.
[02:10:09.506 --> 02:10:12.368]  Maybe we should talk to her a little bit about her take on the Keystone Project.
[02:10:12.788 --> 02:10:13.748]  Hi David, great to be with you.
[02:10:40.891 --> 02:10:43.273]  Some of the people are starting to wake up.
[02:10:43.273 --> 02:10:44.333]  The word is getting out there.
[02:10:44.333 --> 02:10:53.539]  Of course, you've been someone who was one of the people sounding the alarm about this, doing, I think, one of the best jobs of educating people about Agenda 21.
[02:10:53.539 --> 02:11:00.003]  We see that there are several state bills that are aimed directly at nullifying Agenda 21.
[02:11:00.003 --> 02:11:04.926]  We've got one in Wyoming, there's one in Missouri, there's one in Washington State.
[02:11:04.926 --> 02:11:07.468]  That's good news that those bills have been introduced, don't you think?
[02:11:08.638 --> 02:11:17.000]  What I see is that people are becoming aware, and this is our most powerful, you know, you consider yourself part of the resistance.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:29.243]  Resistance is an action, and so of course this is what's really happening is that people are making inroads and getting this information out, letting people understand what it is, what Agenda 21 looks like.
[02:11:30.143 --> 02:11:30.963]  I'm not sure.
[02:11:46.929 --> 02:11:49.290]  It's actually implemented locally.
[02:11:49.290 --> 02:12:13.320]  That's what we need to see, is that even though it's a global, international, huge plan, it's put together locally so that it gives the impression, gives you the impression that it's just local, that it's all just some little thing there in Elgin or Bastrop or wherever you are in Texas, and that it's not the same plan all over the world, which it is.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.821]  These plans are all identical all over the world.
[02:12:16.201 --> 02:12:17.842]  That's the key thing.
[02:12:17.842 --> 02:12:20.864]  Penetrating the secrecy and exposing the trick.
[02:12:20.864 --> 02:12:22.485]  Because it's like a magician's trick.
[02:12:22.485 --> 02:12:26.027]  You know, they can spellbind you by doing all these illusions on stage.
[02:12:26.027 --> 02:12:29.329]  If you understand what the trick is, it's lost its magic.
[02:12:29.329 --> 02:12:32.912]  And I think it's very important to expose that, to pull off the mask.
[02:12:32.912 --> 02:12:36.514]  A good example, if you guys can get a shot of this, I'll leave it here on the desk.
[02:12:37.208 --> 02:12:42.152]  You'll see something like this flyer that we got saying, your participation is needed.
[02:12:42.152 --> 02:12:47.717]  Please join us in a public meeting and learn more about the Lone Star Regional Rail Project.
[02:12:47.717 --> 02:12:49.318]  That's what you're going to see in your area.
[02:12:49.318 --> 02:12:52.501]  You're going to see something like that come in the mail.
[02:12:52.501 --> 02:12:57.866]  They're going to want to get you there with the quote-unquote stakeholders and talk about possible solutions.
[02:12:57.866 --> 02:13:00.408]  But they've got it all worked out, don't they Rosa, before you even get there.
[02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:05.022]  Yeah, the deal is that these are your government meetings.
[02:13:05.022 --> 02:13:07.964]  I'm not talking about your city council meeting or something like that.
[02:13:07.964 --> 02:13:13.566]  These are, you know, just like you said, David, these are plans, you know, this is your central Texas region.
[02:13:13.566 --> 02:13:26.811]  This is, the plan is designed to destroy jurisdictional boundaries, so you're going to actually lose the nation state, your national government, and become, you know, a collection of mega regions.
[02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:30.272]  So this is the process of doing it, and there you are in central Texas.
[02:13:30.792 --> 02:13:46.310]  So the plan is really to provide money for high-speed rail or light rail so that it can justify getting you out of your car and into the high-density, concentrated city center.
[02:13:47.090 --> 02:13:54.876]  And it may be a holding town, a temporary town that'll then, you know, be, you'll then later be moved into a larger city.
[02:13:54.876 --> 02:13:59.019]  But the idea is that, you know, you're going to think this is all your idea.
[02:13:59.019 --> 02:14:00.120]  You're so smart.
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.003]  You came up with this plan all on your own.
[02:14:03.003 --> 02:14:07.966]  And in fact, the plan's the same plan all over the world, certainly all over the U.S.
[02:14:10.488 --> 02:14:12.090]  It's about indoctrinating you.
[02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:16.413]  It's about propagandizing you so that you will not dissent.
[02:14:16.413 --> 02:14:19.616]  Because this plan does not allow for any dissent.
[02:14:19.616 --> 02:14:31.927]  Agenda 21, Sustainable Development, is about neutralizing the opposition and propagandizing the populace so that you are pacified and don't take action against it.
[02:14:32.407 --> 02:14:40.870]  Yeah, speak a little bit about exactly how that's going to be broken down at a meeting, because the RAND Corporation has worked this out into an exact science.
[02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:46.232]  And they've practiced this over and over again, just like the magician's trick where they say, hey, pick a card, any card.
[02:14:46.232 --> 02:14:47.473]  They know which one you're going to pick.
[02:14:47.473 --> 02:14:49.914]  They offer you the card they want you to take.
[02:14:49.914 --> 02:14:53.235]  Talk a little bit about how this works in these RAND Corporation-designed meetings.
[02:14:54.212 --> 02:14:56.894]  Yeah, this is actually quite cool.
[02:14:56.894 --> 02:15:02.298]  You have to certainly give them credit because they have thought this through and it's very well engineered.
[02:15:02.298 --> 02:15:08.942]  And if you're not paying attention and you're not hip, you're going to get sucked right into this thing.
[02:15:08.942 --> 02:15:10.864]  And especially, I have to say, if you're just like,
[02:15:11.384 --> 02:15:12.405]  We're good to go.
[02:15:33.753 --> 02:15:42.596]  And they have it set up so that, I describe this really fully in my book and I show you how to anti-Delphi these meetings.
[02:15:42.596 --> 02:15:55.761]  Delphi technique is about giving groups of people the impression that what they're seeing and what they're participating in is all their idea, while directing them to a predetermined outcome.
[02:15:56.041 --> 02:16:00.605]  That they literally, you literally have no impact on.
[02:16:00.605 --> 02:16:07.352]  That thing is all typed up, printed up, set up, ready to go before you walk in the door.
[02:16:07.352 --> 02:16:13.457]  And they may, you know, change the color of the park benches or something, but they're not going to change that plan.
[02:16:13.457 --> 02:16:15.019]  And this is the way it's designed.
[02:16:15.219 --> 02:16:25.502]  To give people an idea, I look on the back of this flyer and it says, the purpose of this meeting is we're going to define the purpose and identify the needs of the proposed project could address, including lack of transportation options.
[02:16:25.502 --> 02:16:28.903]  We're going to allow the public to learn more about the history of the proposed project.
[02:16:28.903 --> 02:16:34.305]  We're going to identify issues that should be studied, including regional air quality and natural resources.
[02:16:34.305 --> 02:16:40.687]  And we're going to give you the opportunity to tell us how the proposed project could address your transportation needs.
[02:16:41.943 --> 02:16:50.552]  I'm going to go in and I'm going to tell these people exactly what I need and they're going to custom design for me, Rosa, a light rail transportation system that's going to exactly match my needs, aren't they?
[02:16:50.552 --> 02:16:53.235]  It is so, yeah.
[02:16:53.235 --> 02:16:58.841]  And, you know, let's say you go in there, David, and you're just, you know, real contrarian and you go, you know what, I really dig my car.
[02:16:59.321 --> 02:17:01.702]  I'm driving my car.
[02:17:01.702 --> 02:17:04.263]  Yeah, and they're going to go, uh-huh, right, and next.
[02:17:04.263 --> 02:17:21.731]  You know, they don't want to hear anything that does not go right along with the idea that you're going to be living in a condo on top of a shop, Smart Growth, in the center of your transit-oriented development town, which got funding from the federal government to put on that meeting that you're being indoctrinated in.
[02:17:23.313 --> 02:17:27.718]  3.7 million dollars, David, in HUD funds went to Central Texas.
[02:17:27.718 --> 02:17:34.525]  Some of it went to Elgin, and that's the meeting you're talking about, in order to implement this plan.
[02:17:34.525 --> 02:17:36.727]  And this is all across the United States.
[02:17:36.727 --> 02:17:44.976]  Every year HUD gives out a hundred million bucks to little areas so that they'll use these indoctrination techniques on the people.
[02:17:45.636 --> 02:17:49.920]  And yes, you're not going to be given any other options.
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.602]  And if you don't like it, you know, this is what you have to do.
[02:17:52.602 --> 02:17:54.944]  You've got to take those meetings down.
[02:17:54.944 --> 02:18:02.911]  And we show you in that book, Behind the Green Mask, my book, there's 20 pages in the back of the book on what to do.
[02:18:02.911 --> 02:18:04.893]  And it's a narrow, small book.
[02:18:04.893 --> 02:18:09.737]  And part of that is real in-depth focus on how to take down a Delphi meeting.
[02:18:10.157 --> 02:18:11.638]  It's very exciting.
[02:18:11.638 --> 02:18:13.659]  It's a lot of fun to do it.
[02:18:13.659 --> 02:18:16.301]  And you can really send these guys packing.
[02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:18.062]  Just take them right out of your town.
[02:18:18.062 --> 02:18:21.084]  That's an excellent book, and we all need to get active.
[02:18:21.084 --> 02:18:24.907]  A large part of this, of course, as we said at the very beginning, is an education process.
[02:18:25.367 --> 02:18:27.009]  We see a lot of people understand that.
[02:18:27.009 --> 02:18:36.197]  That's why we've got bills being introduced and state legislatures, the three states that I mentioned, a good source to find out what's going on with that is of course Rosa Corey's website.
[02:18:36.197 --> 02:18:40.281]  She's got a blog, DemocratsAgainstUNagenda21.com.
[02:18:40.281 --> 02:18:41.362]  You can find that information there.
[02:18:41.362 --> 02:18:43.985]  Of course, some of those articles I was reading were from the Tenth Amendment Center.
[02:18:44.565 --> 02:18:49.509]  You mentioned, hey, I really dig my car and, you know, I really do dig driving.
[02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:56.834]  One of the things, though, that I think is on the horizon right now is taking over the cars.
[02:18:56.834 --> 02:19:00.276]  And I think there's even going to be competition with these light rail projects.
[02:19:00.276 --> 02:19:04.960]  Of course, they'll still fund the light rail projects because it's never been about transportation.
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.282]  It's always been about paying off corporate donors.
[02:19:07.282 --> 02:19:09.243]  But before they even get these light rail projects,
[02:19:09.483 --> 02:19:14.651]  I think they're going to have a control grid imposed upon our cars.
[02:19:14.651 --> 02:19:15.653]  Talk about that a little bit.
[02:19:16.471 --> 02:19:26.618]  Yeah, well, part of that, I mean, just, you know, the initial thing was OnStar, which, you know, a lot of your vehicles have that, where they can literally be shut off remotely from another location.
[02:19:26.618 --> 02:19:38.045]  In other words, let's say somebody, suppose the deal is that somebody rips you off, takes your car, and you report it stolen, and the car can be shut off remotely and disabled.
[02:19:38.045 --> 02:19:41.668]  But what these, you know, this is a real great
[02:19:42.468 --> 02:19:46.193]  Indicator that you should not be an early adopter of technology.
[02:19:46.193 --> 02:19:52.701]  Hang on, we're going to explore that a little bit more with Rosa Corey, author of Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:54.403]  We've got to go to a commercial break, Rosa.
[02:19:54.403 --> 02:19:55.184]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:55.184 --> 02:19:55.625]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.651 --> 02:20:05.736]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.

[02:24:10.279 --> 02:24:11.599]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:24:11.599 --> 02:24:18.221]  I'm your host, David Knight, and we have joining us on the phone, Rosa Corey, author of Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:24:18.221 --> 02:24:25.504]  We were talking in the last segment about how managed this whole process is when they come into your areas.
[02:24:25.504 --> 02:24:35.687]  They just came into the area where I live, saying, we'd like for you to come to a meeting to talk about how we can help you with your transportation needs and make this area more sustainable.
[02:24:35.687 --> 02:24:39.068]  I always use the green mask of sustainability.
[02:24:39.548 --> 02:24:47.113]  Rosa Corey worked as a real estate specialist and she recognized what was going on with this and here's where the magic is.
[02:24:47.113 --> 02:24:56.678]  She recognized that it wasn't something that was just going on in her area because I always like to say this is just something that's happening locally and we want your input at the meeting.
[02:24:56.678 --> 02:24:59.260]  No, this is something that has been pre-planned.
[02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:00.321]  They have a very
[02:25:01.181 --> 02:25:08.187]  Specific way they sell this to the public in these Rand Corporation controlled meetings, these Delphi meetings.
[02:25:08.187 --> 02:25:14.252]  She speaks about that in her book about how they try to manipulate you and how you can shut that process down.
[02:25:14.252 --> 02:25:16.554]  And we're going to take some of your calls in the next segment.
[02:25:16.554 --> 02:25:20.057]  We've got some people who want to talk to you about that, Rosa.
[02:25:20.057 --> 02:25:25.842]  And we're going to take calls in the next segment, Rosa, about Agenda 21, any issues that you're concerned with.
[02:25:25.842 --> 02:25:27.883]  We had just started talking about how
[02:25:28.584 --> 02:25:31.905]  They've been selling this as part of light rail.
[02:25:31.905 --> 02:25:39.086]  A key part of this, of course, is going to be transportation, because they want to keep you in concentrated areas.
[02:25:39.086 --> 02:25:41.126]  They don't want you spread out over the country.
[02:25:41.126 --> 02:25:42.987]  They want to control the food supply.
[02:25:42.987 --> 02:25:44.867]  They want to control travel.
[02:25:44.867 --> 02:25:48.088]  That's one of the ways they're going to do it, is by controlling transportation, of course.
[02:25:48.088 --> 02:25:53.729]  And so, they've been selling these light rail projects, but Rosa, before these things are even going to come online, they're going to
[02:25:53.729 --> 02:25:55.650]  We're going to have a control grid of cars.
[02:25:55.650 --> 02:26:07.077]  We already see articles going back a few months where people are starting to put this together and say, hey, these light rail projects are going to come up against competition with quote-unquote autonomous cars.
[02:26:07.077 --> 02:26:08.238]  They're not autonomous.
[02:26:08.238 --> 02:26:14.402]  They're all rigged into the government where they're going to control where, how, and when you can drive in the cities.
[02:26:14.402 --> 02:26:20.266]  And they're saying that putting in these light rail systems is kind of like designing a Pony Express in the world of the Telegraph.
[02:26:20.566 --> 02:26:26.313]  I think before they even get these light rail systems done, they're going to have this control grid over our highways in place, don't you?
[02:26:27.611 --> 02:26:32.554]  Well, if you look at the whole overall picture, it's about destroying your economy.
[02:26:32.554 --> 02:26:43.921]  And so Light Rail is a great way to do it, because it really costs a lot of money, it's not that functional, it's very seldom used, and it's really a hugely expensive project.
[02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:54.347]  When you know that Agenda 21 is about inventory and controlling everything on the planet, and about full globalization, which is really standardizing
[02:26:54.907 --> 02:26:58.130]  All of your systems and that's done through computers.
[02:26:58.130 --> 02:27:08.258]  Then you see how the computerization of your movement, of your travel, of your ability to be free is actually tying right in with the plan.
[02:27:08.258 --> 02:27:19.348]  Because, you know, I mean, of course, if you look at this in a nightmare scenario, you get into your, you know, your computer controlled vehicle, the doors lock and, you know, who knows where you're going to go after that.
[02:27:19.348 --> 02:27:20.969]  You may not go where you think you're going.
[02:27:21.069 --> 02:27:24.075]  Just like Minority Report, we've already seen that acted out in Hollywood.
[02:27:24.075 --> 02:27:26.942]  They've predicted that forth to show us exactly what that's going to look like.
[02:27:27.731 --> 02:27:28.231]  I know.
[02:27:28.231 --> 02:27:31.714]  In fact, you know, I really don't view popular culture that much.
[02:27:31.714 --> 02:27:33.055]  I think it's a big waste of time.
[02:27:33.055 --> 02:27:37.918]  But one thing that you do see is that these guys do write the scenarios for the plan.
[02:27:37.918 --> 02:27:40.200]  That's right.
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:44.483]  But one thing that you're going to see with, you know, this is a corporate plan.
[02:27:44.483 --> 02:27:46.585]  It's a mega corporation plan.
[02:27:46.585 --> 02:27:54.591]  So it's a neo-feudal, fascist, Machiavellian plan to actually restrict your ability to move freely throughout the world.
[02:27:55.111 --> 02:28:10.398]  It indoctrinates you through your educational system and your entertainment system, and it also is selling you and propagandizing you on the cool new technology of the future, so that you will want to be an early adopter.
[02:28:10.398 --> 02:28:23.925]  I mean, if I told you that the government was going to force you to hold in your hand a device that tells where you are at all times, and what you're thinking about, what you're doing, who you're hanging out with, there's no way you would do that.
[02:28:25.065 --> 02:28:28.146]  But instead, you actually pay for it.
[02:28:28.146 --> 02:28:30.047]  You've got your iPhone in your hand.
[02:28:30.047 --> 02:28:30.907]  I don't have one.
[02:28:30.907 --> 02:28:32.687]  It's very inconvenient, yes.
[02:28:32.687 --> 02:28:33.808]  But you know what?
[02:28:33.808 --> 02:28:35.968]  Refuse to collaborate with this plan.
[02:28:35.968 --> 02:28:39.309]  You do not have to be part of this plan.
[02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:43.191]  Rosa, you know, there were some slides that were leaked as part of the Snowden documents.
[02:28:44.711 --> 02:28:49.217]  Not quite a year ago in Germany and they showed exactly that thing.
[02:28:49.217 --> 02:28:59.370]  They showed some slides from the NSA and they had a picture of Steve Jobs and the 1984 commercial behind him was when they introduced the Macintosh and said who would have thought in 1984 and then in the next slide you see
[02:29:03.135 --> 02:29:04.976]  Steve Jobs holding an iPhone.
[02:29:04.976 --> 02:29:07.676]  And the caption is, that this would be Big Brother.
[02:29:07.676 --> 02:29:16.679]  And then you see the next slide, you got people queued up at the Apple Store and they say, and the people would wait in line to pay for it themselves.
[02:29:16.679 --> 02:29:18.900]  So they understand exactly what that is.
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:20.340]  And when we look at this control grid,
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:30.163]  These self-driving cars that they're selling to everybody, you need to understand that this is a combination of the NSA and the TSA, at the very least.
[02:29:30.163 --> 02:29:35.965]  The worst aspects of both of those, spying on you, controlling your movements, looking at everything that you're doing.
[02:29:35.965 --> 02:29:37.145]  Hang on, we've got to go to a commercial break.
[02:29:37.145 --> 02:29:48.709]  We're going to come back with Rosa Corey, behind the green mask, UN Agenda 21, and we're going to take some of your calls for her asking about what you can do to disrupt these meetings that are going to be coming to your place, regardless of where you live on the planet.
[02:29:48.709 --> 02:29:49.429]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:52.491]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.491 --> 02:29:59.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.317 --> 02:30:02.600]  Year after year, we watched the threats steadily increase.

[02:32:44.617 --> 02:32:49.762]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:33:21.537 --> 02:33:28.018]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.018 --> 02:33:29.799]  That's right, you are the resistance.
[02:33:29.799 --> 02:33:32.339]  We're talking to Rosa Corey behind the green mask, you in Agenda 21.
[02:33:32.339 --> 02:33:40.321]  We're going to talk with the callers about how you can be the resistance when they come to your area and say, we want your participation.
[02:33:41.781 --> 02:33:45.284]  We've got a plan that we would like to help you with your transportation needs.
[02:33:45.284 --> 02:33:47.587]  It's all part of a larger agenda.
[02:33:47.587 --> 02:33:52.572]  This is being replicated across the country, across the world, because it's part of a UN agenda.
[02:33:52.572 --> 02:33:52.993]  Agenda 21.
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:00.662]  Breaking the magic spell that they cast over people is essentially exposing the magic tricks.
[02:34:00.662 --> 02:34:02.762]  And she does that very well in her book.
[02:34:02.762 --> 02:34:08.664]  And we're going to talk to... We have some people who have questions for her about shutting down a meeting or commenting on it.
[02:34:08.664 --> 02:34:09.304]  Maybe they've done it.
[02:34:09.304 --> 02:34:09.924]  I don't know.
[02:34:09.924 --> 02:34:18.027]  Before we go back to your calls and before we go back to Rosa Corey, I want to let you know that this hour, the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by one of our new products, InfoWars Life
[02:34:18.727 --> 02:34:19.727]  Oil of oregano.
[02:34:19.727 --> 02:34:23.728]  This is a new nutraceutical form of highly active oregano oil.
[02:34:23.728 --> 02:34:25.869]  And if you've ever taken it, I've got this right here.
[02:34:25.869 --> 02:34:27.149]  It's in a pill form.
[02:34:27.149 --> 02:34:32.430]  Because if you take oregano oil, you'll notice that it's going to really burn your mouth.
[02:34:32.430 --> 02:34:32.970]  I've taken it.
[02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:37.791]  I've had good experience with oil of oregano during cold and flu season.
[02:34:37.791 --> 02:34:41.172]  But it is not something that is comfortable to take.
[02:34:41.172 --> 02:34:43.392]  But you can take it now in a pill form.
[02:34:43.392 --> 02:34:44.273]  We have this available.
[02:34:44.273 --> 02:34:45.413]  It's one of our newest products.
[02:34:46.773 --> 02:34:50.879]  They say, as they point out, this has been used as far back as Roman times.
[02:34:50.879 --> 02:34:55.645]  For thousands of years, oil of oregano was traditionally used to support digestive health.
[02:34:55.645 --> 02:34:58.429]  And now you can get it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:34:58.429 --> 02:35:01.132]  Available for this winter season.
[02:35:01.132 --> 02:35:02.113]  Or for any season, actually.
[02:35:03.181 --> 02:35:06.664]  That's new oil of oregano in pill form.
[02:35:06.664 --> 02:35:08.485]  Let's go to the calls, Rosa.
[02:35:08.485 --> 02:35:12.368]  I've got someone here who is talking about shutting down a meeting.
[02:35:12.368 --> 02:35:14.230]  Let's go to John in Washington.
[02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:21.556]  John, have you ever been to a meeting or you just have questions about how this would be done to shut it down?
[02:35:21.556 --> 02:35:23.337]  How's it going there, Dave?
[02:35:23.337 --> 02:35:25.259]  This is a fascinating subject for me.
[02:35:25.259 --> 02:35:30.423]  I was formerly a county commissioner in Spokane County here in Washington State.
[02:35:31.327 --> 02:35:43.714]  And in 1999, I was overseeing a cemetery renewal project in the Milan District, and I noticed these guys playing in the creek, and they had white suits on and such.
[02:35:43.714 --> 02:35:45.175]  I didn't pay much attention.
[02:35:45.175 --> 02:35:46.416]  The next day, they were back.
[02:35:46.416 --> 02:35:53.860]  The next day, they were in the creek, the same creek, but a little farther away at a bridge.
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:55.821]  I stopped and asked them what was going on.
[02:35:55.821 --> 02:35:56.882]  They were very evasive.
[02:35:58.071 --> 02:36:02.092]  And that got my curiosity peaked.
[02:36:02.092 --> 02:36:06.773]  Then, I was in the process at that time of looking for land.
[02:36:06.773 --> 02:36:10.274]  I was going to build a new home.
[02:36:10.274 --> 02:36:13.695]  And I ran into these people two or three times.
[02:36:13.695 --> 02:36:16.756]  Finally, once in the deep woods up north of Spokane County.
[02:36:16.756 --> 02:36:18.016]  And this time,
[02:36:21.875 --> 02:36:24.636]  They were clearly agitated at me asking questions.
[02:36:24.636 --> 02:36:29.658]  They had some fellow with them in a brown suit, and he had a gun.
[02:36:29.658 --> 02:36:36.401]  And when I walked up on them at Otter Creek in the middle of the woods, he pulled a gun on me and told me to get out of there.
[02:36:36.401 --> 02:36:39.222]  And I said, hey, I'm just, I'm friendly.
[02:36:39.222 --> 02:36:40.922]  I'm a county commissioner.
[02:36:40.922 --> 02:36:41.963]  I'm just curious.
[02:36:41.963 --> 02:36:43.283]  I keep running into you guys.
[02:36:43.283 --> 02:36:44.524]  What's going on?
[02:36:44.524 --> 02:36:47.945]  And he says, you get out of here or you're going to wish you had.
[02:36:48.505 --> 02:36:56.651]  Now, the trucks that they were in had no tags on them, they had no insignias on their uniforms, so I thought to dig into this a little bit deeper.
[02:36:56.651 --> 02:37:01.715]  Come to find out, they were from Golder and Associates in Toronto.
[02:37:01.715 --> 02:37:06.298]  They were doing an in-stream study, that's Growth Management Smart Growth Agenda 21.
[02:37:07.699 --> 02:37:20.147]  And then we started the envisioning process where they had these meetings, just like Rose is talking about, all over the area, and they were having them in the firehouses.
[02:37:20.147 --> 02:37:25.970]  Well, after I had dug into this, I found the silver bullet to shut these meetings down.
[02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:32.153]  There's a publication by the EPA, and here's the number of the publication.
[02:37:32.153 --> 02:37:35.695]  Now, bear in mind that this publication is printed with U.S.
[02:37:35.695 --> 02:37:36.456]  tax dollars.
[02:37:37.293 --> 02:37:48.803]  This is EPA-231-R-04-002.
[02:37:48.803 --> 02:38:02.354]  Well, this book literally lays out the entire process and the program of how to conduct these envisioning meetings, how to create the appearance of consensus,
[02:38:03.067 --> 02:38:06.269]  How to sway public opinion.
[02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:10.491]  They create all these stupid little games that you play in these meetings.
[02:38:10.491 --> 02:38:23.698]  And then I also used the diaprax anti-method which is to not play into their invented vocabulary and so forth.
[02:38:23.698 --> 02:38:26.239]  It got so bad I showed up at every one of these meetings
[02:38:27.057 --> 02:38:36.820]  I pulled this book out, it's a very nice thick book, and it tells in detail exactly how to conduct these meetings and trick the people.
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:39.701]  Exposing their playbook and pulling back the curtain.
[02:38:39.701 --> 02:38:47.903]  These people, mostly older people, mostly elderly, the average age was about 70 in these rooms, and in one meeting
[02:38:48.681 --> 02:38:52.923]  I had one man, looked like an intelligent guy, actually started crying.
[02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:59.485]  And he goes, but we've got so much time invested in this, hundreds of hours.
[02:38:59.485 --> 02:39:02.026]  And I said, you have been tricked.
[02:39:02.026 --> 02:39:02.867]  Yeah, that's very important.
[02:39:02.867 --> 02:39:04.547]  Let me get Rosa's comments on that.
[02:39:04.547 --> 02:39:06.148]  Rosa, your comments on what he just told us.
[02:39:07.116 --> 02:39:24.749]  Yeah, the EPA is definitely, if you go to Smart Growth America, EPA is a partner in non-profits, with non-profits, your government is partnering with non-profits and corporations to manage these meetings all across the United States.
[02:39:24.749 --> 02:39:28.972]  And these plans are directed, they do have playbooks
[02:39:29.372 --> 02:39:35.457]  Where they actually design the meetings with consultants and their plans are all designed the same way.
[02:39:35.457 --> 02:39:39.280]  The consultants are all managing everyone the same way.
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.164]  These meetings are across the nation and there are ways you can take them down.
[02:39:44.164 --> 02:39:48.487]  Yes, it is possible to stop these meetings.
[02:39:48.487 --> 02:39:52.951]  What the plans are all about is about destroying your private property rights.
[02:39:53.271 --> 02:39:55.652]  They're an obstacle to the plans.
[02:39:55.652 --> 02:40:10.637]  So, of course, you're going to have multinationals on your land talking about how they're going to develop it, use it, utilize your mineral rights, your land rights, your water rights, and take them away from individual property owners.
[02:40:10.637 --> 02:40:17.599]  That's what the goal is, is to get you off the land, into the cities, away from the property that you can use.
[02:40:17.599 --> 02:40:18.999]  Absolutely.
[02:40:18.999 --> 02:40:20.240]  Yes, you know, you can
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:23.241]  Ickley produces these playbooks.
[02:40:23.241 --> 02:40:25.742]  The EPA produces them.
[02:40:25.742 --> 02:40:27.143]  Consultants have them.
[02:40:27.143 --> 02:40:30.444]  And the point is how to take down these meetings.
[02:40:30.444 --> 02:40:31.365]  How to block them.
[02:40:31.365 --> 02:40:32.625]  How to stop them.
[02:40:32.625 --> 02:40:33.826]  And that is powerful.
[02:40:33.826 --> 02:40:34.866]  You can do it.
[02:40:34.866 --> 02:40:35.266]  Absolutely.
[02:40:35.266 --> 02:40:37.387]  It's all about informing people.
[02:40:37.387 --> 02:40:38.688]  It's an information war.
[02:40:38.688 --> 02:40:44.810]  Once people see the trick, once you pull back the curtain, it really takes the power out of what they're doing.
[02:40:44.810 --> 02:40:45.631]  Thank you, John.
[02:40:45.631 --> 02:40:47.792]  Let's go to Dominic in California.
[02:40:47.792 --> 02:40:48.392]  Dominic, go ahead.
[02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:51.652]  Hey David, hi Rosa.
[02:40:51.652 --> 02:40:52.873]  Hi, how you doing?
[02:40:52.873 --> 02:40:56.315]  Go ahead, what's your comment on Agenda 21?
[02:40:56.315 --> 02:41:14.385]  Yeah, I started a show called Kim Chasers and we follow around the Kim Trail Jets and show how they turn into clouds and cover whole cities and we just did an episode out in Tahoe where we showed there was no snow, the lake had went down about four feet
[02:41:15.507 --> 02:41:19.831]  And there was chemtrail flights going over every mountain that should have snow.
[02:41:19.831 --> 02:41:28.959]  So, I want to say this drought is going to be bad, and I want to ask Rosa, is this the first, the start of rewilding America?
[02:41:28.959 --> 02:41:31.861]  And are these chemtrail flights, Agenda 21 related?
[02:41:34.031 --> 02:41:42.594]  Well, there's a lot, you know, there's certainly a lot of speculation on what this is about, what's up there, how are, you know, whether this is part of the HART program, what's happening.
[02:41:42.594 --> 02:41:54.598]  What you need to know, though, is that whether, you know, whether there's a so-called emergency of drought or whatever, the design is to create a culture of emergency.
[02:41:55.604 --> 02:42:01.448]  And to keep you in a position where you are not able to think clearly and rationally.
[02:42:01.448 --> 02:42:04.410]  And this is, of course, enforced in your educational system.
[02:42:04.410 --> 02:42:10.494]  That's about, you know, just responding to things emotionally, rather than thinking about objective reality.
[02:42:11.014 --> 02:42:20.779]  So, what you need to do is to recognize what your participation in the plan is, and how it is that you can withdraw your support from the plan.
[02:42:20.779 --> 02:42:30.763]  So, it's very important to educate yourself, to become more informed, to find out what is happening exactly in your town locally.
[02:42:30.763 --> 02:42:38.947]  Because, you know, I'm sure you feel right now that you have no impact on the Congress, you have no impact on the Senate, no impact on the President.
[02:42:39.207 --> 02:42:44.930]  But you do have some, still some, control on your local government.
[02:42:44.930 --> 02:42:52.034]  And so, you know, regardless of what's happening around you, you can have some impact locally.
[02:42:52.034 --> 02:42:55.275]  And this is what you want to do, is focus in locally.
[02:42:55.275 --> 02:42:58.477]  Go and observe your elected officials.
[02:42:58.477 --> 02:43:00.338]  Let them know you're observing them.
[02:43:00.838 --> 02:43:03.939]  Find out what the plans are for your town.
[02:43:03.939 --> 02:43:08.621]  Because this plan is a huge, very pervasive plan.
[02:43:08.621 --> 02:43:09.801]  And it's very powerful.
[02:43:09.801 --> 02:43:16.223]  It involves your educational system, healthcare, the law enforcement system, your food production.
[02:43:16.223 --> 02:43:19.064]  Every aspect of your lives is covered by this plan.
[02:43:19.064 --> 02:43:25.307]  So you want to take action by becoming aware and make others aware as well.
[02:43:25.307 --> 02:43:29.128]  The plan is dependent on you being passive and ignorant.
[02:43:29.648 --> 02:43:34.152]  So anything you want to inform yourself on is a very powerful thing.
[02:43:34.152 --> 02:43:38.415]  I encourage you to take action and really be the resistance.
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:48.543]  Actually, you know, too, if you inform yourself and you come in there understanding what this is about, with the power to expose this plan, you're in a very powerful situation as an activist.
[02:43:48.543 --> 02:43:51.684]  It's one of the few places where I think you really can have a big impact.
[02:43:51.684 --> 02:43:53.444]  Another one is on juries.
[02:43:53.444 --> 02:43:55.985]  One person on a jury can shut this whole thing down.
[02:43:55.985 --> 02:43:59.626]  We can go to one of these meetings and you can expose their plans.
[02:43:59.626 --> 02:44:03.647]  And you can show exactly how this is a trick and expose that trick.
[02:44:03.647 --> 02:44:05.748]  Let's go to George in Connecticut.
[02:44:05.748 --> 02:44:06.188]  Go ahead, George.
[02:44:08.231 --> 02:44:14.954]  Hi Rosa, I'm just curious, how do you sift out, they try to put this under several different names.
[02:44:14.954 --> 02:44:21.918]  I can find out, like, Agenda 21 is directed at my particular town, Stanford, Connecticut.
[02:44:21.918 --> 02:44:26.180]  I know that a lot of things are going on, because when I try to push certain things,
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:33.225]  Uh, police, uh, came to my door and said, get the hell out of the way, otherwise we're gonna kill you and your family.
[02:44:33.225 --> 02:44:37.669]  So you start to wonder, you know, how far are these, these, these thugs gonna push this stuff?
[02:44:37.669 --> 02:44:46.356]  But you can't find out any details outside that they, that were under Agenda 21, you know, and they don't want to, uh, supply, uh, proper information.
[02:44:47.904 --> 02:44:53.131]  There actually is a tremendous amount of information available to you in just one second.
[02:44:53.131 --> 02:44:55.755]  All you need to know is how to look for it.
[02:44:55.755 --> 02:44:58.919]  So, if you're in Connecticut, whatever, here's what you do.
[02:44:58.919 --> 02:45:00.921]  You put in your town name.
[02:45:00.921 --> 02:45:02.383]  You go to your search engine.
[02:45:03.204 --> 02:45:12.571]  Uh, you put in your town name and you put in sustainable development or envision or visioning or, uh, you know, uh, property.
[02:45:12.571 --> 02:45:14.813]  Uh, what am I want to say?
[02:45:14.813 --> 02:45:17.575]  A high speed rail, uh, rail projects.
[02:45:19.416 --> 02:45:20.997]  Form-based zoning.
[02:45:20.997 --> 02:45:21.578]  Many things.
[02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:26.041]  We've got the code words there on our websites and you can go to that.
[02:45:26.041 --> 02:45:29.704]  Put that in with your town name and you're gonna, it'll just come out.
[02:45:29.704 --> 02:45:31.145]  You will see it all.
[02:45:31.145 --> 02:45:34.167]  And then you need to go there and participate.
[02:45:34.167 --> 02:45:35.108]  Observe.
[02:45:35.108 --> 02:45:39.111]  You've got, we have flyers on our websites that you can hand out.
[02:45:39.111 --> 02:45:40.392]  Get up early in the morning.
[02:45:40.392 --> 02:45:42.273]  Put those on doorsteps.
[02:45:42.273 --> 02:45:46.276]  When was the last time you read something when you opened your door that blew your mind?
[02:45:46.676 --> 02:45:48.357]  You want to make people aware.
[02:45:48.357 --> 02:45:52.801]  This is a stealth plan in plain sight.
[02:45:52.801 --> 02:45:53.842]  So it's out there.
[02:45:53.842 --> 02:45:55.904]  It's available for you to see.
[02:45:55.904 --> 02:45:58.726]  You just have to know how to look for it.
[02:45:58.726 --> 02:46:01.568]  So that's what my book is about.
[02:46:01.568 --> 02:46:03.890]  That's what our websites are about.
[02:46:03.890 --> 02:46:06.412]  There's a lot of information out there for you.
[02:46:06.412 --> 02:46:10.976]  And you will find, I don't care how small your town is in Connecticut, you're going to find it there.
[02:46:11.716 --> 02:46:19.284]  It's under your educational system, your healthcare, your governmental agencies, your climate action plan.
[02:46:19.284 --> 02:46:20.164]  Look at that.
[02:46:20.164 --> 02:46:22.046]  Look at your form-based zones.
[02:46:22.046 --> 02:46:24.929]  Look at your new zones, transit-oriented development.
[02:46:24.929 --> 02:46:27.011]  You're going to see it in your town.
[02:46:27.011 --> 02:46:27.392]  Fight it!
[02:46:28.089 --> 02:46:32.572]  And of course, her website is democratsagainstunagenda21.com.
[02:46:32.572 --> 02:46:35.334]  That's where you'll find the information that she was just talking about.
[02:46:35.334 --> 02:46:38.155]  We showed that for people who are watching the stream.
[02:46:38.155 --> 02:46:42.218]  And we sell the book, Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, at infowars.com.
[02:46:42.218 --> 02:46:51.664]  It's a great way to get the big picture, to understand how this is all being played out, to understand what goes on at these Delphi-type meetings that are put together by the Rand Corporation.
[02:46:51.664 --> 02:46:54.986]  Let's go to HB in FEMA, area number 4.
[02:46:54.986 --> 02:46:56.147]  You had a question about Agenda 21.
[02:46:56.147 --> 02:46:56.507]  Go ahead.
[02:46:57.503 --> 02:46:58.264]  A great show, David.
[02:46:58.264 --> 02:46:59.024]  Hey, Rosa.
[02:46:59.024 --> 02:47:07.330]  Yeah, back in about 2010, my wife and I just caught wind of one of these sustainable development meetings being held here in Knoxville.
[02:47:07.330 --> 02:47:11.894]  And I kind of bagged work and went down there, sat in, and it was just what you're talking about.
[02:47:11.894 --> 02:47:16.557]  It was Blunt County, which is Lamar-Alexander's County, which is next to Knox County.
[02:47:16.557 --> 02:47:18.779]  So they held it up in Knoxville so they could get more people there, I guess.
[02:47:19.528 --> 02:47:29.933]  But, all through this, I'm sitting there and there's a guy from the Fed that's in there, looks like some character out of a bad Dick Tracy comic strip, sitting there, and he's the Fed guy there.
[02:47:29.933 --> 02:47:40.079]  At the end of it, I'd written Agenda 21 on my notebook that I took in there, and after the last guy said, you know, thank you for coming, I stood up near the exit and yelled, this is Agenda 21.
[02:47:40.079 --> 02:47:44.501]  I didn't yell it, but, this is Agenda 21, you need to look this up, they're lying to you.
[02:47:45.976 --> 02:47:46.637]  Beautiful.
[02:47:46.637 --> 02:47:47.918]  Good for you, man.
[02:47:47.918 --> 02:47:49.859]  That's what you need to do.
[02:47:49.859 --> 02:47:52.121]  Yes, that's exactly what you need to do.
[02:47:52.121 --> 02:47:55.464]  And, you know, this is the elimination of the nation-state.
[02:47:55.464 --> 02:47:56.605]  This is the goal.
[02:47:56.605 --> 02:47:59.708]  It's the erection of a totalitarian corporatocracy.
[02:47:59.708 --> 02:48:01.950]  And that seems like something that's so out there.
[02:48:02.310 --> 02:48:04.272]  But really, it's right there in Knoxville.
[02:48:04.272 --> 02:48:05.693]  It's right there in your town.
[02:48:05.693 --> 02:48:09.177]  This is how it's done, through regionalization.
[02:48:09.177 --> 02:48:14.222]  And the plan is developed in order to make this possible.
[02:48:14.222 --> 02:48:20.188]  That is a powerful thing to do, to have the guts to stand up there and say, hey, this is Agenda 21.
[02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:22.490]  Look it up, people.
[02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:23.610]  Check it out.
[02:48:23.610 --> 02:48:24.771]  This is how it's done.
[02:48:24.771 --> 02:48:26.132]  This is what it looks like.
[02:48:26.132 --> 02:48:29.573]  Because you're never going to see it called Agenda 21.
[02:48:29.573 --> 02:48:37.718]  You're going to see it called Climate Action Plan, or Vision 2020, or Envision Knoxville, or whatever it is they're going to call it.
[02:48:37.718 --> 02:48:39.479]  And that's what you need to do.
[02:48:39.479 --> 02:48:40.659]  It's call it out.
[02:48:40.659 --> 02:48:43.841]  Give out flyers as you're standing at the door, as people are leaving.
[02:48:44.541 --> 02:48:44.921]  Absolutely.
[02:49:06.596 --> 02:49:07.537]  Or is it?
[02:49:25.848 --> 02:49:27.810]  Lays this out for you, the steps to proceed.
[02:49:27.810 --> 02:49:30.873]  Understand that they win when they keep everything secret.
[02:49:30.873 --> 02:49:36.018]  That's why they're negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade Partnerships.
[02:49:36.018 --> 02:49:40.703]  They're negotiating those completely in secret because they don't want you to see any of this.
[02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:44.727]  That's the way the Republicans and the Democrats all pass their bills anymore.
[02:49:44.787 --> 02:49:46.869]  They don't even let the congressman see what's there.
[02:49:46.869 --> 02:49:49.571]  They say, we're going to have to pass it before we can find out what's in it.
[02:49:49.571 --> 02:49:59.739]  And we're going to put this 1,000-page bill, this 2,000-page bill, we're going to give you less than 24 hours to look at it, but we want you to sign it because if you don't, your career on Capitol Hill is over.
[02:49:59.739 --> 02:50:01.460]  It works with intimidation.
[02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:02.881]  It works with secrecy.
[02:50:02.881 --> 02:50:07.004]  So you can expose the secrecy, pull back the mystique of all of this.
[02:50:07.004 --> 02:50:10.307]  If you understand what's there, she has a great way to expose it.
[02:50:10.307 --> 02:50:12.188]  Let's go to Daniel in Florida.
[02:50:12.188 --> 02:50:12.729]  Daniel, go ahead.
[02:50:14.213 --> 02:50:15.654]  Hi, Rosa.
[02:50:15.654 --> 02:50:16.955]  I couldn't help but comment.
[02:50:16.955 --> 02:50:24.662]  I'm in Southeast Florida and they're building something called All Aboard Florida where they're going to run a... You've heard of that then, right?
[02:50:24.662 --> 02:50:26.323]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:50:26.323 --> 02:50:36.892]  They're taking $2 billion plus of federal money to beef up a rail system along the East Coast that will not even be high speed.
[02:50:36.892 --> 02:50:43.097]  Nobody along the East Coast wants this, but they're going to be doing... And I went to one of these meetings
[02:50:43.795 --> 02:50:44.596]  It's a joke.
[02:50:44.596 --> 02:50:46.397]  You can't believe it.
[02:50:46.397 --> 02:50:49.480]  You've got people in suits standing around that are apparently... Absolutely.
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:53.684]  We've got to go to commercial break, but they're not even going to have that finished before it's obsolete.
[02:50:53.684 --> 02:50:56.106]  We're going to talk about that with Rosa Corey right after the break.
[02:50:56.106 --> 02:50:56.547]  Stay with us.
[02:50:56.547 --> 02:50:57.487]  More calls about Agenda 21.

[02:54:00.743 --> 02:54:06.550]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:08.853]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:10.862 --> 02:54:12.143]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:12.143 --> 02:54:12.764]  I'm David Ida.
[02:54:12.764 --> 02:54:18.368]  We're talking to Rosa Kory, author of Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:54:18.368 --> 02:54:23.931]  Rosa, it seems to me like this is very much something that they sell to Democrats.
[02:54:23.931 --> 02:54:29.195]  That's why I think it's important your website is DemocratsAgainstUNAgenda21.com.
[02:54:29.195 --> 02:54:31.256]  Democrats want to hear about sustainability.
[02:54:31.256 --> 02:54:33.278]  That's why you talk about it being behind the green mask.
[02:54:33.658 --> 02:54:40.087]  Yet this is a secret plan for corporate control about bankrupting you, about controlling you.
[02:54:40.087 --> 02:54:50.081]  I think in the same way that so many Republicans are hoodwinked by the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the Transatlantic Partnership because in that secret agreement,
[02:54:50.561 --> 02:54:55.767]  They see that as something that's going to be about free trade or the economy or jobs or whatever.
[02:54:55.767 --> 02:55:05.697]  We need to break the spell of these secret agendas, whether it's the trade agenda or whether it's the Agenda 21 that is hiding behind environmentalism.
[02:55:05.697 --> 02:55:07.739]  We need to break it for both the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:55:07.739 --> 02:55:13.005]  They both need to understand that these are secret techniques to bankrupt and control you.
[02:55:13.871 --> 02:55:14.531]  Yeah.
[02:55:14.531 --> 02:55:22.354]  Well, one thing I do want to say, no, I don't see a difference between the Democrats and the Republicans, particularly their globalists.
[02:55:22.354 --> 02:55:29.037]  The reason we call our site Democrats Against You on Agenda 21 is because we are, were Democrats.
[02:55:29.037 --> 02:55:31.678]  We don't affiliate with parties now at this point.
[02:55:31.678 --> 02:55:33.819]  We are liberals.
[02:55:33.819 --> 02:55:40.482]  And we felt that this was an issue that was really, had just been brought to the awareness of people who are more conservative.
[02:55:41.002 --> 02:55:41.923]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.923 --> 02:55:47.548]  But the thing is, is that, you know, the whole party thing is about, is designed to just keep you in each other's throats.
[02:55:47.548 --> 02:55:51.692]  It's about, you know, whether you're the red and blue team, it's a bunch of baloney.
[02:55:51.692 --> 02:55:52.393]  Yeah.
[02:55:52.393 --> 02:55:59.700]  But of course they can identify certain, you know, people who identify with one team versus another, they'll see that they identify with one aspect of one issue.
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:00.581]  So they'll play that up.
[02:56:01.121 --> 02:56:12.499]  Meanwhile, it's a secret agenda and once you break that mystique and you understand these people have got a secret agenda that they're trying to force on us without informing us, trying to trick us, that kind of breaks the spell, doesn't it?
[02:56:13.396 --> 02:56:15.037]  Yeah, it does.
[02:56:15.037 --> 02:56:24.744]  We're looking at an oligarchy that's ultimately about, you know, completely Machiavellian nation-states being destroyed and having city-states in their place.
[02:56:24.744 --> 02:56:28.126]  This is about destroying the old order, okay, in any way.
[02:56:28.126 --> 02:56:33.630]  And I just want to refer to your last caller was talking about high-speed rail in Florida.
[02:56:33.630 --> 02:56:36.071]  High-speed rail is designed to fail.
[02:56:36.071 --> 02:56:38.973]  It's designed purposely to sink your economy.
[02:56:38.973 --> 02:56:39.674]  That is the purpose.
[02:56:41.115 --> 02:56:43.918]  Yes, I know about that supposed project.
[02:56:43.918 --> 02:56:46.220]  Look at Florida, not all aboard.
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:49.203]  That's a good website for that.
[02:56:49.203 --> 02:56:53.127]  What we are talking about here is something that is all over the world.
[02:56:53.127 --> 02:56:57.372]  Australia, England, Europe, the EU.
[02:56:57.372 --> 02:57:00.295]  This is the incremental destruction of the nation state.
[02:57:01.256 --> 02:57:03.077]  We're not talking about nationalism here.
[02:57:03.077 --> 02:57:08.643]  What we're talking about is your ability to control what happens in your life.
[02:57:08.643 --> 02:57:14.288]  And if you are talking about a region or a huge block of nations, you have literally no say.
[02:57:17.050 --> 02:57:33.745]  What you can do, what you can do is you can anti-delphi those meetings, you can send out flyers, you can speak to people, withdraw your financial support from the Sierra Club, from environmental groups, from front groups that are front groups for sustainable development.
[02:57:33.745 --> 02:57:37.889]  Do not round your grocery bill amount up if you're shopping at Whole Foods and they go,
[02:57:38.029 --> 02:57:40.030]  You want to give some money to this non-profit?
[02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:41.410]  No, you don't!
[02:57:41.410 --> 02:57:45.492]  Not unless you have fully vetted that non-profit completely.
[02:57:45.492 --> 02:57:50.894]  And I'm talking about really checking out who is in it, who supports it, who is pushing it.
[02:57:50.894 --> 02:57:54.676]  These people are running your town, they're running your world.
[02:57:54.676 --> 02:57:56.517]  Don't join the Bike Coalition.
[02:57:56.517 --> 02:58:03.219]  That group is a shock troop to create sustainable development, transit-oriented development downtown in your town.
[02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:08.044]  You can do a lot by not taking part.
[02:58:08.044 --> 02:58:09.686]  By not collaborating.
[02:58:09.686 --> 02:58:11.429]  But you do want to take action.
[02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:12.610]  And you can.
[02:58:12.610 --> 02:58:13.211]  Do it.
[02:58:13.211 --> 02:58:14.653]  Don't just sit there.
[02:58:14.653 --> 02:58:16.355]  Get up and do more.
[02:58:16.355 --> 02:58:17.616]  Do something.
[02:58:17.616 --> 02:58:20.600]  You can be very effective working at the local level.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:21.461]  And again, that book.
[02:58:21.461 --> 02:58:22.662]  Thank you so much for joining us, Rosa.
[02:58:23.323 --> 02:58:25.625]  That book is Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21.
[02:58:25.625 --> 02:58:27.426]  It's available in a variety of places.
[02:58:27.426 --> 02:58:32.889]  One of those is Infowars.com, and of course, her website is DemocratsAgainstUNAgenda21.com.
[02:58:32.889 --> 02:58:33.530]  Stay with us.
[02:58:33.530 --> 02:58:34.530]  We're going to go into overdrive.
[02:58:34.530 --> 02:58:37.372]  We're going to take some of your calls about Agenda 21 and other issues.
[02:58:37.372 --> 02:58:37.813]  Stay with us.
[02:58:37.813 --> 02:58:41.855]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:41.855 --> 02:58:45.878]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:49.457 --> 02:58:53.119]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:58:53.119 --> 02:58:57.402]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:58:57.402 --> 02:58:59.183]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:58:59.183 --> 02:59:07.028]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:07.028 --> 02:59:08.169]  But for how long?
[02:59:08.169 --> 02:59:14.813]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:59:14.813 --> 02:59:17.635]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:59:19.008 --> 02:59:22.510]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:22.510 --> 02:59:30.755]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:30.755 --> 02:59:36.178]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:36.178 --> 02:59:38.700]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:38.700 --> 02:59:40.801]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:51.217 --> 02:59:53.801]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.537 --> 03:00:13.080]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:15.464]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:15.464 --> 03:00:20.652]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:20.652 --> 03:00:24.319]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.039 --> 03:00:28.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:30.762]  We're in overdrive, as you just heard.
[03:00:30.762 --> 03:00:36.867]  We want to take some of the calls, some of the people who have been waiting for a while to comment on Agenda 21, but also Jeff in Illinois.
[03:00:36.867 --> 03:00:39.029]  You've been waiting for quite a while to make your comments.
[03:00:39.029 --> 03:00:39.390]  Go ahead.
[03:00:39.390 --> 03:00:43.453]  We're going to go through Jeff, and then we're going to go to Kevin, Doug, Brandy, try to get all of you in in this short segment.
[03:00:43.453 --> 03:00:44.794]  Go ahead, Jeff in Illinois.
[03:00:44.794 --> 03:00:46.396]  Thanks, Ms.
[03:00:46.396 --> 03:00:47.176]  Corey, David.
[03:00:47.176 --> 03:00:48.237]  We love your work.
[03:00:48.237 --> 03:00:54.823]  Agenda 21, would you agree that it's Achilles' heel would be if people could make their own electricity?
[03:00:55.544 --> 03:01:01.349]  Easily, quickly, they could make their own electricity for cars, hydrogen, greenhouses, everything.
[03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:04.972]  Well, certainly, getting off of the grid is a very empowering thing.
[03:01:04.972 --> 03:01:06.493]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:01:06.493 --> 03:01:13.099]  Yeah, Gerard Morin, M-O-R-I-N, YouTubers, and the quantum electric generator are breaking the code.
[03:01:13.934 --> 03:01:18.317]  Anybody can go out there and start a business making their own electricity, make their own greenhouses.
[03:01:18.317 --> 03:01:22.099]  If you have your own food, you have your own way to make water out of the air.
[03:01:22.099 --> 03:01:23.580]  You have your own way to desalinate.
[03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:26.101]  You have your own way to do transportation.
[03:01:26.101 --> 03:01:27.582]  This is their Achilles heel.
[03:01:27.582 --> 03:01:33.345]  You could even make synthetic diamonds out of methane and electricity and create your own currency locally.
[03:01:33.345 --> 03:01:42.871]  We could get rid of all governments if people would just wake up to the fact that you can turn your drain pump from your washing machine into an electrical generator.
[03:01:43.453 --> 03:01:43.994]  Absolutely.
[03:01:43.994 --> 03:01:45.475]  It's that dependency, isn't it?
[03:01:45.475 --> 03:01:51.399]  And they want to make us ever more dependent on them, whether it's artificial intelligence, as I mentioned earlier in the program.
[03:01:51.399 --> 03:01:58.725]  They see that the brains of these taxi drivers studying this complex map actually get much larger as they're doing it.
[03:01:58.725 --> 03:02:00.026]  But the opposite happens as well.
[03:02:00.026 --> 03:02:02.388]  If we don't use our minds, they atrophy and die.
[03:02:02.388 --> 03:02:05.231]  If we don't use our freedoms, they atrophy and die as well.
[03:02:05.951 --> 03:02:07.352]  It's a good point that you're making.
[03:02:07.352 --> 03:02:11.154]  Learn how to do things self-sufficiently at a local level.
[03:02:11.154 --> 03:02:17.398]  That's a very empowering thing for you personally, but it's one important way to shut down this control grid that they've got.
[03:02:17.398 --> 03:02:18.519]  Thank you for holding, Jeff.
[03:02:18.519 --> 03:02:20.420]  Let's go quickly to Kevin in Michigan.
[03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:24.222]  Kevin, go ahead.
[03:02:24.222 --> 03:02:25.603]  Hey, how are you doing?
[03:02:25.603 --> 03:02:26.364]  Go ahead.
[03:02:26.364 --> 03:02:28.125]  Yeah, I'm doing great.
[03:02:28.125 --> 03:02:29.966]  Hey, Rosa, I had a question for you.
[03:02:29.966 --> 03:02:33.048]  Recently, we've had a long-standing farmer's market
[03:02:33.786 --> 03:02:42.811]  Over 10 years that all of a sudden bureaucratic councils taken over and making people apply to be able to
[03:02:45.851 --> 03:02:56.581]  Yeah, everywhere you look, and Rose is no longer with us, but everywhere you look, government is shutting down just the simplest types of entrepreneurship, the simplest types of trying to be independent.
[03:02:56.581 --> 03:03:08.573]  There was a story in this snowstorm in New Jersey where they had a couple of teenagers who, instead of sitting around watching Xbox while the snowstorm hit, they handed out flyers and said, we'll shovel your driveway for X amount of money.
[03:03:08.573 --> 03:03:09.934]  Somebody called the cops on them.
[03:03:10.174 --> 03:03:14.416]  And the cops came in and said, you need a 400 plus dollar license in order to do that.
[03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:16.857]  And by the way, that's only good for 180 days.
[03:03:16.857 --> 03:03:21.240]  I mean, they don't want anybody to have any kind of self-independence.
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:23.681]  That's why you need to get active at the local level.
[03:03:23.681 --> 03:03:26.462]  The best way that you can fight this is at the local level.
[03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:33.646]  And farmers markets are a great way because the whole system is really set up to screw the farmer as well as the consumer.
[03:03:33.646 --> 03:03:37.608]  And if you can eliminate that massive infrastructure, go direct
[03:03:37.848 --> 03:03:38.209]  Thank you.
[03:03:49.813 --> 03:03:51.935]  Hey David, thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:51.935 --> 03:03:54.578]  First the bad news, then the good news, and I'll make it quick.
[03:03:54.578 --> 03:04:04.048]  I'm a producer for cable access television out here in Oregon, and I've been in these meetings for about three or four years, public meetings, and I gotta tell ya, there is nothing being changed in Oregon.
[03:04:04.048 --> 03:04:07.472]  Zero change, same people elected, same agenda goes forward all the time.
[03:04:07.472 --> 03:04:12.357]  Now we have vote by mail in Oregon, as you probably know, and I think it's an absolute fraud.
[03:04:12.737 --> 03:04:12.897]  Yes.
[03:04:30.135 --> 03:04:31.656]  The election system is very rigged.
[03:04:31.656 --> 03:04:37.778]  There's a number of ways that they can do it, from the kind of voters they have, to the custody being violated of the votes, the way that it's reported.
[03:04:37.778 --> 03:04:40.580]  We saw that in the caucuses for Ron Paul.
[03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:45.842]  We saw the massive corruption, even within the Republican Party, let alone the general election.
[03:04:45.842 --> 03:04:48.003]  So there's a lot that needs to be done about that.
[03:04:48.003 --> 03:04:54.005]  The key thing, again, is creating an awareness of the problem before you can solve it with enough people.
[03:04:54.005 --> 03:04:55.386]  That's it for today's show.
[03:04:55.386 --> 03:04:58.607]  Join us tonight at 7 central for the N4's nightly news.
