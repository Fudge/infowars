[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.040]  jones welcome to the alex jones show on this thursday january 29th 2015 i'm
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.640]  david night i'll be your host today we're going to be talking about a wide
[00:30.640 --> 00:34.720]  variety of issues we've got paul joseph Watson joining us from the uk in the
[00:34.720 --> 00:38.960]  third in the bottom of this hour in the third hour we have rosa quarry who has
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.440]  published the book behind the green mask you in agenda 21
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.360]  she's an expert on agenda 21 she's somebody who's coming to it
[00:47.360 --> 00:51.040]  from the left and she has a very important perspective i think these two
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.040]  things are really coming together in one area in particular that we're seeing
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.120]  this happen and that is in transportation we're going to talk to paul joseph
[00:59.120 --> 01:03.440]  Watson about his article talking about how the
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.720]  uk is going to start developing the government controlled network using
[01:08.720 --> 01:12.480]  what they call m2m machine to machine here it's going to be called
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.160]  v2v vehicle to vehicle that's been mandated by obama
[01:16.160 --> 01:19.840]  to take place in just a couple of years and of course every bit
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.840]  of your movement is going to be tracked and controlled by the government
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.760]  they want to call this self-driving cars let me tell you
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.800]  they're computer driven cars and they're controlled
[01:30.800 --> 01:34.720]  by the government that's the point of it and it's also a part of
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.640]  agenda 21 because of course agenda 21 is about limiting
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.800]  where we can live limiting where and when we can travel
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.280]  they need to take control of transportation that's a very important
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.520]  aspect of government control it's not just knowing everything about you
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.840]  tracking you wherever you go it's also about controlling where you go
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.680]  controlling where you live controlling how you live it's an absolute
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.840]  total control grid that they want to put in place and transportation
[02:03.840 --> 02:06.320]  is a very important part of that so we're going to be talking to
[02:06.320 --> 02:10.560]  rosa quarry about that i just got this flyer this last week
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.800]  about one of the agenda 21 meetings that were being held to push
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.040]  the texas corridor that they're trying to create the course they want to
[02:19.040 --> 02:22.320]  merge the large cities austin san Antonio and eventually
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.760]  dallas and houston will be brought into a triangle if you look at their long-term
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.320]  plans and pretty much everything else will be off limits the government wants
[02:30.320 --> 02:34.320]  to take back control of all that so there's a real fight going on
[02:34.320 --> 02:37.680]  in the country right now utah and western states are saying
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.440]  we want to have the land back that the government owns
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.400]  has kept control of they've kept in many cases well over 90 percent of the
[02:46.400 --> 02:49.280]  land in some of the states they never turned that back to the
[02:49.280 --> 02:53.520]  individual states as they became states as i can i've repointed out when he
[02:53.520 --> 02:56.320]  was visiting with alex a couple of weeks ago
[02:56.320 --> 02:59.600]  that was a situation that happened even in western states like
[02:59.600 --> 03:04.720]  florida see when florida came into becoming became a state
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.080]  lands that were territories were controlled and owned by the federal
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.160]  government but they turned that over to the state to private individuals we saw
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.440]  that happen in texas of course because texas was an independent republic
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.280]  before it ever joined the union but after the civil war
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.800]  the government had a major change in many areas one of the things that they
[03:22.800 --> 03:25.200]  did was decided that they're just going to retain
[03:25.200 --> 03:29.920]  control of the land and never turn that back now they're going a bit farther
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.960]  with agenda 21 they want to not only not turn over the land that's out west but
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.200]  they also want to seize control of the private property that we have here and
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.160]  of course it's all being sold as sustainable
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.480]  as environmental as something that's going to
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.960]  help you to live a more green life and so she
[03:50.960 --> 03:54.800]  points that out in behind the green mask this is what i got in this flyer says
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.800]  the regional rail project is proposed to improve mobility
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.960]  mode choice accessibility and transportation reliability well you
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.080]  know what i have mode choice right now and i get
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.680]  to choose where i want to go but they don't like that they're not going to
[04:09.680 --> 04:13.120]  allow that we already had a story earlier this week
[04:13.120 --> 04:19.040]  where we saw that the DEA back in 2009 the ACLU learned that the DEA
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.680]  was trying to monitor the license plate so people that were gun shows
[04:23.680 --> 04:26.880]  now this was something that was leaked to the ACLU and then the DEA said oh
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.720]  don't worry about it we never did that we promise we never did that
[04:30.720 --> 04:33.760]  do you really believe that we're going to be back we're going to talk about that
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.040]  we're going to talk about obama care there's a discrepancy between the left
[04:37.040 --> 04:40.400]  and the right is it really more expensive than we were told or is it
[04:40.400 --> 04:43.520]  actually cheaper i think there's some group ring of the
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.720]  data going on here we're going to look at that as well as
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.480]  the trans-pacific partnership meetings on capitol hill were interrupted by
[04:50.480 --> 04:59.120]  protesters very important videos stay with us we'll be right back
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.840]  the average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges

[05:29.120 --> 05:32.800]  the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.240]  at the same time the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.640]  firearms can you put two and two together infidel body armor can stop

[08:22.160 --> 08:26.560]  welcome to the alex jones show this thursday january 29th 2015 i'm david
[08:26.560 --> 08:30.960]  night your host today it's amazing how quickly january has passed already one
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.440]  month into 2015 we have today rosa kori is
[08:35.440 --> 08:37.760]  going to be joining us in the third hour paul joseph
[08:37.760 --> 08:40.880]  what's going to be joining us at the bottom of this hour
[08:40.880 --> 08:45.920]  i think a common theme between what paul watson has talked about this last week
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.480]  of course he's been talking about davos we're going to talk to him about that
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.120]  as well but he also talked about the uk
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.440]  government announcing plans to remotely control vehicles and of course
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.680]  this is something we've been pointing out for quite a while here at info wars
[08:59.680 --> 09:02.720]  and alex jones has been talking about it for a very long time
[09:02.720 --> 09:07.520]  a key portion of controlling the population of course is going to be
[09:07.520 --> 09:13.200]  getting control of transportation and that plays into both agenda 21 as well
[09:13.200 --> 09:16.400]  as what we see being rolled out very rapidly
[09:16.400 --> 09:20.400]  in all the western countries europe uh the united states as well
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.520]  they are all rushing to what they call driverless cars let me tell you
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.040]  these self-driving cars is the other way they refer to them
[09:29.040 --> 09:32.160]  i have a self-driving car right now i can drive myself
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.840]  anywhere i want to go that's not going to be the case once we have
[09:35.840 --> 09:40.240]  computer driven government controlled cars they're going to determine
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.000]  where you go how fast you go and they're going to determine where you go and
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.120]  they're going to track everywhere you go and that's something that we should
[09:47.120 --> 09:49.360]  all be very concerned about especially when we look at
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.440]  articles that have just come out this last week look at the air passengers
[09:53.440 --> 09:57.040]  bank details that they want to see in the e you
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.440]  they want to know all about your banking details before they allow you to travel
[10:01.440 --> 10:05.680]  we also saw in the united states that the tsa is planning to scrutinize
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.080]  social media posts of travelers so they want to know about your bank details
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.800]  they want to know about what you're saying on social media
[10:12.800 --> 10:15.840]  what do you think they're going to do once they control
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.920]  even internal travel within the country controlling the cars
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.280]  we've already gotten a glimpse of this of course we know the government has an
[10:23.280 --> 10:26.880]  insatiable appetite for information about what we're doing
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.160]  what we're thinking if we're a possible threat at all to them
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.000]  we had this story that we talked about yesterday alex talked about it some
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.320]  where the dea was planning to take license plate
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.680]  scans of people who had gone to gun shows this was something
[10:41.680 --> 10:47.040]  that was leaked to the aclu it was a plan that they had back in 2009
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.960]  and this was something that was being done by the drug enforcement agency
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.200]  not the atf but the drug enforcement agency
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.440]  say of course they've been on the cutting edge of destroying the constitution
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.640]  for a very very long time they were the ones who gave us
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.240]  civil asset forfeiture they destroyed the rule of law
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.640]  they set up the surveillance state they did things to corrupt the police using
[11:10.640 --> 11:13.440]  civil asset forfeiture they've been on the forefront of this for a long
[11:13.440 --> 11:16.240]  time is a six years ago they were planning on using
[11:16.240 --> 11:20.560]  automatic license plate readers to record everybody at a gun show
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.080]  and the aclu at the time said well we we saw this and so we concluded these
[11:24.080 --> 11:26.800]  agencies were collecting the information but
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.160]  we've now been reassured by the dea that
[11:30.160 --> 11:33.760]  they never did it and so there there alleviates
[11:33.760 --> 11:37.440]  some concerns says the aclu do you really believe
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.760]  that they didn't do it i mean these people credible in any way whatsoever
[11:41.760 --> 11:44.560]  do you think that perhaps they if they didn't do it
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.920]  is probably because they just found a better
[11:47.920 --> 11:51.600]  more covert way to do it using stingray using
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.040]  your cell phone to track you probably somebody said guys we don't need to drive
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.760]  around the park and i've taken pictures of cars at gun shows
[11:57.760 --> 12:01.200]  we can just track them using their cell phones
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.720]  haven't you heard we just got this great program from the nsa
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.160]  so they're doing it they're looking to see everything that you're doing they're
[12:08.160 --> 12:12.240]  following everything that you're doing it's about
[12:12.240 --> 12:15.440]  total government control it's about turning our planet
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.520]  into a plantation and our overseers and our slave masters
[12:19.520 --> 12:22.400]  want to know everything that we're doing now the third hour we're going to talk
[12:22.400 --> 12:24.960]  to rosa quarry one of the things guys see if you
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.280]  can get a a shot of this map for the people who are looking
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.280]  at a video feed of this this is a flyer that i got
[12:33.280 --> 12:36.320]  telling me that i could go to a meeting and that's something we're going to talk
[12:36.320 --> 12:41.120]  to rosa quarry about this is not just about a texas corridor
[12:41.120 --> 12:44.720]  that same thing is going on where she lives in san francisco the same thing
[12:44.720 --> 12:48.800]  is going on wherever you live if you're listening to us because this is part of a
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.720]  un global agenda this is a global agenda this
[12:52.720 --> 12:55.680]  isn't just a problem with texas or california or the united states
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.840]  this is going to go on everywhere this is about containing everybody
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.680]  into a small area restricting their movements
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.280]  and right now i we're looking at this flyer that i've got and
[13:07.280 --> 13:10.800]  what they're saying is well of course one option that could be studied
[13:10.800 --> 13:14.480]  would be to provide passenger rail service what do you think i mean we
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.960]  could study that we could you could come to the meeting
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.080]  and give us your input i mean that's just an idea we had
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.680]  they know exactly what they want to do this meeting is something that's
[13:23.680 --> 13:26.640]  carefully controlled and plotted by the ran corporation
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.480]  to try to make you feel like you're part of a consensus buying into this
[13:30.480 --> 13:35.600]  sustainable program the whole thing is a very elaborate lie
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.280]  and i think people are starting to wake up to this we see that uh the trans
[13:39.280 --> 13:42.800]  pacific partnership is being given a fast track
[13:42.800 --> 13:45.680]  by the obama administration republicans want to get this done
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.920]  very very badly as well is very likely that it's going to happen obama wants it
[13:49.920 --> 13:52.880]  uh both houses of the republicans want it they've
[13:52.880 --> 13:56.960]  signaled that they want to do this very early very quickly why should you be
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.960]  concerned about this well because it's the next step
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.280]  in global corporate governance is being negotiated in secret
[14:05.280 --> 14:09.040]  and even if you don't have an issue with what's there we
[14:09.040 --> 14:11.760]  you think you know what's there and you don't have an issue with it you should
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.120]  have an issue with the process that they're going through the fact that
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.400]  they are negotiating this in secret that none of our elected
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.000]  representatives are allowed to see this that they're going to be given this
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.720]  massive document with no time to look it over
[14:24.720 --> 14:28.640]  and no capability of changing it some people have had enough let's uh roll
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.240]  this tape guys of the tpp protesters interrupting the
[14:32.240 --> 14:44.320]  us trade representatives presentation this is on c-span
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.080]  by knocking down barriers to us exports and leveling the playing field for
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.600]  american workers and businesses of all sizes oh it's going to be great to work
[14:51.600 --> 14:54.000]  to open markets around the world
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.720]  he said you're not telling the american people the truth but they're exporting
[15:02.720 --> 15:04.000]  this protester out
[15:09.520 --> 15:12.560]  let's have orders all right remove this
[15:12.560 --> 15:16.640]  so we remove her out they take her out
[15:16.640 --> 15:20.320]  and then they organize this so they've got as soon as they get her out and she
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.040]  shuts up they've got another person who comes in there watch this
[15:37.520 --> 15:40.400]  this government bureaucrat and they're unfurled that for those of you who are
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.440]  just listening they're unfurling the big banner behind him ppp
[15:43.440 --> 15:50.000]  fast track is uh the protester taking that guy out that's enough guys yeah
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.560]  it's listen if you want free trade you don't need
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.880]  multi-thousand page documents to do it negotiated in secret with only corporate
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.280]  lobbyist attending it's not free trade it's anything but free trade and this
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.840]  is not simply about trade this is about much more than trade this is about a
[16:11.840 --> 16:14.800]  global corporate governance they're going to change copyright laws
[16:14.800 --> 16:18.480]  they're going to force gmo's on people they're going to
[16:18.480 --> 16:21.600]  take over the internet this is another means of internet control that they're
[16:21.600 --> 16:24.640]  going to use i'm very very disappointed to see
[16:24.640 --> 16:28.000]  many republicans who should know better republicans like ran paul saying that
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.320]  he's going to support this i think if he does
[16:30.320 --> 16:34.160]  it is going to gut his support with a lot of people i think a lot of people
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.520]  are going to say that's it he sold out to private secret
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.760]  corporate interests because anybody that votes for fast track
[16:41.760 --> 16:45.040]  has done that that's something we should be very very concerned about and it's
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.640]  good to see people standing up taking the risk and even
[16:48.640 --> 16:53.760]  getting arrested for that now obama care we're told that this is the
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.600]  affordable health care act we had headlines just the last couple of days
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.200]  from bloomberg as well as from media matters
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.200]  saying that the right wing is lying to you about obama care
[17:05.200 --> 17:08.480]  affordable health care turns out is affordable after all
[17:08.480 --> 17:11.840]  we got this headline from bloomberg says obama care will cost 20 less than
[17:11.840 --> 17:15.680]  initial projections says the cbo then we've got another one that's a bit
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.840]  stronger from media matters it says right wing media won't tell you
[17:19.840 --> 17:24.960]  that the cbo's new obama care costs estimates are lower than expected
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.480]  oh but meanwhile we're seeing that actually they have gone
[17:28.480 --> 17:34.880]  up to 1.93 trillion dollars actually that's a 12 percent increase
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.840]  over just three years ago so what's going on who's telling the truth
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.080]  again the grew bring the data you can make the data say anything you want if
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.240]  you massage it enough the cbo has done a 10-year
[17:48.240 --> 17:51.760]  projection they did one back in 2012 and they did one just
[17:51.760 --> 17:55.280]  recently now we reported on this when it happened back in 2012
[17:55.280 --> 17:59.200]  if you look at this article that we had it was
[17:59.200 --> 18:06.160]  in march 22nd 2012 10 years of obama care would cost 1.76 trillion dollars
[18:06.160 --> 18:10.960]  far more than originally claimed that was 2012
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.960]  they were saying that it was going to cost 1.76 trillion dollars
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.360]  go forward to this last october and we had an article on info wars.com from
[18:19.360 --> 18:23.440]  rt obama care likely to cost 300 billion dollars
[18:23.440 --> 18:27.680]  more than thought they say it's gone up 300 billion dollars
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.080]  since the summer of 2012 so that was back in october
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.440]  just this last week we saw articles all over the internet we saw
[18:35.440 --> 18:40.000]  two trillion dollars to cover just half of the uninsured actually a little bit
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.640]  less than half of the uninsured that was the headlines from
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.280]  new american we also saw other outlets talking about this we had the daily
[18:47.280 --> 18:53.280]  veil saying that it was going to be 1.993 trillion that's two or three hundred
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.360]  billion dollars more than they had expected so that's a 12 increase
[18:57.360 --> 19:02.160]  in just three years so what's the difference well the difference is one
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.720]  of those is looking at a 10-year cost and then the one that media matters and
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.720]  bloomberg is cherry picking that they are
[19:08.720 --> 19:14.560]  groupering is only looking at four years they're looking at 2015
[19:14.560 --> 19:18.080]  through 2019 so by picking the end points
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.360]  they can come up with a 20 percent decrease
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.280]  why is it going down 20 percent but over a 12-year
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.680]  period it's going up over a 10-year period it's going up 12 percent
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.560]  well it's because obama has arbitrarily extended so many of these things
[19:34.560 --> 19:37.920]  if it looks like it's going to hurt the economy before the election he pushes
[19:37.920 --> 19:41.120]  this out or he grants arbitrary restrictions with executive orders
[19:41.120 --> 19:44.160]  so by doing that he's pushing the cost out a few years
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.520]  then the liberal media goes in and looks at a shorter period of time
[19:47.520 --> 19:50.960]  at the front and says oh look it's 20 less because he's pushed these things
[19:50.960 --> 19:53.200]  out then they say the right wing media is lying
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.360]  about it we can't afford obama care but it's more
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.720]  than just the efficiency it's about freedom we'll talk about that when we
[20:00.720 --> 20:02.960]  come back we had to keep secrets for somebody
[20:02.960 --> 20:06.240]  why don't you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care
[20:06.240 --> 20:10.960]  what you're hiding the year is 2007 and 20 percent of the state of california

[24:12.800 --> 24:16.560]  welcome back to the alex joneshow on this thursday january 29th 2015 i'm
[24:16.560 --> 24:19.840]  david night your host we're going to be joined in the next segment all joseph
[24:19.840 --> 24:23.280]  watson from the uk and of course he had a story out yesterday the uk
[24:23.280 --> 24:27.440]  government announces a plan to remotely control vehicles
[24:27.440 --> 24:31.280]  that's something we've been seeing coming for a long time as a matter of fact
[24:31.280 --> 24:36.480]  obama has mandated devices on american cars i forget exactly what the time
[24:36.480 --> 24:39.760]  frame is guys maybe you look that up but but it's only about five or six years
[24:39.760 --> 24:43.920]  out that we're looking this is something that is coming
[24:43.920 --> 24:47.680]  they're selling it as safety as convenience you know you can just get
[24:47.680 --> 24:50.640]  in these cars and they'll drive themselves and you can just
[24:50.640 --> 24:55.200]  set back and play on social media or do whatever you want you
[24:55.200 --> 24:58.320]  don't have to be concerned about driving your car
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.200]  i think it's a very dangerous thing because it illustrates the continuing
[25:03.200 --> 25:07.680]  movement towards a total control grid of your movement so they're not just
[25:07.680 --> 25:11.120]  concerned with tracking your movements of course we had the report earlier this
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.480]  week about the dea saying that they back in 2009
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.600]  they were going to record everybody's license plate said gun shows
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.240]  and they said don't worry we didn't do that they probably found a better way to
[25:20.240 --> 25:23.680]  do it as i mentioned the last segment but we also saw this week that the tsa
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.360]  wants to look at your social media posts before they let you fly
[25:27.360 --> 25:31.840]  they also want to look at your bank details in the uk
[25:31.840 --> 25:35.200]  and now they say we want to control your car don't worry
[25:35.200 --> 25:40.160]  it's for your own safety believe me they're going to hit that number hard
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.520]  that is going to be for your own safety just before we went to the break we
[25:43.520 --> 25:47.200]  were talking about obama care affordable care you know that has gone up
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.600]  12 percent in just three years according to the cbo's estimates of course
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.840]  the liberal media is goobering the data looking at a very
[25:55.840 --> 25:59.680]  short section of that not 10 years but looking at four years and say no no no
[25:59.680 --> 26:02.720]  it's going to go down 20 percent well it's going to go down 20 percent
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.400]  because they have pushed the cost farther out but of course we got
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.120]  republicans who don't want to do anything about it either
[26:09.120 --> 26:12.800]  one of them of course is not just painter but we got governor
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.040]  casick of ohio he says if you oppose obama care
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.400]  you're a bad christian this is something comes from campaign for liberty
[26:20.400 --> 26:24.160]  they point out that he's been going around the country stomping for a balanced
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.920]  budget can you feel the cognitive dissonance there
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.720]  he's going around stomping for balanced budget and obama care at the same time
[26:32.720 --> 26:35.440]  something that we now see from the congressional budget office
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.320]  is going to add two trillion dollars to the debt
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.640]  over a 10-year period i mean we're looking at a
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.400]  total debt that's about 17 trillion right now 17 18
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.840]  so we're looking at a pretty big increase that's about
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.240]  one ninth that's about 11 percent increase just for that one program
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.000]  just for only about half of the people who
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.320]  did to get insured and of course these are going to be largely in the forms of
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.680]  subsidies well hey subsidized insurance is great isn't it
[27:09.680 --> 27:12.880]  where's that money going to go that subsidy we've been saying from the very
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.080]  beginning this is nothing but a massive transfer of wealth
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.080]  from the american people to the insurance companies
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.880]  you're going to pay for that subsidy in taxes and where is that money going to
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.400]  go it's going to go to the insurance companies
[27:28.400 --> 27:31.600]  that write the checks for the democrat and republicans
[27:31.600 --> 27:34.960]  in office now this is what kasek is saying as he's going around
[27:34.960 --> 27:37.840]  talking about a balanced budget amendment first thing he did to explain it
[27:37.840 --> 27:40.640]  was he said well hey uh it's not going to cost uh
[27:40.640 --> 27:43.360]  ohio any money we're going to get that money for free we're going to get it
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.480]  from the federal government i guess uh they're just going to run the
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.920]  printing presses a little bit over time but of course we all know that
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.040]  eventually it's it's pretty easy to point out that that's going to have to
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.120]  be paid back with interest by us or by our children so then he changes
[27:57.120 --> 28:02.720]  tack and he starts talking about the compassionate side of it
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.320]  washington said that government is not compassion it's not eloquence it's not
[28:06.320 --> 28:09.120]  persuasion it's not any of those things it's simply
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.360]  force but he puts it out in terms of this is our christian duty
[28:13.360 --> 28:16.880]  to provide obama care government provided
[28:16.880 --> 28:19.840]  health insurance because it's not even health care
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.280]  okay it is health insurance you're buying insurance and hoping
[28:23.280 --> 28:26.320]  that you're going to get health care but just because you've got health insurance
[28:26.320 --> 28:28.800]  as so many people have found out in this country
[28:28.800 --> 28:33.200]  doesn't mean that you're going to get health care but he says this he says
[28:33.200 --> 28:36.160]  well i think i want to feed the hungry and i want to clothe the naked and i
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.960]  have to tell you i read a horrible story in the wall street journal in the
[28:38.960 --> 28:41.760]  weekend about people one man in particular freezing
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.120]  to death over in montana and they've turned down about half a billion
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.960]  dollars of help i'm told and that disturbs me
[28:48.960 --> 28:52.800]  so you know it's it's about helping your fellow man but
[28:52.800 --> 28:58.000]  you know god never said anything about practicing charity with other people's
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.360]  money that's one of the first problems with this
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.360]  and god never said that you need to go create a giant
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.080]  government bureaucracy to help people part of helping people
[29:10.080 --> 29:14.400]  is to make sure that you are doing it one on one
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.400]  that's the real important thing to step up and help people yourself
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.560]  you can't depend on government agencies and bureaucracies to do that
[29:22.560 --> 29:25.680]  they won't even allocate the money to them they're going to keep more than
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.320]  half of the money for the bureaucracy it's not even a good
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.400]  charity if you want to support that charity but they can't tell who really
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.800]  needs it and it's a faceless giving of money it has
[29:36.800 --> 29:39.920]  nothing to do with being a good christian stay with us we're going to be right
[29:39.920 --> 29:43.760]  back with paul joseph watson and we're going to talk about making the train

[34:16.800 --> 34:21.440]  paul thanks for joining us i wanted to talk to you before we go to this
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.480]  global control of transportation that we see developing there's been a lot of
[34:24.480 --> 34:27.520]  stories this last week and in the next hour or the third hour we're going to
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.360]  be talking to rosa quarry about the agenda 21
[34:31.360 --> 34:34.560]  aspects of this because this is a a global issue the
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.200]  crackdown on our movements the not just the tracking of our movements but the
[34:39.200 --> 34:41.280]  control of our movements but before we do that
[34:41.280 --> 34:45.040]  you've got a story up today about george soros linking him
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.120]  to the davos group where they're essentially panicking
[34:49.120 --> 34:53.440]  over social unrest but at the same time they're fomenting it we know that
[34:53.440 --> 34:57.840]  george soros is pushing billboards that are trying to
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.080]  foment the unrest in ferguson and then they are also
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.240]  looking for their bug outplaces in new zealand and elsewhere
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.680]  yeah that's the theme isn't it that they know these revolutions these
[35:09.680 --> 35:12.320]  uprisings are coming and they want to hijack them
[35:12.320 --> 35:17.440]  co-op them towards their own ends while having the insurance policy as you said
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.680]  of these secret hideaways which um robert johnson
[35:21.680 --> 35:26.560]  this economist revealed during the recent davos economic forum saying that
[35:26.560 --> 35:30.480]  people are basically buying huge tracts of lands in remote locations like new
[35:30.480 --> 35:34.800]  zealand as a hedge against this instability which they see
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.160]  coming but as we've reported for years david
[35:38.160 --> 35:42.240]  um as as long as five years ago people were doing this i mean we had
[35:42.240 --> 35:45.440]  john malone the billionaire chairman of liberty media
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.640]  he announced that he was buying a retreat on the quibbeck border we had
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.480]  james cameron the hollywood director in 2012
[35:52.480 --> 35:56.880]  announced that he was moving his entire family out of america to new zealand
[35:56.880 --> 36:02.480]  we also had the bush family uh buying 100 000 acres in paraguay as far back as
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.520]  2006 and in fact i was told by a very prominent
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.360]  person who knows a lot of insiders around a year ago
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.560]  that the elite were buying huge tracts of lands
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.680]  airstrips etc in south america so this is a trend that's been going on
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.080]  for several years and the recent article and in an article that's coming out
[36:24.080 --> 36:27.920]  in about an hour or so i pick it up from the point where
[36:27.920 --> 36:33.280]  zebigniew brzezinski gave this big cfr speech back in 2010 and he followed it
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.320]  up with similar comments in 2012 where the elite know that this quote global
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.200]  political awakening those are his words global political awakening
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.760]  is coming and that it poses a direct threat to the elite's bid to centralize
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.800]  power and you were talking just then about the control
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.640]  grid zebigniew brzezinski wrote the you know america's role in the
[36:56.640 --> 37:02.080]  technotronic era this this book in 1970 in which he
[37:02.080 --> 37:05.920]  heralded the arrival of this control grid under which everybody would be under
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.200]  mass surveillance it's important to know that during this
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.600]  cfr speech in 2010 he was lamenting the fact that this
[37:13.600 --> 37:18.560]  political awakening this uprising posed a direct threat to that
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.560]  technotronic era so this is something that the elite
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.480]  known they've known that it's been coming for at least five to ten years
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.200]  we've now seen expressions of it in the 2011 London riots of course
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.160]  Ferguson Missouri last year so they're talking about wealth inequality
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.760]  this is what it's arising out of is this
[37:39.760 --> 37:43.120]  depression of wages in the western world where people
[37:43.120 --> 37:47.680]  especially younger generations are finding it increasingly harder
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.240]  to meet this consumer culture to maintain this kind of lifestyle
[37:52.240 --> 37:55.840]  now that we've got you know religion family social
[37:55.840 --> 38:00.080]  mobility on the decline that's being replaced by this
[38:00.080 --> 38:04.560]  consumer culture which because of income inequality
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.320]  younger generations are finding it increasingly harder to maintain
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.240]  so that's why we're starting to see these riots like the London riots in
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.640]  2011 and of course then we have the the perceived widespread
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.200]  injustice the complete collapse in confidence in political leadership
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.560]  as well as police brutality which led to the Ferguson Missouri riots last year
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.000]  so we've got all these factors colliding together
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.080]  the elite see this as instigating riots and civil unrest that's why they're
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.680]  buying these insurance policies but as he said this is this is where the
[38:37.680 --> 38:40.400]  involvement of Soros comes in because they need to
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.240]  not only get ahead of that but control and co-op those riots
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.680]  as they did with the Arab Spring as they did in Ukraine
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.520]  well of course they rushed to get the US taxpayer to
[38:51.520 --> 38:55.280]  subsidize and ensure their derivatives one of the first things they did when
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.760]  they came back from the election so they're very concerned about
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.680]  this whole system breaking down but in terms of the of the long-term prognosis
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.720]  of course we know that with AI with robotics
[39:08.720 --> 39:12.960]  coming into so many different areas they're predicting massive unemployment
[39:12.960 --> 39:18.400]  45 unemployment by the early 2020s according to some of the AI experts
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.680]  and economists who have looked at this if you look at that kind of massive
[39:21.680 --> 39:25.120]  unemployment and displacement that is something that is up to the
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.200]  level of the Great Depression or worse and that is going to cause
[39:29.200 --> 39:32.560]  massive unrest so of course they're they're kind of hedging their bets I
[39:32.560 --> 39:36.080]  mean I and you talk about this them seeing this
[39:36.080 --> 39:39.920]  coming you know 10 years ago yeah they started making their moves
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.600]  I went to New Zealand back in 1998 because I was reading
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.360]  Doug Casey and James Davidson and they were talking about
[39:47.360 --> 39:50.880]  what was going to be coming down at that time I had the money to make the move
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.000]  I went there and looked at this beautiful country but I went there
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.520]  and it made me homesick for America I just have to fight this here I can't
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.000]  can't go somewhere else and fight it well yeah I mean that's the point
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.960]  I don't see this David as you know the elite relinquishing power and
[40:08.960 --> 40:11.600]  you know saying the stuff's going to hit the fan and we're going to have to get
[40:11.600 --> 40:14.560]  out of here at the moment it's an insurance policy but
[40:14.560 --> 40:19.680]  there is massive political unrest which is born out of those factors that I
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.760]  mentioned you know social alienation the lack of community
[40:23.760 --> 40:27.840]  increase corruption in government and those declining wages that income
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.120]  inequality then then they want you know an
[40:31.120 --> 40:33.520]  insurance option and that's what this is about
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.320]  but in terms of the economic picture a major factor and this is what Brandon
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.400]  Smith wrote about in his article which we posted which is linked from
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.720]  my article today the next economic downturn the next
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.240]  financial collapse in whatever form that may take
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.160]  they're going to blame it on capitalism this is this is the narrative
[40:54.160 --> 40:57.040]  that they're pushing at the IMF at the ECB
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.560]  that capitalism is the biggest threat to capitalism
[41:00.560 --> 41:04.720]  and of course what is the solution going to be well surprise surprise
[41:04.720 --> 41:08.320]  is going to be for them to centralize more power
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.040]  and create this economic world government so now you have Mario Draghi the
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.440]  ECB head and Christine Lagarde of the IMF both penning
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.120]  very similar editorials earlier this month saying that
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.400]  when this next economic downturn really hits
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.800]  they're going to blame it on sovereign economies and the solution will be
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.440]  what they call multilateralism which is basically a world economic government
[41:33.440 --> 41:37.360]  centralization of economic power into fewer hands
[41:37.360 --> 41:43.680]  less autonomous control over economies by sovereign countries
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.800]  so even though it was their regulation their policies
[41:46.800 --> 41:50.640]  that caused the 2008 economic collapse in the first place
[41:50.640 --> 41:53.440]  their solution is going to be more of the same
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.440]  but also a completely revamped economic system which is
[41:57.440 --> 42:02.080]  directly under their control so again they're using the same trick
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.080]  we've also focused on the past David on these IMF riots in places like
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.640]  Argentina they caused these riots by instigating
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.720]  social unrest in the first place by manipulating economies
[42:14.720 --> 42:19.520]  then when it all crashes they asset strip and seize control over national
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.360]  economies get them into more debt get them reliant on the IMF
[42:23.360 --> 42:27.680]  on the world bank so they're a good couple of moves ahead of the game
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.360]  but whether it comes in the next few years or not remains to be seen i know
[42:31.360 --> 42:34.880]  that Martin Armstrong who is somebody we feature quite regularly
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.640]  he's predicting and he's been very successful with his prior predictions he
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.560]  predicted the 87 black monday crash as well as the 98
[42:42.560 --> 42:45.520]  russian financial collapse he's predicting civil
[42:45.520 --> 42:51.120]  uprising within america before 2016 or in 2016
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.520]  again as a result of this distrust in government in leadership
[42:55.520 --> 42:59.120]  which continues to hover at historical record lows
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.800]  so that distrust combined with an economic downturn
[43:02.800 --> 43:06.560]  again both of those factors are the fault of the economic elite
[43:06.560 --> 43:10.800]  will lead to more of these riots which the elite will then try to exploit for
[43:10.800 --> 43:13.520]  their own purposes well of course paul
[43:13.520 --> 43:18.560]  crony capitalism is not capitalism is really cronyism it's been called graft
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.080]  it's been called corruption for crony capitalism to work
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.800]  government is actually a tool of these these elites who essentially
[43:26.800 --> 43:29.760]  gain control of the government who take it captive
[43:29.760 --> 43:32.720]  and i think one of the things that illustrates that better than anything
[43:32.720 --> 43:38.080]  else that corporate control and capture of our government of course is the
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.440]  trans-pacific partnership something that i think is going to be rammed
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.120]  through by the republicans and by obama we're seeing a lot of strong
[43:45.120 --> 43:48.560]  signals that that's going to happen a perfect example of that where you've
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.640]  got corporations corporate lobbyists meeting in secret
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.080]  and the government is not even allowed to know what's going to happen
[43:56.080 --> 43:59.600]  with that they're not allowed to see the negotiations they're not allowed to
[43:59.600 --> 44:02.800]  read the documents before they deliver it instead they're going to hand deliver
[44:02.800 --> 44:05.600]  this thing and tell them to rubber stamp it and of
[44:05.600 --> 44:08.480]  course they will paul
[44:08.480 --> 44:11.760]  yeah i mean that's the fundamental issue over and over again
[44:11.760 --> 44:15.120]  these economists like pickety these socialists
[44:15.120 --> 44:21.120]  continue to blame capitalism when we haven't had a true system of capitalism
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.280]  in the west for the best part of 50 60 years it just hasn't existed
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.800]  it's crony capitalism it's corporatism it's the revolving door between
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.240]  government and corporations it's favors for favors so
[44:34.240 --> 44:37.120]  you know that's what causes the problems in the first place and then they
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.600]  blame free market capitalism to justify these regulations that
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.440]  only squeeze the middle class and small businesses
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.800]  so then as the middle class declines this wealth inequality this income gap
[44:50.800 --> 44:56.320]  only gets wider as a result of their solutions to the problem and yet they're
[44:56.320 --> 44:59.680]  still out in the media uh legard and george soros
[44:59.680 --> 45:05.280]  particularly saying that this wealth inequality um will cause major social
[45:05.280 --> 45:09.520]  upheaval but their policies their crony capitalist policies
[45:09.520 --> 45:12.320]  are what's creating that problem in the first place
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.840]  if you look at the uh keystone pipeline i mean regardless of what you think of
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.600]  the keystone pipeline the republicans have pushed this through
[45:19.600 --> 45:22.960]  10 times now they're trying to push it through the 10th time
[45:22.960 --> 45:25.920]  even when things hadn't already hadn't changed they didn't have a new senate
[45:25.920 --> 45:28.800]  they did it for the ninth time when they came back from the elections
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.480]  the first thing they did once they got a republican senate was of course to push
[45:32.480 --> 45:35.120]  for the trans-pacific partnership if you look to see
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.720]  who's going to benefit from the trans-pacific partnership you'll know
[45:38.720 --> 45:41.760]  who owns the republican party lock stock and barrel
[45:41.760 --> 45:44.160]  that's why they're not doing any of the stuff that they campaigned on they're
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.440]  not stopping uh open immigration they're not doing anything to defund obama care
[45:49.440 --> 45:53.040]  they're not doing anything to investigate the illegal actions of obama
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.080]  no they just want to deliver to their corporate masters
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.760]  and from that standpoint it doesn't even matter to know who the corporate masters
[45:59.760 --> 46:02.240]  are it's just important that you know that these people
[46:02.240 --> 46:06.000]  are bought and sold and the same thing is going on with the trans-pacific
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.960]  partnership but moving on to this other story paul
[46:08.960 --> 46:12.240]  one of the ways perhaps that they won't have to go to their bug outs in new
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.160]  zealand and elsewhere is if they can affect control of the
[46:16.160 --> 46:19.840]  population and of course one of those things is agenda 21 we're going to be
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.160]  talking to uh rosa quarry in the third hour an important part of that
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.920]  is controlling our movement controlling transportation
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.000]  and we had some really harrowing news this week of course reminding us that
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.040]  that's really what's been going on at airports and
[46:35.040 --> 46:38.400]  the tsa as well as in europe we had these headlines where
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.000]  uh bank details are going to have to be handed over before you can fly on a
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.320]  plane in europe and then the tsa wants to look at your social media posts
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.640]  we learned that the dea six years ago was saying that they were going to look at
[46:50.640 --> 46:56.080]  uh automobile license plates at gun shows so they could put those people
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.080]  in a database as suspects that was the dea that wasn't even
[47:00.080 --> 47:05.920]  the atf that was the dta uh the dea so we look at what they're trying to do
[47:05.920 --> 47:09.120]  it's not really about making the trains run on time paul is it
[47:09.120 --> 47:13.200]  it's really more like a nazi control device it's not an efficiency
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.040]  issue it's really about controlling transportation
[47:17.040 --> 47:22.320]  yeah it's about embedding this idea that you have to get state permission
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.000]  to do anything and if if you've been a naughty boy if you made a
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.040]  a negative social media post about the government
[47:29.040 --> 47:33.440]  then maybe your right to mobility to travel will be revoked we saw that
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.920]  with this new tsa program which for the moment they're considering for their
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.160]  pre-check program so it will be opt-in for on that basis
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.120]  of course the threat is that it then could be expanded to
[47:45.120 --> 47:50.080]  every flyer which is not only will they analyze your social media post before
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.560]  designating you as being a not a security threat and able to fly
[47:54.560 --> 47:57.920]  they'll also analyze your purchase history
[47:57.920 --> 48:01.920]  so this i mean that there was a dystopian
[48:01.920 --> 48:06.720]  british tv show where to travel you had to replay the last
[48:06.720 --> 48:12.000]  week of your entire life via a chip embedded in your head that has a life
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.920]  log camera which shows the security authorities
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.160]  every moment of the past week of your life so that that's the ultimate end of
[48:20.160 --> 48:23.360]  this in in the ultimate dystopian nightmare scenario
[48:23.360 --> 48:26.880]  but for the moment that's what they're proposing we've already had
[48:26.880 --> 48:30.240]  incidents where people are traveling from canada to the united states where the
[48:30.240 --> 48:34.880]  tsa knows their prescription drug record
[48:34.880 --> 48:38.960]  says that they have depression and maybe a threat to the other passengers
[48:38.960 --> 48:42.800]  so people have been harassed interrogated over that so it's it's all
[48:42.800 --> 48:45.760]  about creating this culture of having to get
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.920]  permission from the state based on your behavior
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.680]  or your ideological or political viewpoints and if you think that that
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.040]  science fiction let's play this clip from back in about
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.920]  2008 of a cnn reporter drew griffin who couldn't get on a plane let's let's
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.480]  play that clip
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.200]  don't think it can happen to you
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.600]  it's happening to me
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.920]  i watched this so how did i get on this list
[49:17.920 --> 49:22.160]  well the tsa is adamant it's not even me even though it is me
[49:22.160 --> 49:25.360]  getting stopped at the airport you know they've been keeping people from
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.480]  getting on airplanes and of course the tsa is the
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.240]  transportation security agents here whatever the sa i mean we've
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.280]  seen so many different acronyms that are more accurate than that but they're
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.160]  concerned not with just air travel they're concerned
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.800]  with all transportation and let me tell you think about it when you go to the
[49:42.800 --> 49:45.680]  airport are you concerned that they're not going
[49:45.680 --> 49:48.560]  to let you on a plane are you concerned enough that you will go through and let
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.560]  them put their hands on you subject you to x-rays
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.480]  so that you can then be rewarded with plane travel
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.080]  it is a very important tool for them to be able to control
[50:00.080 --> 50:03.200]  your transportation and it basically put you
[50:03.200 --> 50:06.320]  under house arrest if they don't like who you are i think this is a
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.080]  very dangerous thing paul and it is something that people don't realize
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.080]  how pervasive this is going to be once the government starts controlling
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.520]  the cars electronically whether presuming to do is have
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.520]  a wi-fi or some other wireless technology that is essentially going to
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.040]  track and control the cars but of course they tell us don't worry we're going to
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.040]  get rid of traffic jams for you and it'll be so much safer
[50:29.040 --> 50:33.360]  the way they're selling it yeah and that's that's the uk government proposal
[50:33.360 --> 50:36.400]  by offcon they're now saying within 10 years they're
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.000]  going to try and set up this system whereby they can remotely control your
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.840]  car limit its speed in order to reduce traffic
[50:43.840 --> 50:47.200]  congestion and solve global warming so again it's the government
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.400]  remotely controlling your car it's it's a surveillance nightmare
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.000]  but they won't tell you that it's really going to restrict all of your
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.720]  movement in a way that we've never imagined stay with us
[50:56.720 --> 50:59.200]  we're going to be right back with paul joseph Watson

[53:00.960 --> 53:04.880]  i want to tell you about matt redhawk and his team of patriots over at my
[53:04.880 --> 53:08.080]  patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two
[53:08.080 --> 53:11.280]  bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.120]  and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[53:15.120 --> 53:18.720]  action a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[53:18.720 --> 53:22.720]  my patriot supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[53:22.720 --> 53:26.240]  they now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.160]  over 50 hard-working american men and women it is rare to find companies
[53:30.160 --> 53:34.480]  who practice what they preach and that's why i stock my pantry with high

[54:11.680 --> 54:17.920]  don't want no shackles don't want no shackles on me
[54:17.920 --> 54:21.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today and i have
[54:21.200 --> 54:25.360]  paul joseph watson joining me from the uk we've been talking about
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.160]  not only the article that he's got today about
[54:28.160 --> 54:32.560]  george soros at the same time that endavos they're talking about how they
[54:32.560 --> 54:36.960]  need to have a backup plan essentially a
[54:36.960 --> 54:40.560]  hedging their bets that society isn't going to break down at the same time
[54:40.560 --> 54:44.640]  they're also fomenting unrest by putting billboards up to
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.720]  foment that kind of unrest in furguson but we're also talking about how they
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.160]  may try to actually pull this back certainly how the government
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.320]  is going to try to control our movement it's going to go far beyond
[54:56.320 --> 54:59.440]  what we have seen up to this point at the airport so of course
[54:59.440 --> 55:03.360]  we've seen the viper teams that have gone out on the roadways
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.800]  to harass people to inspect them we're going to have the government
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.720]  however remotely controlling your cars deciding
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.120]  when you can travel where you can travel and they're going to be tracking you
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.280]  completely a very very harrowing thing to contemplate
[55:21.280 --> 55:24.080]  paul one of the things when i look at this and of course they're they're
[55:24.080 --> 55:26.960]  selling this as part of the internet of things
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.640]  something that david patrice was talking about years ago
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.920]  the fact that appliances in your house that are
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.320]  computerized can be used as a listening device for the
[55:38.320 --> 55:43.040]  cia and others who are prone to do that sort of thing but of course
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.640]  it presents a lot of security issues and i see people talking about the use of
[55:46.640 --> 55:49.680]  this in transportation mode they say well the internet of things is not as
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.200]  secure as the internet it's like oh wait a minute
[55:53.200 --> 55:56.880]  the internet's not at all secure and you're pushing something on me that has
[55:56.880 --> 56:01.920]  less security than that what are you talking about that
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.200]  well the ftc came out this week and said that it was
[56:05.200 --> 56:08.880]  vulnerable to hackers so even the u.s government admits that the internet of
[56:08.880 --> 56:14.240]  things is wide open for abuse as he said patrice the former cia director
[56:14.240 --> 56:19.440]  hailed the internet as of things as a transformational boom for clandestine
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.040]  tradecraft which basically means spying on everybody
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.800]  the problem and this is why we need to educate young people on this because
[56:26.800 --> 56:30.240]  the people who are children and teenagers now are going to be growing up in
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.440]  this world they're going to be under this kind of system
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.640]  is that they have no frame of reference they didn't grow up in a society
[56:38.640 --> 56:41.840]  before the internet or before mass surveillance
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.360]  so i've got friends in their early 20s who
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.120]  for example don't can't even remember dial up internet
[56:49.120 --> 56:52.880]  so they literally got no frame of reference for how things were before
[56:52.880 --> 56:56.240]  so they've been inoculated that this is how it's always been and this is
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.920]  completely normal and then you had a speaker at davos
[56:59.920 --> 57:03.440]  last week who got up and stood on stage and said quote
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.840]  people often behave better when they have the sense that their actions are
[57:07.840 --> 57:12.080]  being watched yeah invoking you know o brian out of all wells
[57:12.080 --> 57:15.760]  1984 so it's this whole idea that constant
[57:15.760 --> 57:19.520]  surveillance constantly being watched is the norm that it's always been the
[57:19.520 --> 57:23.280]  norm and that's protest against it is futile
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.520]  and this idea that young people are willing to trade privacy for convenience
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.520]  which at the moment it seems that they are and this is why we need to educate
[57:31.520 --> 57:34.880]  young people on the fact that it's not always been this way
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.160]  the threat that this could pose in terms of hacking
[57:38.160 --> 57:41.440]  and shifting that balance of power over to the government where they're always
[57:41.440 --> 57:44.720]  being watched very concerning because i see the
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.240]  schools today as quite literally being a prison
[57:48.240 --> 57:52.800]  i mean i i jokingly referred to it as that when i was in high school because i
[57:52.800 --> 57:55.360]  felt so confined it's so restricted by it
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.200]  so regimented but today they actually have metal detectors and police walking
[57:59.200 --> 58:02.240]  the halls and uh they're getting quite rough with the
[58:02.240 --> 58:05.760]  students this is the way that they're conditioning them to live
[58:05.760 --> 58:09.520]  julian assange in terms of talking about barrett browns charges against him he
[58:09.520 --> 58:12.880]  said social media has all of your friends wearing a wire
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.560]  and the other part of that is that they're going to twist things that you say
[58:16.560 --> 58:20.640]  take them out of context and come after you it's just a
[58:20.640 --> 58:24.640]  really orwellian society that uh we're growing up these kids are growing up in
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.640]  paul yeah and i mean the iphone for
[58:28.640 --> 58:31.600]  example snowden came out with another story about that
[58:31.600 --> 58:34.640]  most people don't know that every location you visit unless you go
[58:34.640 --> 58:39.440]  hang on paul we're coming up to a break come up to a break can you

[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we were just talking to
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.320]  paul just watching from the uk he's going to stay with us through this
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.520]  segment to finish up what we were talking about of course paul
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.200]  it's very concerning to see the fact that these things they're they're
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.080]  admitting that the internet of things that they're going to use for our
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.480]  transportation are not even as secure as our current internet and so that
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.080]  brings up the issue of maliciousness governments
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.120]  can not only control when and where you travel
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.800]  not only look at everything that you're doing but of course they can get rid of
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.360]  you and make it look like an accident and even if it isn't
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.200]  something malicious like that anybody who has worked with a computer very much
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.240]  ought to be concerned about the fact that your car
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.160]  is under computer control that was something that i would never be
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.680]  comfortable with with experiences that i've grown up with with microsoft
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.360]  google the rest of these companies when you talk about a computer crash now
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.200]  you're talking about a physical crash so i'm not going to be one of the people
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.600]  signing up to get into one of these cars you're
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.560]  going to have to hold a gun in my head to do that
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.440]  yeah and then even on a on a personal level you know it came out that nsa
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.520]  employees were using the data that they had to spy on
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:39.120]  ex-lovers and friends and colleagues i mean we saw that in nazi germany with
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.800]  the gustapo they used it to get business advantages over
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.240]  people they despised and people who they were in competition with
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.880]  so even beyond the level of government surveillance
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.840]  absolutely directly impact people's day-to-day lives
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.400]  there was just a story from jonathan turley i was going to talk about this
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.640]  later since you brought it up alabama's first gay legislator declares that she
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.080]  will out adulterous colleagues who oppose
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.000]  same-sex marriage she said if you're going to oppose same-sex marriage
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.400]  on the basis of supporting the family if i know that you are committing adultery
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.720]  i'm going to go public with it he talks about it
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.760]  from the standpoint well this raises a lot of legal issues as to what they
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.080]  might be able to do uh to her but i look at this is like this is the
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.000]  way the government has been uh the nsa and other people have been blackmailing
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.440]  people in government for quite a long time we had a story just a couple weeks
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.440]  ago about the disappearance of a hollywood screenwriter and director
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.480]  gary devore who was working on a story that he claimed of course the
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.200]  storyline was that the entire invasion of panama was to go down there and to get
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.720]  sex tapes that there were blackmailing government officials with and he was
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.440]  somebody who had some credibility in that area because
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.960]  he was intricately linked with the cia as he was working in hollywood so yeah
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.560]  going in and blackmailing people especially our government officials
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.600]  that's one of the reasons why we should all be so concerned about the
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.040]  nsa and the cia is dragging that spine
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.200]  yeah because i mean surveillance is not is not just a weapon to be used to
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.440]  to track people to chill free speech to make them self-censor to restrict their
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.640]  mobility it's a political weapon i mean we've had
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.120]  many stories about lists of gun owners being published in newspapers
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.480]  and you know the flip side of that you know where people who don't own guns
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.480]  also live that's a boon for criminals you've had a situation in sweden where
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.040]  they've they've got lists of people who are anti-immigration in sweden
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.880]  and of course that could be collected just off social media posts alone
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.680]  then people newspaper editors and other political agitators have actually
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.920]  visited people's houses and harassed them because of their political opinions
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.960]  about immigration so if you've got a total surveillance
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.880]  society where everything is open to data mining down to
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.720]  the minutiae of people's political opinions not only does it make them more
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.800]  likely to self-censor but it also makes it more likely for
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.320]  this surveillance this information to be used as a political weapon
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.080]  to smear people to castigate people and to harass people
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.920]  absolutely we've seen it happen in the past and as we see this gay legislator
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.720]  saying that she's going to out adulterous colleagues if they oppose
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.040]  same-sex marriage a lot of people including myself believe that
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.560]  justice roberts was blackmailed when he handed out the opinion on obama care
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.040]  because he wrote both the opposing and the
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.960]  the winning decision and he flip-flopped on that issue and everybody
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.160]  was really scratching their head as to why he would
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.680]  go from opposing it as a mandate to supporting it and calling it
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.280]  attacks and so a lot of people believe that there was maybe some blackmail
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.880]  going on at that point in time thank you so much for joining us paul joseph
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.480]  watson in the uk and of course the stories there's also another story that

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.520]  2015 i'm david night your host who just talking to paul joseph
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.680]  watching in the uk in the next hour we're going to be talking to rosa quarry
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.760]  she wrote the book on agenda 21 all behind the green mask
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.320]  un agenda 21 we're going to talk to her about uh something that i just saw it
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.720]  and of course they're they're they're enclosing the net on us right now
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.160]  i think with transportation this is the next big
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.840]  control area that they're putting in place very rapidly
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.960]  it was less than a year ago that the uk uh the european governments
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.880]  and the u.s government got into a competition as to who could change their
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.640]  laws quickly enough to allow quote unquote self-driving cars of course
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.120]  those are not self-driven they're computer driven
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.560]  they're government controlled government monitored cars
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.560]  it's a way for them to enact a complete control grid of you and of course this
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.760]  is something that is being done internationally just as we were
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.160]  talking to paul joseph watson about the plans coming out in the uk
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.840]  we have plans being made in the united states as well as mandates coming
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.240]  online with vehicle to vehicle communication
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.080]  but of course this all plays into the un agenda 21
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.480]  trying to limit our scope of movement trying to confine us to
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.760]  certain small areas where we're all going to live in a very high
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.240]  density essentially making it very easy to control us
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.400]  not only a prison planet but that's going to be a plantation
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.920]  planet it's a way of watching everything we do
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.520]  keeping us under strict control it's something we should all be very concerned
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.440]  about and she's going to talk to us about not only what's happening here in
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.920]  texas but what's happening in california what's
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.440]  happening globally so wherever you live this is something
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.280]  that you've already seen to some degree in your area they may have already
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.000]  enacted part of it in your area without you understanding
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.840]  what's going on but believe me there is a lot more coming
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.480]  now we're going to go to some of your calls here in a moment the number is
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.240]  800 259 9231 i want to take some of your calls about
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.600]  perhaps some of the transportation issues that we talked about or the global trade
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.440]  issues of course there were people that crashed the Transpacific
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.120]  Partnership meeting in congress yesterday protesting it
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.400]  the fact that we have a massive sold as a trade agreement it's not a trade
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.840]  agreement it is far beyond trade it has issues that relate to
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.760]  internet control to copyright it's going to have massive
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.120]  issues as far as gmo goes as far as pharmaceuticals go
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.640]  it is far beyond just a trade agreement and of course it is not a
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.240]  free trade agreement you don't need thousands of pages
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.200]  of document negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists to have free trade
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.960]  you can have free trade without that what this is is trade that is managed
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.880]  for the benefit of the corporations that are creating this agreement
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.920]  it's a very dangerous thing and it goes far beyond trade
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.000]  and of course as we saw the people protesting that still most people don't
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.440]  really understand that it's even happening and they don't see it
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.120]  in the bigger picture of things it's far beyond just losing our jobs and losing
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.160]  our freedoms it's about consolidating
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.320]  the world into regional blocks that are then
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.840]  joined together that's the next case they've done first they create the
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.280]  regional blocks like NAFTA they create the European Union
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.360]  then they start consolidating those groups and that's the stage that we're
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.840]  at now and of course this is a secret agreement
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.600]  that we are not allowed to see we're not allowed to make decisions
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.440]  about our lives we're not allowed to make decisions about our families
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.200]  what they're going to have and of course that's a big part of Obamacare
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.120]  you can talk about whether or not it's efficient you can talk about the data
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.680]  and you can play games with the data as we mentioned in the first hour how
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.480]  they're grubbering the data trying to show that it's actually been a 20%
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.880]  decrease by just looking at a five-year projection
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.760]  when the 10-year projection from the CBO has increased by 12%
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.000]  in just the last three years over a 10-year period
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.440]  so it's not affordable but it's not even about that
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.960]  it's about having the freedom to make the decisions
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.240]  about our lives and of course one of those things is
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.680]  what are we going to have in our drinking water
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.520]  we have a California city saying that black sediment filled
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.840]  tap water is quote safe to drink and if you're watching on
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.520]  video just take a look at this pull this article up guys and show them
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.040]  a picture that somebody took of the tap water I mean it looks like
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.600]  crude oil coming out of the tap and of course the golden state water company
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.440]  claims that this grotesque foul smelling black sludge
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.240]  quote unquote water is safe to drink well let's see a picture of them
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.440]  drinking that on video I don't think I would want to drink that
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.600]  but of course if you see the black water coming out
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.200]  you might start to have questions about whether or not this is safe but when it
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.880]  is something like fluoride that you can't see
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.800]  maybe you don't have the same understanding of the danger
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.040]  we've just had a year of debate in Dallas about whether they're going to take
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.640]  fluoride out of the water supply look like they were going to do it for a
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.920]  while but then they have just taken the vote and they've decided that they're
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.120]  not going to remove fluoride from the water supply
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.160]  that's the way it's being reported in the Dallas Morning News
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.280]  that's almost as if the fluoride was already there and they decided that
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.200]  they're not going to run everything through a
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.440]  proprio filter to get it out of there no
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.520]  they're putting the fluoride in it's not a natural situation
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.240]  and it is not something that you need to do for your health
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.960]  look at what they said in the article they said
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.840]  $1,060,800 is the contract that they have with mosaic
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  crop nutrition to fluoridate Dallas's water
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.760]  so they're going to a crop nutrition company to
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.960]  get this fluoride put in the water why would they be going to a crop
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.880]  company to put this in well i don't know but
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.880]  they use fluoride as a pesticide on crops maybe that's why they're getting it
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.360]  because it's not just even the fact that they're
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.480]  putting fluoride in but it's the form of fluoride that they're putting in of
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.680]  course it's industrial waste from aluminum
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.760]  companies from nuclear waste from the processing of nuclear
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.080]  products uranium they have been taking this industrial waste
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.920]  from the aluminum and nuclear industries and instead of those people
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.040]  having to dispose of it as a toxic waste and spend the money
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.480]  they dump it into our water supply and charges in the case of Dallas
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.880]  a million dollars to put this pesticide stuff into the water supply but of
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.560]  course it's for the children that's what they said
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.000]  the doctor said yes saving a million dollars would be great but
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.480]  the cost to our youngest citizens would be higher they might have a cavity or
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.680]  something listen if you want to take a supplement
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.640]  for your kids if you want to put something on their teeth
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.560]  fine do you think that it's really safe for your children
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.120]  to mass medicate the public by dumping this into the water
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.560]  the children are the ones at most risk of getting
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.640]  overexposure to fluoride and we've had studies over and over again harvard study
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.760]  most recently showing too much fluoride causes a loss of 20 IQ points they
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.400]  found that in china 20 IQ points that's huge
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.640]  that's a huge difference that's a difference from a normal intelligence
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.280]  to a moron level intelligence 20 IQ points
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.040]  now how do you control the amount of fluoride that anyone gets if you're
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.880]  going to dump it into the water if you think that it's safe and
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.720]  effective you may be under medicating adults
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:00.000]  you may be over medicating children should children have the same dosage of
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.320]  any medicine that adults get of course not
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.920]  i mean it is absolute idiocy but they can't figure it out because
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.440]  it's not totally black like the water in california
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.200]  and it's not just that it's not just the fluoride but now they're
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.600]  starting a campaign of demonizing people who don't want to get their children
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.680]  vaccinated because of this measles outbreak
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.760]  in disneyland and of course rob dude at an extensive report on that the other
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.360]  night on the nightly news we now see that a doctor
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.880]  who is educating the public on vaccines traveling through
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.240]  australia this is a an article that's up on info wars
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.760]  dot com today that she's actually getting bomb threats
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.760]  and she's had to cancel the tour this is dr sherry tim penny who we've had on
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.720]  the show here several times and else that she has had to cancel speaking
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.120]  appearances that were scheduled for brisbane
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.160]  sydney adelaide melbourne and the gold coast the reason was due to pro vaccine
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.240]  extremists calling for violence and making bomb threats against
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.080]  venue owners and their families in some cities that were originally scheduled
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.840]  for healthy living seminars see we can't even
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:14.960]  talk about this without the extremists threatening people over vaccines
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.040]  look at the difference in the way they've reacted to this measles outbreak
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.800]  versus the way they reacted to the ebola outbreak
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.480]  they shut down the clinics when they've had people come in with measles they shut
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.280]  them down very quickly we've got the cdc and all the health
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.840]  officials giving us dire predictions about what's going to happen with measles
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:38.480]  i've had measles i'm not afraid of measles people my age
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.680]  all the children were given measles by their parents whenever they found a
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.200]  kid down the street had measles they sent the kids down to get it because it's
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.480]  a minor childhood disease it's more serious if you get it as an adult
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.560]  but they wanted the kids to have a good immunity against measles
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.440]  get it when it wasn't going to affect them that much
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.720]  it's not the same thing as ebola but when ebola was bringing up they were
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.640]  reluctant to close down places they didn't take precautions for a couple
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.120]  of days that's why nurses got sick and the cdc was constantly going
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.240]  into the public saying it's nothing to worry about
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.880]  believe me we've got this all under control you're not hearing that about
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.560]  measles they are pushing the hype the panic
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.400]  because they want to sell vaccines look at this other story the palm desert
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.400]  high school sends home 66 unvaccinated students
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.280]  this is because they had one student showed up with a suspected case of
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.840]  measles she was cleared to return to class on
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.080]  tuesday so it's not even clear that to me that she even had measles
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.440]  and yet we're hearing things from the parents associated with this disneyland
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.480]  outbreak we're hearing there was an article from a
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.920]  parent who was in alaska her daughter had been vaccinated vaccinated
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.920]  twice for m mr they went to disneyland
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.400]  she came down with measles and she was absolutely convinced that her child got
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.160]  it from these unvaccinated kids presumably who were at disneyland
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.720]  with measles the vaccine didn't protect her child
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.600]  it was never a they never entertained the thought that
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.320]  her child might have gotten measles from the vaccine
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.400]  that patient zero in this disneyland outbreak could have been
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.560]  a patient who came down with measles after they got vaccinated
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.880]  that was never an issue but she ended with the absurd statement that
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.800]  my daughter got measles after she was vaccinated that's why everybody needs to
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.200]  get vaccinated that's like how can you say that if the
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.360]  measles were the vaccines were effective effective you wouldn't get
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.880]  measles and to say that you're going to mandate it on everybody else because it
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.880]  didn't work on your child absolute insanity
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.640]  idiocracy maybe it's the fluoride in the water we'll be right back with your

[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.760]  hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.680]  i want to tell you about matt redhawk and his team of patriots over at my

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.080]  about how it is playing out here in texas and san francisco but of course it
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.760]  is a worldwide issue it is something that comes
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.920]  from the un it's hiding as she points out in her book behind the green mask it's
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.680]  hiding behind a mask of sustainability of
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.760]  environmentalism it's sold as now these other aspects

[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.680]  cars are going to do all that for you but of course they're going to limit
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.800]  when where how you can get around and we're going to be talking to her about
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.800]  that in the next hour and i want to take some of your calls in that hour
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.760]  about agenda 21 if you've seen some of these phony consensus meetings that are
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.000]  being proposed by stakeholders and policymakers and they
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.600]  would like for you and the community to come meet with them and
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.120]  and give them your input about this plan that they already know
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.880]  exactly what they're going to do they're just trying to use it as a
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.240]  control device it's something she talks about and exposes in her book
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.040]  so if you've had an experience like that i want to make comments about agenda
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.600]  21 then we'll take your calls in the next hour right now we're going to just
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.360]  kind of open it up for general comments let's go to patrick in florida patrick
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.080]  you were want to talk about the tsa travel restrictions we're just talking
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.560]  about yeah can you hear me yes go ahead
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.520]  great yeah i'm escaping the cold from michigan i'm down here in florida
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.320]  and i want to buy a motorcycle and we negotiated the price and we sat down
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.560]  and we're looking at the paperwork and there was a hundred ninety nine dollar
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.000]  you know admin fee and i said you know what's in that
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.240]  and the guy said well four dollars of it is what i have to pay to the tsa
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.440]  to see if you're on the no fly list and he said that he had a computer program
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.840]  where you would you know enter in my info come back
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.920]  but you're starting to break up you had to pay a fee to the tsa to see if you're
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.960]  on a no fly list before you could get a motorcycle
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.640]  that's correct it was it was buried in his administration fee but he broke down
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.040]  it he said it was forty dollars uh the one ninety nine that i was going to pay
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.560]  to get the motorcycle that he had to before he could sell it see if i was on
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.960]  the no fly list so he had a computer program
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.160]  yeah yeah it would say yes or no and then he said if it flashed red
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.880]  no that he was instructed to call the sheriff and make it an excuse to detain
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.080]  the individual until such time as the sheriff would get there and arrest him
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.080]  this is this is just beyond this is just beyond belief
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.360]  the fact that you would have to get the tsa's approval before you can buy a
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.240]  motorcycle and of course we know they put a lot of innocent people
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:22.320]  on the tsa no fly list right after i started here back in 2012 fall of 2012
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.080]  we had a guy who was flying on a military plane his wife was in the
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.040]  military who's going to meet her in japan they stranded him
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.720]  in hawaii saying that they discovered once he got to hawaii that he was on a
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.840]  no fly list and guess what you get to hawaii you can't get
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.360]  anywhere if you are on a no fly list you can wait around and try to get a
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.240]  slow boat or uh something something like that to get out of there
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.560]  but this is also a guy who had been vetted by the tsa's
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.640]  own program to uh to work as a transportation worker he'd been vetted
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.040]  by them he'd been vetted by the fbi in terms of firearms licenses
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.480]  somehow and they would never give him an explanation of course they never do
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.280]  they never say why you're on a tsa list uh no fly list and they won't take you
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.320]  off of it but this also illustrates patrick
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.240]  what we've been saying and that is that the tsa is not about
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:16.160]  airplanes it is about total control of your travel and your movement
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.960]  well it gets better are you ready for the second part go ahead yeah what they do
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.560]  yeah he said uh so we were talking about how i was going to pay for it
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.320]  and uh you know he was going to put a surcharge if i used a credit card and
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:36.960]  and uh anyways he said that if if i paid in cash more than
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.520]  $2,500 that that was also reportable to tsa
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.240]  and that the 10,000 deal is just with the irs but there's a $2,500 cash
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.560]  reporting requirement with the tsa yeah if you have cash you're a criminal
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.080]  because that takes you out of their surveillance grid
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.600]  anybody that wants to get out of the surveillance grid is automatically a
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.120]  criminal that's what's really really dangerous about this thank you so much
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.400]  patrick well that that is really amazing so what he's saying is that he had to
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.480]  pay a fee to the tsa and they were going to vet to see if he was on the no fly
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.320]  list before uh he could be he could purchase a motorcycle
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.600]  and if he was on the no fly list they had to stall him so the sheriff
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.880]  could get there and of course the tsa wants to know if you're buying anything
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.320]  with $2,500 a cash or less is this a free country or have we already
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.800]  descended into tyranny that is beyond what we can
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.720]  believe and yet most people don't even realize this i didn't know that the tsa
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.280]  was doing this for people buying vehicles stay with us we're going to be

[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.760]  transportation it's not only in the united states but
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.360]  it's also in the uk it looks like they're going to go beyond
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.360]  just these light rail corridors the next step is actually to move
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.680]  into a kind of government controlled
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.280]  grid where they take control of your car and actually drive it wherever they
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.880]  want to restricting your travel and as we just heard from a caller
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.520]  the tsa is already telling people when they they buy vehicles he was buying a
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.240]  motorcycle uh he had to pay a tax and the tsa
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.640]  looked to see if he was on a ts if he was on a no-fly list
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.200]  before he could buy a motorcycle and also if he paid more than $2,500
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.680]  that had to be reported to the tsa what do you think they're going to do when
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.880]  they control your car do you really want to see that happen and of course
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.880]  light rail has really been where the agenda 21 people have hung out
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.240]  in terms of trying to create these so-called corridors
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:42.480]  merging cities into concentrated areas for the population so they can get us
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.960]  off of the land but it's not just the trains they're going to
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.080]  be looking at self-driving cars this is an article from back in
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:55.200]  november this last november uh this was from forbes magazine
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.800]  and they were talking i'm sorry fortune magazine that said trains and self-driving
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.960]  cars are headed for a political collision and of course they say the
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.320]  promise of what they call autonomous vehicles are not autonomous they're
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.600]  part of the hive if you will when the government
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.320]  controls that i have a self-driving car right now that's not what i'm going to
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320]  have in the future they say it's becoming a popular
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:18.400]  talking point for opponents of mass transit systems as one person pointed
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.200]  out it's like they're designing the pony express
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.520]  in the world of the telegraph that's right they already know that they're
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.680]  going to roll out these so-called autonomous vehicles where they
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.120]  put all your cars on the internet of things and control them
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.640]  so why do you need light rail to go places before
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.960]  they can get these light rail projects built they're going to have
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:47.760]  the control of of your car and so basically makes it into a buggy whip
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.560]  system but of course it was never about
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.000]  transporting people these light rail issues have never been
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.880]  about mass transportation it's been about paying off corporate donors
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.640]  and we were just talking in the last half hour about the keystone pipeline
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.840]  how that shows how owned our congress is by special interest by corporate
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.560]  interest and now the senate has passed the keystone pipeline bill
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.640]  the house has already passed it nine times and so now
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.480]  the tenth time the very first order of business when they come back is to pass
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.280]  the keystone pipeline whether you're for it or not
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.120]  what it shows is just how corrupt and how driven
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.640]  by a few corporate interests our government is and it's not
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.240]  just the republicans the democrats are just as guilty they're going to push
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.440]  through the trans-pacific partnership which is also being run
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.440]  by a few corporations who want to use this as part of a kind of
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.880]  global governance they're going to put themselves on a par
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.720]  with governments when it comes to negotiating
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:53.840]  effects of their legislation they can take them to a
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.880]  arbitration effect where they have that essentially the the corporations will
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.720]  have the same power as a state and we've already seen this happen
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.320]  with NAFTA and with other trade agreements that were smaller now
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.040]  they're combining these into a global governance
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.360]  we've already seen how corporations can go to an arbitration process
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.480]  and get the taxpayers to pay them for damages because
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.040]  their profits have been hurt because of new legislation
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.680]  you don't get that kind of protection as an individual
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.360]  you don't get that kind of protection as a corporation that just does business
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.960]  within one jurisdiction it's only the giant multinational corporations that
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.840]  are going to get that and it's just part of the total corruption the
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.600]  graft the greed that we see what we call as crony capitalism of course they're
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.840]  selling that as a kind of capitalism it is not
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.080]  capitalism it's anything but but going back to this
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.520]  this trains versus self-driving cars they point out
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.360]  that the Florida governor and this is this whole story in Fortune magazine
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.200]  was about what was going on in Florida to point out Florida Governor Rick Scott
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.520]  has opposed high speed rail lines he's even rejected federal funding for a
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.160]  Tampa to Orlando high speed rail line because of course that's a trap
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.040]  the government is going to give you a little bit of the federal government
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.600]  give you a little bit of money to prime the pump and then they'll pull it back
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.520]  just like they're going to do with Obamacare but it says that conservatives
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.960]  really like this idea of autonomous vehicles
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.320]  because they don't understand it's part of the control grid we're going to be
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.480]  talking to Rosa Corey about how that's going to play out as they move from
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.480]  light rail corridors to controlling your cars before I go back to your calls
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.080]  and we'll let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones show is brought to you by
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.600]  the specials that we run at info wars life.com and the one that we got running
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.760]  right now is buy two x2 nascent iodine and you get one
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.200]  ancient defense free. Ancient defense of course is our new
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  herbal immunity formula this is a limited introductory offer
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.160]  you save $20 if you buy two nascent iodine and get that one ancient defense
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.080]  for free and of course the supplies are limited and that will be ending soon
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:01.520]  right now it's a $20 savings if you get two nascent iodine
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.040]  and one ancient defense for free and you'll find that at info wars
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.360]  life.com let's go back to your calls right now let's go to
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.160]  Ramon and Texas Ramon you're calling from 90.1 right here in austinite
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.600]  yeah yeah absolutely thanks for taking my call
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.240]  I've got a question a couple questions and then I've got
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.520]  kind of a what I'm thinking is a solution I've never really heard anybody
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.040]  talk about it but good and the questions are kind of
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.600]  simple are you do you consider yourself a human being
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:39.200]  do I yeah sure okay do you consider a robot a human being
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.000]  no do you consider a corporation a human being
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.080]  no I disagree with Mitt Romney on that okay
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.080]  do you consider like a police dog to have human rights
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:58.000]  no I don't okay so so it's pretty straightforward
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.520]  you know they're moving to a singularity and
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.560]  trying to download their consciousness into
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.680]  we're talking about the 0.001 percent or whatever
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:15.040]  into a robot the corporations are gaining more and more rights they're
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.720]  gaining human rights and essentially they want to incorporate at
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.400]  least it's my understanding or my belief or my made-up
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:25.440]  you know theory is that they want to be able to be
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.640]  in control of everything speaking of corridors they want to ship us down the
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.000]  highway like cattle in the corridor
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.680]  absolutely you know are their slaves or their chattel and as I said before you
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.080]  know it's not going to be a planet it's going to be a plantation if they have
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.760]  their way absolutely so basically here's the
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.520]  string that that ties everything that if we pull on that
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.960]  string maybe it'll unravel a good portion of it but
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:56.000]  if we were to if everyone that has
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  an agenda or a program or a voice or whatever if they're able to if we were
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.080]  able to
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:14.080]  unitedly push for legislation creating a human being as a human being as a
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.640]  genetic you know Adam and Eve I don't know
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.400]  exactly I mean I can think of a lot of things that would go into that
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.320]  and then the corporation which is pretty obvious
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.080]  is not a human being does not have rights
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:33.920]  like a human then if we were to pull that string
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.400]  and unravel it would unravel a lot of their structure and a lot of their
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.320]  laws that are allowing them to
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.960]  medicate us without permission you know to to treat us like
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.880]  animals essentially you know if you know absolutely no Ramon
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.960]  there's a lot of pervercation that goes on when they start taking our rights away
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.720]  you know one of the things is going in and playing with definitions like
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.880]  who is a human who has rights as you point out giving special rights to
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.880]  police dogs while the police will shoot your own dog
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.640]  at your house in a heartbeat even if they're mistakenly on your property
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.400]  even if the dog is no threat but if you if anything happens to a police dog
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.200]  it's treated as if you attacked a police officer so
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.600]  we have these types of things I think we really need to call them on it
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.520]  I want to talk to Hugo DeGaris we've been trying to reach him as someone who
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.880]  who has been involved in trying to create artificial brains he's very
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.320]  skeptical of the singularity and of course I am too
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:36.080]  there's absolutely no way even if you could transfer
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.200]  a copy of everything that you know into some
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.880]  machine that is not going to be you that's going to be
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.280]  a copy of you it may be a good copy it may not be a good copy
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:50.880]  who knows it might be something like multiplicity remember that movie
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.640]  from the 90s I think it was Michael Keaton he cloned himself and of course
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.360]  the clones come out exactly like him fully mature the same age that he is
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.120]  and then one of the clones makes a copy of him
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.280]  of itself and it doesn't quite it's pretty stupid
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.160]  is walking into walls and basically points out well it's kind of like you
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.960]  know when you make a copy of a copy on a photocopy or each
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.080]  successive generation you lose a little bit there
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:19.680]  regardless it gets to the point of whether or not you make a copy
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.240]  it is still not you we need to talk about what consciousness is
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.160]  how do you define consciousness it's not just about processing power when you
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.600]  talk about the multiplication of technology talk
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.240]  about Moore's law with computer processing
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.800]  doubling in power every 18 months straplating that out and saying yeah
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.440]  we're going to have the computer power to have
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.960]  self-aware machines we need to talk about what consciousness is
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.480]  but i'm really concerned about how this is going to be used
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.080]  by the technocratic elite that we were warned about by
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.080]  Eisenhower it's not just the military industrial complex of course what he
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.840]  warned us about was how how research and how the
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.280]  universities would be taken over by the military industrial
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.280]  complex and we see pretty much that they're running
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.120]  all of the research right now them and corporations like
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.120]  google and of course the potential for this even if it doesn't become a
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.520]  self-aware machine the potential for damage the potential for
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.520]  massive abuse of power using this kind of technology as a leverage
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:24.320]  is something we really ought to be concerned about and before i move on to
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.440]  the next call there was an article um that i saw not too long ago it's called
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.280]  the knowledge London's legendary taxi driver test this
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.240]  is where if you're not from the uk you don't know anything about what happens
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.560]  in london they have an incredibly complex road network there
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.200]  constantly changing names it's twisting and turning because it has evolved over
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.600]  several hundred years so the taxi drivers there had to do what they call
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.240]  do the knowledge they would get on a motorcycle and they would ride the
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:55.360]  streets of london until they had it absolutely memorized
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.760]  and they say as these taxi drivers are in the fight for their life
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.120]  against uber and gps devices they say is there an argument for learning
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.880]  as an end in and of itself and they point out
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.960]  that the posterior hippocampus known to be important for memory
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.040]  is bigger in london taxi drivers than in most people and
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.920]  successful knowledge candidates they see the hippocamp the hippocampus
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.560]  enlarge as they go through the learning process through the test
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.440]  maybe we should ask if instead of being so concerned about developing
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:35.440]  artificial intelligence maybe we should start
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.640]  developing human intelligence because the opposite is also happening
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.560]  we're also seeing our ability as humans as we can become more and more
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.640]  dependent on electronic media as we become more and more
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.480]  the vassal slaves of the technology that is supposed to serve us
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.720]  we find ourselves atrophying not only physically
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.200]  but mentally and i think that's a very dangerous thing i think we need to
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:06.000]  reserve certain areas and understand that if we make ourselves totally dependent
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.480]  on technology that's a very dangerous thing in and of itself
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:16.560]  it atrophies even our brain let's go to uh karen in arizona karen
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.080]  um i know a couple of state senators
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.480]  and and um and i called them up after they you know
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:28.640]  alex mentioned about this course at air asu
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:34.960]  hating whitey and i'm going to name his name if it's okay
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:42.640]  say senator russell pierce i called his office and i said i don't like the idea
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:48.640]  of having a course in hating whitey and they said well you know uh
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:53.360]  if he has a constitution freedom of speech and i said yes
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.800]  but what this is is about teaching hate
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:02.640]  and and i said there's a difference so people you got to call state
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.960]  representative russell pierce and really hold their line on
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:12.800]  and uh you know and tell them you know this there's there's a fine line in
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.800]  freedom of speech but there's also a fine line i said if
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.680]  you know what if they have a course hating black you know blacks
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.640]  that i said there would be an uprising uh as you know you know what so they
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.360]  said well we're going to we're going to send a letter
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:38.160]  a letter and uh concerning this course and i thought
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:44.800]  you know we got it i says no we have to defend this course
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.840]  well you know that the universities have for quite some time
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  the entire education system of course is a part of a
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.080]  control grid to manipulate the way people think of things and that this is
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.600]  something that's been going on i saw elements of this when i was in college
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.000]  20 30 years ago how long has it been now maybe it was longer than that
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.880]  but uh it's definitely longer than 20 years ago
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.480]  30 40 years maybe anyway i saw elements of that when i was there
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.320]  there was a lot of there was definitely an agenda that's being put out to people
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.240]  and of course we've talked about this extensively but this is just yet one
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.600]  more example of how they try to use divide and
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.720]  conquer and of course speech that is directed towards white people can be
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.360]  very hateful and not tolerated by against any other minority group it's
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.320]  something that we need to look out for but anybody that
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:41.200]  has a kid in college you really need to be aware of this you really need to
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.800]  talk to your kids make sure they're grounded before you send them
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:47.600]  to a college because they're going to come after their faith
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:52.080]  they're going to come after their understanding of the way the world works
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.320]  they have a socialist agenda that is going to be also a racist
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.840]  agenda that they're going to try to incorporate into that thank you so much
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.800]  karen and yeah people need to be aware of that and try to talk to your
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.280]  representatives about it but personally i gave up on the college system a long
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.720]  time ago uh let's go to uh john and california john
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.040]  uh david um i want to approach this subject about
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:25.360]  how to restore the republic we tried the ballot box in 2008 and 2012
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:30.720]  the latest crop of republican legislators that have come into the senate
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.400]  have almost immediately renounced their tea party roots
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.400]  because they were told to do so by the leaders
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.000]  and uh there's only one way we're going to avoid civil war
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.760]  and that is to have a counter coup against the foreign offshore banks that
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.280]  have taken control of our country and the military
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:57.280]  must intervene as soon as possible and arrest the entire leadership
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.640]  of the house in the senate as well as the president
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.880]  well the problem is i think that you've got an information war that you need to
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.360]  fight i think there's also possibilities of peaceful resolution of this
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.760]  at the state level we've seen uh some positive signs out west at the state
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.680]  level we have some good representatives if they will exercise their control
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.280]  i think we haven't done anything at the jury box you know you got not only the
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.600]  ballot box and the cartridge box you've also got the jury box where you can
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.400]  exercise power that's a very effective place
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.680]  to shut down laws that are out of control i understand
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.520]  that washington is totally taken over by criminals but i and i
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.520]  basically am not looking for some savior to get elected as president or even as
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.040]  a senator or as a congressman we have a few good senators a few good
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.240]  congressman not enough to make a difference i think we have to work
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.840]  outside the system i'm not ready to see it go violent
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.800]  and yet i think there's too many things that we need to do we need to build a
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.000]  much larger consensus if we have a large consensus we can do it
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.880]  peacefully stay with us we'll be right back

[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:36.160]  open lines in terms of any subject let's go to
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:40.240]  jim and kinetica you said you want to talk about fluoride
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.600]  yeah good afternoon how you doing today you're fine go ahead
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:47.680]  all right yeah i wanted to talk about fluoride um i'm with uh we are changed
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:51.840]  kinetica and i actually did a two-year campaign in the city of waterberry
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:55.360]  and i actually we actually get our forex from both day crop
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.040]  nutrition also i was actually talking to the chemist down there for a couple
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.640]  days so she realized what my agenda was but i actually pulled an foia report
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.280]  from the city of waterberry on what the test of the fluoride is before it's
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.040]  administered into the water and i already know this
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.120]  and the report led in arsenic was in the fluoride
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.720]  and like you said before the reason why is how they get the fluoride is that's
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.240]  how they scrub and and produce the phosphate
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.160]  yes for their you know for the crops and all that beautiful jazz so
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.760]  you know it's it's funny how i went through a big huge campaign in the city
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.680]  of waterberry and i actually had a newspaper meet with me
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.280]  um with an alderman and they had to do a huge
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:44.080]  damage report a couple weeks later about what i did you know it's interesting
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.560]  when you look at the situation in dallas where they talked about it for a
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.360]  year and that last minute they they pulled out they didn't cover
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:53.120]  they didn't uh they didn't stop the fluoridation of the water
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.280]  it largely broke down on the word of dentists
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:00.240]  versus the people who were there against fluoride and they said well just
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:02.400]  because a dentist says it doesn't mean you should do it so
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.800]  when they get into that kind of an argument they're going to lose that
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.240]  argument because the people of town council if they don't know what's going
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.520]  on if they really aren't doing it because they're being paid to do it if
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.040]  there's some question about it you're going to lose that kind of an argument
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  i think you need to take it from the standpoint of what you did doing a
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.720]  freedom of information request looking at the contents of what they're
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.400]  actually putting in pointing out that it is a very hazardous substance
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:30.000]  we had people here at info wars before i ever came on board went down to the
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  city of austin took pictures secretly of the fluoride container
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.320]  that was being dumped into the water supply here it was a class 4 toxin they
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.520]  had it marked on the tank and you could see the
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.960]  corrosion on the pipes it was absolutely amazing
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:50.880]  that's what you need to focus on this is harmful you can see that it's harmful
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.320]  this is not even the fluoride that you'd be given as a supplement and then talk
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.440]  about do you really want to try to mass medicate people
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.200]  through the water supply is that an effective way to do it
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.480]  how do you control the dosage well the simple fact is you can't control the
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:07.840]  dosage and you shouldn't be force medicating people
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.360]  with anything it's not a harmless thing no medication is
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:15.200]  you have to watch what you take regardless of whether it is something
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:18.400]  that is very dangerous you can take too much of anything
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.080]  so you don't have any way to control the dosage when you dump it in the water
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.520]  supply you certainly don't have any way to protect the children
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:28.400]  thank you so much jim i hope you get it out of the water there and the
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.920]  water barrier are they still still working on that or what's the how did
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.200]  that turn out oh he's gone okay sorry uh let's go to
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.160]  nick in california nick you also want to talk about fluoride near

[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.640]  fluoride i'm living near washington hill hello javin
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.560]  hey there yes go ahead um in washington bill
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:53.840]  we they voted against us a new system to put

[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show on david night your host we're going to be
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.080]  joined in the next segment by rosa quarry talking about her book behind the
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:34.000]  green mask u n agenda 21 we're going to be talking about the
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.960]  travel aspects a good deal and how they build consensus is where
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.800]  we just had a situation here locally in texas but of course
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:45.920]  this is something that is global you're going to see this
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.440]  everywhere not just in texas not just in the united states
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:55.200]  everywhere this is a u n agenda sold as environmentalism i think it's
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.920]  interesting to look at the news uh out of new york this
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:02.000]  failed uh snow storm that they had that was
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.920]  predicted to dump quite a bit more snow than actually got
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.160]  now they paid 200 million dollars just in new york city
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:16.400]  for 7 000 troops 760 plows 50 000 pounds of salt but even more importantly
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:20.160]  they shut down public transportation subway systems and trains
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:25.360]  the first time they ever did that it wasn't because this is going to be a
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.400]  storm of historic proportions it was going to be a big storm but not of
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.280]  historic proportions this says more about the nanny state
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.520]  that we live in than anything else the fact that for the first time in new
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.480]  york history and i don't know how long they've had the subway it's been over 100 years
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.920]  that they would shut down the subway the subway
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:49.680]  for a snow storm you need to think about how these politicians are going over
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.200]  the top how they're using weather anything a
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  measles outbreak to try to sell their control grid to you look at the
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.880]  agenda that they're pushing forward here if they can't predict the weather
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.080]  accurately they can't predict climate change
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:08.880]  accurately and we've seen that even as co2 has risen we haven't seen the
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:12.080]  rise commensurate with that and temperature that they had predicted
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:15.680]  we haven't seen a rise in humidity that they predicted that's a key part of
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:20.240]  that and nowhere in any of their models have we seen
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.560]  a 20 year pause in global warming which is what they're telling us now and of
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:27.920]  course global warming is such a joke in terms of the actual
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:31.680]  measurements that they have to now call it climate change
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.200]  but we have to be very careful because they were very close
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:39.760]  in terms of admitting the the senate just admitted to try to get keystone
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.120]  push through they would do anything this is a tenth time they've tried to push
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:46.160]  us through they would do or say anything and so they
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:50.240]  said climate change is real they said that doesn't really
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.960]  matter because of course the weather is changing all the time they tried to pull
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.160]  it back they're a little bit too clever with their
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.040]  winks and their nods they only missed by one vote
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.640]  saying that there was real climate change and it was made by humans
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:08.080]  once they do that all bets are off they can put on a carbon tax which is money
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.480]  that the government is going to collect on you they're going to put that on
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.400]  while oil prices energy prices are low then
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:18.320]  leave it on and then raise it and they also want to have
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:21.920]  carbon credits which basically is nothing but an indulgence that you pay
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.400]  to private corporations run by algor so that you can engage in activity because
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.040]  every activity that you engage in is going to be something that uses
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.680]  energy or produces something like carbon dioxide because when you breathe out
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:38.800]  you are using carbon dioxide so you're going to have to pay for the privilege
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:42.560]  to these corporate masters that's the way they're trying to sell this
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:45.680]  you should back off from this alarmism and of course we're going to talk to
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:48.400]  rosa quarry and we're going to take your calls after we talk to her right now
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.760]  when i open up the phone lines to just random calls let's go to john in

[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.960]  united states being involved in any wars because as we know
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:32.000]  i'd say three of the last three wars in american history are based on lies so
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.280]  these people i don't know if they're feminist i don't know if they're just

[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.240]  and we have joining us now in this segment rosa
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:51.600]  forry she is executive director of the post
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:55.120]  sustainability institute what does she say post
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.120]  sustainability well she's written a book behind the green mask you in agenda 21
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.280]  showing us exactly what is agenda 21 how they
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.120]  use tricks to make people think that they are part of the solution that
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.760]  they're doing something good something sustainable
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:16.240]  it's a very deceptive mask that they wear it's something that has been
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.760]  worked out a technique these ran corporation meetings have been
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.080]  worked out in great detail i contacted her because we had a
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.600]  one of these come to my house here in texas
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.640]  talking about the lone star regional rail project is one of their
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.320]  one of the aspects of what they do to improve mobility
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:41.040]  mode choice accessibility transportation reliability who could be opposed to
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.280]  that and they say well one option that could be studied is to provide
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:48.720]  passenger rail service from the north of austin to
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.440]  downtown san antonio that's not just one option that they're going to look at
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.000]  that is the only option they're going to look at
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.760]  they're bringing you there to sell you on that option to make you think that
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.520]  you're a part of that and so breaking that down with us is going to be rosa
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.120]  quarry and of course as i mentioned she's a commercial real estate appraiser
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.160]  she specialized in imminent domain valuation maybe we should talk to her
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.720]  a little bit about her take on the keystone project
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.000]  imminent domain aspects of that but anyway it
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.240]  working as an appraiser it says enabled her to recognize
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.240]  what was going on in a planning revolution that was sweeping the country
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.800]  and she pulled back and got the bigger picture and of course
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:30.960]  she's been working in the san francisco area for the california department of
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.080]  transportation so the transportation aspect of this
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.240]  is is very key thank you for joining us rosa
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.280]  hi david great to be with you some of the people are starting to wake up the
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.200]  word is getting out there of course you've been someone who was
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:50.320]  one of the people sounding the alarm about this doing
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:53.760]  i think one of the best jobs of educating people about agenda 21 we see
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.920]  that there's several state bills that are aimed directly
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:01.440]  at nullifying agenda 21 we've got one in wyoming
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:05.760]  there's one in missouri there's one in washington state that's good news that
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.480]  those bills have been introduced don't you think
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:13.040]  what i see is that people are becoming aware and this is our most powerful you
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:16.240]  know if you consider yourself part of the resistance
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.040]  in order resistance is an action and so of course this is what's really
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:24.320]  happening is that people are making inroads and
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.960]  getting this information out letting people understand what it is what agenda
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:34.080]  21 looks like locally and i actually retired i was a district
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.920]  branch chief for the department of transportation i retired about three
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.120]  years ago so that i could go around the country and the
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.800]  world talking about this to help people understand
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.200]  how this global plan is actually implemented locally
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:53.440]  that's what we need to see is that even though it's a global
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:58.880]  international huge plan it's put together locally so that it gives the
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.240]  impression it's you the impression that it's just
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.480]  local that it's all just some little thing there in
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.720]  elgin or bass drop or wherever you are in texas and that it's not
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.160]  the same plan all over the world which it is these plans are all
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.760]  dental all over the world that's the key thing
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.920]  penetrating the secrecy and exposing the trick because it's like a magician's
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:26.000]  trick you know they can spell bind you by doing all these illusions on stage if
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.160]  you understand what the trick is it's lost its magic and i think it's very
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.240]  important to expose that to pull off the mask a good example if the guys can get
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.880]  a a shot of this i'll leave it here on the desk
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.120]  that you'll see something like this flyer that we got saying your participation
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.800]  is needed please join us in a public meeting and learn more about the
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:49.280]  lone star regional rail project that's what you're going to see in your area
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.520]  you're going to see something like that come in the mail they're going to want
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.360]  get you there with the quote-unquote stakeholders and talk about possible
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:01.120]  solutions but they got it all worked out don't they rosa before you even get there
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:05.600]  yeah the deal is that um these are your government meetings i'm not talking
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.640]  about your city council meeting or something like that these are you know
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.960]  just like you said david these are plans uh you know this is your central texas
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.120]  region um this is the plan is designed to destroy
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.920]  jurisdictional boundaries so you're going to actually lose the nation state
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:26.640]  your your national government and become you know collection of mega regions
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.640]  so this is the process of doing it and there you are in central texas
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:36.960]  so the plan is really to um to provide money for high speed rail or you know
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.800]  light rail so that it can justify getting you out of your car and into the
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:48.880]  high density concentrated city center and it may be a holding town a
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:52.240]  temporary town that'll then you know be uh you'll
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:57.200]  then later be moved into a larger city but the idea is that um you know you're
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:00.880]  going to think this is all your idea you're so smart you came up with this
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:06.320]  plan all on your own and uh in fact the plan's the same plan all over the
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.880]  world certainly all over the us and um it's about
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:15.280]  indoctrinating you it's about propagandizing you so that you will not
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.040]  dissent because this plan does not allow for any
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.760]  dissent but gender 21 sustainable development is about neutralizing
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:27.600]  the opposition and propagandizing the populace
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.200]  so that you are pacified and don't take action
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.200]  against it yes speak a little bit about exactly how that's going to be broken
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.800]  down broken down at a meeting because the ran corporation has worked this out
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:42.640]  into an exact science and they've practiced this over and over again
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.080]  just like the magicians trick where they say hey pick pick a card any card
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:49.120]  they know what you're going to pick they offer you the card they they want you to
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.760]  take talk a little bit about how this works in these
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.480]  ran corporation design meetings yeah this is actually quite cool um
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:00.160]  you know you have to certainly give them credit because they have thought this
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:04.240]  through and it's very well engineered and if you're not paying attention
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.240]  and you're not uh you know hip you're you're gonna get sucked right into this
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:11.280]  thing and especially i have to say if you're just like
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:14.800]  sitting at home you know not going to these meetings
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:18.560]  you're certainly not going to be making uh you know a resistance if you don't
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.520]  know what's happening right there in the center of your town
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:25.440]  so what you get is yeah come on down give us your opinion on this cool
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:30.320]  plan for the you know development of this exciting thing about the development
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:33.520]  of uh you know the center of your town so you go there
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:39.040]  and they have it set up so that um i i describe this really fully in my book
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:42.480]  and i show you how to anti-delphi these meetings
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:46.480]  delphi technique is about giving groups of people
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.080]  the impression that what they're seeing and what they're participating in
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.920]  is all their idea while directing them to a predetermined outcome
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:02.880]  that they literally you literally have no impact on that thing is all typed up
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.200]  printed up set up ready to go before you walk in the door
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:10.800]  and they may you know change the color of the park benches or something
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:15.120]  but they're not going to change that plan and this is the way it's designed
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.400]  to give people an idea i look on the back of this flyer and it says the purpose
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:21.920]  of this meeting is we're going to define the purpose and identify the needs
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:25.200]  of the proposed project could address including lack of transportation
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.280]  options we're going to allow the public to learn more
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.480]  about the history of the proposed project we're going to identify issues
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:34.240]  that should be studied including regional air quality and natural resources
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:37.840]  and we're going to give you the opportunity to tell us how the proposed
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:41.280]  project could address your transportation needs
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.240]  oh yeah i'm going to go in and i'm going to tell these people exactly what i
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.720]  need and they're going to custom design for me rosa
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.160]  a light rail transportation system that's going to exactly match my needs
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.080]  aren't they oh yeah and you know let's say you
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.200]  go in there david and you're just you know real contrarian and you go you
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:01.600]  know what i really dig my car i think i like driving my car
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:05.440]  yeah and they're going to go uh-huh right and next you know they don't want to
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:08.720]  hear anything it does not go right along with the idea
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.920]  that you're going to be living in a condo on top of a shop
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.320]  smart growth in the center of your transit oriented development town
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:20.160]  which got funding from the federal government to put on that meeting that
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:24.960]  you're being indoctrinated in 3.7 million dollars david and
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.040]  HUD funds went to central texas some of it went to elgin
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:32.400]  and that's the meeting you're talking about in order to
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.560]  in order to implement this plan and this is all across the united states every
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.200]  every year hud gives out a hundred million bucks
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:42.880]  to to little you know areas so that they'll use these
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.600]  indoctrination techniques on the people and yes you're not going to give
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:51.280]  you're not going to be given any other options and if you don't like it you
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:54.800]  know this is what you have to do you've got to take those meetings down
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:18:01.280]  and we show you i in that book behind the green mask my book there's 20 pages
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:04.720]  in the back of the book and what to do and it's a narrow small book
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:09.360]  and part of that is the real in-depth focus on how to take down a delphi
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.440]  meeting it's very exciting it's a lot of fun to do it
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.440]  and you can really send these guys packing just take them right out of your
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.480]  town that's an excellent book and we all need to get
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:23.600]  active at a large part of this of course as we said the very beginning
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:27.440]  is an education process we say a lot of people understand that that's why we've
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:30.640]  got bills being introduced and state legislatures
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.920]  the three states that i mentioned a good source to find out what's going on
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:36.800]  with that is of course rosa quarry's website she's got a blog
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:41.280]  democrats against unagenda21.com you can find that information there
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.760]  of course some of those articles i was reading were from the 10th amendment
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.560]  center you mentioned hey i really dig my car and you know i really do dig
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.840]  driving one of the things though that i think is on the head
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.440]  on the horizon right now is taking over the cars and i think there's even
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:01.200]  going to be competition with these light rail projects of course they'll still
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.240]  fund the light rail projects because it's not even a never been about
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.520]  transportation it's always been about paying off corporate donors but before
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:11.120]  they even get these light rail projects built i think they're going to have a
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:16.400]  control grid imposed upon our cars talk about that a little bit
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.240]  yeah well part of that i mean just you know the initial thing was on star
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.440]  which you know a lot of your vehicles have that where they can literally be
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.160]  shut off remotely from another location in other words let's say somebody
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.920]  suppose that the deal is that somebody rips you off takes your car
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:37.520]  and you report it stolen and the car can be shut off remotely and disabled
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.280]  but but what these you know this is a real
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.840]  great indicator that you should not be an early adopter of technology
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.360]  yeah because we're getting here hang on we're going to explore that a little bit
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:53.120]  more with rosa quarry author of behind the green mask you an agenda 21 we've

[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:14.320]  david knight and we have joining us on the phone
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:17.200]  rosa quarry author of behind the green mask
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.960]  un agenda 21 we were talking in the last segment
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.040]  about how managed this whole process is when they come into your
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:27.920]  areas they just came into the area where i live
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.600]  saying we'd like for you to come to a meeting to talk about how we can
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:34.160]  help you with your transportation needs to make this
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:39.440]  area more sustainable they always use the green mask of sustainability
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:44.560]  rosa quarry worked as a real estate specialist and she recognized what was
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:47.200]  going on with this and here's where the magic is she
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.600]  recognized that it wasn't something that was just going on
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:53.600]  in her area because i always like to say this is just something that's happening
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:56.560]  locally and we want your input at the meeting
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:01.040]  no this is something that has been preplanned they have a very
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:04.560]  specific way they sell this to the public and these
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.080]  ran corporation controlled meetings these delphi meetings
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:12.800]  she speaks about that in her book about how they try to manipulate you and how
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:15.680]  you can shut that process down and we're going to take some of your calls
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:19.200]  in the next segment we've got some people who want to talk to you about that
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.240]  rosa and we're going to take calls in the next segment
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:25.680]  to rosa about agenda 21 any issues that you're concerned with
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.960]  we had just started talking about how they've been selling this as part of
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.800]  light rail they a key part of this of course is going to be transportation
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:39.520]  because they want to keep you in concentrated areas they don't want you
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:43.200]  spread out over the country they want to control the food supply they want to
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.600]  control travel that's one of the ways they're
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:48.480]  going to do it is by controlling transportation of course and so
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:50.640]  they've been selling these light rail projects but
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.080]  rosa before these things are even going to come online they're going to have a
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:58.320]  control grid of cars we already see articles going back
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:01.760]  a few months where people are starting to put this together and say hey
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:05.600]  these light rail projects are going to come up against competition with
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.440]  quote unquote autonomous cars they're not autonomous they're all rigged into
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:13.200]  the government where they're going to control where how and when you can drive
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.280]  in the cities and they're saying that putting in these light rail systems
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:20.400]  is kind of like designing a pony express in the world of the telegraph
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:23.120]  i think before they even get these light rail systems done they're going to
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.520]  have this control grid over our highways in place don't you
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  well if you look at the whole overall picture it's about destroying your
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:34.880]  economy and so light rail is a great way to do it because
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.280]  it really costs a lot of money it's not that functional it's very seldom used
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.840]  and it's really uh it's a hugely expensive project
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:48.160]  when you know that agenda 21 is about inventory and controlling
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:53.360]  everything on the planet and about full globalization which is really
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:57.120]  standardizing all of your systems and that's done through
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:00.560]  computers then you see how the computerization of your
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.000]  movement of your travel of your ability to be
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.160]  free is is actually tying right in with the plan
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.680]  because you know i mean of course if you look at this in a nightmare scenario
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.000]  you get into your um you know your computer controlled vehicle
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.440]  the doors lock and you know who knows where you're going to go after that you
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:22.480]  may not go where you think you're going just like minority report we've already
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.760]  seen that acted out in hollywood they they predicted that for to show us
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:29.760]  exactly what that's going to look like i know in fact you know i really don't
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:33.760]  uh view popular culture that much i think it's a big waste of time but one thing
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:37.760]  that you do see is that these guys do write the scenarios for the plan
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.920]  that's right and so but one thing that you're going to see
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.480]  with you know this this is a corporate plan it's a mega corporation plan
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.800]  so it's a neo-futile fascist Machiavellian plan
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.880]  to actually restrict your ability to move freely throughout the world
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.200]  it indoctrinates you through your educational system and your entertainment
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:02.640]  system and it also it's selling you and
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.400]  propagandizing you on the cool new technology of the
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:09.680]  future so that you will want to be an early
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:12.400]  adopter i mean if i was going to if i told you
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:15.760]  that the government was going to force you to hold in your hand
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.840]  a device that tells where you are at all times and what you're thinking about
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.160]  what you're doing and who you're hanging out with
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:28.240]  there's no way you would do that but instead you actually pay for it you've
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:32.880]  got your hand i don't have one it's very inconvenient yes but you
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  know what refuse to collaborate with this plan you do not
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.120]  have to be part of this plan rosa you know there was a there were some slides
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:44.560]  that were leaked as part of the snowden documents
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.080]  not quite a year ago in germany and they showed exactly
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:51.360]  that thing they showed some slides from the nsa
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:56.080]  and they had a picture of steve jobs and the 1984 commercial behind him was when
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.920]  they introduced the macintosh and said who would have thought in 1984
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:04.800]  and then in the next slide you see steve jobs holding an iphone
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:08.400]  and the caption is that this would be big brother and then you see
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.400]  the next slide you've got people queued up at the apple store and they say
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:16.560]  and the people would wait in line to pay for it themselves
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.000]  so that's they understand exactly what that is and when we look at this control
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.720]  grid these self-driving cars that they're
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:26.080]  selling to everybody you need to understand that this is a combination
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:30.000]  of the nsa and the tsa at the very least
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.400]  the worst aspects of both of those spying on you controlling your movements
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.880]  looking at everything that you're doing hang on we got to go to a commercial
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:40.320]  break we're going to come back with rosa quarry behind the green mask you in
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:43.920]  agenda 21 and we're going to take some of your calls for her asking about what

[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.960]  have you ever been to a meeting or you just have questions about how this
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:20.560]  would be done to shut it down
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:26.240]  um how's it going there david this is a fascinating subject for me i was a
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:31.040]  formerly a county commissioner in spokane county here in washington state
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:37.600]  and in 1999 i was overseeing a cemetery renewal project in the mylon
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:40.960]  district and i noticed these guys playing in the creek
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.040]  and uh... they had white suits on such i didn't pay much attention
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:48.400]  the next day they were back the next day they were in the creek
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.080]  the same creek but a little farther away at um at a
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:57.600]  at a bridge i stopped and asked them what was going on they were very evasive
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.000]  and uh... that got my uh... curiosity peak
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.040]  then um i was in the process at at that time of looking for land
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:12.960]  because i was going to build a new home and um i i ran into these people two or
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:16.320]  three times finally once in the deep woods up north of spokane
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:21.760]  county underray county and uh... this time
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:25.920]  they were clearly agitated at me asking questions they had some fellow with them
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:29.840]  in a brown uh... suit and and he had a gun and
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:33.680]  when i walked up on them at otter creek in the middle of the woods he pulled a
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.600]  gun on me and told me to get out of there and i said hey i'm just
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:40.720]  i'm friendly i'm i'm a county commissioner
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:44.320]  i'm just curious i keep running into you guys what's going on
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.320]  and he says you get out of here or you're gonna wish you had
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:52.320]  now the trucks that they were in had no tags on them they had no insignias on
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:55.760]  their uniforms so i thought to dig into this a
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:00.480]  little bit deeper come to find out they were from golder and associates in
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:04.080]  toronto they were doing an in-stream study that's
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:07.360]  growth management smart growth agenda 21
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:12.320]  and um then we started the envisioning process where
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:15.600]  they had these meetings just like rosa's talking about
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:20.000]  all over the area every and they were having them in the firehouses
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.400]  well after i had dug into this i found the silver bullet to shut these
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:28.320]  meetings down there's a there's a publication by the
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:32.640]  epa and here's the number of the publication now
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:37.200]  bear in mind that this publication is printed with us tax dollars
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:44.560]  this is epa dash two three one dash r dash zero four
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:50.480]  dash zero zero two well what does this look
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:57.920]  literally lays out the entire process and the program of how to conduct these
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:02.960]  envisioning meetings how to create the appearance of consensus
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:08.640]  how to sway public opinion they create all these stupid little games that you
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:14.720]  play in these meetings and then i also used the the
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.880]  diaprax anti-method which is to not play into their
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:25.600]  invented vocabulary and so forth it got so bad i showed up at every one of
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.280]  these meetings i pulled this book out it's a very nice
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:33.360]  thick book and it tells in detail exactly how to
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:37.760]  conduct these meetings and trick the people and exposing their playbook
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:42.640]  and pulling about the curtain these people mostly older people mostly
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:46.160]  elderly the average age was about 70 in these rooms
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.040]  and and and in one meeting i had one man looked like an intelligent guy
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:56.240]  actually started crying and he goes but we've got so much
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:01.920]  time invested in this hundreds of hours and i said you have been tricked
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:04.880]  yeah that's very important let me get the rosa's comments on that rosa your
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:10.080]  comments on what he just told us yeah the epa is definitely if you go to
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:13.840]  smart growth america um epa is a partner
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.800]  in nonprofits with nonprofits your government is partnering with nonprofits
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:24.560]  and corporations to manage these meetings all across the united states
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:28.240]  and these plans are directed they do have
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:32.400]  playbooks where they actually design the meetings with consultants
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:36.240]  and their plans are all designed the same way they're all the consultants
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:41.280]  are all managing everyone the same way these meetings are across the nation
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:46.880]  and there are ways you can take them down yes it is possible to stop these
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:49.920]  meetings and it is what this what the plans are
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:53.200]  all about is about destroying your private property rights
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:57.920]  they're a obstacle to the plans so uh of course you're going to have
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:01.840]  multinationals on your land talking about how they're going to develop it
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.760]  use it utilize your uh your mineral rights your
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:09.920]  your land rights your water rights and take them away from individual property
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:13.680]  owners that's what the goal is is to get you off the land
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.440]  into the cities away from the property that you can use
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:23.520]  absolutely um yes you know you can uh equally produces these playbooks the
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.960]  epa produces them uh consultants have them
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:30.320]  and the point is is how to take down these meetings
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:34.720]  how to block them how to stop them and that is powerful you can do it
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.480]  absolutely it's all about informing people it's an information war
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:41.440]  once people see the trick once you pull back the curtain
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:44.160]  it really takes the power out of what they're doing
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.160]  uh thank you john uh let's go to uh dominick in california dominick go
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:52.160]  ahead uh hey david uh hi roza
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:56.160]  hi how you doing go ahead what's your uh comment on agenda 21
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:59.440]  yeah um i started a show called kim chasers
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.520]  and we uh follow around the kim trail jets and show how they turn into clouds
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:07.600]  and cover whole cities and uh we just did an episode out in
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.800]  tahoe where we showed there was no snow the lake had
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:18.000]  went down about four feet and there was kim trail flights going over every
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.160]  mountain that should have snow so uh i want to say this drought is going to
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:26.560]  be bad and i want to ask roza um is this the first
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.720]  the start of rewilding america and are these kim trail flights
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:35.760]  uh agenda 21 related well there's a lot you know there's certainly a lot of
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:39.680]  speculation on what this is about what's up there how are you know
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:43.040]  if whether this is part of the heart program what's happening
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:47.360]  um what you need to know though is that um
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.480]  whether you know whether there's a so-called emergency of drought or
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:55.440]  whatever the design is to create a culture of emergency
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:00.160]  and to keep you in a position where you are not able to think clearly and
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.200]  rationally and this is of course enforced in your
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:06.960]  educational system that's about you know just responding to things
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:10.880]  emotionally rather than thinking about objective reality
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:14.720]  so what you need to do is to recognize what your participation
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.360]  in the plan is and how it is that you can withdraw your support
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:24.800]  from the plan so it's very important to educate yourself to become more
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:29.440]  informed to find out what is happening exactly
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.440]  in your town locally because you know i'm sure you feel right now that you have
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:37.520]  no impact on uh on the congress you have no impact on the senate
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:42.480]  no impact on the president but you do have some still some control
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:47.760]  on your local government and so uh you know regardless of what's happening
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:52.000]  around you you can have some impact locally and
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.920]  this is what you want to do is focus in locally go
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:59.600]  and observe your elected officials let them know you're
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.840]  observing them find out what the plans are for your town
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:08.480]  because this plan is a huge very pervasive plan
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.400]  and it's very powerful it involves your educational system health care
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.080]  the law enforcement system your food production
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.080]  every aspect of your lives is covered by this plan so you want to
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:24.160]  take action by becoming aware and make others
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:28.320]  aware as well the plan is dependent on you being passive
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:32.320]  and ignorant so anything you want to inform yourself on
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.000]  is a very powerful thing i encourage you to take
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.560]  action and really be the resistance actually you know too if you inform
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:43.280]  yourself and you come in there understanding what this is about
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:48.000]  with the power to expose this plan you're in a very powerful situation as an
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.600]  activist is one of the few places where i think you really can have a big impact
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.840]  another one is on juries one person on a jury can shut this whole thing down
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.440]  we can go to one of these meetings and you can expose their plans
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:03.920]  and you can show exactly how this is a trick and expose that trick let's go
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:08.000]  to uh george and connecticut go ahead george
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.440]  hi rosa i'm just curious uh how do you uh
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.120]  sift out they try to put this under several different names you can i can
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:19.360]  find out like the agenda 21 is is uh directed at my particular
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.120]  town stanford connecticut uh i know that a lot of things
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.160]  are going on because when i tried to push certain things
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.960]  uh police came to my door and said get the hell out of the way
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:34.240]  otherwise we're going to kill you and your family so you start to wonder
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:37.520]  you know how far these these these thugs going to push this stuff
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.200]  but you can't find out any details outside of that they that were under
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:45.280]  agenda 21 you know and then they don't want to supply
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:49.440]  proper information there actually is a tremendous

[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:00.640]  ahead a great show david hey rosa yeah back in about 2010
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:04.960]  we my wife and i just caught wind of uh one of these sustainable development
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:10.160]  meetings being held here in noxville and our kind of bag work and went down there
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:13.280]  sat in it was just what you're talking about it was it was blunt county which
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:16.400]  is lamar alexander's county which is next to nox county
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:19.440]  so they held it up in noxville so they get more people there i guess
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:22.480]  but all through this i'm sitting there and there's a guy from the fed that's
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:26.320]  in there looks like some character out of a bad dick tracy
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:30.720]  strip comic strip sitting there and he's a fed guy there at the end of it i'd
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:35.040]  written agenda 21 on my notebook that i took in took in there and after the last
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:38.240]  guy said you know thank you for coming i stood up at

[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:49.760]  beautiful good for you man you need to do
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:54.320]  yes that's exactly what you need to do and you know this is the elimination of
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:58.480]  the nation's state this is the goal it's the erection of a totalitarian
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:01.280]  corporatocracy and that seems like something is so
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:05.600]  out there but really it's right there in noxville it's right there in your town
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:08.960]  this is how it's done through regionalization
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:14.080]  and you know and the plan is developed in order to make this possible
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:17.440]  that is a powerful thing to do to have the guts
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:21.120]  to stand up there and say hey this is agenda 21
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:26.080]  look it up people check it out this is how it's done this is what it looks like
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.440]  because you're never going to see it called agenda 21
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:32.240]  you're going to see it called climate action plan
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:37.600]  or vision 2020 or envision noxville or whatever it is they're going to call it
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:42.160]  and that's what you need to do it's call it out give out flyers as you're standing
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:46.240]  at the door as people are leaving bring you know i teach you how to
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.520]  anti-ideal by the meeting when you go in there with your friends you don't want
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:52.480]  to identify your friends you don't want to stand with them
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:56.000]  you don't want to talk with them you want to see them through the meeting so
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.760]  that when you raise your hand and you say hey this something's not right here
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:03.520]  they can support you without looking like they are connected to you
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:08.640]  this this is war and this is war absolutely it's very much like
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.640]  very much like going into a jury situation when you know what a jury is
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:15.840]  for you know that it's there to not only judge the facts of the case but
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:18.800]  whether or not the law is right if you show your hand
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:22.400]  they're going to just throw you off of the jury so you have to be wise about
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:26.720]  how you expose this and rosa lays this out for you the
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:30.800]  steps to proceed understand that they win when they keep everything secret
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:34.240]  that's why they're negotiating a trans-pacific partnership the
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:37.840]  transatlantic trade partnerships they're negotiating those completely in
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:40.560]  secret because they don't want you to see any of this
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:43.440]  that's the way the republicans and the democrats
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:46.640]  all pass their bills anymore they don't even let the congressmen see what's
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:48.000]  there they say we're going to have to pass it
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.800]  before we can find out what's in it and we're going to put this
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:53.840]  thousand page bill this 2000 page bill we're going to give you
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.200]  less than 24 hours to look at it but we want you to sign it because if you
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:01.280]  don't your career on Capitol Hill is over it works with intimidation
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:05.120]  it works with secrecy so you can expose the secrecy
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:08.640]  pull back the mystique of all of this if you understand what's there
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.480]  she has a great way to expose it let's go to uh daniel and florida daniel go
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:17.200]  ahead hi rosa uh i couldn't help but how many i'm in
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.040]  southeast florida and they're building something called all aboard florida

[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.720]  to beef up a rail system along the east coast that will not even be high speed
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.440]  nobody along the east coast wants this but they're going to be uh doing
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.240]  and i've went to one of these meetings it's a joke you can't believe it they uh
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:49.840]  you got people in suits standing around that are apparently we got to go to
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:53.040]  commercial break but they're not even going to have that finished before it's
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:54.880]  obsolete we're going to talk about that with rosa
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:59.360]  quarry right after the break stay with us more calls about agenda 21

[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:10.720]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:14.160]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david and we're talking to rosa quarry
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:18.240]  author of behind the green mask u n agenda 21
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.320]  rosa it seems to me like this is very much a
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:25.040]  something that they sell to democrats that's why i think is important your
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.040]  website is democrats against u n agenda 21.com
[02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:31.600]  democrats want to hear about sustainability that's why you talk
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:36.560]  about it being behind the green mask yet this is a secret plan for corporate
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.640]  control about bankrupting you about controlling you
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:44.000]  i think in the same way that so many republicans
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.520]  are hoodwinked by the trans-pacific partnership of the transatlantic
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:51.040]  partnership because in that secret agreement they see that as
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:54.880]  something that's going to be about free trade or the economy or jobs
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:58.080]  or whatever we need to break the spell of these
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:02.080]  secret agendas whether it's the trade agenda or whether it's the
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:05.520]  agenda 21 that is hiding behind environmentalism
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:08.240]  we need to break it for both the democrats and republicans they both need to
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.760]  understand that these are secret techniques to bankrupt and control you
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.040]  yeah well one thing i do want to say no i don't see a difference between the
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:22.240]  democrats and the republicans particularly they're globalists
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:27.360]  the reason we call our site democrats against u n agenda 21 is because we are
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:31.520]  we're democrats we don't affiliate with parties now at this point
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:35.440]  we're liberals we um and we felt that this was
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:39.440]  an issue that was really had just been brought to the awareness of people who
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:43.520]  are more conservative and uh but the thing is is that you
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:46.960]  know the whole party thing is about is designed to just keep you in each other's
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:49.360]  droats it's about you know whether you're the red
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.080]  blue team it's a bunch of baloney yeah so but of course they can identify
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:57.200]  certain you know people who are identify with one team versus another
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:00.400]  they'll see that they identify with one aspect of one issue so they'll play that
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:04.000]  up meanwhile it's a secret agenda and once you break that
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.120]  mystique and you understand these people have got a secret agenda that they're
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:11.200]  trying to force on us without informing us trying to trick us that kind of
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:16.320]  breaks the spell doesn't it yeah it does and i we're looking at an oligarchy
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:20.560]  that's ultimately about uh you know completely machiavellian
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:24.560]  nation states being destroyed and having city states in their place
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:28.000]  this is about destroying the old order okay in any way
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.160]  and i just want to refer to uh uh your last caller was talking about
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:35.920]  high speed rail in florida high speed rail is designed to fail
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:40.320]  is designed purposely to sink your economy that is the purpose
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:43.840]  and uh yes i know about that rail that's supposed project
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:48.000]  look at florida not all aboard that's a good website for that
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.920]  um we are what we are talking about here is something that is
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:55.760]  all over the world austria england europe the EU
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:59.840]  is uh the you know this is the incremental destruction of the nation
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:03.680]  state um we're not talking about nationalism here what we're talking
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:08.480]  about is your ability to control what happens in your life
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:13.280]  and if you are talking about a region or a huge block of nations you have
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:19.920]  literally no say no how what you do what you can do is you can
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:24.560]  anti-delfine those meetings you can send out fliers you can speak to people

[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:53.440]  agenda 21 would you agree that it's achilles heel would be if people could
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:57.600]  make their own electricity easily quickly they could make their own
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:01.200]  electricity for cars hydrogen greenhouses everything
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:05.120]  well certainly getting off of the grid is a very empowering thing
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:10.720]  yes go ahead yeah darard moran m or i am youtubers in the quantum
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:15.680]  electric generator have broken the code anybody can go out there and start a business
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:19.200]  making their own electricity make their own greenhouses if you have your own food
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:21.920]  you have your own way to make water out of the air
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:24.640]  you have your own way to desalinate you have your own way to do
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:28.960]  transportation this is their achilles heel you can even make synthetic diamonds
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:33.280]  out of methane and electricity and create your own currency locally we
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:36.880]  can get rid of all governments that people would just wake up to the fact
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:42.320]  it's in you can turn your drain pump from your washing machine in the electrical
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:45.280]  generator absolutely it's that dependency isn't it
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:49.120]  and they want to make us ever more dependent on them whether it's
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:52.400]  artificial intelligence as i mentioned earlier in the program they see that the
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:56.400]  brains of these taxi drivers studying this complex map
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:00.000]  actually get much larger as they're doing it but the opposite happens as well if
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.720]  we don't use our minds the atrophy and die if we don't
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:05.760]  use our freedoms the atrophy and die as well
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:08.960]  it's a good point that you're making learn how to do things
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:12.480]  self-sufficiently at a local level that's a very empowering thing for you
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:16.560]  personally but it's one important way to shut down this control grid that they've
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.720]  got thank you for holding jeff let's let's go
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:22.800]  quickly to kevin and michigan kevin go ahead
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:27.920]  hey go ahead go ahead yeah i'm doing great
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:32.160]  hey rosa i had a question for you recently we've had a long-standing
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:37.120]  farmers market over 10 years that all the sudden
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:45.600]  bureaucratic councils taken over and making people apply to be able to
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:48.640]  basically a vendor everywhere you like the roses no longer with us but
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:52.640]  everywhere you look government is shutting down just the simplest types of
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:55.840]  entrepreneurship the simplest types of trying to be
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:59.040]  independent there was a story in this uh snowstorm in new jersey
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:02.320]  where they had a couple of teenagers who instead of sitting around watching xbox
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:06.000]  where the snowstorm hit they handed out flyers and said well shovel your
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.480]  driveway for x amount of money somebody called the cops on them and the cops
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:14.480]  came in and said you need a 400 plus dollar license in order to do that and
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:18.800]  by the way that's only good for 180 days i mean they don't want anybody to have
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:22.800]  any kind of self-independence that's why you need to get active
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:25.280]  at the local level the best way that you can fight this
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:28.800]  is that the local level and farmers markets are a great way because the
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:31.840]  whole system is really set up to screw the
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.960]  farmer as well as the consumer and if you can eliminate
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:39.440]  that massive infrastructure go direct to get your food that helps the local
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.040]  farmer it gets you a better quality food that's not loaded with preservatives
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:46.560]  and it helps to keep people working in your area
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:49.680]  let's go quickly to doug in oregon doug
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:53.760]  hey david thanks for taking my call first the bad news then the good news and
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:57.120]  i'll make it quick i'm a producer for table access television out here in
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:00.880]  oregon and i've been in meetings for about three four years public meetings
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:04.560]  and i got to tell you there is nothing being changed in oregon zero change
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:08.480]  same people elected same agenda goes forward all the time now we have vote
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:12.720]  by mail in oregon as you probably know and i i think it's an absolute fraud
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:16.240]  and i think until oregon wakes up and changes that vote by mail
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:19.840]  we are not changing anything at the local level and probably at the higher
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:22.960]  state levels as well this is what i'm seeing so i just wanted your thoughts on
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:25.680]  that david because i know you're having success in texas
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:29.280]  alex talks about it but in oregon we have no
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:32.480]  success at all the election system is very rigged there's a number of ways
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:35.920]  that they can do it from the kind of voters they have to the custody being
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.760]  violated of the votes the way that it's reported we saw that in the caucuses
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:43.040]  for ron paul we saw the massive corruption even within the republican
[03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:46.720]  party not let alone the general election so there's a lot
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:50.240]  that needs to be done about that the key thing again is creating
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:54.080]  uh an awareness of the problem before you can solve it with enough people that's
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:58.240]  it for today's show join us tonight at seven central for the infor's nightly
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:28.080]  news
