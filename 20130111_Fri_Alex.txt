[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:43.040]  ladies and gentlemen it is Friday this is your captain speaking we've got some
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.720]  really rough turbulence coming up ahead so strap yourselves in it is Friday the
[00:48.720 --> 00:54.920]  11th day of January 2013 you can see the shirt I'm wearing come and take it a
[00:54.920 --> 00:58.600]  variant of the famous Texas saying they started the Texas revolution for
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.320]  independence against Santa Ana when he came to confiscate the guns and in
[01:02.320 --> 01:06.840]  Gonzales Texas they hoisted up a flag with a cannon as the symbol and one
[01:06.840 --> 01:10.960]  white star saying come and take it and then inside of the t-shirt I'm wearing
[01:10.960 --> 01:18.080]  is a AK-47 and it says the right to keep their arms shall not be infringed we
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.320]  just put this t-shirt up for sale not starting the broadcast with a plug here
[01:22.320 --> 01:26.320]  for a product I mean I guess I am but I was just looking at the shirt that I was
[01:26.320 --> 01:29.240]  wearing this morning and thought that I should mention it's now the best seller
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.160]  we've ever had of t-shirts only been selling for about a week and it's set
[01:33.160 --> 01:36.680]  to sell out very soon but never fear we're getting more more printed right
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.720]  here in the good old USA but there it is ladies and gentlemen the right to keep
[01:41.720 --> 01:46.920]  their arms shall not be infringed and infringed is the barrel of the rifle
[01:46.920 --> 01:56.200]  come and take it and that's what I told Pierce Morgan on Monday now again I
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.520]  don't get sick very often but I do get allergies every year during the cedar
[02:00.520 --> 02:10.160]  season that's not really Caesar it's a mountain Juniper and I get sore
[02:10.160 --> 02:13.040]  throats from it so I've ignored for two and a half weeks really bad sore throat
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.200]  until I finally got a fever two nights ago I said no you're sick you're wheezing
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.760]  something's wrong so I went to the doctor and they did the swabs and the checks
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.400]  and the physician's assistant that came in and did most of the work was a
[02:25.400 --> 02:28.640]  Afghanistan veteran a big listener he talked about how they were in Afghanistan
[02:28.640 --> 02:31.360]  would listen to the show and how he's about to go back to be a medic over there
[02:31.360 --> 02:37.720]  they did the swab and the check I have bacterial infection and bronchitis going
[02:37.720 --> 02:48.240]  into pneumonia now the reason I mentioned that is that I've been kind of in a
[02:48.240 --> 02:52.920]  fog the last week or so I could barely breathe when I was in New York so I
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.120]  really couldn't decide deep down whether I was just telling myself I did a good
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.040]  job when some people are saying I did a bad job or whether it was because I was
[03:02.040 --> 03:07.920]  sick and I just couldn't basically analyze and make the right decisions
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.960]  usually I'm very clear on things they put me on some powerful antibiotics in an
[03:11.960 --> 03:16.200]  inhaler yesterday and I'm all for antibiotics if they're not overused
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.360]  problems everybody overuses I might have an antibiotics about four years since I
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.640]  since I was Bilderberg four years ago since I cut my leg in DC and it got
[03:24.640 --> 03:29.000]  infected then that time I waited too long until it was all rotting inside and
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.680]  they did x-rays of that and said look at this this would have gone another week
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.080]  you might have lost your leg I had like two different types of bacteria one of
[03:36.080 --> 03:40.520]  them flesh eating inside my leg but again that itself is a side issue I
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.520]  immediately when I started taking antibiotics yesterday afternoon and got
[03:44.520 --> 03:51.440]  on the inhaler and and also took some of the decongestant cough syrup they gave
[03:51.440 --> 03:55.600]  me and the nasal spray the guy said you need all of this you know I'm surprised
[03:55.600 --> 03:59.440]  you're up walking around of course they always say that but actually wasn't
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.960]  walking around some of the time when I was in New York I was laying there in a
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.800]  bed getting ready to you know go on Pierce Morgan I couldn't tell hey I
[04:05.800 --> 04:08.720]  thought I did a good job but maybe it's because I'm sick maybe my head isn't
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.840]  clear this morning I woke up feeling like 80% better 80% better and just
[04:14.840 --> 04:22.880]  absolutely was clear that I did a darn good job but within the response that I
[04:22.880 --> 04:31.400]  saw for maybe 20 30% of people negative I really got a window into the mindset
[04:31.400 --> 04:37.400]  that we have entered in this society so I'm gonna talk about that when we come
[04:37.400 --> 04:41.280]  back here today we got a bunch of clubs I didn't get to yesterday and a bunch of
[04:41.280 --> 04:44.680]  new ones there's Morgan is really getting his butt handed to him he had
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.920]  Ben Shapiro Breitbart.com on and he just said look you're a big bully using
[04:48.920 --> 04:54.480]  with just those children to try to disarm us and he's absolutely right but

[09:13.960 --> 09:17.480]  to take a few weeks ago but you guys reprint me those articles dealing with
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.440]  EU ministers want to merge with Russia and also the reports about the communist
[09:23.440 --> 09:26.720]  Chinese government saying they want our guns and things I want to ask him how
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.760]  his view geopolitically how that fits into the UN gun treaty and why they're
[09:30.760 --> 09:35.040]  pushing for victim disarmament so hard right now they even started before the
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.400]  Sandy Hook tragedy so that's coming up today obviously we're going to have
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.280]  open phones as well once I start giving them phone number out and go over a
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.560]  plethora of news articles that are up at info wars.com right now British host
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.040]  Pierce Morgan calls US Constitution your little book and belittles the
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.700]  Constitution and Bill of Rights and Nanny Bloomberg strikes again outlaws
[09:59.700 --> 10:05.280]  painkillers in hospitals so soda drinks popcorn milk products he's talking about
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.440]  outright bans on cigarettes you name it it's all about control but he's also
[10:10.440 --> 10:13.520]  going to make you live in 250 square foot apartments but he won't live in one
[10:13.520 --> 10:19.160]  he'll live in a 15,000 foot penthouse square foot penthouse Obama signs a bill
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.040]  giving him armed protection for life amazing also nationwide ammo shortage
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.760]  so severe that even cops can't buy bullets ammo rationing imminent that's
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.360]  one reason they might have bought 1.6 billion plus the last 14 months is to
[10:33.360 --> 10:37.440]  create such a crisis they can nationalize ammo manufacturing and there's
[10:37.440 --> 10:40.560]  even some discussion of that that's when governments usually do that is in
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.360]  government shortages of quote essential material or products that's in executive
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.800]  orders by the way already on the books is unconstitutional but I never stops
[10:48.800 --> 10:52.960]  them sandy hook massacre timeline very important new video report out from
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.440]  Rob do they're also hyping severe flu reaches epidemic proportions that's
[10:58.440 --> 11:03.240]  actually not true there's a lot of stuff going around this this year though
[11:03.240 --> 11:06.680]  that is certainly true I mean I know more people that have been sick than I've
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.240]  seen in a long time so I will tell you that the flu itself is hype but these
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.920]  bacterial infections the respiratory stuff all the stuff being sprayed in the
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.240]  air the China has totally industrialized and has dirty industries
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.600]  their rivers every week or two set on fire they make our industrial revolution
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.800]  look clean and the jet stream dumps in all over the United States but
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.360]  predominantly from Texas right into the Midwest it comes in for more than 30
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.880]  thousand feet and dumps into a thousand feet that's why when the EPA goes out and
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.640]  does particulate measurements it says oh my gosh the air so dirty yeah they've
[11:47.640 --> 11:51.280]  they've tested it the scientists we're gonna check it in China you can pull all
[11:51.280 --> 11:58.560]  this up it's well known it's mainly Chinese and Indian and Pakistani you
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.040]  name it I mean incredibly dirty industries there and the jet stream goes
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.600]  low on the other side of the world right over those areas bad luck for us the way
[12:09.600 --> 12:15.240]  it's God designed it and then comes across you know it's just like with the
[12:15.240 --> 12:18.960]  Fukushima why it came over here the trade winds are lower also comes through
[12:18.960 --> 12:24.960]  those the general prevailing winds go in some cases at 125 miles an hour in the
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.040]  jet stream that's why when you're in a jet going with the jet stream you can the
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.960]  jet stream was going really fast when I flew to New York three hours only takes
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.040]  three and a half with the normal jet stream but the pilot talked about how
[12:38.040 --> 12:45.120]  fast the jet stream was up over 125 miles an hour and so we we got there and
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.120]  right under three hours now coming back over four hours you're going into the
[12:50.120 --> 12:57.400]  jet stream I'm already ranting about that the point is is that we have toxic
[12:57.400 --> 13:03.200]  waste raining down on us and they're busy trying to tax people and make you
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.320]  have low flush toilets and and mercury filled light bulbs and taxes on carbon
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.320]  dioxide you exhale and cows methane flatulence and there's always been bovine
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.760]  animals running around passing gas they don't want to go after any of the real
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.120]  environmental crises they want to go after a bunch of stuff where they can
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.000]  tax everybody and continue all their GMO genetic engineering the rest of it so
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.080]  we're gonna be looking at the flu situation some as well today if you go
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.800]  to info wars.com you see I think it's the most important story of the day
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.520]  Obama signs bill giving himself armed protection for life it's also at least
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.400]  last time I checked 15 minutes ago the top middle story at drudgereport.com so
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.160]  you can't miss it there with images of Obama and his secret service above it
[13:51.160 --> 13:58.240]  getting off Air Force One and he is expanding more arm protection as
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.200]  presidents already have that but now he's expanding he signed a bill to give
[14:02.200 --> 14:05.360]  even more arm protection despite launching a gun control agenda that
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.840]  threatens to disarm the American people. President Obama has signed a bill that
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.640]  would afford him armed secret service protection for life the legislation
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.160]  crafted by Republican Representative Trey Gowarty of South Carolina rolls back
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.280]  the 1990s law that opposed a 10-year limit on secret service protection of
[14:22.280 --> 14:28.760]  former presidents Bush's would have been the former commander-in-chief affected
[14:28.760 --> 14:34.400]  reports Yahoo News but they can always use any threats once a year to keep
[14:34.400 --> 14:40.360]  secret service protection on the president I know because I've seen them
[14:40.360 --> 14:43.280]  mention that in the news that well you know as long as there's ongoing
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.520]  investigations one a year of threats to former presidents they still get the
[14:46.520 --> 14:53.400]  guards so they still have them. In fact we had secret service here a few weeks ago
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.160]  dealing with something concerning a former Bush not with us but with some
[14:58.160 --> 15:04.680]  idiot making a comment that's all I'll say is I could even get into it the point
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.720]  is is that that's how they keep it open but now it doesn't matter they just get
[15:09.720 --> 15:14.680]  taxpayer paid for millions of dollars a year 24 hours a day multiple armed guards
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.400]  the new bill which will cost American taxpayers millions of dollars is a
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.720]  reinstatement of that 65 law which which will see presidents protected for
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.200]  life as well as their children up to age 16 the irony of Obama seeking to
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.320]  surround himself with armed men for rest of his life while simultaneously
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.600]  working to disarm the American people via gun control agenda that is likely to
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.960]  be enforced via executive decree represents the height of hypocrisy but
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.400]  it's not the first time Obama has lauded the notion of responsible Americans
[15:43.400 --> 15:50.200]  using firearms to protect himself and his family while concurrently eviscerating
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.920]  the very same right of American people. They're an ABC Nightline interview
[15:54.920 --> 15:59.880]  broadcast on December 26 yet recorded before the Sandy Hook shooting Obama
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.240]  said one of the benefits of his reelection was the ability to have men
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.160]  with guns around at all times we have a link to that video right there but we
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.480]  ought to get that video guys in order to protect his daughters you know to have
[16:11.480 --> 16:14.920]  that along with Feinstein admitting she has armed guards and a concealed carry
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.040]  but we shouldn't be able to gun Mr. and Mrs. America to turn your guns in in
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.280]  addition the school attended by Obama's daughters in Washington DC has no less
[16:22.280 --> 16:26.000]  than 11 armed security guards on duty at all times get the idea of arming
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.080]  teachers in school officials to prevent school massacres has been dismissed by
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.280]  gun control advocates their slave master advocates who want school campuses to
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.520]  remain gun-free zones where victims are disarmed and shooters are free to carry
[16:38.520 --> 16:44.120]  out their rampage unimpeded. The hypocrisy of gun control advocates who
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.040]  feverishly worked to create victim disarmament yet surround themselves with
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.680]  armed men in rampant amongst the political class as reported last month
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.080]  despite and the same year calling for Mr. and Mrs. America to turn in their guns
[16:56.080 --> 16:59.800]  California Senator Diane Feinstein authored the county and Bill said to be
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.720]  introduced later this month that would treat gun owners like sex offenders
[17:03.720 --> 17:09.040]  admitted to carrying a concealed weapon for her own protection after she was
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.600]  threatened by a terrorist group. She's actually already introduced the Bill but
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.520]  he was linking to a clip where she said she'd introduce it. Other prominent gun
[17:16.520 --> 17:20.280]  control advocates such as Mayor Michael Bloomberg have also aggressively pushed to
[17:20.280 --> 17:23.120]  disarm Americans while themselves employing armed bodyguards at all
[17:23.120 --> 17:27.120]  times. Michael Moore and other vehement proponent of gun control also has armed
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.000]  bodyguards one of whom was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon in the New
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.080]  York JFK airport in 2005. His guns are banned there unless you get a license
[17:38.080 --> 17:44.120]  which is like finding a holy grail inside a unicorn's nose. A White House
[17:44.120 --> 17:49.280]  petition created at the end of last month calls for making the White House and
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.400]  all federal buildings gun-free zones. If the government believes gun-free zones
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.200]  are the solution for citizens the same standards you apply to government
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.680]  servants and employees states the petition which currently has over 12,000
[18:01.680 --> 18:09.680]  signatures. So there is the report at info wars.com and drudgereport.com
[18:09.680 --> 18:17.920]  right in the middle top column. I suggest that everyone go out and get that
[18:17.920 --> 18:23.120]  article at info wars.com prisonblot.com drudgereport.com you have no excuse. I
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.200]  know you already know the hypocrisy you already know it. That doesn't mean your
[18:27.200 --> 18:30.600]  neighbor knows it. It doesn't mean your boss knows it. Doesn't mean your employees
[18:30.600 --> 18:33.320]  know it. It doesn't mean your mother your father your sister your brother your
[18:33.320 --> 18:38.280]  wife your husband knows it. It doesn't mean the police chief knows it. And by
[18:38.280 --> 18:45.000]  the way this morning I'm watching Fox News and I was just going off violent
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.160]  crime general statistics and I'm watching Fox News on the morning show and one of
[18:49.160 --> 18:57.560]  the host is debating Stromboli. That's our members name Haruna Rivera and Rivera
[18:57.560 --> 19:00.480]  is saying you know we need to restrict guns basically agreeing with the owner of
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.920]  news corps and let's ban them basically and the other host was putting up FBI
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.200]  statistics off the same FBI.gov that I hadn't seen and I'll be honest with you
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.360]  I just said 21 percent because that's what it showed over the last 15 years 11
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.080]  to 12 percent of it depending on how you look at the graph the last five or six
[19:17.080 --> 19:22.640]  since 2007 I guess that's six roughly and I'm looking at and I get and they were
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.800]  going 49% drop in violent crime. He was showing all these incredible numbers so
[19:27.800 --> 19:34.080]  I grabbed my iPad and I went and searched it and there were all these other
[19:34.080 --> 19:40.600]  breakdowns and I'm wrong it it was I can't believe it it's true crime with
[19:40.600 --> 19:47.320]  guns in the commission of crimes has dropped 49% and by the way I want to do
[19:47.320 --> 19:50.040]  a report on that tonight I just I know a lot of you were watching Fox News this
[19:50.040 --> 19:54.640]  morning you had to see it again there I am again people think I exaggerate it's
[19:54.640 --> 20:02.400]  better than I even said that's why the oh man looking back on 2012 we asked
[20:02.400 --> 20:06.720]  ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy
[20:06.720 --> 20:10.400]  in the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a

[24:03.000 --> 24:07.840]  all right Alex Jones here back live and Cal Eric Muller's joining us and then
[24:07.840 --> 24:11.840]  we'll have open phones and we have another guest popping in a lot of clips a
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.760]  lot of key news today all right so here's my bottom line on what happened
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.240]  with Pierce Morgan my original gut statement that I think it was overall
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.760]  positive obviously I could have done a better job I could have made a few of
[24:24.760 --> 24:29.840]  the points a little more fluidly but in the moment in the adrenaline and also
[24:29.840 --> 24:34.520]  now knowing that I had a bronchitis the beginnings of pneumonia I think I did a
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.920]  pretty good job and Rob Duke can vouch for this I was hacking and coughing so
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.160]  hard I could hardly breathe but as soon as I went in there they were asking are
[24:41.160 --> 24:44.660]  you okay are you okay here have some tea you're gonna be off to go on air and the
[24:44.660 --> 24:49.040]  producers can vouch for that I may have overcompensated because I just
[24:49.040 --> 24:53.000]  absolutely felt horrible that Sunday going into that Monday my wife is like
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.120]  you shouldn't even go she said you're like turning blue turns out there's a
[24:58.120 --> 25:01.920]  lot of this really bad bacteria going around the country and they're hyping up
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.640]  the flu but that's not it so much but I've got to say now that I've gotten a
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.840]  lot better and feel good and I've kind of got that more crystal clear thought
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.240]  process looking back on what happened with Pierce Morgan I think the hand of
[25:15.240 --> 25:21.000]  God was honored again and I don't spend things to myself I'm my own worst critic
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.080]  and when I do things wrong I'll say it on air there was an initial even with my
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.560]  dad my mother and others an initial man you came off as really angry and in his
[25:30.560 --> 25:33.800]  face wouldn't have been better if you've been a little smoother you made some
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.360]  good points it was very entertaining but then they said you know like a day
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.000]  later we should be angry about this and that's what people on the street have
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.560]  told me I was downtown last night in this morning that's what people everywhere
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.320]  crew here everyone has told me that you know what they are coming after our
[25:51.320 --> 25:54.680]  guns and they're lying about the fact that they want our guns and I'm angry
[25:54.680 --> 25:58.040]  about that fact and I'm angry about everything else they're doing and I'm
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.720]  glad you didn't just sit there and take that arrogant guy but even Larry King has
[26:01.720 --> 26:06.760]  now come out against the guest last night called him a bully who was on
[26:06.760 --> 26:09.960]  theirs he was using with death of those children and I didn't intend to make that
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.480]  point was in my notes but I never got to that they're the ones exploiting it and
[26:14.480 --> 26:18.240]  it's that thing if we don't want your guns we want reasonable restrictions I
[26:18.240 --> 26:24.400]  saw a LA Times article this morning attacking myself and showing me as a
[26:24.400 --> 26:31.840]  giant fat Michael Moore type holding an M16 and they said you know these people
[26:31.840 --> 26:35.640]  won't be reasonable and realize we don't want to take their guns we just want
[26:35.640 --> 26:40.420]  reasonable restrictions and I'm like really the bill introduced by Diane
[26:40.420 --> 26:43.720]  Feinstein says they can make you turn them in and makes everything else they
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.360]  say you can keep registered all over the world they end up taking the guns the
[26:49.360 --> 26:52.920]  attorney general he was deputy attorney general wrote public statements saying I
[26:52.920 --> 26:58.680]  want total gunman Obama has said it the UN has said it they've all stated it you
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.520]  know it you've heard Feinstein say mr. Mrs. America turn them in we know the
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.560]  goal and it's insulting that they claim they care about 20 dead kids it's about
[27:07.560 --> 27:12.280]  dominance and only government having power and that's why I blew up because
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.560]  I'm done patty-caking debating them in a nice way they they try to set the
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.280]  agenda and say it's just crediting to get angry don't do that it's kooky they
[27:24.280 --> 27:27.040]  say wanting to have a family's cookie they say wanting to own a gun is kooky
[27:27.040 --> 27:30.880]  when Larry Pratt goes on and talks totally calm they say he's a kook he's a
[27:30.880 --> 27:36.120]  weirdo he's a nut they are all about setting the parameters like they're the
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.160]  boss and they decide what's kosher they decide what's okay the system sets the
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.680]  parameters they set the rules they put themselves in the position of authority
[27:46.680 --> 27:53.040]  in a big fancy set in a rotting CNN headquarters and sit there and tell you
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.360]  they're in control and the emperor is wearing a beautiful cloak I call baloney
[27:57.360 --> 28:03.440]  I say your butt naked and it just comes down to that and I'll tell you you've
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.880]  seen me on many other national TV shows C-span you name it my wife's like why
[28:07.880 --> 28:11.160]  weren't you like when you're on C-span or on the view you took over but you were
[28:11.160 --> 28:14.400]  charming and focused and made all your points you know why did you blow up and
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.160]  I said I think it's because I was sick and he just made me mad and then I'm
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.840]  like last night I'm like God did I do the right thing and I went to sleep and
[28:22.840 --> 28:26.240]  I woke up this morning and it was all just crystal clear and I already knew
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.720]  even though I've been sick and feeling out of it and couldn't really you know
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.920]  maybe I did do it wrong that's them playing mind games with us that's them
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.240]  all I mean when you watch these people they're talking to you like you're a
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.720]  person who's been hypnotized they're talking to you like you're fully under
[28:44.720 --> 28:52.440]  their control and they are the bosses that's what they're doing they are they
[28:52.440 --> 28:59.320]  are setting the parameter like they are in control of everything and notice they
[28:59.320 --> 29:04.960]  always tell you don't get upset don't get angry but when you see the governor
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.760]  in New York saying let's ban the semi-autos he's yelling and screaming and
[29:08.760 --> 29:12.840]  hyping up his troops imagine if he told the football coach because the whole
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.040]  world is a battle football is a battle business is a battle raising your kids
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.280]  is a battle and you've got to decide you want to win the war and when the war
[29:20.280 --> 29:23.760]  means raising them straight and strong living in a free country they always are
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.520]  charging in they've always got the force they're always trying to hype
[29:27.520 --> 29:33.120]  themselves up and but they tell you oh no be passive be nice sit down go along
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.720]  with us no no no don't get upset sit down sit down don't stand up don't stay
[29:38.720 --> 29:43.560]  it's all a mind game you've got to get mad you've got to get angry and realize
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.120]  there are a bunch of criminals lying to you and you need to get angry about the
[29:47.120 --> 29:50.440]  fact that there are a bunch of scammers they're afraid of you we're on the March

[33:21.640 --> 33:29.600]  Diane Feinstein Barack Obama Eric Holder they're all on record saying we
[33:29.600 --> 33:34.040]  shouldn't own any guns now they want to have this debate and say no no no we just
[33:34.040 --> 33:38.600]  want reasonable restrictions here's the LA Times today if you're a prison
[33:38.600 --> 33:44.560]  planet on TV viewers Alex Jones and other pro-gun paranoids put the nuts in
[33:44.560 --> 33:50.440]  gun nuts and then they show a fat guy with an m16 with a rebel flag on his hat
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.320]  that's their image that's what Pierce Morgan calls Americans dumb and stupid
[33:54.320 --> 33:59.720]  he says I'm British I've come to conquer America that's in his tweets and they
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.360]  go on to say Jones is insane he thinks we want to disarm and take the guns
[34:04.360 --> 34:10.040]  they're crazy I have John Stewart saying we're crazy no one wants to take our
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.320]  guns that will play that clip coming up later with mancow of mancow.com
[34:15.320 --> 34:18.520]  syndicate it radio host to get his take on this because I was on his show
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.720]  yesterday and asked his take and he thought it was a big victory I was a
[34:22.720 --> 34:25.960]  little bit under the weather a lot better today and I could really sit back
[34:25.960 --> 34:29.840]  this morning and look at it and the fact that I blew up at him which I wasn't
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.960]  really intending to do got people out of their trance Billy Corgan sent me a
[34:34.960 --> 34:40.120]  text and it that night said you help break the hypnosis he's a really smart
[34:40.120 --> 34:45.840]  guy and that's why it resonated with so many people I got sent emails by
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.920]  psychologists and advertising people that I know saying no no this is really
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.400]  good the reason the producer was crying the reason they panicked and kicked you
[34:53.400 --> 34:57.520]  off the show the reason they were so scared is because if we ever stopped
[34:57.520 --> 35:00.840]  letting them be in the position of authority over us and they're like
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.040]  you're gonna be calm you're gonna be nice you're going to shut up you're
[35:05.040 --> 35:08.000]  going to go along with this and if we ever break through that and go you're a
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.520]  bunch of con artists you're telling me I'm crazy in the LA Times and you're
[35:13.520 --> 35:20.160]  telling me I'm crazy on the daily show we have the clips nobody's coming for
[35:20.160 --> 35:24.920]  your guns crazy man don't get upset don't get upset it's great they say it's
[35:24.920 --> 35:29.160]  crazy to get upset because that's where they don't want you to go they want to
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.200]  just be people keep saying what does it take to get America angry what is it we
[35:33.200 --> 35:36.520]  won't take with the TSA sticking their hands on our pants and the warrantless
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.800]  wiretapping and the checkpoints and the open borders and they just raised taxes
[35:40.800 --> 35:44.720]  again and lied to us about it 77% of America's massive tax increases when
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.760]  they lied said they wouldn't I was sitting there at the doctor yesterday

[38:36.800 --> 38:43.080]  on purpose getting us used to being told what to do and lectured to when the
[38:43.080 --> 38:49.400]  crime rate has dropped 49% with firearms 21% total all violent crime in the last
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.720]  15 years people like I thought you said it was 21 but that was overall violent
[38:53.720 --> 38:57.280]  crime I was watching Fox they had the FBI statistics up this morning I couldn't
[38:57.280 --> 39:00.280]  believe they told the truth but still her all those said take the guns that it
[39:00.280 --> 39:05.440]  was 49% it was bad if there's thousands of pages FBI dot gov I didn't even read

[39:45.760 --> 39:48.960]  say well do you need a machine gun to hunt here you need a handgun to hunt a
[39:48.960 --> 39:55.800]  deer no it's not about hunting it's about protection from you people and
[39:55.800 --> 39:59.960]  boy they're really I mean you know the Constitution be damned the Second
[39:59.960 --> 40:03.120]  Amendment be damned they did there's no laws for this president's really
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.520]  something look here was my take and I know you don't you you don't agree with
[40:06.520 --> 40:10.860]  me totally okay can I get my take can you hear me okay yes I can okay I'm
[40:10.860 --> 40:16.320]  standing below the city of Chicago and okay listen folks you have to understand
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.120]  something you know land of the free land of the free if you say it enough
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.520]  well it must be true but we know the laws every day new new laws but you know
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.640]  just because you say something doesn't mean it's true it's brainwashing the
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.760]  fact is that Pierce Morgan in 2013 is insignificant I have more people on my
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.760]  little radio show and Alex has more people on his radio show you know more
[40:41.760 --> 40:47.400]  people are listening right now and paying attention to Alex then we'll be
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.000]  part of Pierce Morgan if you read drugs you saw the hell that this man went
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.280]  through and I've gone through and most of you people have gone through when he
[40:54.280 --> 40:57.800]  went through the airport take off your shoes jump down turn around pick a bail
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.640]  of cotton yell that hassle harassed we my family's been fighting the flu I'm
[41:03.640 --> 41:06.360]  sure many people listening that fight the flu so here's Alex fighting the
[41:06.360 --> 41:12.200]  flu going through the TSA they're hassling him he's sick boy flying is
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.280]  awful travel is awful when you're sick here is Pierce Morgan insignificant
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.840]  really insignificant and a complete failure for CNN the ratings are a
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.720]  disaster as awful as the troll Larry King was and I worked for Larry King I
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.240]  like Larry but come on way past his prime 20 years ago as awful as Larry King
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.880]  was Pierce Morgan if it's possible is doing even worse so he's insignificant
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.600]  now Alex am I going on too long I'm listening this is great mentally
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.600]  challenged people I mean people out of the asylum that's fine in love with me
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.760]  or Alex or you know a TV star or whatever people that are that have mental
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.920]  problems or don't think they're sufficient enough mentally will remember
[41:53.920 --> 41:58.960]  some obscure fact to prove that they're smart kind of like Rain Man I'm not
[41:58.960 --> 42:02.920]  insulting people with mental illness but what Pierce Morgan did is he remembered
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.520]  how many people were killed in England how many people were killed in England
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.200]  how many people were killed in England so he didn't hear anything Alex said
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.240]  he was getting his ass handed to him how many people were killed in England and
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.120]  Alex rolled over like a steamroller he's a much more powerful presence I've been
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.520]  around Pierce Morgan I've been around Alex Alex dominates Pierce is not an
[42:24.520 --> 42:28.880]  alpha male Alex is an alpha male he's a man I know we've forgotten what that is
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.240]  I know African Americans are encouraged to be tough watch the rap videos and white
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.200]  guys are supposed to be little mealy mouth men without opinion turn on the
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.160]  TV it's just where our culture is right now and I don't like it anyway so you
[42:41.160 --> 42:44.640]  know how many people were killed in Britain you don't know folks I'm
[42:44.640 --> 42:49.720]  smarter than him and look I wrote it up to I do interviews every day Alex does
[42:49.720 --> 42:55.320]  interviews Alex knows what the setup is you come up with some obscure fact they
[42:55.320 --> 43:01.000]  don't know it so you're smarter as the host and you go to commercial Alex knew
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.840]  as soon as he couldn't answer it because who gives a hairy rat's ass how many
[43:05.840 --> 43:08.680]  people were killed in England we're talking about America they're trying to
[43:08.680 --> 43:13.880]  take our guns in America so rather than be run roughshod and cut the commercial
[43:13.880 --> 43:18.040]  and Alex looks stupid he didn't answer it he didn't he didn't jump in the snare
[43:18.040 --> 43:21.720]  to get trapped he didn't walk over the leafy path to fall into the bungee
[43:21.720 --> 43:27.320]  stakes and I think what you did Alex was absolutely brilliant who cares the
[43:27.320 --> 43:30.240]  only reason anybody's talking about the shows because you were on there I don't
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.120]  watch beers Morgan I watch because my buddy was on there by the way does you
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.360]  know their ratings this came out you can anybody can look up TV ratings just
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.480]  typing in it's all there the ratings went from about 500,000 a night to 870
[43:43.480 --> 43:46.880]  something thousand tonight I was on and then over a million the next night now
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.280]  they're already going back down that ought to tell those idiots something no
[43:50.280 --> 43:56.360]  one wants to watch them yeah it's only when we go on those shows you know what
[43:56.360 --> 44:00.440]  why not look these people are propagandists their prostitutes they are
[44:00.440 --> 44:06.920]  the mouthpiece of government CNN ABC CBS NBC so so why play their games and I
[44:06.920 --> 44:11.400]  think Alex just had a bow I mean that really was my take watching it my wife's
[44:11.400 --> 44:16.920]  at all did you think he went too far for what for nobody watching nobody nobody
[44:16.920 --> 44:20.640]  cares the only reason they watch is because I think he got hassled by the
[44:20.640 --> 44:25.840]  TSA it was all over George it was most downloaded story on George he went to
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.920]  hell to get there they're hassling you that the cops are coming out of the
[44:28.920 --> 44:34.840]  woodwork and in New York and and you know enough is enough you're an idiot
[44:34.840 --> 44:40.160]  you're not an American you want to take my guns go to hell and I thought part of
[44:40.160 --> 44:45.160]  it was done tongue-in-cheek and I had a bow with it so I really I thought and you
[44:45.160 --> 44:48.080]  know what it was great TV how about that no matter what you think no matter what
[44:48.080 --> 44:52.200]  your opinion is it was entertaining as hell that isn't that supposed to be a
[44:52.200 --> 44:57.040]  rule on these shows at least be entertaining so damn boring let me
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.200]  raise this point they're always telling us to be calm be calm be calm because
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.200]  they know that it's when you get active that you're able to take action I've
[45:06.200 --> 45:09.400]  been watching and I'm putting a piece together on this a bunch of different
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.880]  democratic political rallies with Feinstein Cuomo and all of them and I'm
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.120]  gonna play a clip of Cuomo here in a moment the governor of New York they
[45:18.120 --> 45:22.640]  are really yelling and screaming but though that's normal when they do that
[45:22.640 --> 45:27.440]  or or when Pierce Morgan has guessed on getting all hyped up shaking their
[45:27.440 --> 45:32.080]  fists saying let's shoot Alex Jones oh that's yeah yeah that's cute and funny
[45:32.080 --> 45:36.960]  you know but it's radical when I say hey you want my guns and they try this lie
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.160]  one reason I blew up was this thing if I don't want your guns I mean the guys on
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.120]  record saying we shouldn't own any guns and and their bills will take almost all
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.320]  the guns so I'm tired of them lying to their audience but I'm gonna play this
[45:49.320 --> 45:53.160]  Cuomo clip but first what is your take on this attempt to tell us we shouldn't
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.920]  get upset I've actually found Alex can I say something about that yes you know
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.640]  folks look first of all we should be upset but I don't think you're Alex
[46:01.640 --> 46:08.520]  you're not I've been out with you it is not it's not anger I mean you look you
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.280]  get angry you get happy I understand that but what happened with passion why
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.280]  can't we care why can't we care that our country is being destroyed Alex can I
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.240]  say one more thing totally off the subject would people do this I know you
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.200]  will too can I say something wherever you want to go to ask everybody every

[47:03.560 --> 47:07.040]  they don't think to bring up teachers you know whatever taught whenever they
[47:07.040 --> 47:10.480]  talk about gun control it's muskets well they were talking about muskets and
[47:10.480 --> 47:13.480]  whenever they talk about how they want to steal more money from us in taxes they
[47:13.480 --> 47:16.000]  always bring up teachers and I like to bring up well how about the fact that
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.120]  we're arming the Muslim brotherhood and some of the other nonsense that we're
[47:19.120 --> 47:22.800]  paying for so I just love all these brain dead morons that weren't paying
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.880]  attention and you and I told them canary's in the coal mine we told them and

[47:38.600 --> 47:42.960]  everybody angry well that's what I was mentioning at the doctor's office
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.700]  yesterday literally and I wanted to tie into it it was it was stuck in my
[47:46.700 --> 47:50.360]  car and I wanted to get that out listen they're not even gonna know check and
[47:50.360 --> 47:53.560]  by the way this is only the beginning it's three percent for everybody because
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.760]  of Social Security they're taking more by the way guys like us we're not gonna
[47:56.760 --> 47:59.440]  see any of that money anyway Alex you and I are too young we will never see
[47:59.440 --> 48:02.560]  Social Security and it's it's for you know the Obama voters they got their
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.520]  phone their new shoes we know it you know that welfare is being spent in
[48:06.520 --> 48:10.440]  strip clubs and liquor stores that's where it goes and you know you and I
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.040]  will just keep working harder it's you know our kids have to do without so so
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.160]  that half the people could sit around on their fat asses and by the way when
[48:18.160 --> 48:21.880]  they're sick and diabetic and eat a foot lop top I guess I'll pay for that too it
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.560]  is it's just it's just repulsive I saw an article in the Chicago Tribune that had
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.840]  a straight face and it was an illegal alien who was given by the government a
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.840]  free kidney and he said this isn't enough I deserve more and I want you to
[48:36.840 --> 48:40.120]  give free health care to all the other immigrants who already get it and the
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.880]  article was like you're right we need to do more for you they're just and we're
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.320]  not supposed to get upset oh no don't be extreme it's not extreme to give any
[48:47.320 --> 48:52.320]  legal alien a free kidney when when citizens go without but and that's
[48:52.320 --> 48:58.240]  what's amazing is I literally watch no exaggeration 15 people at least and I
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.640]  almost started videotaping it but I didn't want to be rude at the doctor's
[49:02.640 --> 49:06.160]  office going well why is it more money why is my insurance more why is the
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.120]  deductible more why does everything cost more why and and and I started
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.000]  telling them though I said hey lady it's Obamacare and the woman started
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.760]  arguing with me one lady that said no it's true but it's a fact and it's the
[49:18.760 --> 49:26.080]  same thing the average paycheck in America gets $200 taken out of it every
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.800]  month just for the 3.8 percent and now they've got all these other taxes in
[49:31.800 --> 49:35.520]  there and these people are so dumb as they lose their jobs because some of the
[49:35.520 --> 49:39.280]  oldest companies in America leave or shut down they're gonna go get on food
[49:39.280 --> 49:43.520]  stamps and be even bigger supporters I mean how do you stop something that
[49:43.520 --> 49:48.320]  stupid Alex brother we are gonna be nickel and dime to death where it was a
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.000]  quarter in the parking meter listen to this where I do my radio six dollars

[50:10.400 --> 50:14.200]  will be solved if you're a new business you don't have to pay any taxes I mean
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.040]  and then they so they do tax breaks to get new companies in everybody's trying
[50:18.040 --> 50:20.740]  to get the hell out of dodge everybody wants to get out of here this is what

[54:23.840 --> 54:30.160]  man Cal agrees with me that we need to get out of our trance we certainly know
[54:30.160 --> 54:35.960]  land down and being passive has gotten us to the point we're to here today and
[54:35.960 --> 54:43.240]  it makes me angry that these poor sad most of them working-class people as I
[54:43.240 --> 54:48.040]  went to a clinic near my office and it's it's it's you know working-class area
[54:48.040 --> 54:53.040]  good people not an elitist and it's a good clinic as well I've been going
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.320]  there when I have to about 15 years with my dad's friends with the owner so I
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.400]  know him and I went as it's a big clinic and they were really they were
[55:00.400 --> 55:02.960]  hurting I mean there were people in there trying to argue about their how
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.680]  much they had to pay just a couple hundred bucks and it was very reasonably
[55:06.680 --> 55:10.640]  priced compared to most health care I know the numbers my dad's in health
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.320]  care management and and then they were sad and some people came in and talked
[55:16.320 --> 55:21.480]  about the prices and said listen I can't pay that doctor such as such said no
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.200]  matter what he'll treat me and the nurses would be like okay we'll get him
[55:25.200 --> 55:30.560]  in so I was seeing some free health care going on too and I was seeing doctors
[55:30.560 --> 55:34.520]  and physicians assistants given people free samples and I heard one going I'm
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.080]  real sorry we've run out of samples I can't give you a prescription that's
[55:38.080 --> 55:43.560]  illegal they can only give you a sample America's running on empty folks and
[55:43.560 --> 55:48.160]  that's what makes me so mad at Obama and so mad at the globalist and because
[55:48.160 --> 55:52.080]  their plan is to shut America down and Romney was their placeholder the fix
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.640]  was in not that he was good either it's that we're in trouble and I know that
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.960]  healthcare bills meant to hurt you I know they want our guns and they said
[56:01.960 --> 56:06.720]  they want them and you bet I get mad and yes some of it was tongue-in-cheek just
[56:06.720 --> 56:09.940]  because I like to joke around some but a few times I really was disgusted by
[56:09.940 --> 56:14.920]  Pears Morgan because in person he came off as cold and evil and crusty
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.360]  looking he looked like a reanimated corpse and I was talking to man Cal
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.320]  yesterday Eric Muller is with us he agreed that you know he's been around a
[56:22.320 --> 56:25.720]  lot of TV people been on Fox for over I don't know 15 years all over everything
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.520]  else got a TV show right now they're piloting nationwide and he's been
[56:29.520 --> 56:33.920]  around these people and you know selling out to evil I don't know what they get
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.800]  because Pears Morgan isn't nobody the system tries to prop him up as a
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.040]  somebody but he's got every TV show in the country promoting him and he I was
[56:42.040 --> 56:47.720]  watching a movie and they had clips of him in it and CNN what's the movie what's
[56:47.720 --> 56:53.360]  it called flight Denzel Washington the new one pretty good movie I'm ranting
[56:53.360 --> 56:56.640]  man Cal we got about three minutes till the hour ends other points you want to
[56:56.640 --> 57:00.240]  make on where this country's going how painful it is to see them destroying us
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.200]  on purpose shutting down our cities people fleeing California fleeing
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.960]  Chicago but when the Democrats and liberals get to Austin they just do
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.000]  the same thing they always do I mean why are they fleeing from themselves but
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.760]  then doing the same thing once they get here you know you know something Alex
[57:15.760 --> 57:19.200]  it's all very predictable it's it's you know it's a mouse playbook it's it's
[57:19.200 --> 57:24.760]  Hitler it's it's it's it's a power pot it's all these guys it's it's you know
[57:24.760 --> 57:30.440]  it's Castro they got to take the guns this is the final straw and you know
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.760]  look they're not gonna let this guy it really is I've got little kids you've
[57:35.760 --> 57:41.480]  got a door a little kids the fact that they are using these children exploiting
[57:41.480 --> 57:47.680]  these children to destroy us it really is it isn't insidious evil isn't it yeah
[57:47.680 --> 57:52.680]  that's why I blew up at him I I genuinely when I said hey let's have a
[57:52.680 --> 57:58.800]  boxing match I'll be I'll be honest I was having a instinct to really want to
[57:58.800 --> 58:02.520]  physically deal with him but you notice the next night they said they wanted to
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.840]  shoot me it's that I knew that they did they want to hurt me they want my guns
[58:06.840 --> 58:09.680]  because they want to dominate me and they said that the next night did you see
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.720]  that Alex Alex can you imagine can you imagine going on the radio just think
[58:14.720 --> 58:19.080]  about this can you imagine going on the radio and saying I want to hear
[58:19.080 --> 58:23.640]  Morgan can you imagine I would never even think of it to say something like
[58:23.640 --> 58:28.760]  I wouldn't think of it and I would be arrested if I did okay if anyone else
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.920]  said that but I mean my god if Al Franken said it it's the funniest thing

[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:36.200]  it does double everything AP Reuters USA today and it was painful I take it
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:41.320]  personally when con artists do things to me and others and I sat there yesterday
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.480]  having to go to the doctor over a bad chest cold hadn't been to the doctor in
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:50.520]  three years or so and I watch people go why is everything going up so much why

[1:09:55.560 --> 1:10:00.000]  they said it's the new health care law ma'am and then and for some reason it was
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.160]  almost all women and then there was a man saying look I can't afford this I
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:06.960]  don't have this much money in the bank let me talk to the doctor and they were
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:10.600]  there begging and the doctors are like all right I'll do it for free like
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:13.960]  they're supposed to with certain percentage but people with insurance
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:18.040]  couldn't afford it now and of course the insurance companies wrote it and I
[1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:23.320]  know already talked about that last hour it's just seeing this I got angry again
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:29.360]  it's like the Dave Mustaine song angry again angry again that's normal it's
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:34.480]  meant to get me moving to do something and they want to physically confiscate
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.200]  most our guns the bills are introduced at massive ammo taxes registration to buy
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:44.040]  ammo and then I'm there and Pierce Morgan's like we're nobody wants to take
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.300]  your guns and I'm like you're advocating you've advocated the past the
[1:10:47.300 --> 1:10:52.160]  abolition of citizen ownership but I just want the British style what where

[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.640]  facility where you can go shoot at targets and hunting's been outlawed you
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:03.480]  and it's what of course that's exactly what I want I was talking to him before

[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:13.560]  flaming hoops on a blue moon when the planets align if I cross my fingers and
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:17.280]  stand on one leg then I can go to a shooting range to shoot guns and that's

[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:21.440]  guys up you know you talk about getting angry Alex am I gonna stop talking no
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.880]  that's why I'm not interrupting you talk about you talk about getting angry you
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:29.760]  know I had a politician in yesterday about your ready like you know the
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:34.400]  second man was about muskets and I just got a text I believe it's from another
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:38.920]  radio host named Michael Savage who's listening to us right now you know one
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:44.840]  of my buddies in radio anyway he sent me this and he wants me to read this and
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:49.280]  it's from George Washington and it's a free people ought not to be armed and
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:53.000]  disciplined but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.520]  maintain a status of independence from any who would attempt to abuse them
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:02.240]  including their government I mean this is George Washington see this is the
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:07.040]  thing they love to twist it you know it's not freedom I don't see the 10
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:13.000]  Commandments it's not freedom from religion it's freedom of religion these
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.720]  people take this and they mutated and they twist it and they make it
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:20.440]  something it isn't this isn't about muskets and hunting this is about having
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:25.280]  equal firepower to them okay and in my city were 532 have been killed in the
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:30.760]  city of Chicago folks 532 murders when the gangbangers come they don't come one
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:35.480]  at a time they come and you need a machine gun to fight back these gangs
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:42.520]  okay I know because I've seen it by the way it's not freedom from the press well
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:46.200]  there was no radio or TV back when they wrote this so let's get rid of that there
[1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:50.520]  was no internet I mean what is this nonsense and this is what these
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:55.320]  politicians say the second amendment was not about muskets and it's not about
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:00.240]  hunting so don't let them suck you into that stupid argument folks I agree with
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:03.840]  you don't say hi to Michael Savage glad he's getting back on radio and if he
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:06.640]  ever wants to come on here talk about his books or whatever I know he goes on
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:11.200]  your show and you guys are friends yeah he's absolutely welcome any time to come
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:15.600]  on the broadcast would love to have him on but I tell you we're here at this
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.000]  crossroads now and and I agree with you talking about the William Shatner
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:25.120]  analogy or allegory because he actually talked about some of that story
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:30.480]  yesterday in his two-hour talk but he didn't tell the part about how he said
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.920]  he was down and out after the divorce and the kid came over and he said is that
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.560]  really a spaceship and he let him go in the story yeah and he said the kid and
[1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:43.800]  he said the kid came in the camper and then you know he said yeah here's the
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:47.920]  controls of the spaceship with the knobs but he didn't tell the story of how
[1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:51.760]  his life turned around there but your point about America the globalists the
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:56.440]  New World Order yeah they know that they've gotten away with so much and that
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:00.560]  people are waking up to them they are desperate and and we just need to believe
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:05.600]  we can win and get it and get angry Alex yes something that we don't need to
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:12.760]  quote George Washington William Shatner how about we quote Alex Jones and I
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:16.600]  really do think this could look for you I think this could be this could be the
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:20.440]  moment this is our moment and I think when they go door-to-door and they're
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:24.760]  talking about in Iowa going door-to-door in other places I think this will be the
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:33.520]  moment and you said it it will be 1776 over again I think enough is enough you
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:37.360]  talk about at the clinic well buddy not everybody's sick but every one of your
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:41.240]  listeners that has a job is looked at their paycheck now and this is only the
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:49.120]  beginning I think the tide is turning and then let's let's let's quote 2013
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:55.360]  Alex Jones it's going to be 1776 all over again if they if they want to get
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:59.520]  rid of the checks and balances if they want to skip the judges if they want
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:04.080]  to skip the Congress and everything else if Obama wants to sign into executive
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:08.000]  order the destruction of the Second Amendment it's an impeachable offense
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.880]  and and I don't want anyone hurt I really don't I don't I don't want any of
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:17.760]  this I really don't I just got dang it I just want to raise my kids and and you
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:21.480]  know God guns and guns and these are real authoritarians I mean that's the thing
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:25.800]  they're not gonna stop and they're waging war against us the power to tax is
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:29.680]  the power to destroy and they're coming after us and by the way I'm seeing all
[1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.480]  these calls for gun confiscations I know you wouldn't just say that
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:37.120]  Iowa's talking about door-to-door now yeah Iowa one of the top politicians are
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:41.440]  hey Alex on the day of the Sandy Hook massacre okay these little kids being
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:46.080]  killed on the day on the day on that day did you see the politicians on CNN
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:52.280]  saying that we did Obama and I quote Obama and I'm sure you have to clip but
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:56.880]  Obama should exploit this tragedy I saw them say all over we need to use this
[1:19:56.880 --> 1:20:01.200]  this is great rubbing their hands together man Cal thank you looking back
[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:06.040]  on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like
[1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:09.960]  hurricane Sandy in the devastating summer drought to the family hardships
[1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:13.960]  brought on by a disastrous economy our hearts go out to those that have lost

[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.840]  wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:16.560]  warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:20.120]  just a few weeks ago former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:23.600]  op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:28.000]  can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.960]  liberals in the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:37.160]  created a free video at weird device calm that exposes this threat and blows
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:42.040]  the doors off a conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device calm
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:47.280]  right now to discover exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you

[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.320]  weird device calm on the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:05.720]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:10.960]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:15.160]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw free
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:18.720]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:22.600]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:26.080]  questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the

[1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:38.840]  change and they're a mafia using high-tech advertising technologies
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:43.320]  brainwashing to manipulate people and I'm just using good old-fashioned truth

[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:54.000]  I can to wake people up not even to convince you this stuff is right there
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.480]  historically and we've got all the proof I mean when they say we don't want your
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:04.200]  guns in the LA Times Alex Jones is crazy there's an article out today Alex
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.760]  Jones is a gun nut he thinks we want their guns well it's not my opinion and
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.800]  they think you're stupid on the Daily Show when he gets up there and goes it's
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:17.800]  not like Hitler's invading nobody wants your guns this is a guy broadcasting
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:25.680]  transmitting from a city where no one can own guns but government people this is
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:29.200]  a guy in a city where Bloomberg has said he wants to disarm the American people
[1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:34.920]  this is a guy that says hospitals can't give out painkillers let me tell you I
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:38.520]  had pretty much a compound fracture one time the bone almost sticking out of my
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:44.920]  leg and I was real glad when they jab me with that morphine and Bloomberg saying
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:47.960]  I'm just going to tell the hospitals and doctors what they can do I'm going to
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:51.760]  tell you what you can serve how much Coca-Cola you can buy I'm going to tell
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:54.880]  you how big your apartment can be people like that's over the top they're
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:26:00.880]  getting you used to it he's following a program and then Cuomo says we're going
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:04.480]  to sweep across the country we're going to ban the guns you don't need those
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:09.600]  guns for hunting deer no once you can ban those you can ban them all and they
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:14.240]  know that they follow the same pattern worldwide they're coming for the guns
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:18.400]  ladies and gentlemen and they're accelerating their program and we've
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:26.920]  got to get back in their face here's governor Cuomo two days ago in a rally
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:32.040]  to come get our guns now now why is he raising his voice why raising your
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:35.800]  voices discrediting you're supposed to be calm no no they always raise their
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.880]  voices when they're getting hyped up see when they say kill Alex Jones it's
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:43.240]  funny if I said kill them I'd be arrested see because they define
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:49.160]  everything because they're the bosses no you're not you're a mirage you're a
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:59.720]  facade you're a paper tiger a fraud a projection a hologram a lie smoke and
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:06.680]  mirrors and I'm sick of it wasn't my opinion that the healthcare plan is
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:10.480]  going to rip everybody off and set up debt panels the stink of things set it
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.760]  it's a copy of what they've done in other countries it's not like we're up here
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:24.000]  flying blind or something we know where this thing leads authoritarianism I
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:32.920]  mean I let's just go to the clip here here's Cuomo here it is I know I know
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:38.800]  that the issue of gun control is hard I know it's political look at that monster
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:44.200]  no it's controversial extra what you're proposing today common-sense measures
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:51.480]  and I say to you forget the extremist I am done no one hunts with an assault
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:28:01.120]  rifle no one needs 10 bullets too many innocent people have died already
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:08.560]  and Bosnian and the madness now has safe reasonable gun control in the state
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  and Bosnian seagulls make this safe safer save lives like Chicago and New York
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:22.680]  an example for the rest of the nations let them look at New York and say this is
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:29.840]  what you can do look at New York this is New York the progressive capital you
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:41.680]  show them how we leave unbelievable I mean you've got these guys Bloomberg
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:51.600]  Cuomo all of them Nancy Pelosi just all of them Michael Moore again they talk
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:55.000]  to you like your five-year-old Wayne LaPierre comes out and said what I've
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.360]  been saying common sense hey the Israelis arm all their people in school
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:03.360]  shooting stopped and the Israeli Foreign Minister comes out and goes well
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.320]  technically we didn't arm people to stop school shootings we call it terrorism
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:12.800]  and the media went see they told you and they said Wayne LaPierre lied I mean
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:15.640]  that's the mind games because because they don't call it a mass shooting they
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:19.720]  call it terrorism when somebody shoots people people like oh well I mean they
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:27.000]  play these mind games with people and wake up out of your trance but I mean
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:32.120]  why did he get so excited in state of the Union is state of the state with all
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:38.440]  of his minions in the State House a mafia I mean New York legislature's famous
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:43.320]  group of crooks just like Illinois and they're like we're taking over America
[1:29:43.320 --> 1:29:47.120]  we're gonna take everybody's guns and then we're gonna raise taxes up to 80%

[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:29.560]  it's alex jones
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:34.520]  what's happening is the gun culture and even the alec times admits this is
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:38.760]  taking over and winning in polls despite them trying to say gun owners
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:42.760]  are guilty for the dead 20 children which is incredible exploitation
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:45.800]  we're winning and a lot of leftist and women
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.800]  in fact i even saw a CNN story yesterday when i was out you guys
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:53.560]  type the other side of the gun culture women women
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:57.160]  uh moms with guns CNN it was it was out yesterday
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:34:00.520]  i've already told you this for years the women are getting into shooting
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:03.560]  groups the liberals are shooting and going wow this is
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.640]  good to have a gun and feel secure i have an instant access pistol safe
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:11.640]  my kids can't get to it it's biometric or it's it's a hand code
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:15.160]  and they read locally about women shooting intruders and
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:19.320]  or women who people try to rape out the parking lot women are getting empowered
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:22.680]  which i wouldn't call feminism i would just call being human
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.800]  defending yourself the feminists don't want that the
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:32.280]  they want you dehumanized uh defeminized
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:35.960]  unmasculated i guess if that's a word demasculated but it's not a masculine
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:39.800]  trait defeminized and then the state is your husband
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:43.320]  see the man gets out of the way and the state is the husband that's basically
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:46.680]  what this is but look at this la times article if you're watching on
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:56.920]  prisonplanet.tv alex jones and
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:03.560]  alex jones and other pro gun paranoid's put the nuts in gun nuts and this
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:09.080]  article goes on to say
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:14.440]  that i'm making it up no one wants to confiscate my guns
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:19.320]  now i've got diane feinstein i've got holter i've got obama i've got
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:24.920]  sarah brady i've got the quotes and video of all of them saying we want to
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:29.000]  take guns there should not be a right to own guns there is no second amendment
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.600]  remember they used to argue that there's a bunch of articles out saying i'm a
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.960]  nut because i said i know you want our guns pears morgan
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:39.160]  let's just get the debate out in the open here's the daily caller but it links
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:44.760]  through to the local newspapers where he makes the quote
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:48.520]  iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:51.240]  confiscation of semi-automatic weapons well
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:54.600]  quomo called for that in the new york times three weeks ago
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:59.880]  feinstein called for it iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:04.440]  confiscation of semi-automatic weapons in an interview with the daily times
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:08.040]  herald and carol iowa state rep dan
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:11.880]  mullaburr i think it's how you pronounce it said governments
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:14.920]  should start confiscating semi-automatic rifles and other
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:19.960]  firearms and other firearms down to 22 rifle
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:25.000]  we cannot have big guns out there out here as far as big guns that are out there
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.920]  the semi-automatics and all of them that's all of them
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:32.840]  mullaburr am i pronouncing that right told the newspaper
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:36.760]  during a december 19th audio tape interview we can't have
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:39.880]  those running around out there those are not hunting weapons see they say it's
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:42.680]  always about hunting that's their fake argument no it's about defending
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:45.240]  against tyranny we should ban those in iowa
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:50.120]  he then went on to say we'll go door to door street by street and get them
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:53.800]  we need to get them off the streets illegally and even if you have them i
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:58.840]  think we need to start taking them we can't have those out there
[1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:03.240]  and he goes on to describe how to take them door to door
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:08.360]  ladies and gentlemen now now remember i just showed you the la times you're
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:10.440]  a radio listener the headline is alex jones
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:14.360]  and other pro-gun paranoid's put the nut in guns and you read the article
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:18.680]  they say not once but twice we are imagining they want to take our guns
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:22.280]  all they want is crazy people not to have them
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:26.280]  and i was on pierce Morgan tried to get to this point but could never get to it
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.840]  because i was going to debate allen dirsch what's about it but they panicked
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:31.400]  and kicked me off
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:35.320]  they keep saying well shouldn't we be able to stop mentally ill people folks
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:38.840]  five times in the month before he tried to go in gun shops and buy guns
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.520]  he went to a gun show too and they wouldn't sell him a gun because in the
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:45.320]  nicks system a he looked crazy at the gun show so they are not
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:51.480]  not selling my gun to you okay because that's a private sale
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:54.520]  but at the places with the background check he'd been flagged he was in
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:58.360]  psychiatric care you go in and they flag you as dangerous whether
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:01.080]  it's right or wrong because they do a lot of veterans i think it's wrong
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:04.520]  you're that's it you can't buy a gun he was refused
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:08.520]  through the nicks system and what we've got clips
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:12.680]  of is uh biden the vice president saying we don't need to just ban gun shows
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:16.600]  in private sales private transfers period well that's what their bills do
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.200]  you can never transfer guns not when you die anything kind of like the death
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:22.680]  taxes can't transfer your money when you die
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:26.120]  they're saying can't transfer any guns period when you die
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:30.920]  you go turn them in and they want to and and and don't say they won't ban
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:34.200]  guns even though they can't enforce it like the drug war that's the whole plan
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:37.960]  is is now to pack the prisons with gun owners and have the purges of us just
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:42.360]  like the attorney general has said we need to make it like
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:48.200]  cigarette smoking a dirty thing others have said make it like us being a sex
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:51.080]  offender that's why they put your name out in the news when you're a gun owner
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:55.480]  when they have you registered they want to shame you in fact that's a quote
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:59.480]  he says we want to shame people and they're not owning guns
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:02.200]  well i mean aren't you ashamed of having all the bodyguards and carrying a gun
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:07.000]  you punk you gangster you thug who shipped
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.360]  20 000 guns into mexico to blame the second amendment
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:14.520]  that came out in the in the cbs news they got the memos first
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:17.720]  i didn't need cbs news to tell me that was done to blame the second amendment
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:23.160]  i had a dea source told me about it before it even broke selling a steel
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:28.120]  on record go watch the video he's been in studio
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:32.440]  years before fast and furious even broke
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.200]  because i'm here in texas and now it turns out the atf was actually
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:41.960]  shipping in 18 wheelers guns themselves to them they just when they started
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:43.800]  breaking because they just wouldn't go along with it
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:47.160]  they just reported on telling gun shops go ahead and sell to the illegals go
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:51.240]  ahead and sell to the coyotes they work for us oh we're going to track it that
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:53.800]  was their cover they were shipping 18 wheelers
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:57.080]  of hand grenades down there and this all comes out here in there in the news
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:01.240]  how are we being lectured by the fast and furious crew now
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:04.760]  and then they play this game of oh we don't want your guns
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:08.600]  and then obama signs the bill giving himself secret service and other
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:11.800]  presidents armed secret service protection of
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:14.840]  upwards of four million dollars a year per president
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:18.920]  for life normally it was only 10 years after now it's for life
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:23.240]  you say well that's reasonable hey most of us can't afford
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:26.680]  i'm going to tell you right now i don't want a bodyguard people around me all
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:29.080]  day plus somebody really wants to get you they
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:32.600]  can probably get you a lot of times it turns out to be the bodyguard who
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.680]  they actually approached me the one that kills you
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:37.880]  but i i mean i can't afford a really good bodyguard
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:41.400]  i'd rather put that money into the getting the news out
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:45.800]  i mean man i'm not going to start living where i've got a bodyguard with me
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:49.400]  i might need one just to watch my back now if i go to new york or something
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:52.680]  where they got goons trying to set us up just witnesses
[1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:55.640]  maybe like an entourage or something when i'm in public
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:01.320]  uh you know just to document things because they can set you up when you're
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.640]  alone
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:07.400]  but um
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:12.520]  we are going to go ahead now
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:19.960]  and we are going to uh play uh this clip this is a
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:27.240]  this is a uh clip that we're going to go to uh of mr steward and of course he's
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:30.680]  an establishment guy steward's his fake name so that you don't know his brother
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:34.360]  runs the new york stock exchange and this is a guy who's very funny very witty
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:37.000]  i like him at many levels but he's a globalist and he's anti-gun
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:40.280]  and he's up there broadcasting and transmitting from a city
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:43.560]  that says you can't own guns unless you're basically government mafia
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:48.120]  and he's saying alex is implying hitler is going to invade america no
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:51.560]  he thinks his audience is dumb i'm saying hitler style and now
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:56.680]  and all these others took the guns let's go ahead and go to that clip now
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:01.960]  so this isn't really about the constitution or efficacy of regulation or intruder defense
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.640]  it's about how perilously close some people in this country feel they're
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:08.840]  living to a tyrant's rule it's something we've seen happen
[1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:11.720]  time and time again in history with stalling
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:16.040]  happened in cambodia and then of course the third rite no one saw that coming
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:19.640]  until it was too late hitler took the guns stalling took the guns
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:23.560]  mal took the guns fidel castro took the guns you go shaves took the guns
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:27.400]  and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:30.840]  if you try to take our firearms
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:43.320]  no one's taking away all the guns but now i get it
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:47.480]  now i see what's happening so this is what it is
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:52.360]  their paranoid fear of a possible dystopic future
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:58.440]  prevents us from addressing our actual dystopic present
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:02.920]  we can't even begin to address 30 000 gun
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:08.280]  and i guess we need the full clip but it's not 30 000 gun deaths it's 11 000
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:12.120]  most of them gang bangers or suicide i've been breaking down the actual numbers
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.920]  i was seeing over 4 000 it looks like it's more like 3 000
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:19.160]  are actually people doing the murders uh or killing people i mean that's nothing
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:25.000]  in in in in 315 million people uh so again back that up a little bit
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.640]  because there were several steward clips i don't know that's the one i actually
[1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:29.960]  gave you problems i give you guys so many clips
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:34.760]  play play the steward part again for people because i want folks to hear that
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:37.720]  just just whenever you're ready or just play the whole thing
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:41.640]  so this isn't really about the constitution or efficacy of regulation
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:44.920]  or intruder defense it's about how perilously close
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:48.600]  some people in this country feel they're living to a tyrant's rule
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:52.760]  it's something we've seen happen time and time again in history it was stalling
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:58.040]  happened in cambodia and then of course the third rike no one saw that coming in until it was too late
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:03.000]  hitler took the guns stalling took the guns mal took the guns that el castro took the guns
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.360]  how many you go shaves took the guns and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:13.560]  if you try to take our firearms
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:15.480]  holy
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:25.560]  no one's taking away all the guns but now i get it now i see what's happening
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:34.600]  so this is what it is their paranoid fear of a possible dystopic future prevents us
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:40.920]  from addressing our actual dystopic present we can't even begin to address
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:45.640]  the yeah when i saw the full clip he goes on to say they think hitler is going to invade
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.560]  will somebody get me the full clip because i wanted to play it a couple days ago and never
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:54.200]  got around to it i want the i want the full thing because because the clip i want is where he says
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:45:00.520]  they're afraid hitler is going to invade no we're not afraid it's my fault i just got to review
[1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:05.080]  every clip we're going to play because we've just got so many they always get mixed up for whatever
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:11.560]  reason he goes on to say in my whole point of playing the clip that we believe he was just
[1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:15.240]  playing off youtube and then i've turned into a big rocket science deal we can just find it get
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:20.440]  to it and play the part he says that we think hitler is going to invade no no no we know the
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:26.200]  same megabanks that funded hitler stalin and mount did that that's what we know that's what we
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:32.600]  understand that's what we're aware of that's what's going on and plus he says we don't want the guns
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:36.760]  no one's going to take them they're talking about confiscating them the bills are introduced
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:42.360]  and he's still up there and another clip he talks about you know biden said nobody's going to take
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:48.120]  your gun and nobody is you can have your barretta pistol lots of handgun not a pistol it just shows
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:51.800]  the incredible ignorance now again we've already played this but here's a short clip of counten
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:46:02.920]  o brian where he is talking about how there was a debate between myself and pierce morgan
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:07.800]  and pierce morgan handled it very calmly and they put a gun in my hand animated if you're a
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:12.840]  radio listener people hear it shooting and it's firing and i'm firing it at him and the idea
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:16.760]  is the fact that i'm like hey governments have been tyrannical our government's clearly getting
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:22.520]  tyrannical you're not going to get our guns and the and the message is i'm the dangerous one
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:27.160]  and see that's how domesticated we've gotten you raise your voice to a foreigner tyrant liar
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:33.080]  and oh my gosh some conservatives said don't get in anybody's face don't wake anybody up no no no
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:39.560]  that's just how the country was founded don't ever get your blood pressure up just go to sleep
[1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:43.560]  be calm one of the clergy response teams that governments hired to tell folks to turn their
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:48.040]  guns in and submit to government they go just calm down do what's required of you do whatever
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:52.520]  the government says the government's our boss that's not what freedom is all about we didn't
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:47:04.360]  get all this freedom because our forebearers laid down here is the clip of counten o brian
[1:47:07.960 --> 1:47:13.080]  everyone is talking today about pierce morgan's interview last night with radio talk show host
[1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:18.840]  and conspiracy theorist alex jones he's the guy who started a petition to get peers deported
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:26.040]  from america now the two men debated gun control i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think alex
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:33.320]  was the one who took the pro gun position tonight i'll go head to head with a man who actually wants
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:39.320]  to deport me and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again if you're proud to take off
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:44.920]  firearms we will not relinquish them do you understand Stalin took the guns malakut the guns
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  and al-qastro took the guns you those guys took the guns
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:01.560]  what appears handle these yeah and the clip goes on to say i think pierce handled things quite well
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:08.840]  well so this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with as a society and as a culture
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:18.440]  and again this is how they sit there and try to try to misrepresent everything to everybody
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  this is how the power structure tries to manipulate the population and you know to go on and finish
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:29.160]  what john stewart said and the full clip he said hitler's you know going to be invading
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:34.680]  that's what we think no no we don't think hitler's invading we know we live in the worldwide center
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:40.440]  of a globalist empire that is full spectrum dominance against human populations the globalist
[1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:45.480]  fund all the major radical groups they fund our government the other governments they control the
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:50.920]  whole show through fiat they fund the radical muslims they put them in charge they have them
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:55.400]  menace us then they train the military and police to take on gun owners conservatives
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:59.800]  libertarians constitutionalist this is what we're dealing with
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:06.600]  this is the problem that as a society we face
[1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:14.680]  and their brain is into this crisis they're economically imploding things they want to
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.920]  make us poor so that we can never rise again against them this is all their stated plan
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:24.520]  but during this period of takeover they know we're going to get restless so they're gauging
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:30.760]  things they're and and and they're they're fine tuning things but their main message is
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:35.480]  you're discredited if you get upset and get involved and that's a self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:39.720]  they're like look at these kooks these tea party people want lower taxes and they all want open
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:45.480]  borders and they say healthcare has got death panels man they're in loons the bill has the
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.040]  death panels now they brag they're in there look at these kooks they say we want their guns but we
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:55.800]  don't they're playing psychological gas lighting games you don't know the psychological term
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:03.640]  gas lighting you haven't looked it up and that's just where you sit there and tell somebody you're
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:08.520]  not on planet earth you're on planet pop tartar they're like really i am yes you fell down and hit
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:13.240]  your head and some weak-minded people actually buy into it so they're up there going yeah we're
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:18.520]  going to take your guns but we're not we just said you were oh you crazy little man and then they
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:24.760]  make the whole debate about whether or not we're going into this level of control and again i'm
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:28.360]  going to do a special report with all these different clips together the bizarreness of it
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:32.040]  as i heard a clip yesterday they were playing me we'll play it later at virtual scows and pops in
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:42.040]  where howard stern and uh quivers his uh co-host were defending me and and saying they agreed with
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:46.920]  me uh very very strange to have them agreeing with me but i i guess they understand where the
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:52.760]  people are and that most people understand that guns make you safer uh especially because society
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:57.000]  is degenerating there's going to be a lot of craziness going on and so we need guns to protect
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:05.640]  ourselves stay with us hello i'm alex jones myself my family the info wars dot com team

[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:30.680]  again the establishment would not be coming after our guns right now
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:36.520]  unless they were planning a lot of nastiness here's the daily times herald
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:41.800]  ban and seize semi-automatic weapons boom door-to-door confiscation being called for
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:50.600]  and by the way that's in iowa it was arcadia iowa that the us army did a gun confiscation drill
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:55.320]  and it was in the paper they practiced taking over the gun shop arresting him in the drill
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:59.960]  and then going door to door and taking the guns and they got all 600 quote households
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:06.600]  estimated i don't know 3 000 people or whatever to let the army in each house to search for guns
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:11.560]  and then i read the article a few years ago on air it created a national stir and they had an
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:17.480]  article the next day saying the conspiracy theorist alex jones is a liar and a horrible person and
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:23.320]  caused a panic but i had the news article where they said they trained for gun confiscation and
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:30.520]  then i had the colonel on who admitted it and that's all in police state for the rise of fema
[1:55:32.200 --> 1:55:37.560]  two years ago came out very important film and you see that film from two years ago
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:43.800]  all of it's now coming true because i mean they said they would do it and that's what's so frustrating
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:51.960]  about all this is that this is real this is happening and i go and i get in the face
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.160]  of pierce morgan going i know you're coming after our guns tyrants throughout history have
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:03.800]  tried to get our guns and i'm not putting up with you is that clear you're on notice i mean
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.680]  which do you think george washington they talked to the red coast like that for years before it
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:16.440]  happened before the physical fight tall revere did the exact same thing and then some i'm telling you
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:19.960]  the average even conservative today because some conservatives a lot of them got mad at me
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:26.520]  they would probably want to put george washington in jail thomas jefferson benjamin franklin
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:39.560]  um thomas pain patrick henry all of them i mean i bet i bet if i drove with them with
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:43.640]  a car with bullhorns on the top of it if the army was coming door to door confiscating guns
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:49.240]  i bet if i drove through the streets of austin even in a conservative area saying they're coming
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:54.600]  to confiscate guns they're coming to confiscate guns prepare yourselves that a lot of people
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:59.000]  would come out and start shooting at me and would be proud when the police showed up and
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.920]  would salute them and say here's my guns and i killed alex jones in fact i know that would happen
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:12.360]  if paul revere had people like this so-called conservatives like this and libertarians in
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:19.960]  his day and age in 1775 he would have been riding through the countryside saying to arms to arms the
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:25.800]  redcoats are coming to confiscate the ball and powder and muskets somebody would open their
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:31.080]  upper window they'd slid a long rifle out and they would have shot him right there on the spot
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:36.920]  and then when the redcoats got there they would have saluted
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:40.360]  and handed their gun in
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:46.760]  and so that told me a lot about people that i don't know 20 30 percent of folks got real mad at me
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.280]  and said how dare you call him a liar how dare you get in his face and you know what hey may the

[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:46.200]  review of world war z which is a bunch of un world government propaganda we're going to premiere

[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:08.600]  certainly good news that that is now posted up at info wars dot com but we'll be premiering that
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:14.920]  on the radio coming up at the bottom of the hour i said i'd go to calls and i'll try to do that there's
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:20.920]  just so much news to go over here i've got a couple more news articles out today where people are
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:26.600]  being attacked in bars in pharmacies in businesses in their homes and they're defending and shooting
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:34.360]  the intruders but it's only ever in the local news that's why the real media the citizen media
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:39.400]  the alternative media that that is diverse doesn't mean we have all the answers but we are the real
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:45.640]  media we're media the globalists are fake media people are always trying to figure out a name
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:52.600]  prostitute media collaborator media globalist media corporates media collectivist media fascist
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:02:01.880]  media trader media neural order media anti-american media the cesspool media the sewer stream media
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:10.040]  the decepticon media how about just they're the fake media i mean that's really what it is they
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:16.680]  are the fake media and a lot of what they report on is true a plane crash a cat stuck in a tree
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:22.760]  how many inches of rain fell this week most reporters is doing their job but when it comes
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:29.480]  to policy and politics and punditry it is a bunch of spinning and obfuscation and outright lies
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:36.600]  and i for one am just absolutely totally 110 sick of it all
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:43.320]  and we are entering
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:51.000]  world government world government is being announced all over the news but we're told oh
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:55.720]  you're still crazy it doesn't exist oh yeah all these states are announcing bills to confiscate
[2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:01.000]  all semi-autos oh and there's bills federally introduced to do it
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:08.840]  but it's not going to happen people say yeah as we've heard you say that here today
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:16.360]  about 150 times we know okay well you better get that word out to other people
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:21.560]  because they're trying to tell you to not get angry and not get in their face and not call
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:27.000]  them liars they're trying to tell you that discredits you so that you just buy their propaganda
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:30.760]  and go oh that discredits me i better not do that because that's what is effective
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:39.480]  that's what historically has brought these people down over and over and over again
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:50.360]  oh man again i've had this uh chest cold starting to get over it here and
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:55.800]  it's kind of like a fireworks display it goes and fits and spurts
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:03.080]  and that was kind of a grand finale right there those antibiotics must just be absolutely
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:10.760]  killing that stuff because my chest just lit up on fire whoo excruciating pain is kind of uh
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:16.200]  i don't like it but at the same time it's kind of interesting phenomenon you know your little kid
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:20.840]  pain really really hurts because you don't know how to cut it off just understand well that's that's
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:27.640]  pain and then that's over there uh and just kind of ignore it but it's also hard when it's in your
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:33.080]  chest and you're on the air so excuse me there we come back we're gonna go to Joel Scowles and

[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:46.200]  time always goes quick with Joel Scowson political scientist by training specializing in philosophy
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:50.440]  of law and constitutional theory of course his uncle was a clion scowson who helped expose the
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:57.240]  how the new order controls communism and his book strategic relocation north american safe places
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:01.800]  is a bestseller in the patriot movement and we sell the third edition discounted with the new
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:06.040]  film we put together strategic relocation and info or store dot com i should add if you want to
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:12.360]  support broadcasting in an absolutely vital book and video together and of course he was also a
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:19.400]  marine corps fighter bomber pilot in vietnam era and also he's with the chairman of the
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:23.880]  conservative national committee of washington dc jones scowson dot com he's also the editor of
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:30.440]  world affairs brief and he joins us now i wanted to get him on last week but the gun thing happened
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:36.200]  so we moved him to talk about uh herman von rupee and others and there's video of this
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:43.080]  an article saying let's merge the e u with russia which uh the president of the check republic has
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:47.800]  said that's been the plan and that it's communism the globalists have always talked about creating
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:53.240]  three or four blocks and then merging those blocks but there is factions within those blocks and i
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:58.760]  agree with scowson's power breakdown but having the communist chinese come out official government
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:05.640]  tv and papers and say obama you need to wage a war uh against the second amendment that's a quote
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:11.080]  and having russia today suddenly flip and say alex jones is bad turn the guns in he's a radical
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:17.640]  uh and suddenly have you know all these foreign outlets saying we need to get the guns uh
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:23.560]  what does this signify uh the state-run media outlets suddenly becoming pro obama are they
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:29.800]  worried about a conservative libertarian retake of america why do they want a more socialist system
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:35.640]  here i wanted to get his because he does have considerable uh gravitas on the geopolitical
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:40.680]  interlockings uh to break that down but here it is bill derberg picked e u leader von rupee calls
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:46.120]  for global governance with russia that's the new american uh here's innocent blood demands no delay
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:53.160]  for us gun control people's daily out of china uh let's give up on the constitution new york times
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:57.320]  just get rid of it uh they're calling for gun confiscation door to door again they're just
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:02.200]  conditioning you to this idea doesn't mean it's coming next month or next year but it could be
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.240]  when you know the nuke goes off from another mass shooting but i gotta say i've said the time frame
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:11.720]  is longer i i think it's accelerating for whatever reason because they know our gun culture is winning
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:17.560]  okay so joel we don't have a lot of time obviously condense it down let's get first in the geopolitical
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:23.320]  and what all this signifies and the un treaty coming up and then and then you uh wanted to say
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:29.400]  something about uh mr hagman and his federal source and i mean the fact is we were falling
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:34.280]  around harassed a lot of it in new york they look like new york detectives to me not feds but
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:39.240]  you wanted to say something about supposed federal sources go ahead well let's cover that first
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:44.920]  so we can get that out of the way but you know the conservative movement has always been enamored
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:49.560]  by the fact that we might have one of our own inside government that's feeding us information
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:55.560]  and warning us about things doug hagman claims that he's got such a source uh who works in supposedly
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:12:01.720]  high level in dhs and he got involved in uh in your uh new york appearance with pierce morgan
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:06.120]  by saying that you were followed around and and obviously you know that that is true
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:12.280]  so you're too far this particular source in dhs has claimed several things that simply have not
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:18.040]  come through it's claiming the collapse of uh of the economy in 2012 which didn't come through and
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:24.840]  worst of all he claimed that a big black operation was quote going hot that was going to stop the
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:31.480]  election and bring a bomb in through uh through having no election uh and that didn't happen uh
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:36.360]  hagman confronted him in one of his interviews and he gave some offhanded excuse hagman didn't
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:41.960]  pursue it but it should have been pursued because um you know it really was wrong uh
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:47.960]  what was more disturbing to me which i covered in today's world affairs brief of his uh
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:54.040]  after the fact you know i'll tell you what joe we had good audio with you in the pre-interview
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:57.480]  and i think your computer switches to internal mic when you go on air i don't know why we're
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:00.840]  gonna have to go to phone only video skype we're gonna do that now we're not gonna
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:05.480]  we're not gonna have audio like that on air uh sorry um trying to work that out with him and
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:09.160]  i don't want to go too far off into this you wanted to mention and get into it we will
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:13.080]  i believe dug you know it has this source and believes what he's saying and i think joe what
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:17.800]  joe's told me off air is that he believes he has it too it's just that he thinks the guy is bamboozling
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:23.080]  that could be the case all i know is i've been given homeland security documents by state police
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:28.680]  by feds by others that turn out to be national news uh like the clergy response team documents
[2:13:28.680 --> 2:13:33.560]  that turn out to be absolutely accurate about training preachers in-regard documents uh myak
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:37.720]  report documents a homeland security about veterans and gun owners being the number one
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:42.600]  terror threat uh people could say well those guys leaked these to us because they wanted it out there
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:48.520]  because they're bad guys you know i talked to these guys on the phone some of them uh they've
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:54.040]  just gotten to a point where they don't care and i know that um people like wane madson have said
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:59.000]  that they've got whole nsa teams spying on people in government that's one of their main
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:02.760]  focus to make sure these leaks don't happen but they have a right and a duty to come out with
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:07.800]  all this so there is an attempt for this to happen but i i don't think it's impossible
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:12.840]  to ever have real sources out there who aren't just feeding you something because i know i've
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:19.160]  gotten stuff from real people who are in briefings get the documents go to the library and send me
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:24.280]  the pdf and i've had cases where i've had a preacher on with the clergy response team documents
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:30.280]  and they get called in at the hospital the next week where they go and do ministry
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:37.400]  by fema threatening them so uh i mean what joel saying does happen too they go after you
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:43.160]  but i mean i mean so so so certainly they are tracking people joel is right okay joel please
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:47.160]  continue go ahead well that's what i'm saying alex is there's no way this guy could keep
[2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:53.480]  talking to doug haigman out of school uh warring them about things or even revealing um what should
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:59.000]  have been a legal operation of harassing you in new york which opens up homeland security anyone
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:05.560]  else for uh you know civil rights violation uh he can't keep doing that uh and claim that they
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:11.720]  don't know about it i mean they surveil everything and when it's published openly on uh info wars
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:17.720]  dot com certainly we know that the government reads everything you put out you're the biggest
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:22.680]  target they have they're not going to let somebody continue to talk to haigman and then to you
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:29.000]  without shutting him down if in fact he is on our side if he's not on our side if he's playing it
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:34.680]  which i think he is uh and and that uh that curveball he threw about the election but just playing
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:40.760]  um uh targeting us to get this credit well you know they also line up for big things just to see
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:44.680]  who in the federal government will go along with it and tell people things are going to happen
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:48.440]  even though it's not a hundred percent they kind of take the safety off but then they don't pull
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:55.240]  the trigger of they they scrap mission so that happens too all i know is this over and over again
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:16:00.680]  we've found out that at homeland security it's a click of weird women to say the least dominating
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:06.760]  men harassing them and the government settled so they a lot of it is they're getting so disorganized
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:11.640]  up there and so many people don't like what's happening i mean i know you know you've studied
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:17.080]  this you've had family in and around fbi you name it that that that you have contacts and you believe
[2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:22.760]  they're more more organized i'm not saying you're wrong that he couldn't be being played but i'm
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:27.240]  also saying that there's a i mean look at the hookers and the secret service and maybe something's
[2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:31.480]  behind that too to compromise them but i mean well you heard my point what's your take on that
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:38.280]  well they're always having to do damage control you know look at the sandy hook shooting i mean
[2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:43.560]  to send eric holder up there to have a secret meeting with all the state police he basically
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:46.440]  is setting down the law this is the matter of national security if you've seen things that
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:50.760]  don't match the official story you just shut up about it he was quieting the opposition had to
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:56.040]  deal with that all the time but they're also consolidating more and more at the top levels
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:01.880]  and there is no dissent at the top level uh perhaps the only thing that really got out of hand with
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:09.640]  general petraeus and he ended up by getting snookered by a muslim agent from lebanon and got
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:15.880]  close to general john allen as well and boy that was a very embarrassing thing for the military
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:21.400]  petraeus had to go he was a big player they had big plans for him but he made a mistake so they do
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:27.800]  have to do damage control but i don't believe uh you know that they're uh you know losing power i
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:32.120]  think they're even more confident oh no i agree that they're accelerating their power but at the
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.200]  same time just because they're winning the race doesn't mean their NASCAR isn't smoking and
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:42.840]  having problems now now now expanding on that you were just hinting at anomalies i mean this
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:49.080]  wasn't just five-year-old saying they saw multiple shooters this has a lot of really bad signs so does
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:54.760]  colorada and look at all the timing and they do seem very arrogant right now about the guns what do
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:18:00.840]  you see happening well as i pointed out in today's world fairs brief uh they don't have the votes in
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:06.040]  my opinion to ram through all the gun control they want they're going to get what they can
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:14.680]  but that's the main reason why they're pushing for an executive order that's a sheer admission they've
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:20.520]  made that play twice now that's a sheer admission that they don't think they have the votes and i've
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:24.600]  looked at the law of what you can do with an executive order and i want to be very clear
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:32.760]  obama cannot legally include other weapons in class three weapons like machine guns
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:37.880]  by executive order he cannot do it it's not legal now that doesn't mean he can't do it and get away
[2:18:37.880 --> 2:18:43.240]  with it if the courts let him but there's no way that an executive order can actually change law he
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:49.400]  can direct federal agencies to implement the law he can tweak that a little bit he can't add weapons
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:55.480]  and just to be clear um level three firearms are full auto you gotta get a background wave your
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:19:01.080]  rights get a stamp they are wanting to include the semi-autos in level three and just say by
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:07.080]  executive order those are all added in i believe that will cause resistance if they do that i'm
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:14.280]  really concerned well it won't cause the same kind of resistance is that they tried to do something
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:18.920]  uh you know uh blatant confiscate guns that would really as you you know correct it pointed out
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:23.560]  that's going to cause a revolution they're not going to be dumb enough to do that besides you
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.200]  can't do confiscation until you have registration first so that's the first thing they really want
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:35.320]  to have this gun ban is to get a list of expanded banning and then have this new form of registration
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:41.480]  which is grandfather you can be grandfathered if you agree to register and take your fingerprint
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:45.960]  that's right exactly it brings you in to get you on record so they know how to come take it we're
[2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:49.320]  going to come back and talk about that and then i got to get your take on the geopolitical but

[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:24.600]  but joel just finishing up and condensing it all they're moving really fast on the guns
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:31.000]  i'm seeing a lot of signs of arrogance from them talk of confiscation they could want to go ahead
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:36.440]  and start a conflict here to paint libertarians conservatives christians as radicals we know
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:41.320]  homeland security was set up for that i know you think the timeline is is longer i hope that's the
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:46.200]  case but they're moving really fast finish your point on the guns well it almost looks like
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:50.920]  they're moving fast when they build up a a manufactured crisis like the bandy hook and
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:55.960]  they're trying to take as much advantage as they can it's going to move to do the debate
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:25:01.320]  to about 20 to 30 percent in a direction which is very very dangerous still at the bottom line i
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:06.440]  don't believe that there's very many congressmen they get away with uh you know we know what happened
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:12.280]  to the democrats in 1996 they lost big because they voted for that assault weapon ban and if it
[2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:16.840]  happens again i don't know if any republicans or very many they're going to get away with voting
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:22.600]  but now there's a lot of election fraud which can trump that and they know that there's an
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:27.800]  awakening happening so they want to head it off at the pass i think with preemptive uh crises i mean
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:34.360]  i think that's in the cards well i think there's about a frankly about a 40 to 60 chance against
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:41.640]  being able to pass in congress a major i agree but they're going to go if that doesn't pass they are
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:47.000]  going to go with the uh an executive order and boy i just don't believe that congress has the
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.920]  guts to impeach over the illegal use of the executive order that's right and we've got to
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:57.000]  drive because they want to make us come to the atf and re-register turning a right into a privilege
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:01.240]  we've got to move towards congress to block that now geopolitically what's happening with all this
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:08.520]  realignment we see happening well first of all no major new world order with rush is going to
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:14.120]  happen without war i'm i'm absolutely convinced of that what we're seeing in the new new american
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:20.520]  peace bill berg picked u leader von rompoy calls for global governance with russia and this doesn't
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:27.080]  mean that that's even close to a uh you know they're floating this uh as uh as a peace initiative but
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:33.400]  there's a it's kind of a double handed back uh hand here in other words the west has continued to
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:38.840]  play like russia is an ally and this is part of furthering that deception that russia is an ally
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:44.200]  another ally in order to pain weakness to give russia more confidence that we're stupid that
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:49.960]  we're incompetent that we can infiltrate the inner openly letting russia infiltrate uh the e u and
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:55.800]  nato uh but it's only to facilitate an eventual third world war it's not because they're ever
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:27:00.840]  going to get complete global sure they're suckering them out that's right they're sucking in now
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:07.320]  let me just say it is very important the the globalist at bill berger or at the bill berg
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:12.120]  conference this is really kind of a leadership conference for that bringing along the up and
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:17.720]  coming leaders and exposing them to globalist viewpoints and testing how they react to that
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:22.760]  they bring in not only bona fide globalist but they also bring in people from the socialist
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:28.760]  international which is tied to moscow and that's important different now uh for example tony blair
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:32.280]  was a full-blown member of the socialist international i believe was a marxist thing
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:38.120]  thing with javier solana and they bring them into to bill de berg because they want to feel
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:43.400]  make the communists who are associated with social and feel like we're giving in to them that we're
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:50.040]  that they're snookering us they're playing soft they're playing accepting they're playing blind
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:56.360]  so at any given time we don't really know when they attend bill de berg even if they've been a
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:01.400]  socialist international if they've switched sides and become true globalist now i think
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:06.600]  tony blair actually did switch sides i think he was marxist socialist internationally switched
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:12.440]  side and became a full-blown globalist brock obama was marxist became a globalist was bought out and
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:16.680]  that's where that you can tell sure they use marxism they use marxism to take over but it's
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.360]  globalist on top that's exactly from carol quickly's own book what they do in closing why am i starting
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:30.600]  to getting attacked by european tv radio and british and especially russian why are the russians
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:37.240]  coming after me well first of all the russians are playing uh have been playing the game through
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:43.560]  rt through e u times which is the phony kgp front they've been facilitating and helping out the
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:49.560]  conspiracy movement here in the right wing almost as if they want to foment this civil war between
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:56.280]  what they do is the right wing and the government and right now you are the prime leader of that
[2:28:56.280 --> 2:29:00.760]  movement and that's why pierce morgan target you to to go after you and try to discredit you
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:05.800]  and that's why the russians are after you but there's a another side to that too there are the
[2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:11.640]  free market people out there in uh in russia like uh stanislav ishii which wrote you know americans
[2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:16.440]  don't give up your guns uh you know no we talked to him no no there are a lot of good russians
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:22.760]  that's why we want to stop this globalist russian engineered war is there any way to stop that i don't
[2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:28.440]  believe there is i think it's coming not only because the russians want it but the the american
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:34.040]  angle american establishment the globalist as we call them wants that war and you can't get to a
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:38.280]  full integration and loss of american sovereignty without that war i tell you what this is a 14

[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:27.240]  three days ago i saw the article now to prob that used to be a complete
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:32.760]  outlet of disinformation the joke was hey our local papers as bad as prob though
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:39.720]  which i guess means truth but more and more it's like really good analysis anti-globalist
[2:33:39.720 --> 2:33:43.640]  and there's a guy that calls himself basically a white russian that means you know a wants to
[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:48.920]  go back to the old czar monarchy which has been the russian culture for a thousand years or so
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:55.480]  but he says your government and your banks funded the marxist that came over here in 1917 we were
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:34:01.240]  all armed that's how we beat napoleon and that's how we fought hitler because all the guns hadn't
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:06.360]  even been taken by them people hit them and it's just a shame that you're run by these people
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:11.720]  and to see that in provda because that's what you've exposed and your uncle clion scowls in
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:16.920]  that's what carol quickly later confirmed what your uncle had written about with the mega banks
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:22.200]  were actually funding authoritarians and communism in closing what do you make of
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:29.000]  of the russian starting to tell the truth like that what does that signify well first of all i
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:33.560]  was really surprised the first time i've seen someone out of russia recognize the role of the
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:40.440]  globalist in financing communism and i mean he said very clearly if it had not been for russia
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:46.440]  oh for washington's clandestine support of and for the red history would have gone quite differently
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:53.560]  they cut off the arms to the white russians they refuse to allow any military aid to be sent to them
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:58.440]  they sabotage them it was just like what they did with mal they brought malta power by sabotaging
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:05.000]  cutting off military aid chank i check but what i want to say in in conclusion is that there is a
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:10.680]  major division between those who understand this one believes that because they have facilitated
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:16.680]  communism they own communism they run it they control it and i don't agree with that i believe
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:23.320]  they're co-predators buying to control a new world order which they each want to control the west
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:29.160]  is going to use war to destroy national sovereignty so that's why they're building the best enemies
[2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:36.440]  that money can buy is dr stan monty says they built marxism in in in china they gave russia the first
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:43.080]  nuclear weapon weaponized uranium in order to build the first they helped create hitler i mean a lot
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:48.760]  of that came out as you know with congressional uh congressional uh hearings well listen i want to
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:54.200]  get you back sometime for a full hour to go over cleon scowson's research and your updated research
[2:35:54.200 --> 2:36:00.600]  jolscowson to talk about how they funded hitler anthony sutton's research that helped congress
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:06.680]  how they funded uh the communist in china and in russia and how they're funding the radical
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:12.840]  muslims today to get your detailed geopolitical breakdown of the past the present and the future
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:17.400]  jolscowson thank you so much for spending time with us my pleasure elix all right now all right
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:26.520]  bye-bye there he goes got that update uh from uh him this is from uh genesis some of our new
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:36.440]  affiliates that are turning the broadcast on um wtny 790 am watertown new york and that is very
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:43.400]  very exciting to have that new station uh and again i will plug several more on the sunday

[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:55.480]  and we need to focus also on some of the stations that have already been carrying us but
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:37:00.680]  uh a lot of new affiliates uh picking up the broadcast praise god okay i want to go to this
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:08.120]  report on world war z because it it ties into the dehumanization you know we see um people
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:13.480]  like bill marr saying kill people more shootings more killings you know more car wrecks more death
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:19.800]  more abortion uh on hbo a few months ago but then he says ban our guns for 20-head kids
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:23.480]  the globalists are not liberals they say they're liberals they want lower population
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:29.080]  and this zombie meme now being pushed by the marines and pushed by fema and pushed by cdc
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:34.200]  is to sell you the general public or ugly zombies now the video of this is extremely powerful if
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:39.640]  you're a radio listener uh but here's the audio also very powerful for radio listeners but radio
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:44.120]  listeners go to prison planet dot com go to info wars dot com you can see it now video
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:51.960]  secrets of world war z leaked here is that report and we'll come back with howard stern uh and his
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:58.280]  co-host uh saying that they agreed with me on this robin quivers saying they agree with me
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:06.840]  on the second amendment but pretty amazing uh here it is the secrets of world war z leaked
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:14.520]  what is the message behind world war z we're going to leak those secrets right now
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:20.520]  um
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:33.400]  the core of the book is a un plan developed to use survivors as bait to lure in the zombies
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:40.920]  so they can be exterminated the number one enemy in this disgusting pro genocide anti human
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:49.000]  publication is that humans that have not submitted to communism and the united nations are undesirables
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:55.400]  that are worse than the zombies as the globalists prepare the worldwide collapse they must condition
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:00.760]  the public that humanity is ugly and needs to be killed those of you lucky enough to be behind
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:07.480]  the compact cities shouldn't complain and should do any marks as job you're told after all only
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:13.880]  that can defeat the zombies world war z is a regurgitation of the same message we've been
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:21.640]  hammered with our whole lives the un is the planet's savior humanity is the world's enemy
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:28.600]  only world government will save you from the disgusting zombie filth that is humanity
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:35.160]  the globalists have publicly bragged that they engineered world war one world war two
[2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:39.720]  to create the league of nations in un and the begin the destruction of the nation state
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:46.280]  so if world war one and world war two or wars against the nation state and national sovereignty
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:56.280]  world war z is a psychological warfare simulation declaring war on humanity itself
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:04.360]  with humanity as the enemy and the un as the savior let's talk about brad pit who was in a
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:12.600]  bidding war with leonardo de caprio over the book world war z we've analyzed it and i can say
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:21.160]  unequivocally this is a manifesto of united nations worldwide genocide against nation states and
[2:40:21.160 --> 2:40:29.400]  individuals it is a declaration of war and a sacrament to planetary bloodlust and the new world
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:36.360]  orders wish to reduce world population in brief synopsis the book begins with the disintegration
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:42.600]  of the world civilizations by an outbreak of zombies and the world transforming itself under
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:50.680]  un leadership as a single international union to save humanity under marxism and the extermination
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:57.560]  of all american gun owners from the book world war z that's when the un multinational force
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:41:02.440]  was created and we were pleasantly surprised by how many people signed up in the first week
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:09.000]  the biggest enemy for this communist un takeover our domestic secessionist of the united states
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:16.840]  the ribs only welcomed you with gunshots the brass had special units for ribs i saw them on
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:21.800]  the road once crossing the black hills that was the first time since the rockies that i ever saw
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:30.600]  tanks bad feeling you knew how it was going to end the ultimate crime is owning a gun not under
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:37.640]  un control those that submit and turn in their firearms are called robinson carousos and are
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:43.640]  given a nice job at the force labor camp the body armor was for protection against some of the
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:52.440]  regular people we found i'm not talking organized rebels just the odd lmoe or last man on earth some
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:59.000]  dude or chipped and managed to survive most of the time we managed to talk them down those we called
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:06.760]  rc's or robinson carousos that was the polite term for the ones who were cool if the un concludes
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:13.400]  that you are not a communist socialist you are used as bait to lure in zombies because you are
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:21.480]  the number one enemy before you can be used as slave labor you must submit to reeducation camps
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:29.240]  they actually call them reeducation camps from the book this was the national reeducation act
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:34.920]  i'd say it was the largest jobs training program since the second world war and easily the most
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:41.960]  radical in our history this is a way to roll out authoritarianism and make it sexy and fun and
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:50.280]  condition the public that this type of mass murder is okay this film talks about man my dad was
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:57.160]  smart he loved marxism and now that we've got marxism under the un it's so great yeah we put people
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:03.240]  in labor camps yeah we put them in reeducation camps he used methods that were almost marxists
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:08.120]  the kind of collectivization that would make and ran leap from her grave and join the ranks of the
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:15.560]  living dead i've always rejected the wisdom he tried to impart running as far away as wall street
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:21.880]  to shut it out now i'm racking my brain to remember it and if they didn't do what they were told they
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:29.000]  were killed god there's such a beauty to that yeah i guess if you're a dirtbag psychopath or somebody
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:34.280]  worth hundreds of millions of dollars like brad pit who's married to that angel of death whose
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:41.480]  brag she loves death and evil angelina joe lee who travels the world to hype up nato invasions
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:46.600]  and al-qaeda invasions of free countries where they line up blacks by the tens of thousands like libyan
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:52.440]  kill them or they attack syria for 22 plus months and engage in all sorts of evil and there she is
[2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:57.960]  saying it's humanitarian kill them kill them when she's not making an illuminati tomb raider film
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:05.800]  after all they're all just arab zombies just like in this movie trying to get over the israeli wall
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:12.520]  anyone that's infected with the virus black vans come around and snatch and grab you and throw you
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:19.400]  in them to take you away and kill you so it is pure conditioning for snatch and grab it is pure
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:26.440]  operant conditioning and preparation to get the public ready for unbelievable evil and you're
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:33.640]  told you will serve the megastate you will serve the greater collective of the supreme un soviet
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:41.320]  or you will die quoting the book world war z the ribs on the other hand armed organized political
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:48.680]  secessionist they were easily our most tangible danger he would say in private these must be
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:54.760]  eliminated swiftly decisively and by any means necessary these were the enemies of our country
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:45:03.240]  the domestic ones a floating un command center off the coast of hawaii consisting of 72 delegates
[2:45:03.240 --> 2:45:09.800]  controls the fate of the world nation states of the problem the un's got the answers
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:17.000]  i know i caught a lot of flak for going un instead of making an all american crusade
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:19.640]  but to be totally honest i really couldn't give a damn
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:29.720]  throughout history militaries and cultures have demonized their enemies and said that they're
[2:45:29.720 --> 2:45:36.200]  not human now the whole of humanity is being caught that were worthless that were garbage
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:42.920]  that were ugly part of the un's agenda 21 is to teach us that humans are bad for the earth
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:47.320]  and that the world would be a better place without us that we are ugly parasites
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:55.880]  i covered in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement or the elite openly talk about how
[2:45:55.880 --> 2:46:03.960]  they're going to set up a police state surveillance control grid worldwide to carry out the orderly
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:11.560]  extermination of 90 percent of the world's population with the united nations as the prime
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:18.280]  organizer and nato as the physical enforcer and in all these documents they talk about
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:25.960]  releasing or allowing the release of weaponized mousepox and other pathogens like airborne
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:33.000]  Ebola that will take out more than 90 of the people that come in contact with it and during
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:40.440]  an event like that you're going to see civilization level collapse and so the ruling class worldwide
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:46:45.640]  is setting up seed vaults underground bunkers putting trillions of dollars in the aggregate
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:51.000]  of taxpayer money in europe and the united states australia new zealand other western countries
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:57.480]  into building incredibly resilient heavily armed underground shadow government systems
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:05.320]  and i said a decade ago this zombie fascination was being pushed into humanizes and get us ready
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:12.920]  with kind of a racial memory ahead of the fact so that we will accept as prophecy at a subconscious
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:20.200]  level the mass culling of humanity films like world war z are meant to program people that
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:28.600]  they're lucky to serve as slaves of the un and not be exterminated once these bio weapons are
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:36.680]  released and the zombie archetype is just a cover to demonize and dehumanize anyone who's
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:44.440]  even suspected of being infected of bio weapons plagues the globalist are publicly preparing
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:51.080]  to release on the planet you see for the new world order world government is just the beginning
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:59.320]  once that panopticon surveillance control grid is in place the mass extermination begins only
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.360]  what has more apocalyptic visions planned out for years to come steven spielberg just started
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:10.840]  shooting robo apocalypse scheduled to be released in april of 2014 here a deadly supercomputer
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:15.800]  concludes that human beings are too much of a threat to life on earth in an attempt to save
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:21.240]  all non-human life on the planet arcos the supercomputer decides to eliminate the human
[2:48:21.240 --> 2:48:27.160]  race with just a few human specimens to be left alive sounds like the eugenesis program this
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:34.680]  computer this is how they introduce the sick ideas to the population through fiction it's the same
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:41.720]  thing that hitler did it's the same thing the soviets did it is beyond monstrous this is
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:49.960]  undoubtedly a globalist propaganda production oh isn't that cute the australian prime minister's
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:57.000]  tongue-in-cheek zombie apocalypse warning right as the megabank shine the world and their peoples
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:03.080]  onto 1.5 quadrillion right as they shut off the power plants and cut off the oil
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:11.000]  go look at it for yourself the cdc and homeland security online describes people
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:19.160]  who get sick during a pandemic as zombies and they show the us army in america mowing down
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:24.600]  american citizens how would they ever introduce something like that to the public there'd be a
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:30.840]  revolt but if they do it like hey get ready for zombies we're gonna have to mow some people down
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:35.720]  you better get the vaccine they say in here or you're gonna get killed by the army
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:42.600]  how would the government ever present the army and the police mowing people down the street
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:49.560]  oh they didn't get their flu shot so they're zombies and they have to be killed and then meanwhile
[2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:57.080]  we have all over the united states and in other nations the military training and martial law
[2:49:57.080 --> 2:50:02.760]  civil unrest drills in major cities and the combatants that don't want to give in to the
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:08.200]  un takeover why they're not even human they're zombies so when the troops practice mowing down
[2:50:08.200 --> 2:50:14.440]  us citizens we're in football jerseys well they've got some makeup on some green makeup and some
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.640]  swine so they weren't really human so the next time the troops actually pull the trigger on real
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:25.560]  citizens during the engineered collapse well they were zombies anyway they're teaching people
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:31.400]  that ancient thing that tyrants and corrupt militaries have done of dehumanizing their
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:38.040]  enemy before they kill them the same thing was done by the soviets in poland and in ukraine
[2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:44.120]  where they killed tens of millions they said these people are animals the nazis said the jews
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:49.320]  and others weren't human the communist chinese said the same thing about the shop owners they
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:56.920]  forcibly collectivized and put in slave labor camps you are a fool if you don't understand
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:03.320]  that the new world order does not want you to be in the future they want the planet's resources
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:09.480]  for themselves they want the hard work and the scientific developments the free humanity has
[2:51:09.480 --> 2:51:17.880]  developed to be their spoils they want you dead and people like brad pit and angelina joe lee
[2:51:17.880 --> 2:51:28.200]  are nothing but propagandists selling the population on mass genocide and megadeth world war z is a
[2:51:28.200 --> 2:51:35.560]  declaration of war against free humanity i'm alex jones you have been warned and if you

[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:22.360]  some others but he and robin quivers are pretty nice towards me you know they they place that
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:26.760]  they think is entertaining but robin agrees with the second amendment uh here that you know that
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:31.640]  they just want our guns to enslave us uh pretty amazing and of course howard acts like he doesn't

[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:42.920]  already going back down again since i'm not on there and he says he wants to debate again uh but
[3:00:42.920 --> 3:00:48.760]  i've called his producers and they've not called me back so uh he by the way had a protest or a
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:54.440]  fronion slip he had a rally for him yesterday that four people showed up he tweeted it out as a big
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:00:59.880]  victory for him uh just unbelievable uh let's go ahead and go back to the howard stern clip

[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:15.560]  against any kind of gun control i like that guy that is the best yeah well he's some sort of i think
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:21.160]  he even has a radio show the guy you know he seems to have some facts and it's not right you know
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:26.120]  but it's just funny when guys are yelling and peers peers is calm and the guy's screaming yeah
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:31.000]  this is some other clips that are pretty good let's try again how many gun murders were that oh

[3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:48.360]  no that guy's great but good good show peers i you know it appears to get a lot of you know
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:53.880]  and i told you i like peers well you better thank that guy they better be on together every night
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:59.080]  yeah they should bring that guy back whatever his name is alex jones okay
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:06.200]  hey he did start talking to peers in a british accent did you want to hear that yeah okay
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:13.240]  and then it goes on from there yeah i mean i knew that that that if he got in my face i was
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:17.480]  going to get in his face but i did plan that i told uh rob do was with me i said he goes
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:21.400]  right i said are you gonna blow up at him i said no i'll debate him on facts he lets me get to my
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:27.800]  facts but i would say okay our crime rates down over 20 violent crime by the way i was that was
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:31.960]  general violent crime i was watching fox news this morning and i'm gonna go dig this out because
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:35.720]  they were showing fbi.gov the same place i go the problem is there's literally hundreds and
[3:02:35.720 --> 3:02:41.320]  hundreds maybe thousands of pages on there they've got all the local towns cities all the reports all
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:49.240]  of it and it's good government numbers because it's locally gathered and i'm watching this morning
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:53.480]  i bet a lot of you saw we got to find that clip and put it on youtube because it's it's amazing
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:03:01.000]  and they've got uh stromboli on there uh what's what's his real name roldo herrera uh yeah and
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:04.360]  he's saying let's just you know ban the guns whatever they're going but look at these fbi
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:10.760]  numbers gun crimes down 59 percent and they showed the years and i'm sitting there and it was the
[3:03:10.760 --> 3:03:16.840]  same fbi site but i hadn't dug into all of it i'm like oh my gosh i've done it again i've i've
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:24.600]  i it's so incredible what the revolution of guns taking over has done i mean it is incredible
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:28.680]  that's why they're panicking because if we all get guns and crime rates go down to nothing
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:33.400]  then their whole gun grab plan is over that's what they're trying to get it all right now
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:37.640]  so i got to find that remind me right when the show ends i've got to go dig that up
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:41.880]  uh because it was just but they were showing it and i'm like well i said 20 something percent
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:51.800]  it's 59 on the guns 59 percent drop unbelievable let's play that clip again of conan o bryan
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:56.200]  implying i'm going to shoot everybody putting a animated gun in my hand uh everyone is talking
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:04:01.320]  today about pierce morgan's interview uh last night with radio talk show host and conspiracy
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:08.040]  theorist alex jones he's the guy who started a petition to get pierce deported from america
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:13.720]  now the two men debated gun control i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think alex was the
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:20.200]  one who took the pro gun position take a look tonight i'll go head to head with a man who actually
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:27.240]  wants to deport me and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:32.440]  we will not relinquish this do you understand Stalin took the guns mail took the guns and
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:38.840]  he took the guns he took the guns all right that's enough here's what i'm saying pierce is calm
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:46.120]  uh by the way i'm going from memory here watching fox news this morning and and it's either 49 or 59
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:52.040]  the point is it's not 27 percent that's a violent crime the gun crime it's either 49 or 59 we got
[3:04:52.040 --> 3:04:58.040]  to do a story on this i mean this is incredible they were showing the fbi website areas i hadn't
[3:04:58.040 --> 3:05:03.640]  found we got to dig that up
