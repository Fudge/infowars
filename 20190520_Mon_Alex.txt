[00:00.000 --> 00:28.560]  here we are another live global transmission Monday May 20th 2019 I am
[00:28.560 --> 00:37.400]  your host Alex Jones the globalist model themselves after the Jacobins that
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.480]  triggered and started the French Revolution and they were a group an
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.720]  organization whose own internal documents later admitted didn't want human
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.160]  liberty or freedom but wanted absolute control over all aspects of humanity who
[00:51.160 --> 00:56.520]  wanted to overthrow the old existing church and system of royals and in its
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.960]  place install absolute dictators over every facet of human life they are a
[01:02.960 --> 01:07.800]  priest class that seeks to create a final revolution or a total and complete
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.680]  domination of the human species forever by capturing the human species in
[01:12.680 --> 01:16.800]  artificiality now when you see the internet the way it's been designed when
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.280]  you see globalism when you see high-tech cities and all of these systems that
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.560]  are basically creating false environments for us artificial environments
[01:27.560 --> 01:34.360]  that are dehumanizing us that are making us weaker stupider slower fatter more
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.000]  feeble and where people haven't just been enslaved they've given up without
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.400]  even giving up they've given up without even knowing that they've given in they
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.080]  have no drive they have no life force they have no fire in the eyes how was
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.880]  this done how was this plan how was this carried out you know the pope just
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.560]  last week said there's some mysterious evil throughout history that hurts
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.200]  humanity and then wants to destroy us now I previously said that there is no
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.520]  devil that didn't work so he came out as well I didn't mean that but there he
[02:08.520 --> 02:13.240]  was again saying it what is this mysterious mystery of evil that the
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.160]  Bible talks about of course he plagiarized he didn't say it was from the
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.880]  Bible he was saying that this mystery this hidden hand this dark force that
[02:21.880 --> 02:27.720]  wants to hurt us is it some type of subconscious kill switch is that what
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.360]  the monsters of the id are talked about no ladies and gentlemen the pope's out
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.800]  today calling for world government and of course once you have world government
[02:37.800 --> 02:41.800]  you have world cashless society and if you haven't been a good little globalist
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.220]  they're going to turn your global ID that's biometrically accessed by a face
[02:47.220 --> 02:54.160]  scan or a hand scan off the mark in the face or on the hand by the way I was
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.800]  thinking about this just last night I'll talk about when come back how out of the
[02:59.800 --> 03:05.800]  gates as soon as the cashless society is almost getting here they're not waiting
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.200]  to slowly incrementally do it once it's here it's almost here they're already
[03:10.200 --> 03:15.720]  announcing at Mastercard and at Visa they're already announcing at Facebook
[03:15.720 --> 03:21.680]  with with online banking that your behavior will govern how many goody
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.760]  points you get and if you're not a good little globalist and don't have your
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.680]  five-year-olds you know report for sex education to learn how to be
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.760]  chemically sterilized well then you have your credits taken away but if you let
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.040]  your child be sterilized well you've got a good decade or so not even having to
[03:40.040 --> 03:46.640]  work and luxury cruises around the world this is the official plan being
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.520]  announced you take all 100 something vaccines they want you to take why you're
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.660]  gonna have a great social score you don't well you're not gonna be able to set
[03:56.660 --> 04:01.240]  one foot outside your house then they're gonna take your house then there's gonna
[04:01.240 --> 04:04.280]  be such a homeless problem in the future you're gonna be taken to a work
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.640]  brigade facility where you're going to then be euthanized after all we're the
[04:08.640 --> 04:12.360]  socialist system we can't pay for all these homeless people that's why they're
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.200]  ballooning the homeless problem so that it becomes such a huge problem we then
[04:16.200 --> 04:20.320]  accept exterminating them which has been the admitted plan it's all problem
[04:20.320 --> 04:26.240]  reaction solution we're gonna be talking about it all today this is gonna be a
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.320]  broadcast you do not want to miss we're gonna have Caitlyn Bennett and Millie
[04:29.320 --> 04:33.280]  Weaver who are here in Austin in studio they're going to be co-hosting the
[04:33.280 --> 04:39.400]  fourth hour today and so much more than the war room 3 p.m. central as well with
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.440]  I would stroyer and don't forget to have a night weekday mornings 8 a.m. central
[04:43.440 --> 04:48.520]  the three hours right before I kick off all right strap yourselves in the most
[04:48.520 --> 04:53.600]  banned verboten demonized broadcast in the world because we're over the target
[04:53.600 --> 05:00.000]  and we're dead on let me carry the light in the dark of the night I'm Alex Jones
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.640]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the
[05:05.640 --> 05:13.720]  Western world's history this is a digital AI enforced gag order not to say
[05:13.720 --> 05:18.720]  the name Alex Jones are in four wars dot com
[05:21.360 --> 05:26.920]  this is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr. president
[05:26.920 --> 05:33.840]  we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as
[05:33.840 --> 05:39.120]  a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family
[05:39.120 --> 05:44.320]  populist organization so they thought first they come for Alex Jones then
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.920]  when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like Domino's would fall
[05:48.920 --> 05:53.280]  the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a
[05:53.280 --> 05:57.040]  standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they could
[05:57.040 --> 06:03.880]  take us down they'll take everybody else down we are transferring power from
[06:03.880 --> 06:10.560]  Washington DC and giving it back to you the people
[06:10.560 --> 06:22.680]  Americanism not globalism will be our credo yes I have thought an awful lot
[06:22.680 --> 06:28.240]  about growing up the White House huge nationwide protests erupted once again
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.360]  on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office
[06:33.360 --> 06:43.440]  when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice when
[06:43.440 --> 06:51.480]  America is united America is totally unstoppable
[06:52.680 --> 06:59.640]  and most importantly we will be protected by God from the bloodlines of the
[06:59.640 --> 07:04.760]  info it's Alex Jones
[07:29.640 --> 07:42.520]  it's Monday May 20th 2019 I'm Alex Jones your host we have a lot of huge
[07:42.520 --> 07:45.800]  breaking news and developments big guests in studio you name it but first I
[07:45.800 --> 07:51.880]  just want to state this so it's clear and on the record Bible prophecy whether
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.080]  you believe in revelation or not whether you believe in the God of the Bible is
[07:55.080 --> 08:02.560]  being used as a template of the world government cashless society grid and so
[08:02.560 --> 08:08.560]  just as humans envisioned in Nules Verne's books 150 years ago traveling to
[08:08.560 --> 08:13.800]  the moon and we've now done it or just as people imagined a thousand years ago
[08:13.800 --> 08:21.120]  airplanes in the sky that humans would fly in we've now done it or they imagined
[08:21.120 --> 08:24.880]  back in Star Trek in the 1960s your little communicators and of course a few
[08:24.880 --> 08:33.440]  years later we'd already done it what we imagine we're able to build and ladies
[08:33.440 --> 08:39.880]  and gentlemen a cashless society world governments here Sweden is almost
[08:39.880 --> 08:48.080]  completely cashless now and Sweden is now talking about passing laws where you
[08:48.080 --> 08:53.240]  have to have a microchip to get on a bus or a train and they're already
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.840]  microchipping people to get on buses and to get on trains and giving them
[08:58.840 --> 09:06.920]  discounts if they do it remember a decade ago they had the digital angel and
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.040]  they'd have these swing clubs where you have the downstairs club and the club
[09:11.040 --> 09:17.880]  with all the sexy girls you had to get a microchip to get in the VIP area they
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.080]  had it in Florida they had it in areas like Barcelona Spain so it's always been
[09:24.080 --> 09:32.880]  a carrot or the stick situation and way back in 2015 we first reported on the
[09:32.880 --> 09:39.720]  Chinese social score first on air now that Chinese Communist social score or
[09:39.720 --> 09:52.360]  mark of the beast is going worldwide and out of the gates in 2018 2019 hundreds
[09:52.360 --> 09:56.840]  of prominent nationalist hundreds of prominent conservatives and now it's in
[09:56.840 --> 10:03.060]  the thousands are losing their mastercard losing their visas they're
[10:03.060 --> 10:07.760]  having their bank accounts cancel on them and they're saying to people when
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.400]  they call the bank we notice you bought a bunch of guns or we notice you went to
[10:13.400 --> 10:21.400]  the NRA convention now LA's passed the law where if you're a member of the NRA
[10:21.400 --> 10:27.680]  that's your own private membership or is it six million strong or so should be
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.440]  a hundred million that you won't be able to get a city contract total
[10:32.440 --> 10:38.440]  discrimination for your political beliefs totally criminal and if you're a
[10:38.440 --> 10:43.640]  radio listener while I speak the crew is just search engineering everything I
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.360]  say and pulling up mainstream articles so I'm not making this up this is really
[10:47.360 --> 10:54.240]  happening last year I was given a hate leader designation by the Southern
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.560]  Primary Law Center whose word is taken as God worldwide criminal offshore
[10:59.560 --> 11:06.720]  organization all sorts of CD past all the hundreds of millions that they rake
[11:06.720 --> 11:13.120]  in trying to foment fake racism and I was put in there as that designation and
[11:13.120 --> 11:16.480]  then suddenly bank account or bank account that I'd had for decades in
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.720]  merchant accounts with perfect credit scores I have no criminal record I have
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.520]  really good personal credit and I had a basically as good a credit this was a
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.440]  thing it's perfect as good a credit as you can get in banking in merchant
[11:29.440 --> 11:34.680]  banking as good a credit we don't take loans any of that stuff we pay our bills
[11:34.680 --> 11:40.960]  we pay our debts we instantly transfer the money in and out we play by the book
[11:40.960 --> 11:47.880]  ladies and gentlemen they said that we are a criminal terrorist organization no
[11:47.880 --> 11:55.160]  judge no jury total defamation slander whatever you want to call it to
[11:55.160 --> 12:00.120]  prohibit me from the market and now they announced two weeks ago that major
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.000]  credit card companies are going to appoint Southern Primary Law Center
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.960]  trained human rights commissions inside each company who will watch what you do
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.640]  and what you buy and that they will then penalize you these are SJWs this is
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.040]  what you get college degrees for now to censor the internet to watch what people
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.800]  do to watch how they buy and sell if you're a mainstream media reporter you
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.000]  get access to YouTube to Google to Twitter to Facebook's internal algorithms
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.640]  and data they get access to your accounts this is all come out in the
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.280]  notion and then they are your minders they are your controllers they are the
[12:40.280 --> 12:45.200]  people that will then oversee you and run your life and it's going to go down
[12:45.200 --> 12:51.280]  to every facet of what we do if you don't send your children to the sex
[12:51.280 --> 12:53.960]  education when they're five where they're going to teach your little boys
[12:53.960 --> 12:56.880]  and they're really little girls that they should be sterilized that's in the
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.200]  news today you will be given a bad social credit score if you don't take the
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.520]  hundreds of vaccines you'll be given a bad social credit score if you go to the
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.640]  wrong church you'll be given a bad social credit score this is it we are
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.040]  living to see the mark of the beast manifest and there's there's not an
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.720]  outcry there's not a word being said by your mega churches there's not anything
[13:21.720 --> 13:26.680]  being done about it and we're just sliding over the edge down the slide
[13:26.680 --> 13:34.280]  in to the abyss we're going to cover it all today it's here everything you do
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.520]  tracked in real time everything put into a global score every fast of your life
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.080]  chronicled and then even people that submit completely they're going to
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.880]  notice there's more and more added to what they're supposed to do and how
[13:48.880 --> 13:52.960]  they're supposed to live and the technocrats controlling it can put more
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.120]  restrictions on someone if they want or less even if that person is complying
[13:58.120 --> 14:04.560]  and submitting they're going to still drive you into the ground because that
[14:04.560 --> 14:10.800]  is the essence of what these globalists are establishing so it's here and people
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.960]  better organize against it they better say no to it they better resist it and
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.640]  they better start setting up alternative systems encounter it because the Bible
[14:19.640 --> 14:26.760]  says the beast system will come up and be live for one hour one hour now it's
[14:26.760 --> 14:34.800]  all archetypal there and encoded but one hour means generally about a year and
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.080]  near in that time most the earth's point a planetary population will be
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.120]  exterminated 2,000 years ago that was written plus 2,000 plus years ago and
[14:46.120 --> 14:50.880]  then notice magically the world government wants to depopulate the earth
[14:50.880 --> 14:57.160]  today everything revelations and Daniel Old Testament New Testament Ezekiel it
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.840]  all ties together it's all right there in black and white and that's why there's
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.320]  the war on Christians that's why they want anybody shut down that talks about
[15:04.320 --> 15:10.080]  this because it's all there the total world government beast system is coming
[15:10.080 --> 15:15.920]  it's almost here and out of the gates it's manifesting and it's politically
[15:15.920 --> 15:21.560]  going to target certain little political subgroups first that aren't popular with
[15:21.560 --> 15:27.200]  with with the technocrats and their minions and and then once they've been
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.360]  shut down and destroyed the precedent set for everyone it's here it's
[15:31.360 --> 15:37.720]  incredibly dangerous and it's still amazing though and exciting to know that
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.880]  Bible prophecy is being fulfilled world government cloned humans the break up
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.640]  of the family all of it foretold all of it planned all of it here and yes folks
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.200]  it's not just the evil ones taking the Bible and using as a blueprint no there's
[15:54.200 --> 16:01.520]  a master behind this most of you know that heart disease is the number one
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.120]  silent killer in the US what if I told you for just 54 95 a month you could

[17:59.320 --> 18:03.320]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.560]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[18:08.560 --> 18:12.920]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[18:12.920 --> 18:18.640]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s
[18:18.640 --> 18:22.520]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:22.520 --> 18:27.200]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.440]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the
[18:31.440 --> 18:35.920]  fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[18:35.920 --> 18:41.000]  seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.080]  antihistamine. In fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.560]  blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[18:49.560 --> 18:54.120]  inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.120 --> 18:59.760]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.760 --> 19:06.200]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA region 6 you're on the air worldwide
[19:06.200 --> 19:10.240]  Stacey. Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say I just want to let
[19:10.240 --> 19:13.520]  you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all I was turned on to the
[19:13.520 --> 19:17.200]  ultimate female force I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.920]  root things like that that I trust you know because I've seen a lot of other
[19:20.920 --> 19:24.120]  vitamins they don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're
[19:24.120 --> 19:26.920]  often not things that are natural I appreciate that. Well what happened with
[19:26.920 --> 19:29.560]  ultimate female force tell us about it. Well it's really great you know it's
[19:29.560 --> 19:32.840]  like a multivitamin I take it it tastes good it doesn't have that nasty
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.040]  aftertaste it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and you know it
[19:36.040 --> 19:39.040]  just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day so I really like it.
[19:39.040 --> 19:42.320]  Well just so you know we look at whatever the best herbs are they're known to
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.200]  turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it so yeah
[19:46.200 --> 19:52.080]  stamina, libido, energy these are amazing things and ultimate female force so I'm
[19:52.080 --> 20:04.520]  glad you plugged it. Infoorstore.com or CRIPLE-8253-3139 you're listening to the
[20:04.520 --> 20:07.960]  Alex Jones show
[20:07.960 --> 20:27.120]  Welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones show here's what it comes down to whether
[20:27.120 --> 20:35.400]  you believe in God or not whether you believe in Jesus or Buddha or Satan the
[20:35.400 --> 20:39.480]  fact is we're on a planet out here in deep space we can invent incredible
[20:39.480 --> 20:44.920]  technologies what ancient man envisioned is basically all coming true and
[20:44.920 --> 20:49.800]  revelation is being fulfilled before the global cashless society is even
[20:49.800 --> 20:56.720]  firmly in place but right as it is about to arrive big tech across the world is
[20:56.720 --> 21:02.440]  working with authoritarian regimes like China to track and trace and oppress and
[21:02.440 --> 21:11.200]  control their populations and futurists back in the 60s 70s and 80s predicted
[21:11.200 --> 21:17.080]  that when computers could get down to the size of a phone that they'd be hand
[21:17.080 --> 21:22.160]  held and would dial into larger computers to give you maps to give you
[21:22.160 --> 21:28.120]  reviews of restaurants and to give you instant digital credit the problem was
[21:28.120 --> 21:33.520]  it would then give the companies that control that incredible control over
[21:33.520 --> 21:37.960]  where you went and what you did if that was turned off and it would allow
[21:37.960 --> 21:42.160]  monopolies to form that then could basically make you completely dependent
[21:42.160 --> 21:46.720]  on it and look at how people don't even know how to grow vegetables or do a
[21:46.720 --> 21:52.640]  arithmetic with a pencil or sew their own clothing we are becoming beyond
[21:52.640 --> 22:01.680]  domesticated educated idiots that are basically drunk on entertainment and
[22:01.680 --> 22:08.960]  anesthetized on alcohol and drugs so all of this is here and from the very
[22:08.960 --> 22:14.400]  beginning of the cusp of the cashless society it's being immediately used to
[22:14.400 --> 22:21.040]  target nationalist conservatives Christians traditionalist people that
[22:21.040 --> 22:24.560]  don't want to turn their children over to the social engineers and all that
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.360]  news is coming up people that think 5g is bad even though all the scientists
[22:28.360 --> 22:33.040]  have said it's deadly people that again are saying these people to opt out their
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.400]  children from sex education in the fifth grade in California teaching little
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.880]  girls they're really little boys serious stuff to break down the family and
[22:42.880 --> 22:47.360]  reduce population something top Democrats are coming out now and admitting is
[22:47.360 --> 22:54.920]  what they want they want to reduce population they want to reduce fertility
[22:54.920 --> 23:00.040]  they want to bring all of this control in feminist writers this family must be
[23:00.040 --> 23:06.120]  abolished to dismantle capitalism so I was poking around doing some research on
[23:06.120 --> 23:10.080]  some of the interviews I saw decades ago predicting all of what ended up
[23:10.080 --> 23:15.440]  unfolding and I found one of them on a very interesting page on YouTube of a
[23:15.440 --> 23:20.600]  famous filmmaker David Hoffman it's Alan Weston who died a few years ago a
[23:20.600 --> 23:27.720]  privacy expert and he wrote down in 1979 basically how all of this was coming
[23:27.720 --> 23:44.000]  but how you have to give up your privacy to do it so watch this I want to talk
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.480]  first about how individuals have some of the capacities for being helped by
[23:50.480 --> 23:55.080]  technology if we only as a society knew what we wanted to do I talked about the
[23:55.080 --> 23:58.360]  dilemmas of people who run organizations but before we get to individual
[23:58.360 --> 24:03.600]  rights there are lots of things we could do with the technology if we as a whole
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.960]  society decided that we want to use it that way for example supposing that at
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.720]  every street corner or at stores located throughout a city you had terminals
[24:13.720 --> 24:19.360]  and you could find out which store had been cited for violations of price
[24:19.360 --> 24:25.160]  gouging which restaurants had roaches found by the health inspector and all
[24:25.160 --> 24:29.120]  of the information that's stored in government files and stored supposedly
[24:29.120 --> 24:33.040]  for consumer protection was really out there so the average person could see
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.360]  it and if you think ahead just a little bit to cable television and two-way
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.360]  communication you could eventually see that being in everybody's home so that
[24:40.360 --> 24:45.200]  before you went out to eat you could dial up the restaurants to see who were
[24:45.200 --> 24:50.200]  health violators or any of those kinds of things for example many of my friends
[24:50.200 --> 24:54.040]  believe that the home computer is the great engine that's going to unlock
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.560]  this if we have in the next ten years reduce the cost of computing so much
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.120]  that for the cost of a typewriter or even the cost of a medium-price calculator
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.040]  you'll be able to have your own home computer and you can link this by the
[25:09.040 --> 25:14.240]  cost of a telephone instrument to other computers this would open up a whole
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.880]  new way of people relating to others then the question will be why do people
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.280]  want to do that what purposes will it serve and that's a whole open area that
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.080]  we just don't know anything about yet the middle class for example has
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.080]  opportunities that as a result of information technology make life you
[25:33.080 --> 25:38.040]  know very very happy for them for example I can go to San Francisco and if I
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.680]  want to buy a suit for $200 I can flash a little piece of plastic and get
[25:42.680 --> 25:47.400]  instant credit and that's possible only because a telecommunication system can
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.440]  identify me make sure I haven't exceeded my floor limit for American Express or
[25:52.440 --> 25:58.640]  Visa will make sure that my balance is within the range of unpaid balance that
[25:58.640 --> 26:02.440]  they permit me and so I get my suit that's a tremendous convenience I can
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.320]  get an airline reservation with instantaneous accuracy and I'll get the
[26:07.320 --> 26:12.120]  seat I want and all those kinds of things but the problem is that the knowledge
[26:12.120 --> 26:18.520]  that would enable many people to know what they need to know in order to
[26:18.520 --> 26:25.040]  function better as consumers as voters as people who are trying to function in
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.640]  ways that are different than the traditional ways of getting information
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.000]  and using information I don't think we've begun to explore what some of those
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.600]  kinds of things would be how did this privacy issue arise quickly what I'm
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.080]  really asking is where people always concerned about privacy or has there
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.720]  been a change and why has this change occurred in information technology play
[26:48.720 --> 26:53.640]  any role in the change a lot of people have thought and have read the signs to
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.240]  in their judgment to prove that the American public is willing to give up
[26:58.240 --> 27:02.120]  its privacy or that it's becoming accustomed to losing its privacy and
[27:02.120 --> 27:06.920]  that when the trade-offs are all looked at the public is after all more
[27:06.920 --> 27:10.680]  interested in getting better services and having criminals caught and having
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.000]  terrorists looked out for then they are and having their privacy well that's
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.480]  just not true there was a study done by Lewis Harrison associates called the
[27:19.480 --> 27:24.640]  Sentry privacy study that I was an advisor on and we asked people how
[27:24.640 --> 27:30.080]  concerned they were about threats to their own personal privacy and 64% of
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.320]  the American public said that they were very concerned about threats to their
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.000]  own privacy and two-thirds of the American public said they now see
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.240]  privacy as something which should be added to life liberty and the pursuit of
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.520]  happiness at that fundamental a level of value in the society and that we're
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.000]  now learning how to enact laws and how to get organizations to put rules in
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.400]  place that will protect the patient in the hospital the consumer in the
[27:56.400 --> 28:02.640]  business community the employee on the job the taxpayer in relationship to tax
[28:02.640 --> 28:07.680]  authorities or the welfare client so that's Alan Weston a famous futurist
[28:07.680 --> 28:11.760]  and that's outtakes from the documentaries so that's pieces that
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.000]  never even made it on PBS but but there he is laying out what we should have
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.360]  done but notice there's no discussion or debate about an organization saying
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.520]  okay well MasterCard can deny NRA members a right to have a MasterCard now
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.800]  that's where they say they're going see first it's Gavin McGinnis and it's Alex
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.960]  Jones then it's you oh it's a private company no no there's only a few big
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.120]  companies now they're consolidating total control the owner of Twitter is one
[28:39.120 --> 28:44.440]  of the biggest people consolidating digital banking and and they're openly
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.040]  saying no if you're a conservative or Christian you're gonna starve to death
[28:48.040 --> 28:52.840]  on the street the left has been planning this for a long time they were
[28:52.840 --> 28:58.960]  never for free speech now they're making their move with total control
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.880]  heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high

[35:57.080 --> 36:00.760]  else is coming up because uh i usually don't even get to a lot of
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.360]  the top news that's on info wars dot com and news wars dot com because i'm
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.920]  dealing with bigger thematic issues like a world government system tracking
[36:08.920 --> 36:11.640]  everything you do controlling what you do
[36:11.640 --> 36:18.280]  and controlling what other people do and then downgrading your social score
[36:18.280 --> 36:22.040]  if you haven't submitted to the system and then they can continue to put more
[36:22.040 --> 36:26.680]  and more controls on by increments making you do basically insane things
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.120]  which is what control freaks want throughout history when civilizations go
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.400]  insane as they tend to do when they get long in the
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.360]  tooth now here's an example my wife had some
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.040]  family in town and we're driving along in the car
[36:42.040 --> 36:47.560]  yesterday going to get lunch and they start talking
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.400]  about the black mirror episode the first black mirror episode like four
[36:51.400 --> 36:57.080]  years ago where the woman goes crazy
[36:57.080 --> 37:00.200]  everybody has a social score that you can see in live time
[37:00.200 --> 37:03.080]  and if you're not just a perfect little person that submits to whatever the
[37:03.080 --> 37:06.440]  corporate norms are you get downvoted and you basically become
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.080]  homeless and starved to death and she finally just goes insane
[37:11.080 --> 37:14.760]  well we reported on the chinese social score two years before that report
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.320]  was ever put on black mirror or three years so people always say to me oh
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.760]  black mirror black mirror because they were asking yeah we hear how you're
[37:22.760 --> 37:26.440]  getting banned everywhere and we hear how they took you off paypal
[37:26.440 --> 37:30.280]  and a bunch of other places wow did they get that from black
[37:30.280 --> 37:33.720]  mirror and you know i like her family they're nice folks they're smart people
[37:33.720 --> 37:37.000]  they're professionals but you know i almost throw up
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.760]  because everybody's just comfortable about it oh like black mirror
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.840]  no not like black mirror like planet earth baby
[37:44.840 --> 37:48.520]  this is real and they think you're cowards they think when they start doing
[37:48.520 --> 37:51.880]  this what they're starting to do well i better not be an nra member
[37:51.880 --> 37:55.960]  that's the next target well i better not be a trump supporter i mean they'll
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.800]  dump a milkshake on my head or coffee or they'll punch me in the nose or they'll
[37:59.800 --> 38:03.640]  take my bank account they've already got your kids
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.000]  they're already sexualizing them and bringing convicted pedophiles
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.640]  to your schools unannounced for your kid to sit on their lap
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.520]  it's a raw exercise of power
[38:18.040 --> 38:23.080]  and so we must realize how bad it's gotten now eisenhower warned about this
[38:23.080 --> 38:26.600]  in 1961 in his farewell address days before
[38:26.600 --> 38:30.200]  kennedy was sworn in the full speech is 21 minutes
[38:30.200 --> 38:32.440]  long i've aired it several times over the years
[38:32.440 --> 38:36.120]  everybody always only hears the military industrial complex part
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.920]  the trump by the way just brought up yesterday that's coming up
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.240]  but he really talked about a technological elite
[38:43.240 --> 38:47.640]  that are in control of darpa and all the research money and how it's dangerous
[38:47.640 --> 38:50.360]  because they're able to direct civilization
[38:50.360 --> 38:53.720]  where you think you have free market and you think you have competition but
[38:53.720 --> 39:00.520]  what you have is an oligopoly a combine big tech ruling your life
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.800]  more powerful than king george the third ever imagined
[39:03.800 --> 39:09.160]  more powerful than adolf hitler or joseph stalin or mousetung ever imagined
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.400]  and those very tech powers are now openly allied
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.800]  with the chai cons themselves who are the heavyweight champions of mass murder
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.640]  here it is akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes
[39:23.640 --> 39:28.520]  in our industrial military posture has been the technological revolution
[39:28.520 --> 39:35.240]  during recent decades in this revolution research has become central
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.440]  it also becomes more formalized complex and costly
[39:40.440 --> 39:44.200]  a steadily increasing share is conducted for by
[39:44.200 --> 39:50.360]  or at the direction of the federal government today the solitary inventor
[39:50.360 --> 39:56.280]  tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists
[39:56.280 --> 40:03.240]  in laboratories and testing fields in the same fashion the free university
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.960]  versatility historically the fountainhead of free ideas
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.840]  and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution and the conductive
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.160]  research partly because of the huge costs involved
[40:17.160 --> 40:22.440]  a government contract becomes virtually a substitute
[40:22.440 --> 40:28.360]  for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.040]  new electronic computers the prospect of domination of the
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.000]  nation's scholars by federal employment project allocations
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.760]  and the power of money is ever present and is gravely
[40:42.760 --> 40:49.160]  to be regarded yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.720]  as we should we must also be alert to the equal and
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.880]  opposite danger that public policy could itself
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.800]  become the captive of a scientific technological elite
[41:03.800 --> 41:07.720]  is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.320]  and to integrate these and other forces new and old
[41:11.320 --> 41:14.440]  within the principles of our democratic system
[41:14.440 --> 41:18.440]  ever aiming toward the supreme goals uh let's stop right there
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.400]  see you never hear the real speech you only hear about the military industrial
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.160]  complex he explains that's controlled by the technocrats
[41:25.160 --> 41:27.720]  now if you go read the debauches statements the last decade they say
[41:27.720 --> 41:30.600]  we're technocrats we don't want elected governments anymore
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.840]  we want to control you pull up type in bloomberg
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.280]  the ultimate technocrat and then a big bloomberg article about him
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.600]  wanting to control your life because he knows best they're very arrogant
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.440]  about this now and so again right as this society
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.760]  comes into its full fruition they're immediately going to abuse it like we
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.520]  were always warned by eisenhower and by
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.160]  john the revelator on the isle of patmos and by your own common sense
[41:59.160 --> 42:03.160]  there it is the great technocrat politico
[42:03.160 --> 42:06.680]  another article in bloomberg about it i mean it's all there
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.840]  the president just warned you of the technocrat that means the dictatorship
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.600]  of the technocracy and now big tech spawned by the federal government
[42:14.600 --> 42:20.040]  has merged with china doesn't even respect our government anymore
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.120]  and believes that we're obsolete believes we're been beaten already
[42:24.120 --> 42:28.760]  and maybe we have been because if people go quietly into this dark night
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.000]  and just let them do whatever they want then i guess we deserve what happens to
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.840]  us it really is incredible the forced inoculations are here
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.040]  the forced gmo's here the force 5g is here and they admit all of it kills us

[47:43.160 --> 47:47.480]  of control being rolled out against the public
[47:47.480 --> 47:51.720]  because there's a larger global plan that's what davos is all about
[47:51.720 --> 47:55.560]  that's what bill berg is all about that's what these systems
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.320]  are all about and in that there is orthodox radical
[47:59.320 --> 48:04.680]  expansionist islam being used to invade western countries
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.040]  i want to air an extremely powerful greg reish piece

[48:23.560 --> 48:26.600]  this country down but she came here as a refugee
[48:26.600 --> 48:30.520]  married her own biological brother to do it
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.280]  but hates the country she tried to get into
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.360]  it's an oxymoron but that's what the universities
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.360]  and the systems are establishing is what they call
[48:42.360 --> 48:49.240]  liberation theology hating the west turning brown people into hardcore
[48:49.240 --> 48:53.720]  anti-white racist anti-westerners it's the mega globalist
[48:53.720 --> 48:59.560]  reverse colonizing the west to destroy the egalitarian ideas of the west
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.720]  of building up the world and having a global industrial
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.520]  renaissance based system the technocrats don't want a pro human
[49:08.520 --> 49:11.800]  future that's why they're bringing in the 1.8
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.520]  billion muslims that are incompatible and that's why the great law of europe
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.160]  and the great law of america now is don't talk about what muslims are doing

[49:56.040 --> 50:00.760]  the truth the media doesn't want you to see incredible tommy robinson footage
[50:00.760 --> 50:03.800]  of the police standing down while a thousand muslims that came from all
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.480]  over england came to attack him families in with babies and
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.080]  strollers are attacked we have that footage coming up but this
[50:11.080 --> 50:14.760]  is what's happened to europe and what's coming to america
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.000]  and the media and the police in europe are on the side of the jihadis
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.600]  part of the larger plan the technocracy from on top
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.440]  the university's brainwashing in the middle with the media and islam from
[50:26.440 --> 50:28.520]  the bottom and in the end we all have a giant
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.680]  anti-human war that reduces population it's all been scripted
[50:32.680 --> 50:37.720]  it's all been planned here's greg rees's report
[50:37.720 --> 50:43.160]  what is insurrection a rebellion or rising of citizens or subjects in
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.360]  resistance to their government in 2017 the justice democrats and
[50:48.360 --> 50:51.800]  brand-new congress seek to undermine the democratic
[50:51.800 --> 50:57.080]  system by electing fake politicians antifa is conspiring with the mexican
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.440]  cartel to stage an armed rebellion at the border
[51:00.440 --> 51:03.800]  and democrats continue pushing for open borders
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.200]  while patriots are silenced on the internet this all qualifies
[51:08.200 --> 51:11.640]  as insurrection but there is something far more deadly
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.920]  that has been taking root within america for decades
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.720]  islamist terrorist compounds have been found all over the country
[51:19.720 --> 51:23.400]  training for islamic jihad with the election of donald trump they believe
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.240]  that their end times prophecies that they believe in are now being fulfilled
[51:27.240 --> 51:30.520]  donald trump is part of a satanic jewish conspiracy
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.440]  and they are preparing for the camps to be raided and to fight back

[51:38.760 --> 51:41.800]  was involved in the first world trade center bombing
[51:41.800 --> 51:46.520]  and has clearly stated his support for islamic jihad islam is better than a
[51:46.520 --> 51:50.280]  democracy in time the so-called democracy will crumble
[51:50.280 --> 51:54.600]  and there will be nothing and the only thing that will remain will be islam
[51:54.600 --> 52:00.680]  his son was found training children to be terrorists in new mexico and alabama
[52:00.680 --> 52:05.240]  young children in a philadelphia mosque were found singing songs about killing
[52:05.240 --> 52:14.280]  and torturing non-muslims
[52:14.280 --> 52:29.320]  muslim clerics are openly calling for jihad
[52:44.840 --> 52:50.760]  experts on islamic jihad have warned us there is no place in the world where
[52:50.760 --> 52:54.840]  muslims have come that they haven't started wars against the non-muslims
[52:54.840 --> 52:57.560]  why do we think we're going to be different the leader of the iranian
[52:57.560 --> 53:24.120]  nationalist movement has warned us the islamist movement has been very clear
[53:24.120 --> 53:28.040]  and their goal and that is to establish their own caliphate
[53:28.040 --> 53:31.880]  on the other side the left not only sympathize with them
[53:31.880 --> 53:36.440]  they're applying democratic values onto an extremist group that doesn't
[53:36.440 --> 53:40.760]  believe in democracy they want sharia law despite these dire warnings
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.160]  our elected officials have continued to support islam
[53:45.160 --> 53:49.480]  we have a congresswoman who openly supports islamic jihad should be
[53:49.480 --> 53:52.680]  reassess the way that we are dealing with al-shaba
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.120]  her constituents in minneapolis want sharia law
[53:56.120 --> 53:59.080]  in america do you feel more comfortable living under
[53:59.080 --> 54:03.000]  american law or do you feel more comfortable living under sharia law
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.640]  uh sharia law i'm a muslim i prefer sharia law
[54:09.640 --> 54:14.920]  sharia law yes you prefer sharia law over american law
[54:14.920 --> 54:20.280]  of course yes of course and do you find most of your friends
[54:20.280 --> 54:23.880]  say how you feel the same way yeah of course if you're a muslim
[54:23.880 --> 54:27.000]  he can make his daughter marry somebody yeah he isn't right to kill somebody
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.280]  who sold to muhammad yeah because she is just uh she had the religion i understand
[54:32.280 --> 54:35.080]  because she shouldn't beat up the president you know and they don't even
[54:35.080 --> 54:37.400]  want to live here do you have a choice would you rather live here
[54:37.400 --> 54:38.920]  or would you rather live in the muslim country
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.080]  i'd rather live in muslim country with my people would you prefer to live in america
[54:43.080 --> 54:46.760]  or prefer to live in somalia for me i think it's Somalia do you rather live
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.880]  in america or live in somalia i'd rather live in somalia for those who are not
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.760]  brainwashed by the mainstream media insurrection is clearly happening in
[54:56.760 --> 55:00.600]  america and president trump invoking the insurrection
[55:00.600 --> 55:05.880]  act is clearly within america's best interests i believe that president trump
[55:05.880 --> 55:09.320]  is is one of the best things that have ever happened to the white house
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.640]  this is very very serious you have a president that will really go after the
[55:13.640 --> 55:20.120]  extremists and not care what anybody else thinks islamic jihad will never end
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.040]  unless we start fighting back but the point i'm getting across
[55:24.040 --> 55:30.040]  is that we are trying to treat a person humanely when they're not human
[55:30.040 --> 55:33.960]  they're not human we come to america warning the christians
[55:33.960 --> 55:37.800]  the christians don't want to listen to what they want us to do
[55:37.800 --> 55:43.560]  if i'm telling you i fled from this guy and this guy is now moving next door
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.320]  and you're telling me i'm a slaver for how can i help you
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.160]  if we want to be realistic the only medicine for ices
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.080]  and their likes is when the christians rise to defend europe
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.280]  and defend their sacred sites and their churches
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.120]  that's the only way that these people will wake up

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.640]  and most the last hour than i heard greg rees report
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.360]  it's really important president trump is basically threatened to attack iran
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.680]  after iran threatened military strikes now iran is saying
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.280]  never threaten an iranian try respect i mean come on iran
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.640]  constantly threatens to attack and blow up us targets the middle east
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.560]  i don't want this to happen though and i don't want war with iran
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.240]  and i don't want war either in the whole thing with venezuela
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.200]  i'm just simply pointing out that the whole situation
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.680]  is continuing to deteriorate
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.880]  and it fits into this whole global model where you have the technocrats trying
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.200]  to escalate the world into a planetary crisis
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.400]  so that's all coming up in the next segment
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.400]  we're also going to get to what's happening with the invasion of europe
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.640]  and i want to explain something i personally don't want to hate people
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.080]  from the middle east and i personally don't want to be at war
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.640]  with muslims and i understand there's a larger
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.960]  globalist plan for a clash of civilizations
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.400]  but if your daughter gets kicked down a subway
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.240]  stairs by a group of islamists because they think you know that she's a
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.640]  profane you know dog creature because she's a christian or whatever
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.760]  the police or the media try to cover it up and that's wrong
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.280]  and so if a horde of radical islamists are coming down your french street
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.360]  or you're having your crosses taken down on the coastline of greece
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.000]  because it's offensive to muslims that's war and that's wrong
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.760]  i understand it's a manipulated collision
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:23.240]  i understand it's a manipulated clash but it doesn't change the fact if you're
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.040]  on the receiving end of it and capitulating to it
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.000]  and going along and saying oh islam's great it's a religion of peace
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.440]  there isn't a class of civilizations happening only adds the globalist
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.000]  program we must be honest about the cancer
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.520]  that has become islam in this current permutation
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.960]  and the fact that the globalism is cancer and the fact that
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.480]  the left system is cancer and the fact that
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.280]  mainline churches that just want to be country clubs
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.080]  have become cancers and that the 5g
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.600]  and the gmo and the big drug companies knowing they're giving us stuff that
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.960]  kills us and makes us more depressed they're a cancer too
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.360]  there's a lot of damn evil going on here so i don't sit here and shake my
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.560]  finger at the muslims like i'm high and mighty like
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.160]  a Pharisee up here or a hypocrite and say
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.560]  you know you you're you you're the only bad people in the world no
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.440]  we got a lot of evil going around here you'll see examples in the u.s and in
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.200]  england where they're trying to teach
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.640]  five-year-old boys and girls is where you know boys they're girls and girls
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.240]  they're boys and trying to teach five-year-olds about anal sex
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.360]  and the muslims come in there and they say our kids are pulled out of here
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.160]  and they protest and then the school stops it or says muslims don't have to go
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.160]  but nobody else will stand for their kids so
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.320]  that's the point i'm getting in here is is that we've got a lot of evil
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:04:00.680]  ideologies here and humanity has really lost touch
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.280]  with what civilization has given us and we are becoming
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.760]  animals in the civilization our ancestors built
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.680]  and i don't care where that is i don't care if it's in africa the middle east
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.840]  the united states the europe asia
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.760]  you've got people that are becoming disconnected from reality
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.040]  and who are not self-aware
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.800]  who will do basically anything at any time and it's going to create
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.920]  a world meltdown it's going to create a societal collapse
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.000]  because if you don't want to work the systems will basically
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.960]  let you live for free but you got to follow their political aim
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.200]  to conquer but if you want to be free you got to work more more more
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.360]  but when you hit that point where the globalists finally take over
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.400]  they're going to have their own weird right-wing backlash
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.920]  that i think is going to be very very dangerous as well it's a serious time
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.040]  folks and we need god more than ever
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.880]  mike in new jersey you're on the air thanks for calling mike you are the man

[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.520]  then if you don't submit to syria law and anger the muslims you yourself

[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.600]  because the left and antifa and all of this is joining
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:33.160]  with radical islam as their muscle on the street
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.360]  so again uh ladies and gentlemen tommy called me yesterday he asked me

[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.880]  then of course they know that others will end up posting his stuff so then
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.640]  you'll get an alex jones level ban where they say you will not
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.520]  promote this person unless it's negative that is the 1984 level
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.480]  that'll take several segments to get to all of this but it is a

[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.360]  and it came out in the news today that mainstream media in major studies all
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.040]  over the world works with antifa and that a lot of media people dresses
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.560]  antifa of course they believe to the ruling class and they're allied
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.480]  with out of control islam here it is

[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:29.640]  of their areas and come to attack our campaign rally in a non in a non muslim area and still

[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.440]  police police vehicles smashed why are they not reporting who smashed the vehicles let's have
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:37:11.960]  a watch of the video so you can see who smashed those vehicles
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:41.960]  so
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:56.560]  This footage from their own cameras, the Islamist cameras, the general public, of them attacking
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.360]  and the media won't say it.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.520]  All over the country, all over the world, cover it up.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.240]  Don't let people know there's an invasion taking place.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.800]  Tommy has his bank accounts taken away.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.680]  Tommy has his websites taken away.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.080]  Tommy gets kicked off Facebook, Twitter.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.080]  Look at the BBC headline.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080]  They put him in prison.
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.880]  None of these headlines, none of them tell you the truth of what happened.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.200]  None of them name who the aggressors were.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.480]  All of them paint a picture that I went into a town and started smashing out with my supporters.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.680]  The complete opposite of the reality that happened.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.680]  Why are they lying to you?
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  And just so we get a full house.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.680]  Let's have a look at the Daily Mail's reporting on this.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:36.080]  All of the mainstream media have lied to the public about what happened.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.880]  Lastly, let's look at the independent newspaper, who are absolute trash.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.080]  Tommy Robinson, police vehicles damaged during clashes at campaign event in Oldham.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.080]  But wait for it.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.800]  They actually joke in the line below and say that no milkshakes believed to have been thrown
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.720]  during the disturbances.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.160]  Not only do they write the headline to push fake news that somehow have caused damage
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.040]  to police cars, but they then make a joke about a previous assault whilst ignoring the
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.280]  fact that violent mass Muslim gangs have travelled miles to attack innocent women and children.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.280]  We all talk about our rights and our freedoms.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:13.080]  We all see our freedoms disappearing before us.
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:20.600]  The ability to have a campaign in 10 years' time or 5 years' time is in fact today.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.560]  The ability to have a safe and free democratic political campaign in Oldham is gone.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560]  It's gone already.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.440]  We've got to have this phone, there's women and children, there's women here.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.560]  Police come under violent hostile attack by gangs of Muslims armed wearing balaclavas
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.440]  supported by the police.
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  That's the reality.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.960]  That's what the headlines should have said.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.480]  Innocent bystanders, innocent members of the public go into a political rally.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480]  They're right.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.440]  They're right and my right were violently attacked, but not one of the mainstream media
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440]  have told you that.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.000]  How many of these videos that you're seeing now in this, how many of them have you seen?
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.800]  How many of them have the news reported?
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.320]  Could you imagine and reverse the roles?
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.120]  Imagine a Muslim politician talking to the Muslim community and hundreds of young English
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  men wearing balaclavas.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.000]  We're going to break and I'm going to come back and I'm going to finish up with this,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  but it's on news wars.com.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  It's censored on YouTube.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.880]  They've got an age restricted.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  Everybody else should download it.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:16.880]  Reupload it.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.080]  We've got it saved to info wars.com.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.880]  We've got it on the live stream coming up and there's so much more to this, but you're
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.520]  not supposed to see this.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.960]  You're supposed to only buy the corporate lies when they send the Antifa and the Islamists
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.520]  to attack you, then it's your fault.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.280]  That's why they want everybody off the air so they can lie with impunity like the Covington
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:45.840]  kids and like Jesse Smollett and like all the other staged events and they're coming
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.840]  for everybody now.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.840]  We're going to go to break.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:52.560]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to finish up this clip and then I'm going to get to
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.880]  a bunch of other news that I haven't gotten to yet, but first, ladies and gentlemen, we
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.680]  are only here because you support us and I thank you and I appreciate you and I salute
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:13.960]  you, but you have to understand we are the biggest, most effective platform for when
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.520]  they shut everybody else down, which is now happening.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.920]  We have a place to still punch it out.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.840]  That's why Tommy called me yesterday.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.160]  It's why he sent me the information.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.080]  It's why when he's done campaigning tonight, I'm going to interview him again for a taped
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.960]  interview, we'll probably go live.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.640]  That's why we need these independent systems.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.440]  It's why we have to build our own organizations.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:39.080]  That's why that's so precious that we have these ragtag systems because when the truth
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:44.120]  comes out, even if we're much smaller than all the corporate media together, all of that
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.600]  information still doesn't mean anything because it's lies.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:50.840]  When people see the truth, it's David versus Goliath.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:57.720]  I want to encourage everybody to go to infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple eight, two, five,
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.440]  three, three, one, three, nine and stand with us and free speech worldwide and stand with
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:07.200]  the ability to have some true independent media that's under siege because it's effective
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.200]  and because we get news out when no one else is able to do it thanks to your support.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:21.440]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com or triple eight, two, five,
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:25.000]  three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.440]  We have a big special that has to end today and that's the bottle of X3 for free.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.440]  It's amazing.
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.680]  With a bottle of X2, 25% off, that special has to end.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.400]  Learn about iodine efficiency, why it's so important, why these are the best iodines
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.400]  out there.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.040]  It's a secret 12, now twice as strong as secret 12, highest quality B12, 50% off, that special
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.800]  is going to go for another week, but the last day, and it is the last day of X3, free bottle
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:56.800]  of X3, infowarstore.com, a lot of other specials, be sure and check it out.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:03.800]  Okay, it's true, I stayed up late last night so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:15.200]  It's a secret 12, now twice as strong as secret 12, highest quality B12, 50% off, that
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  special is going to go for another week and that's the bottle of X3, 50% off, that special
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200]  has to end.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:36.600]  It's a secret 12, now twice as strong as secret 12, highest quality B12, 50% off, that
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:48.600]  special is going to go for another week and that's the bottle of X3, 50% off, that special
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:44:03.180]  is going to go for another week and that's the bottle of X3, 50% off, that special is
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:12.160]  going to go for another week and that's the bottle of X3, 50% off, that special is going
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:19.160]  are infowars.com
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.960]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.000]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.440]  You can take on big tech. They saw Info Wars as a dominant,
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.840]  independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign,
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.440]  pro-family, populist organization. So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones,
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.640]  then when people say, okay, take him off the air,
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.080]  everyone else like Domino's would fall. The way to fight back
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.280]  is to support Info Wars now more than ever and make it a
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:53.840]  standard of freedom and free speech. Understand that they believe they can
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.600]  take us down.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.000]  They'll take everybody else down.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.640]  They've not shut down our speech. We're at infowars.com
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.240]  and newswars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.160]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air.
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.360]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:15.720]  Are you coming back? We're at infowars.com.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.480]  We're at newswars.com. Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news. We have our own videos.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.440]  We have our own articles. They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on,
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.080]  Info Wars is still chatting along. So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:31.120]  Today, Info Wars.com!
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:42.160]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.640]  We knew this censorship was coming forever. We have our own video streams,
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.920]  our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.160]  Reupload and do whatever you want. People go to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:53.800]  That's where they find it.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:46:06.120]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.920]  of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:15.920]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.320]  And then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.200]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup that was sick.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.880]  But then you add, not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.360]  Literally. Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen,
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:41.200]  then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:46.200]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing. It's 50% off right now at infowars.com
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.360]  because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.200]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:35.200]  You know, the left always claims they're so radical, they're so cool, they're so rebellious.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.200]  The most conforming thing in the world is the left now.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.200]  And they're the most oppressive group out there trying to make everybody think the way they want.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.200]  Oh, they'll say Alabama is trying to tell women how to live their lives.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  They don't criticize Islam for being against abortion.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.200]  One of the good things Islam does. My issue is Islam is tribal.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:48:00.200]  It's aggressive and it's being protected and welded into the left to be used as a weapon against what's left of Western culture.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  We're told abandon our culture. We're told don't have a guide, but then we're told comport to somebody else's worldview.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:12.200]  Here's the conclusion of Tommy Robinson being physically attacked, trying to have a rally in England this weekend.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.200]  And then we'll come back with all the news.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:21.200]  Families come under violent hostile attack by gangs of Muslims armed wearing balaclavas supported by the police.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  That's the reality. That's what the headlines should have said.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.200]  Innocent bystanders, innocent members of the public go into a political rally.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:33.200]  Their right, their right and my right were violently attacked, but not one of the mainstream media have told you that.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:38.200]  How many of these videos that you're seeing now in this? How many of them have you seen? How many of them have the news reported?
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  Could you imagine and reverse the roles? Imagine a Muslim politician talking to the Muslim community
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.200]  and hundreds of young English men wearing balaclavas were escorted there by the police
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  to throw rocks, missiles, to throw scissors and attack them when they're children there.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.200]  Imagine that.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:00.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you call Pakistani men from my community.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:06.200]  This is Ramadan. This is what you call peaceful Islam.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:14.200]  I want to address the Pakistani men from my community. Shame on you.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:27.200]  We have the right to have a political rally. The Pakistani men have no right to come here and attack young kids in the crowd
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  by throwing bricks and balls. Shame on the Pakistani community.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:41.200]  I think, to be honest, the longer I stay here, the longer they're going to stay here.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.200]  As it gets into the evening, the last thing we've got is them looking right across the city.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.200]  So I'm going to make the decision. I'm going to leave. I'm going to love you all. I'm going to thank you all.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.200]  I'm going to say thank you all for coming, man.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  I'm sorry that the way this has been placed has allowed that.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:03.200]  I'm sorry that there's members of this. In fact, it's not members of this town.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  They've travelled from everywhere. I've just heard online they've got Halifax Pakistanis.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.200]  They've come from everywhere they have. They've come from everywhere to kick off and cause violence.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.200]  And the worst thing is, all the intelligence was there online. All the people inciting it were online.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  But I think the best thing, so that there's less disorders for me to leave.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.200]  So I thank you all for coming here.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:28.200]  We've got female supporters being glassed and attacked.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  Maybe if we have just been glassed in my face...
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:44.200]  Maybe she's just been put a pint glass in her face.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.200]  So I make her the last.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:53.200]  If this doesn't make you vote on the 23rd of May, nothing will. Make sure you vote.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.920]  We've seen bricks being thrown at families and scissors. They're throwing scissors
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:08.520]  How are the media not telling you this how has it how has this been twisted and turned
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:13.320]  Why don't they want you to know the reality of what happened and then the local Labour MP Jim Mackon
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:16.860]  Says that we had a peaceful rally in the town center. We didn't have any problems
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.580]  You didn't have 300 balaclava dot thugs
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:25.840]  Directed to your to your rally by the police to violently attack you with weapons. Did you do now?
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.520]  Why would the police allow this?
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.000]  Why would this be allowed to happen on an election campaign? You've all witnessed. I've been physically assaulted multiple times
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.360]  You've seen the police trying to prevent me campaigning Carl. Oh, and now this why would they let this happen?
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:45.260]  I'll let Mohammed tell you I appreciate you to speaking to me about what my concern is is right meant for my community
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:49.680]  You know exactly why they were out there and they were here to cause trouble
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:54.880]  Why enough did the police officers did not stop them right at the end right at the start of it?
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:59.680]  It's because they wanted this reaction to happen. Why we said they don't want it to happen
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:04.280]  Your chief constables do why because they want to they want to label Tommy
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:09.840]  They want to label Tommy's supporters as the other trouble shooters. That's why right right?
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.520]  And you're playing into into the hands of your chief constables under their orders
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.880]  This is why this has happened right, okay?
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:19.960]  The establishment has literally thrown everything at me during this campaign
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.680]  But I never would have imagined they'd have their police lead a Muslim mob
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:29.480]  We're in balaclavas to my family-friendly campaign event to attack it
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:36.640]  We all have a choice on May 23rd. I need you if you want to send a message to all those trait as in Parliament
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.080]  Then vote for Tommy Robinson on May 23rd
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:47.880]  It started off with milkshakes, and then it was X and then bricks and violence and complete attacks against innocent families
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:53.960]  You've now witnessed what happened. The scary thing is not one single politician
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:58.560]  Not one media outlet has condemned the behavior of these mass thugs
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:04.440]  Instead they've all spun it completely and led the public to believe that my supporters and myself
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.240]  Cause disturbance is an old on May 23rd. Send them all the message
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:12.920]  I need every single one of you share this message everywhere share the truth
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:17.960]  That's what I'm asking you to do share the truth about what happened in Oldham share it to your email lists
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.480]  Share it in your whatsapp group, and let's send all of them a message together on May 23rd
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.080]  Change is coming
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:36.080]  For those of you worried about the children who had to be escorted out earlier from the demonstration, we caught up with them, they caught up
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.080]  So it was a little bit scary, did you read it?
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.080]  She could take us, no, did you see it?
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.080]  The cards in my book
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.080]  I'll read it and put it on telegram when I get home now
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.080]  Cheers, thank you
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080]  Thank you little man
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.080]  And I'll read your card later darling, alright?
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.080]  That's it
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.080]  That's it
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.080]  That's it
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.080]  And folks I'm fully behind Tommy
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:14.080]  You know the Brexit party is set in major polls to get 45% of the seats in this round of parliamentary elections in Europe
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.080]  Not just in England
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.080]  But obviously the UK is still under the EU
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.080]  So they have the EU Parliament
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.080]  Even though the bureaucracy makes the decisions, the parliament is ceremonial basically
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.080]  But it still has power with the people
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.080]  Because obviously it's elected
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.080]  People know that it's legitimate
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  And Brussels and the bureaucrats aren't
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.080]  Now sure, Farage and UKIP got in a fight and split a couple years ago
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  Doesn't matter, UKIP set to win a bunch of seats
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.080]  So is Brexit
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.080]  That is incredibly, incredibly exciting
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.080]  There's the telegraph
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  European elections, latest polls, Brexit party
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.080]  Forecast to win
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  Most votes, did you hear that?
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.080]  Or 45%
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  And again, if you're an American and don't know about parliamentary systems
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.080]  You're like, well wait a minute, you have to win 50 something percent to win
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.080]  Well no, they've got more than 15 parties
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.080]  So the fact that they're set to win 40 plus percent
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  Out of all of those different parties
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.080]  And those seats is just huge
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.080]  They're going to get the most seats
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.080]  Only Farage's new anti-globalist party
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.080]  Tommy's gotten in fights with him and stuff
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.080]  So he's still with UKIP, great, I don't care
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.080]  UKIP, Brexit, do you know how exciting this is?
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:32.080]  That UKIP and Brexit is set to win the most seats in this parliamentary round
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  The EU is in trouble
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.080]  Globalism is in trouble
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.080]  Humanity is awake
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.080]  This is an exciting time to be alive
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:42.080]  That's why they're so scared
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.080]  All over the world
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080]  Nationalists and populists are getting elected
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.080]  And yeah, they elected a nationalist in Brazil
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.080]  So now the globalists are trying to plunge this economy
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.080]  The public sees through it
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.080]  He's just as popular as ever
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.080]  So that's how they punish you
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.080]  Is economically
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.080]  Do we want to be slaves to this system?
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  Because they punish us up front if we don't submit
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]  They're going to punish us like they've been doing with deindustrialization
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.080]  And globalism the whole time
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.080]  But at the end of the day, there's things more important than money
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.080]  Is it there?
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  It's things like your culture
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.080]  And your freedoms
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.080]  And the globalists come in
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080]  And they take all of that from you
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.080]  These articles are up on infowars.com
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.080]  And newswars.com
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.080]  And people need to go see it
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.080]  France does not belong to the French
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.080]  400 plus African migrant storm airport to demand asylum
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.080]  That's coming up
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.080]  Rapper sings IF France
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.080]  As he symbolically strangles a white woman
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.080]  They've had a bunch of rap groups
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080]  To the top of the charts in Europe and the UK
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:48.080]  Where this is the thing
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  You strangle the white woman, you destroy her, you rape her
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080]  Whites are the enemy
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.080]  New report finds Islamic terrorism in Europe
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.080]  Has increased 725%
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080]  That's on infowars.com
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.080]  Nobody's going to know that
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.080]  Unless you get it out
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  Look, I'm not bitching or complaining, I'm thanking you
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080]  But they want us shut down because they don't want a platform
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.080]  That's going to put all this together
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:10.080]  Show it to you, have the video, have the audio
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.080]  Have the guest

[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080]  Because they've got big political crackdowns coming
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.080]  And they want you silenced
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080]  With no platforms when it happens
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.080]  That's why supporting this platform is paramount

[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:03.080]  Faced off hundreds of years of traditional techniques

[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:16.080]  Beto Rourke thinks that he's figured out why
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.080]  There's a hundred thousand illegal aliens
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:20.080]  Flooding across our border every month
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.080]  And it has nothing to do with the fact that
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.080]  There's no border wall over half of it
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:27.080]  To tell us bozo what's really going on
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:30.080]  We know that increasingly those apprehensions
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.080]  Include farmers from Honduras
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  Who are trying to persist in the face
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080]  Of historic droughts in that country
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080]  What they are planting is no longer growing
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.080]  Soon enough along this trajectory
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.080]  Some of those countries will no longer support
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.080]  Or sustain human life
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080]  At that point a hundred thousand
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080]  Is going to be a drop in the bucket
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080]  Compared to what we will see arrive
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  On the US-Mexico border
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  The competition for resources
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.080]  In a warming planet is going to be absolutely fierce
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.080]  I fear the judgment of the generations
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:04.080]  That will follow us, the people of the future
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:07.080]  Who will look back on 2019 and 2020
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.080]  And know full well that we had all the evidence
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080]  And the facts and the science in front of us
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  All that they could do
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.080]  Was to muster the political will
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.080]  To make those decisive bold choices right now
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.080]  So that to me is the singular challenge
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.080]  That we have as a country
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.080]  Soon country south of the border
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.080]  Won't be able to sustain life, he says
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.080]  Well you already can't drink the water in Mexico
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.080]  So maybe he's out to something
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.080]  Captain Planet, he's our hero
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.080]  Running for president but he's pulling near zero
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  With your hashtags combined
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.080]  I am Captain Planet
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.080]  Mark and Brown didn't do nothing
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.080]  I support child drag queens like Desmond is amazing
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.080]  Down with the patriarchy
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.080]  CNN most trusted name in news
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.080]  No habla ingles amigo
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.080]  Beto was born for this, yay
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.080]  A little like save the environment and stuff
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.080]  And to do that we got to stop these cow farts
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.080]  Yeah, yeah, stop the cow farts
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.080]  That was just the tip of the iceberg
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:08.080]  For this week's global warming circus however
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.080]  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.080]  Organized a green new deal event
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:15.080]  Right outside of Trump Tower
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.080]  Except apparently it was pouring rain
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.080]  So he had to come inside
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.080]  Since he's such a terrible mayor
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.080]  People started shouting him down
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.080]  It didn't really go as well as he had planned
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.080]  Is this a good place to get your message out?
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.080]  Look, I had the weather cooperated
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.080]  We would have been outside
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.080]  That was the original plan
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.080]  It's a public place and you know what?
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.080]  This may be one of Mark Dices
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.080]  I think it is one of his best videos ever
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.080]  So I'm going to play the rest of it coming up
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.080]  But do you see the total hysteria?
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  Global warming is going to cause the third world to collapse
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.080]  And they're all going to come here
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  Then the globalists put in economic systems
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.080]  On record knit to collapse things
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  And then open the borders up and build refugee centers
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080]  And then tell you
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:01.080]  It's because everybody's under water
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:03.080]  And no one can grow crops
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  And everyone's dead
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.080]  And the world's ending in 12 years
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:10.080]  Unless you do exactly what DeBlasio
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.080]  And AOC and Beto say
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:15.080]  It's all coordinated
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.080]  And countries like Spain
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.080]  That actually implemented the same green deal a decade ago
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.080]  They now have 50% unemployment
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.080]  And people under 30
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.080]  So like 25% unemployment in general
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.080]  The country has fallen apart
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.080]  It's been destroyed
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.080]  It's been an economic missile
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.080]  To destroy economies
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:35.080]  To take them over
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.080]  To conquer them
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.080]  It's economic warfare
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:41.080]  AOC is just a teleprompter reader
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.080]  All of these globalists
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.080]  Have been hired
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.080]  They've all been set up to parrot
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.080]  The same garbage
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:51.080]  Over and over again
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:53.080]  And they must be stopped
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:55.080]  And they must be called out
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.080]  But you notice
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080]  The response to us is
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080]  Shut us up
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.080]  And don't
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.080]  Let us criticize them
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:07.080]  The science has settled
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.080]  Manmade global freezing is real
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:11.080]  Give us all your money
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:13.080]  That was in the 70s and 80s
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.080]  Now it's manning global warming
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.080]  Now they went well
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.080]  Let's just say change, period
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.080]  And then it's all your fault
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.080]  And you're going to pass money
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:25.080]  But 160 plus countries like China
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  Are all exempt
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  Only the West has to be industrialized
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.080]  And have its system shut down
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.080]  Industrially
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  Alright, coming up
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.080]  Trump and Iran getting pretty close to war
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  And a whole bunch more
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.080]  On the other side
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  I'm Alex Jones, this is Info Wars
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  And I'm going to play the whole Mark Dice
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.080]  Report coming up, it's just too good
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:49.080]  We don't have time to play the whole thing in the
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:55.080]  Yeah, stay with us
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:21.080]  Even better for your telemeters
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.080]  For your cells
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.080]  For your mitochondrial DNA
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.080]  For your nerves
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:25.080]  For your brain
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.080]  If there's one thing you take
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.080]  It should be DNA Force Plus
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:30.080]  With PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.080]  And all apparel
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.080]  We only do this once a year
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:34.080]  Annual super sale
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.080]  All apparel
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.080]  Ball caps
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.080]  T-shirts
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.080]  Sweatshirts
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.080]  Hoodies

[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.080]  And you help fund the Info War
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.080]  And you spread the word
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:44.080]  And you stand up to the bullies
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.080]  Store-wide apparel sell 50% off
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.080]  And so much more
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.080]  And your funding
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.080]  All possible

[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.080]  Get DNA Force today
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.080]  It's discounted
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:53.080]  But it's about to sell out
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:06:19.080]  With a right back
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:23.080]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.080]  Austin, Texas
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.080]  Transmitting worldwide
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:34.080]  It's Alex Jones
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:36.080]  Well, you know, Al Gore claims
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:38.080]  He invented the Internet in 1996
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.080]  Even though the patents were filed
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:41.080]  For it using that name
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:42.080]  In the late 1950s
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.080]  And then it was officially set up
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.080]  With email-like systems in the 60s
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.080]  And he's not officially
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:49.080]  Accredited with it
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:50.080]  But he said he invented it
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.080]  But Joe Biden says he invented
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.080]  The whole fraudulent climate movement
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.080]  Really, I thought it was the Club of Rome
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.080]  In 1968
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.080]  But hey, if you want to take credit
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:01.080]  For this feudalistic monster
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:05.080]  Go ahead, Joe, here he is
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:06.080]  We suppressed that
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.080]  Joe, I have a question
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.080]  My name is Sevira
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.080]  I'm part of the US Youth Climate Trade
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.080]  An organization we, like, on March 15th
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.080]  We organized a bunch of tricks
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:18.080]  You did a great job
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.080]  And now we have a petition
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.080]  To ask all the presidential candidates
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.080]  To support a forum
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.080]  Where we're talking about the
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.080]  Quiet policy
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.080]  And can you commit
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:28.080]  To the non-subleader
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.080]  And support me
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.080]  By the way, I was
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:31.080]  Just so you know
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.080]  I'm the guy that did all this stuff
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.080]  Read real clear politics
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:35.080]  I'll tell you about how
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.080]  I started this whole thing
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.080]  Back in 87
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.080]  Climate change
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.080]  Can you commit to being a leader?
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.080]  Send what you need
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080]  I guarantee you'll be a leader
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.080]  I'll get you
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.080]  Now, it is true that
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.080]  He is involved in the climate exchange
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:49.080]  In Chicago, mercantile
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:50.080]  We have to pay him money
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:52.080]  If they ever get the carbon taxes through
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.080]  Because you pay private
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.080]  Rothschild bank, actually
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.080]  And Al Gore is involved
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.080]  So it is true that he gets your money
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.080]  In the scam
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.080]  But he did not come up
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.080]  With the scam
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.080]  He does sound like
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.080]  He's either had an entire bottle
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:08.080]  Of Jack Daniels in the last hour
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.080]  Or, again, he's having trouble
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.080]  Because of those strokes he had
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:14.080]  Where the doctor said he only had a 50% chance
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:15.080]  Of coming back
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.080]  And he's famous for slurred speech
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.080]  But you're not allowed to question
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:20.080]  His medical background
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:22.080]  Now, I started getting to a Mark Dice report
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:24.080]  But I want to air the whole thing right now
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.080]  Mark Dice has knocked it out of the park
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.080]  The video is up on infowars.com
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:31.080]  And it's an absolute must
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:32.080]  Must see
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:34.080]  Beto O'Rourke is captain
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.080]  Planet
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.080]  And, again, he's saying in Honduras
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.080]  Remember the clip he's
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:40.080]  A month ago
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.080]  Where he and AOC said 12 years
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:43.080]  So the year is gone
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.080]  He said, rising floods
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:46.080]  No farmland
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:48.080]  Latin America underwater
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:51.080]  Well, he just says these are all Honduran farmers
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.080]  Who just have nothing
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.080]  And that's, no, no
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.080]  The UN built refugee centers
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.080]  They paid them to come up here
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.080]  But now he's gone from a few months ago
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:01.080]  Running for Senate
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:04.080]  Telling you that there is no caravan
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.080]  We can pull those clips up
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.080]  There is no caravan
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.080]  Or it isn't a problem
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.080]  We don't need a border wall
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:11.080]  And there is no problem
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.080]  To saying everyone should be let in
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.080]  And it's because of global warming
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.080]  Everybody's underwater in Honduras
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.080]  That's not true
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.080]  No one's ever said it
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.080]  He thinks his constituents
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:24.080]  Are a bunch of historic morons
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.080]  Yes, hysterical morons
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.080]  Here it is
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  Mark thinks that he's figured out why
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.080]  There's 100,000 illegal aliens
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.080]  Flooding across our border every month
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.080]  And it has nothing to do with the fact
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.080]  That there's no border wall
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.080]  Over half of it
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:40.080]  To tell us bozo
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:42.080]  What's really going on
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:43.080]  We know that increasingly
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:46.080]  Those apprehensions include farmers from Honduras
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.080]  Who are trying to persist
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.080]  In the face of historic droughts
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:51.080]  In that country
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.080]  What they are planting is no longer growing
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.080]  Soon enough along this trajectory
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.080]  Some of those countries will no longer support
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:00.080]  Or sustain human life
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.080]  At that point, 200,000
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.080]  Is going to be a drop in the bucket
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.080]  Compared to what we will see arrive
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.080]  On the US-Mexico border
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.080]  Now there are no caravans
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.080]  Just a few months ago
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:12.080]  Now this is only the beginning
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.080]  Yeah, once you break the border
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:15.080]  Create the conduits
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.080]  They're giving $1,000 debit cards per leg
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:18.080]  And everybody gets in
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:20.080]  Everybody gets put on welfare
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.080]  And they have the rancor babies
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:22.080]  And they tested the people
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:25.080]  30% are not the parents of the children
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:27.080]  They've got kidnapped, smuggled kids
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:28.080]  The Senate report admits it
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.080]  It's okay though
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:31.080]  Because they can no longer sustain
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.080]  Life in Venezuela in places
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.080]  Not because of communism
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.080]  But because of global warming
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:38.080]  No, it's because of communism
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.080]  They're rich in resources
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:11:07.080]  Let's continue
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.080]  Soon country south of the border
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.080]  Won't be able to sustain life, he says
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.080]  Well, you already can't drink the water in Mexico
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.080]  So maybe he's out of something
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:18.080]  Captain Planet
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:19.080]  He's our hero
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.080]  Running for president but he's pulling near zero
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  With your hashtags combined
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.080]  I am Captain Planet
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.080]  Michael Brown didn't do nothing
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:30.080]  I support child trade queens
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.080]  Like Desmond is amazing
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.080]  Down with the patriarchy
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:36.080]  CNN's most trusted name in news
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:38.080]  Norah but in English, amigo
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.080]  That it was born for this, yay!
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:44.080]  I want to save the environment and stuff
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:48.080]  And to do that, we gotta stop these cow farts
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.080]  Yeah, yeah, stop the cow farts
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  That was just the tip of the iceberg
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.080]  For this week's global warming circus
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.080]  However, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.080]  Organized a green new deal event
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.080]  Right outside of Trump Tower
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:03.080]  Except apparently it was pouring rain
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.080]  And so he had to come inside
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:07.080]  And since he's such a terrible mayor
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.080]  People started shouting him down
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  And it didn't really go as well as he had planned
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.080]  Is this a good place to get your message out?
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.080]  Look, had the weather cooperated
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:17.080]  We would have been outside
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.080]  That was the original plan
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:20.080]  But it's a public place
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:21.080]  And you know what?
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.080]  In New York City, we're perfectly tough
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:26.080]  If people want to offer their opposition
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:27.080]  It doesn't change me one
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:28.080]  It doesn't change anyone here
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.080]  This was the scene directly behind him
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.080]  Where Trump supporters brought their own signs
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:36.080]  And rode up and down on the famous escalators
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.080]  While he was trying to give his speech
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  This is the guy who literally
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.080]  Wants to ban skyscrapers in New York City
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.080]  Meanwhile, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.080]  Is now saying that her repeated claim
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.080]  That the world is going to end in 12 years
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:51.080]  Was just a joke
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:53.080]  Or at least I think that's what she said
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.080]  I can't tell if this is her actual Twitter account
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:58.080]  Or one of the parody accounts
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:00.080]  She's calling us all out now for mocking her
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:03.080]  Saying that this is a technique of the GOP
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.080]  To take dry humor and sarcasm
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.080]  And literally fax jacket
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:09.080]  Like the world is ending in 12 years thing
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.080]  You'd have to have the social intelligence
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:14.080]  Of a sea sponge to think it's literal
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:15.080]  You're the one who said
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:17.080]  That a lot of millennials are afraid to have kids
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  Because they're concerned that global warming
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:22.080]  Is going to bring the end of the world
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  And apparently, Cory Booker didn't get the memo
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.080]  Because now he's saying
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.080]  There's only 10 years left
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.080]  Let me just say
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  That with climate change
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.080]  We have 10 years to deal with it
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  But vulnerable communities
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  Are going to feel the impacts first
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.080]  And so this cannot be something where
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.080]  We don't act with a sense of urgency
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.080]  And we've got to be creative
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:43.080]  In the way we're going about it
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.080]  In fact, Bernie Sanders is now saying
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.080]  That global warming is one of our biggest
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:48.080]  National security issues
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.080]  You also know that intelligence
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.080]  And defense agencies in the United States
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.080]  And all over the world
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:59.080]  See climate change as a major
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.080]  National security issue
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.080]  Alright, so again
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.080]  No other nation does this
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.080]  But Western nations will be shut down
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.080]  And AOC and Beto and all of them are very clear
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.080]  They said the world was ending in 12 years
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:14.080]  Okay, if we don't do whatever they say
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.080]  And pay them carbon taxes
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:18.080]  And now they put out tweets
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.080]  And make statements saying it's fake
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  We made it up
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:22.080]  No lady, you did put out your green deal saying
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  If you're unable to work
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.080]  Or don't want to work
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.080]  You'll be given a living wage
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:28.080]  You did say that
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.080]  And you tried to say
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.080]  First you gave a speech endorsing it
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.080]  Then you said we made it up
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.080]  Then you had to back off of that
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:37.080]  You're a lying, evil-eyed weasel
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.080]  We have the videos
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.080]  We know what you've said
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.080]  We know what you've done
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:44.080]  We're aware of it
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.080]  Stop trying to constantly lie
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  We come back
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:50.080]  I'm going to play those clips for you ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:52.080]  Because she's denying it
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:54.080]  She's saying it doesn't exist
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.080]  We're going to show it to you
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.080]  And show you her tweet
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  And finish Mark Dice's report
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.080]  Where she is saying that she didn't say it
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:01.080]  You made it up
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.080]  You're a liar
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:05.080]  They practiced just insulting us
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.080]  There are no mothers and fathers
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.080]  There are no boys and girls
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.080]  We're going to forcibly inoculate you
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:12.080]  There is no world government
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:15.080]  But the Pope just called for world government
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.080]  It is cuckoo land
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:18.080]  We're in a total war
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.080]  You're the best audience on the planet
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:20.080]  The globalists take your guts
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:21.080]  I love you to death
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:22.080]  I'm not bitching at you
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.080]  I'm thanking you
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.080]  I'm just telling you
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:26.080]  You are the power
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:27.080]  You are the resistance
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.080]  And when you word of mouth
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.080]  And when you on your own email
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:31.080]  And your own text message

[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:23.080]  From deep in the heart
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:25.080]  Of FEMA Region 6
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:26.080]  Austin, Texas
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:28.080]  Transmitting worldwide
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.080]  It's Alex Jones
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.080]  So we just
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:40.080]  Point a clip of
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:43.080]  AOC
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:44.080]  Saying that
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:45.080]  We made it up
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.080]  She never said
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:49.080]  There should be a way
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:50.080]  For people that don't want to work
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.080]  She never said
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:52.080]  The world was going in
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:53.080]  In 12 years
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:54.080]  She was being
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.080]  Sarcastic when she did
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.080]  So that's what these
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:00.080]  Moral Relatives do
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.080]  In the left
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.080]  So let's go ahead and play

[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.080]  And again, Beto
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:07.080]  And what they really said
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.080]  Along this current trajectory
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:10.080]  There will be people
[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:11.080]  Who can no longer
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:12.080]  Live in the cities
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:13.080]  That they call home today
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:14.080]  There is food grown
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.080]  In this country
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.080]  That will no longer
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:18.080]  Prosper in these soils
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:19.080]  There is going to be
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.080]  Massive migration
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:21.080]  Of tens or hundreds
[02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:22.080]  Of millions of people
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.080]  From countries
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:24.080]  That are literally
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:26.080]  Uninhabitable or underwater
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:27.080]  That are above the sea
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:28.080]  Right now
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:30.080]  This is our final chance
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.080]  The scientists
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.080]  Are absolutely unanimous
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.080]  On this
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.080]  That we have no more
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:36.080]  Than 12 years
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.080]  To take incredibly
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:39.080]  Bold action
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:40.080]  On this crisis
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:41.080]  The crisis that could
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:42.080]  At its worst
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.080]  Lead to extinction
[02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:44.080]  I think that
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:45.080]  The part of it
[02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:47.080]  That is generational
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:50.080]  Is that millennials
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:51.080]  And people
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.080]  And Gen Z
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.080]  And all these folks
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:54.080]  That come after us
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:55.080]  Are looking up
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:57.080]  And we're like
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:58.080]  The world is going to end
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:21:59.080]  In 12 years
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:00.080]  If we don't address
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:01.080]  Climate change
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:05.080]  And your biggest issue is
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:07.080]  Your biggest issue
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:09.080]  Is how are we going to pay
[02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:10.080]  For it
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:11.080]  And like
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:12.080]  This is the war
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:14.080]  This is our World War II
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:16.080]  The worst part of that
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.080]  I don't know if it translates
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:18.080]  Over a.m. radio
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.080]  Because we're on a lot
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:20.080]  Of a.m. radio stations
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:21.080]  As well
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.080]  Everyone I'm precious
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:25.080]  But the
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:26.080]  But the interviewer
[02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:27.080]  The interviewer is going
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:28.080]  Mmm
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.080]  Mmm
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:30.080]  Mmm
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.080]  Mmm
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:32.080]  Like
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:33.080]  Like ooh
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:34.080]  I'm getting some heavy truth
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.080]  There
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.080]  The earth is going to
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:37.080]  End in 12 years
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.080]  And again
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:39.080]  I keep going back to this
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:40.080]  Not for lack of news
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.080]  Because Beto and her
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:43.080]  Back in the news
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:44.080]  Saying we're all dead
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.080]  If you don't do this
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.080]  But she's trying to back off
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:47.080]  A little
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:48.080]  He's not backing off
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:49.080]  He's getting
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.080]  More insane
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.080]  Saying that we have
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.080]  Hundreds of thousands
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.080]  Every few weeks
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:56.080]  Slamming into the United States
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:57.080]  Not because the U.N.
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:22:58.080]  Set up refugee centers
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:59.080]  Not because they advertise
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:00.080]  They should do it
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.080]  Not because they do the same
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:02.080]  Thing to Europe
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:03.080]  But because
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.080]  There's no crops growing
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:06.080]  In Latin America
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.080]  I'm going to explain something
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:09.080]  And I know the audience is smart
[02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:10.080]  Totally condescending
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:13.080]  But I'm going to explain something
[02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:14.080]  Places like Honduras
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:16.080]  In Central America
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:20.080]  And places like
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.080]  Venezuela in northern
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:24.080]  South America
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:26.080]  Have
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.080]  Soils that are the best
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:33.080]  In the world
[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:34.080]  They have
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:35.080]  Incredible wildlife
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:37.080]  Incredible fish
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:38.080]  Incredible timber
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:42.080]  They have way more resources
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.080]  Than the average area
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  In the United States
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:47.080]  It's joke level
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.080]  But just like Africa
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:49.080]  Because of the corruption
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:50.080]  And the governments
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:51.080]  And the systems they have
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.080]  And the cultures
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.080]  They can't get it together
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:58.080]  Africa has so many resources
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:02.080]  Sub-Saharan particularly
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.080]  Every resource you can imagine
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.080]  Africa has got it
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.080]  It's the only continent
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:08.080]  That has everything
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.080]  Everything
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.080]  Everything
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.080]  The U.S. has a lot of dinosaur bones
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.080]  For some reason
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:19.080]  So does China
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:20.080]  Africa doesn't have a lot
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:21.080]  Of dinosaur bones though
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.080]  But it's got a lot of gold
[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:24.080]  Lithium
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:25.080]  Everything else you can imagine
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.080]  It's got everything
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:28.080]  Everywhere is mineral
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.080]  Every gym
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:31.080]  Farmland
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:32.080]  Volcanic soil
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:33.080]  Everything you need
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:35.080]  What do you think Venezuela has?
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:37.080]  Volcanic soil
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:41.080]  Why do you think we sell coffee
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:42.080]  From southern Mexico
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:44.080]  And the Guatemalan border?
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:45.080]  There's volcanoes
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:47.080]  They grow on the sides of volcanoes
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.080]  Some of them are active volcanoes
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:51.080]  Why do you think Greece
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:52.080]  Has such good food?
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:55.080]  Volcanic soil
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.080]  Why do you think areas of Italy
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:57.080]  Have such good soil?
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.080]  Volcanoes
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.080]  Why do you think the best coffee
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.080]  In the world comes from places
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:04.080]  You can get really expensive Hawaiian coffee
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:05.080]  That's excellent as well
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:08.080]  It's grown on the side of volcanoes
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.080]  They've got everything
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:13.080]  We don't have coffee from the continental U.S.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:16.080]  Because we don't have the soil to grow it
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:17.080]  You can grow it
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:20.080]  It just doesn't taste good
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:22.080]  Ours is from southern Mexico
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.080]  I think it's some of the best coffee out there
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.080]  And this is kind of a plug
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:25.080]  While I'm talking about a story
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:28.080]  But think about this
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:30.080]  Think about the insanity of this
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:34.080]  Venezuela, again, until the 50s
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.080]  Was richer per citizen than the United States
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:40.080]  The average Venezuelan citizen
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:42.080]  Had more money than a U.S. citizen
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.080]  Even when the U.S. was in a boom time
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:46.080]  Oh, and it wasn't the only country
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:48.080]  That was as good or better
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:51.080]  Argentinian
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:53.080]  The Argentines
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.080]  Again, these are facts
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:56.080]  But they got globalist governments in
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.080]  They got socialist governments in
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:00.080]  And they wrecked their economies
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:03.080]  They sold out their people
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.080]  People aren't fleeing up here
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:08.080]  From Latin America
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:11.080]  Because they don't have grass fields
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:14.080]  That have got like six foot tall grass
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.080]  They do
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:18.080]  All over Central and South America
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:20.080]  They've got some of the best cattle grazing
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.080]  The planet's ever seen
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:25.080]  They don't even have basically winters down there
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.080]  Year-round, folks
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:31.080]  Year-round, Mexico has three planting seasons
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  Three
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.080]  The United States has one and a half
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:40.080]  Places like Brazil have four planting seasons
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:43.080]  Venezuela has four planting seasons
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:46.080]  Honduras has three planting seasons
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:48.080]  And volcanic soil
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.080]  And all the water they could ever want
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.080]  And Beto tells you
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:54.080]  They're not fleeing communism
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:55.080]  They're not fleeing socialism
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:58.080]  They're not fleeing corruption
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:00.080]  They're fleaming
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:01.080]  Fleaming, new word
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:03.080]  They are fleeing climate change
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.080]  A load of crap
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:07.080]  And again
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:08.080]  We've got to get the videos together
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.080]  From just a few months ago
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:10.080]  What, four months ago?
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.080]  Five months ago running for Senate?
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.080]  There is no climate change or whatever
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.080]  You know, at that point
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.080]  He wasn't pushing that as his big talking point
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.080]  It was all there is no caravan
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:26.080]  There is no border crisis
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:28.080]  There is no problem
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:29.080]  Remember all that?
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.080]  Jim Acosta saying there's no caravans
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:33.080]  Trump's made up the caravans
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:37.080]  He's made up the crisis
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.080]  Well, that's not what they say now
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.080]  Bernie Sanders says
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  Trump is to blame for the caravans
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.080]  Trump is what did it
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:48.080]  And it is climate change
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.080]  And so does Cory Booker
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:52.080]  And so does Pepe O'Rourke
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.080]  And so does AOC
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.080]  And why do they all say the same thing?
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:59.080]  Over and over again
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.080]  Because it's a way to take control of your life
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.080]  They're not going to get rid of high rises
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:07.080]  Or skyscrapers or hot dogs
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:11.080]  They're going to make you pay their money
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.080]  I'm Bernie Sanders
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.080]  I bankrupt businesses
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:20.080]  I give my children money from the colleges
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:22.080]  To bankrupt them
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:25.080]  And my campaign head is a convicted swindler
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.080]  That's what I do
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:31.080]  The earth is going to end
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  Unless you give me money
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.080]  I'm Bernie Sanders
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:39.080]  Who could stand against me?
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.080]  Western culture might wake up and say no to me
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:43.080]  I have an answer
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:46.080]  Outlaw Western culture and families
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.080]  I'm Bernie Sanders
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:52.080]  I rule you now
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:23.080]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.080]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:28.080]  To replace your old habits with new habits
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:30.080]  And totally change your life
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:33.080]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:35.080]  The entire program may be covered
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:37.080]  Fix your problem right now
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:39.080]  Before it gets any worse

[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:07.080]  And all of our affiliates

[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:15.080]  And when you don't buy the products
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:17.080]  They're absolutely the best out there
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:20.080]  We aren't able to continue on
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:22.080]  So remember, you are the InfoWare
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:23.080]  I'm not the leader
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.080]  You are the leader
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:26.080]  When you take action, nothing stops you
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:29.080]  We've got giant specials running right now
[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:31.080]  InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented

[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:35.080]  That you already need
[02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:36.080]  From across the board
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:39.080]  It funds the second American Revolution worldwide
[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:40.080]  So I want to thank you for your support
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.080]  And I want to encourage you again

[02:30:52.080 --> 02:31:17.080]  God bless you
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:24.080]  And now because of their intensifying censorship
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:26.080]  It's more important than ever
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:28.080]  That everyone go to infowars.com
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:29.080]  Forward slash newsletter
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:31.080]  And sign up via email
[02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:33.080]  So there's no way the censors can get between us
[02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:36.080]  With critical videos, articles, breaking news
[02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:38.080]  Intel, you name it
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:40.080]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:42.080]  To share the infowars.com articles
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:43.080]  To share the videos
[02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:45.080]  To tell people by the local state
[02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:46.080]  Since you're listening to
[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:47.080]  But the bare minimum you can do
[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:49.080]  Is sign up for the free newsletter
[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:53.080]  At infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:54.080]  We are the Renaissance
[02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:56.080]  And we are winning
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:58.080]  The globalists are hyper competitive
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.080]  Scientific dictators
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:01.080]  They are technocrats
[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:03.080]  They are control freaks in their own words
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:05.080]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:06.080]  And make your own decisions
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:09.080]  Gets to the way of their great destiny
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:10.080]  To merge with AI gods
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:12.080]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:14.080]  We're fighting them hard right here
[02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:15.080]  In the third dimension
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.080]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.080]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:21.080]  In our lives is our bodies
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:23.080]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:25.080]  From foreslives.com
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:26.080]  I couldn't do it
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:28.080]  That's why we decided to
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:30.080]  Take our original secret 12
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:31.080]  That was incredibly high quality
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:32.080]  Methylcobalamin
[02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:34.080]  And double the strength of it
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:36.080]  In a new formula, Ultra 12
[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:38.080]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly
[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:40.080]  The strongest, highest quality B12
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:42.080]  Over the counter that you're going to find anywhere
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:44.080]  It is amazing, experienced pure
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:46.080]  Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.080]  And fund the second American Revolution
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:50.080]  Against the tyrants at
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:52.080]  M4WarsStore.com
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:53.080]  M4WarsLife.com
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:33:20.080]  Or AAA-253-3139
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.080]  Is the U.S. involved with any
[02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:26.080]  Procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons
[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:28.080]  Buying, selling anyhow
[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:30.080]  Transferring weapons to Turkey
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:33.080]  Out of Libya
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:35.080]  To Turkey?
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:38.080]  It is a big idea
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:40.080]  A new world order
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:42.080]  How is it that this organization is so well funded
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.080]  So organized?
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.080]  Atlantic state-linked militants have gained
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:48.080]  A stronger foothold in Libya
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:50.080]  You economically vital areas of the country
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:53.080]  The leader of ISIS in Libya
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:56.080]  Is none other than Abdel Hakim Bel-Haj
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:58.080]  And of course he was armed to the teeth
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:59.080]  By NATO
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:01.080]  A world in which there is the very real
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:03.080]  Prospect of a new world order
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:05.080]  The Russians say they're negotiating with
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:07.080]  North Korea to hold joint military
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:08.080]  Exercise
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:10.080]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:12.080]  Creating an ominous alliance
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:14.080]  Against the United States
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:16.080]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.080]  Is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.080]  That the U.S. government is negotiating
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:21.080]  With Iran
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:23.080]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.080]  Allow Israeli jets into its airspace
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:27.080]  To conduct attacks on Iran
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:29.080]  We have an unprecedented opportunity
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:32.080]  To build a new world order
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:34.080]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:36.080]  And created an important part
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:38.080]  In events now
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.080]  Ukraine is set to receive the first
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:42.080]  Trunch of International Monetary Fund
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:43.080]  Aid package
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:46.080]  That broke the deal to transition power
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:47.080]  In Ukraine
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:50.080]  Vladimir Putin is on the move
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  Only when this transformation is complete
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:57.080]  Will we be able to take full measure
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:59.080]  Of the opportunities presented
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.080]  By this new and involving world order
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:15.080]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:31.080]  What is insurrection?
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:34.080]  A rebellion or rising of citizens
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:37.080]  Or subjects in resistance to their government
[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:40.080]  In 2017, the Justice Democrats
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.080]  And Brand New Congress
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:44.080]  Seek to undermine the democratic system
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.080]  By electing fake politicians
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:50.080]  Antifa is conspiring with the Mexican cartel
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:53.080]  To stage an armed rebellion at the border
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:56.080]  And Democrats continue pushing for open borders
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.080]  While patriots are silenced on the internet
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.080]  This all qualifies as insurrection
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:04.080]  Something far more deadly
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.080]  That has been taking root within America for decades
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:09.080]  Islamist terrorist compounds
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:11.080]  Have been found all over the country
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.080]  Training for Islamic jihad
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:15.080]  With the election of Donald Trump
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:17.080]  They believe that their end times prophecies
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:19.080]  That they believe in are now being fulfilled
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:22.080]  Donald Trump is part of a satanic Jewish conspiracy
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:25.080]  And they are preparing for the camps to be raided
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:26.080]  And to fight back
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:29.080]  Brooklyn Imam and CNN contributor
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:32.080]  Miraj Wahaj was involved in the first
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:34.080]  World Trade Center bombing
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:37.080]  And has clearly stated his support for Islamic jihad
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:39.080]  Islam is better than a democracy
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  In time the so-called democracy will crumble
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:44.080]  And there will be nothing
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:46.080]  And the only thing that will remain will be Islam
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  His son was found training children
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:52.080]  To be terrorists in New Mexico and Alabama
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:55.080]  Young children in a Philadelphia mosque
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:57.080]  Were found singing songs about killing
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:59.080]  And torturing non-Muslims
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:17.080]  Muslim clerics are openly calling for jihad
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:38.080]  They are calling for jihad
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:41.080]  Experts on Islamic jihad have warned us
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:44.080]  There is no place in the world where Muslims have come
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.080]  That they haven't started wars against the non-Muslims
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:49.080]  Why do we think we're going to be different?
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:52.080]  The leader of the Iranian nationalist movement has warned us
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:59.080]  The European governments have no right
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:02.080]  To defend Islamic radicalism
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.080]  They should be prepared
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:08.080]  That the day will come
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:11.080]  Islamic reformer Muhammad Tawidi has warned us
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:17.080]  The Islamist movement has been very clear in their goal
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:20.080]  And that is to establish their own caliphate
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.080]  On the other side, the left not only sympathize with them
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:26.080]  They're applying democratic values
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.080]  On to an extremist group that doesn't believe in democracy
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:30.080]  They want sharia law
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:32.080]  Despite these dire warnings
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.080]  Our elected officials have continued to support Islam
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:40.080]  We have a congresswoman who openly supports Islamic jihad
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:44.080]  Should we reassess the way that we are dealing with al-Shabaab
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.080]  Her constituents in Minneapolis want sharia law in America
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:51.080]  Do you feel more comfortable living under American law
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:54.080]  Or do you feel more comfortable living under sharia law?
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.080]  Sharia law
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.080]  I'm a Muslim, I prefer sharia law
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:02.080]  Sharia law?
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:03.080]  Yes
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.080]  You prefer sharia law over American law?
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:07.080]  Of course, yes
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.080]  Of course, yes
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:13.080]  And do you find most of your friends say how they feel the same way?
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:15.080]  Yes, of course
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:17.080]  He can make his daughter marry somebody
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:18.080]  Yeah
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.080]  Is it right to kill somebody who insults Muhammad?
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.080]  Yeah, because she has the religion, I understand
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.080]  But she shouldn't pick up the prophet, you know
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:28.080]  And they don't even want to live here
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:31.080]  Do you have a choice? Would you rather live here or live in Muslim country?
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:33.080]  I'd rather live in Muslim country with my people
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:36.080]  Would you prefer to live in America or live in Somalia?
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:38.080]  For me, I think it's Somalia
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:41.080]  Would you rather live in America or live in Somalia?
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:43.080]  I'd rather live in Somalia
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:50.080]  Those who are not brainwashed by the mainstream media, insurrection is clearly happening in America
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:56.080]  And President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act is clearly within America's best interests
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.080]  I believe that President Trump is one of the best things that have ever happened to the White House
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.080]  This is very, very serious
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:09.080]  You have a president that will really go after the extremists and not care what anybody else thinks
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  Islamic jihad will never end unless we start fighting back
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:21.080]  But the point I'm getting across is that we are trying to treat a person humanely when they're not human
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:23.080]  When they're not human
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.080]  We come to America warning the Christians
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:29.080]  The Christians don't want to listen to what they want us to do
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.080]  If I'm telling you, I fled from this guy
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:35.080]  And this guy is now moving next door
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:37.080]  And you're telling me, I'm a slaver fall
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:39.080]  How can I help you?
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:47.080]  If we want to be realistic, the only medicine for ISIS and their likes is when the Christians rise to defend Europe
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:50.080]  And defend their sacred sites and their churches
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:54.080]  That's the only way that these people will wake up
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.080]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Rees
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:01.080]  And that we're boating clips on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:04.080]  Here's President Trump talking about the military industrial complex and how they want war
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:06.080]  Pretty powerful, here it is
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:08.080]  We have tremendous power economically
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.080]  If I can solve things economically, that's the way I want it
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.080]  So you can reassure people you're not looking for some kind of conflict in Iran
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:21.080]  Well, I'm the one that talks about these wars that are 19 years and people are just there
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:25.080]  And don't kid yourself, you do have a military industrial complex
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.080]  They do like war, you know, in Syria with the caliphate
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:32.080]  So I wipe out 100% of the caliphate
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:37.080]  That doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people going around blowing up stores and blowing up things
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:40.080]  These are seriously ill people
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.080]  I don't want to say, oh, they're wiped out, you know, ISIS
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:45.080]  But I wiped out 100% of the caliphate
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:50.080]  I say, I want to bring our troops back home to a place where they're crazy
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:53.080]  They want to keep, you have people here in Washington
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:55.080]  They never want to leave
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  I say, you know what I'll do, I'll leave a couple of hundred soldiers behind
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.080]  But if it was up to them, they'd bring thousands of soldiers in
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:05.080]  Someday people will explain it
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:10.080]  But you do have a group, and they call it the military industrial complex
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:12.080]  They never want to leave, they always want to fight
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:13.080]  No, I don't want to fight
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:17.080]  But you do have situations like Iran
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:19.080]  You can't let them have nuclear weapons
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:20.080]  You just can't let that happen
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:23.080]  So that's an example, I think, of what people liked in 2016
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:26.080]  Where you didn't come over as a traditional Republican
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:27.080]  No, but I haven't changed
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:28.080]  Well, take a look
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:31.080]  That's what we talk about, and I'll show you the popular
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:33.080]  I gave them, I gave the generals
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:36.080]  I said, go ahead, you've got one year
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:38.080]  See what you can do in Afghanistan
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:40.080]  So they fight, fight, fight
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:42.080]  You know, we've taken it way down
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.080]  Powerful stuff, alright
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.080]  Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett in studio
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:48.080]  I'm Alex Jones, we'll be right back
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:51.080]  And they're hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:58.080]  Stay with us
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:23.080]  You're our only hope, brother
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.080]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:27.080]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:55.080]  That's boots on the ground
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.080]  You know, the worst part about getting old
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:43:59.080]  And I'm still strong at 45
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:01.080]  Is that I won't be there for my children someday
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:03.080]  That's why I need to make them strong now
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.080]  Now I can be there for my children
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:06.080]  Now I can make them strong
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:08.080]  Now I can instruct them
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.080]  Now I can teach them what I've learned
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:11.080]  But not once I'm gone
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.080]  You think of this digital age, your word's gone forever
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.080]  But now they're even better
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.080]  Getting rid of what you said they were before
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:21.080]  Now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:24.080]  But I have joined my will to the resistance
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:25.080]  I can't be destroyed now
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.080]  As long as I realize I've done right
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:29.080]  And the longer the people know the truth
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:30.080]  And you can't be destroyed either
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:33.080]  As long as you bind yourself to something
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:34.080]  And commit to it
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:36.080]  And go through the fire for it
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  There is a magic that then takes place
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.080]  That trends in space and time
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.080]  When you commit, be a word of mouth
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:43.080]  Or to pray for us
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.080]  Or to spread our articles and videos
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:47.080]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:50.080]  So please now, commit to support Info Wars
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:51.080]  However you can
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:53.080]  And realize your provision to Info Wars
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:55.080]  Is your own provision
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:26.080]  But you can override the sensors now
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:28.080]  And if all of our audience gets involved
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:29.080]  With hashtag Alex Jones
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:31.080]  We are unstoppable together
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:34.080]  We've already changed the world together
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.080]  With our laser focus
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:36.080]  Do it again
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:38.080]  With hashtag Alex Jones
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:39.080]  On Twitter
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:40.080]  On Facebook
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:41.080]  On Google
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:42.080]  On YouTube
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:43.080]  Everywhere
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:44.080]  Call to talk radio
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:45.080]  C-span
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:46.080]  Shout it out loud and public
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.080]  Hashtag Alex Jones
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.080]  That's the rallying cry
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:50.080]  To restore the First Amendment
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:53.080]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.080]  That refuses to submit
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.080]  It would take me more than an hour
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:02.080]  Just to lay out all the admitted benefits
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:04.080]  And known positive effects
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:06.080]  Of just one of the ingredients
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.080]  In our ultimate bone broth formula
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:11.080]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:14.080]  And all of the amazing things that it's associated with
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:15.080]  And then it's been the big craze
[02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:16.080]  For at least a decade
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.080]  Well thousands of years ago
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:19.080]  It's what everybody told people
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.080]  They should drink in a soup
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:21.080]  They were sick
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  But then you add
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.080]  Not to the fact that this is the strongest
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  Most concentrated highest quality bone broth
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:27.080]  Out there
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.080]  Literally
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:30.080]  Then you have the chaga mushroom
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.080]  Then you have the turmeric
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:32.080]  Then you have the bee pollen
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:34.080]  Then you have the other key ingredients
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:37.080]  That are all known to just make people
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:39.080]  Incredibly strong and healthy
[02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:41.080]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:43.080]  It's 50% off right now
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:44.080]  At FullWareStore.com
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:45.080]  Because I want you to try it
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:46.080]  And see how great it is
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:48.080]  And of course getting the bone broth
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:49.080]  Is just great for you and your family
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.080]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.080]  Our operation
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:54.080]  That's taken on the globalists
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:56.080]  And fighting for all of our freedoms
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:02.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:08.080]  You've got it
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:11.080]  That's your expression that's coming to you
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:17.080]  Waging war on corruption
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.080]  It's Alex Jones
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:23.080]  Coming to you live from the front lines
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:25.080]  Of the Info War
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:30.080]  Alright take a minute
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:32.080]  Billy Weaver in studio for this segment
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:34.080]  Then they take over in the next hour
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.080]  And I said
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.080]  What do you want to get into
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:37.080]  And my god
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:39.080]  You've got a lot to cover
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:42.080]  Infant mortality in the United States
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:46.080]  Is just exploding
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:48.080]  And it's because they do things like
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:49.080]  Spinal taps
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:51.080]  If your baby gets a fever
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:53.080]  Which then gives them meningitis
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:54.080]  And opens up the body
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.080]  Everything is about being bioethics in
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:57.080]  To hurt babies
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:59.080]  And they know what they're doing
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:01.080]  They're fully aware of their operations
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:03.080]  Also you brought in your beautiful baby
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:05.080]  Daughter today
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:06.080]  Known you guys for years
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.080]  Watch your son grow up
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.080]  You and Gavin
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.080]  And she's just amazing
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.080]  She's had no vaccines
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:11.080]  We'll talk about her tests
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:13.080]  And how she's in the top 100%
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:15.080]  That special video
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:17.080]  That's all in the next hour
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:19.080]  That mothers and fathers and families
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:21.080]  And people need to see
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  I've got a lot to cover here
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.080]  But I'm going to eject here
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:25.080]  Or I'll take over
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  As I always do
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:27.080]  What else
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:29.080]  Caitlin and Millie is on your radar
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:30.080]  What else are you going to be covering
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:31.080]  Next hour
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:32.080]  Well you know
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:33.080]  I know Caitlin has been talking
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:35.080]  A lot to me recently
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:37.080]  About the abortion debate in this country
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:39.080]  We've seen many conservative states
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:41.080]  Like Alabama recently
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:44.080]  Changed laws to protect babies
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.080]  From the moment of conception even
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:47.080]  In some
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:48.080]  And some of it's with the heartbeat
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:49.080]  But that's a huge deal
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:51.080]  Because we know Alex
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:52.080]  That the woman who was part of
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.080]  Roe vs. Wade
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:55.080]  She came out years later
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:57.080]  Wanting to undo Roe vs. Wade
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:00.080]  She said this was wrong
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:01.080]  I lied in court
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:04.080]  I didn't testify to the best knowledge
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:06.080]  And now there's evidence that
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:08.080]  These babies are living
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:09.080]  They feel pain
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:10.080]  And the new textbooks teach that
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:11.080]  They're cancers
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:12.080]  That they're parasites
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:14.080]  They have stupid
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:15.080]  Saturday night life skits
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:16.080]  Saying mine
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:18.080]  But the Democrats have gone so far
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:19.080]  They want to kill babies
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:21.080]  In the past laws in several states
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:22.080]  After they're born
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:25.080]  So are we going to kill a 50 year old
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:27.080]  And say it's a post birth abortion
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:29.080]  It's gotten out of control
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.080]  And the left can't believe
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.080]  They're losing the debate
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.080]  Exactly
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:34.080]  You know Caitlin
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.080]  Your report recently
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:36.080]  In Houston
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.080]  Tell us about what the people said there
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.080]  So there were a few people
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:40.080]  I was asking them
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:41.080]  When does human life begin
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:43.080]  And a lot of people would say
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:44.080]  When they pass through the birth canal
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:46.080]  When they take a breath of oxygen
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:47.080]  And I'm like what's in the oxygen
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:48.080]  What's in the air
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:51.080]  That makes you automatically a person
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:53.080]  When you were unborn the day before
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:54.080]  What's the difference
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:56.080]  And it was really troubling
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:57.080]  So it's like the spark of God
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:49:59.080]  Is in the atmosphere
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:00.080]  Some things in the air
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:02.080]  Making us humans
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:03.080]  You know after
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.080]  Our mom gives birth to us
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.080]  But one woman said that
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:08.080]  It's up to the parents to decide
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:09.080]  When life begins
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:10.080]  It's up to them to decide
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:12.080]  Which is the bioethics board
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:13.080]  Which is Dr. Peter Singer
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  That founded PETA
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:16.080]  He says kill kids up to age three
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:17.080]  Exactly
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:18.080]  And what's brilliant
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:20.080]  Is she gets them to realize
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:21.080]  She asks them
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:24.080]  So when does life end
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.080]  Like medically
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:26.080]  When does life end
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.080]  Well when the heart stops beating right
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:30.080]  So then when does it begin
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:32.080]  And then they have this dumb
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:33.080]  Founded look on their face
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:34.080]  So a powerful video
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:35.080]  I saw it a few days ago
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:36.080]  Tell folks the name of it
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:37.080]  And then in the law
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:38.080]  We'll repost it to M4s.com
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:39.080]  So folks can find it
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:41.080]  So we haven't done the one from Houston yet
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:42.080]  But there are some
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:44.080]  On Liberty Hangout YouTube
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:45.080]  Of us talking about abortion
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:46.080]  We did a pop quiz video
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:47.080]  At the Women's March
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:49.080]  About you know how many
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.080]  What's the biggest cause of death
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:51.080]  In the United States
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:53.080]  It's obviously abortion
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:54.080]  But there's a lot of videos
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.080]  On Liberty Hangout YouTube
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:57.080]  And again they've got their arguments
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:59.080]  But when you get deep down
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:00.080]  It's about body parts
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.080]  It's about the humanization
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:03.080]  It's about the population
[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:04.080]  It's about eugenics
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:05.080]  It's not about what they claim
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:06.080]  It's about
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:07.080]  Oh yeah definitely
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:09.080]  And even with what we've been seeing
[02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:10.080]  With the vaccines
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:12.080]  I mean you have doctors
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:14.080]  That want to just say
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:15.080]  Oh you know what
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:16.080]  We need to all just
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:17.080]  Vaccinate our kids
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:18.080]  Because of herd immunity
[02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:19.080]  You'll hear this argument
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:20.080]  All the time
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:21.080]  The herd immunity
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:22.080]  The herd immunity
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.080]  Anytime you mention
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:24.080]  Well there's a possibility
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.080]  That my child could be
[02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:26.080]  One of those statistics
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.080]  That end up with autism
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:29.080]  Or autoimmune disorders
[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:30.080]  Or brain damage
[02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:31.080]  Or even die
[02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:32.080]  From SIDS
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:33.080]  Or some other issue
[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:34.080]  Yet they say
[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:36.080]  Oh well the herd immunity
[02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:37.080]  Takes precedent
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:38.080]  Well wait a second
[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:40.080]  My child is not cattle
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:41.080]  Okay so
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:42.080]  Why do you keep coming out
[02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:43.080]  Of herd immunity?
[02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:44.080]  By the way vaccines
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:45.080]  Have liability protection
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:47.080]  Like no other drug company has
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:49.080]  They have immunity in court
[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:51.080]  They're not tested for effectiveness
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:52.080]  And then now they're saying
[02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:53.080]  It's disinfo
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:54.080]  We criticize them
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:56.080]  That's just consumers' views
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:57.080]  Of I don't like this hotel
[02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:58.080]  I don't like this restaurant
[02:51:58.080 --> 02:51:59.080]  I don't like this doctor
[02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:00.080]  The medical cartel
[02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:02.080]  Starting with vaccines
[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:03.080]  Is trying to set the precedent
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:05.080]  Where we can't criticize
[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:06.080]  Medical events
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:08.080]  That we saw for ourselves
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:09.080]  Like this hospital sucks
[02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:10.080]  It's dirty
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:11.080]  The doctors are jerks
[02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:12.080]  Blah blah blah
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:13.080]  This hospital is great
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:14.080]  They were wonderful
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:15.080]  They're trying to say
[02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:16.080]  You aren't allowed to comment
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:17.080]  On the priest class
[02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:19.080]  Exactly and here's a good one
[02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:20.080]  If the doctor is trying
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:21.080]  To corner you as a parent
[02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:23.080]  And pressure you into vaccines
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:24.080]  Even though there's a risk
[02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:25.080]  That your child could be injured
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:26.080]  From it
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:27.080]  Just ask them this
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:28.080]  Say hey doctor
[02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:29.080]  If my child is injured
[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:30.080]  Are you going to sign a contract
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:32.080]  That if my child's injured
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:34.080]  I can hold you personally liable
[02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:36.080]  For my child being brain damaged
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:37.080]  You're going to sell your home
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:39.080]  You're going to be held liable
[02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:40.080]  For my child being injured
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:42.080]  Instantly the doctors back off
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:43.080]  They don't want to have anything to do
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:44.080]  In the past
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:45.080]  Western universities taught
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:48.080]  Nonconformity, rugged individualism
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:49.080]  Do your own research
[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:50.080]  Stand up for yourself
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:52.080]  Now they teach compliance
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:53.080]  They've gotten rid of the
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:55.080]  Hypocratic oath in many hospitals
[02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:56.080]  For many doctors
[02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:57.080]  And they think this is cool
[02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:00.080]  I was talking to one of my wife's
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:01.080]  Family members
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:02.080]  Who's a registered nurse
[02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:04.080]  And I was talking about
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:06.080]  Some facilities keep babies alive
[02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:07.080]  And take their organs
[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:08.080]  That's why they're passing that law
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:09.080]  And she goes
[02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:10.080]  Well I'm not involved in that
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:12.080]  But I know nurses that are
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:13.080]  That's what you do with organ donors
[02:53:13.080 --> 02:53:14.080]  You keep them alive
[02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:15.080]  And I meant
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:17.080]  So the baby's considered
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:19.080]  Not going to be born
[02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:20.080]  But they keep it alive
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:22.080]  In an oxygen tent
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:23.080]  To harvest the organs
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:24.080]  And she was just like
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:26.080]  Like
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:27.080]  He was like
[02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:30.080]  I'm kind of like having an anxiety attack
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:32.080]  See this has all been mainlined
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:33.080]  And so you're a nurse
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:34.080]  And on another wing
[02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:35.080]  They've got babies alive
[02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:36.080]  Because they're going to
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:37.080]  Harvest them in a day or two
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:38.080]  They're getting all the people
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:39.080]  Lined up
[02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:40.080]  Getting them ready
[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:41.080]  Getting the aircraft ready
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:42.080]  Because you've got to keep
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:44.080]  The little flesh ball comfortable
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.080]  It's not alive
[02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:46.080]  We say baby dead
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:47.080]  But keep it comfortable
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:48.080]  While it's dead
[02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:50.080]  So we get to good or good
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:52.080]  And then once we get to flesh ball
[02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:54.080]  You make them skin
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:56.080]  The blood and the organs
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:57.080]  See how it works
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:59.080]  But these very people
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:00.080]  Like
[02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:01.080]  But that's what you do
[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.080]  With an organ donor
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:03.080]  And I'm like
[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:04.080]  Oh, like a guy that has a car wreck
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:05.080]  They say he's brain dead
[02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:06.080]  And they keep him alive
[02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:07.080]  In the oxygen tent
[02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:09.080]  While they get
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:10.080]  And they're like
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:12.080]  Oh, oh
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:15.080]  You see how it works
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:16.080]  You know what's interesting
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:18.080]  Is they're even on social media now
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:20.080]  Starting to censor parents
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:21.080]  To talk about vaccines
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:22.080]  And they're trying to
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:24.080]  Censor people that talk about
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:27.080]  Why you look at the flesh ball
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:29.080]  We say it's not alive
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:30.080]  Not a human
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.080]  We keep it comfortable
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:34.080]  Oh yeah, that's what they'll do
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:35.080]  They'll try to say anything
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:36.080]  They say it's not alive
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:37.080]  Why not hang it up by its feet
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:38.080]  And electrocute it a while
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.080]  If it's not even a human or alive
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:42.080]  Why we keep it comfortable
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:43.080]  The doctors
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:44.080]  You know I'm imitating the
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:45.080]  Governor of Virginia
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:46.080]  When he talks about
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:48.080]  We keep the little flesh ball comfortable
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:49.080]  Yeah
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:51.080]  I mean it's the dehumanization
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.080]  Of babies
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:53.080]  And something that
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:54.080]  I really want to get into
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:56.080]  The next hour when we're hosting Millie
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:58.080]  Is how if we choose
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:00.080]  Undesirable traits for people
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:02.080]  We are no better than what
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:03.080]  Hitler did
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:05.080]  Or when we had slavery
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:07.080]  These are innocent circumstances
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:08.080]  Of babies
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:09.080]  They didn't choose this life
[02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:11.080]  Someone else chose for them
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:12.080]  To come into this life
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:14.080]  But mama choose where the baby live
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:15.080]  Exactly
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:16.080]  And then one person
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:17.080]  I talked to yesterday
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:18.080]  She goes
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:19.080]  So the parent decides
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:20.080]  When life begins
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:21.080]  And I said okay
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:22.080]  So if the parent chooses
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:23.080]  Life begins at
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:24.080]  One years old
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:25.080]  Outside the womb
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:26.080]  Can you
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:27.080]  Can you kill it?
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:28.080]  And she's like
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:29.080]  Oh you're just trying
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:30.080]  To twist my words
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:31.080]  And I'm like
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:32.080]  You said it
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:33.080]  You said it
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:34.080]  Own up to your words
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:35.080]  Or admit that
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:36.080]  What you said was wrong
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:37.080]  And that's what it is
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:38.080]  They take followers in this culture
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:39.080]  To the universities
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:40.080]  And like
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:41.080]  They agree with NPRs
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:42.080]  Orthodoxy
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:43.080]  So they're part of the anointed
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:44.080]  And really all you are
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:45.080]  Is soulless, jealous
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:47.080]  Anti-free speech, anti-life
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:48.080]  Monsters
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:49.080]  You know
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:50.080]  They're trying to twist
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:51.080]  The truth
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:52.080]  To get us to
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:53.080]  Believe their argument
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:54.080]  That they actually believe
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:55.080]  These aren't living beings
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:56.080]  Because
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.080]  Give me a break
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:55:58.080]  The day before
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:55:59.080]  Baby's born
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:00.080]  We all know it's human
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:01.080]  They want power
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:02.080]  Over life and death
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:03.080]  They're signed on death cult
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:04.080]  You ladies
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:05.080]  Are about to take over

[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:38.080]  All coming up
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:39.080]  On the other side
[02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:40.080]  Of this quick break
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  I'm going to air a special report
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:43.080]  So these great ladies
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:44.080]  Have a chance to
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:45.080]  Move over here in the chairs
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:46.080]  And get ready
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:47.080]  And then they'll be back
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:48.080]  And
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:49.080]  George Soros
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:50.080]  And the globalists and others
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.080]  Really hope you don't tell
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:53.080]  Your neighbors, friends, family
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:56.080]  People randomly at the gas station
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:57.080]  How you're listening
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:56:58.080]  On AM and FM
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:56:59.080]  Or how you're watching on
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:00.080]  Local TV
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:01.080]  Or cable
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:03.080]  Or how you are
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:04.080]  Watching or listening
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.080]  Over the internet
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:06.080]  Whatever you do, remember
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:07.080]  That's how we stand up
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:09.080]  We're starting to win
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:10.080]  For pro-life
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:11.080]  We're starting to win
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:12.080]  For nationalism
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:13.080]  We're starting to win
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:14.080]  For privacy
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:15.080]  But the globalists
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:16.080]  Worldwide are taking the
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:17.080]  Gloves off and saying
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:18.080]  We're not going to let you do
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:19.080]  That
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:20.080]  We're going to keep the baby alive
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:21.080]  We're going to get the goodies
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  We're going to get the
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:24.080]  Ferrari off that money
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:26.080]  So that is all coming up
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.080]  But first
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:29.080]  Karma kingpins
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:31.080]  Run their game on America
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:32.080]  John Brown
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:34.080]  And myself report
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:35.080]  And then
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.080]  Billy Weaver
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:37.080]  Caitlin Bennett
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:38.080]  Run on the show
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:40.080]  In the Alex Jones broadcast
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:41.080]  On the other side
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:51.080]  Stay with us.
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:13.080]  They began studying this effect
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:14.080]  In published trials
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:15.080]  And decades later
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:17.080]  We now have the fruit of this research
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:19.080]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:20.080]  That helps alleviate
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:22.080]  Seasonal distress symptoms
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:24.080]  Pollen block is natural
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:25.080]  And effective
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:27.080]  It is not an antihistamine
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:28.080]  In fact, current research has found
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:29.080]  That it actually acts
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:31.080]  By blocking the activity
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:32.080]  Of triptase
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.080]  Which is an enzyme
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:34.080]  That amplifies immune
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:36.080]  And inflammatory responses
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.080]  In the body
[02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:38.080]  Go outside

[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:20.080]  Of your work life

[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:19.080]  American people are being played for chumps. Just chumps.
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:27.080]  Paying four times the cost for the same drug in another OECD country.
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:48.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in resistance.
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:04.080]  It took 15 days for a federal jury in Boston to find former
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:09.080]  incest therapeutics chairman John Kapoor and four other former
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:13.080]  company executives guilty as part of what prosecutors described as
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:16.080]  a nationwide conspiracy.
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:20.080]  The BBC reported John Kapoor, the former billionaire, was found
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:23.080]  guilty of racketeering conspiracy for his role in a scheme which
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:28.080]  also misled insurers. Along the way, incest therapeutics had a rap
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.080]  video made to educate their employees on boosting sales for its
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.080]  fentanyl spray subsist. An obvious homage paid toward the crack
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:50.080]  slinging epidemic of the 1980s into the early 90s.
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:54.080]  It became very clear that the opioid crisis, which has killed
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:58.080]  tens of thousands of Americans, is one of systemic failure brought
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:02.080]  on by the pharmaceutical kingpin's iron grip on the healthcare
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:04.080]  industry and Congress.
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:12.080]  Do you know of any instances where branded pharmaceutical drug
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:19.080]  companies pay a generic competitor not to compete as part of a
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:21.080]  patent settlement?
[03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:27.080]  Do you know of any instances where that's happened?
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:30.080]  I know that the Supreme Court has addressed instances where that
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:32.080]  has been the allegation.
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:38.080]  But the American people are being played for chumps. Just chumps.
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:44.080]  Paying four times the cost for the same drug in another OECD
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:49.080]  country. We're chumps.
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:52.080]  More people in the county are dying due to overdosing on prescription
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:54.080]  drugs, specifically painkillers.
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:57.080]  They're going in, they're saying they have these pains, and then
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:59.080]  they're turning around and doctors are prescribing them the pain
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:00.080]  buds.
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:03.080]  A woman is admitted to the ER for a prescription pill overdose
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:07.080]  every three minutes. What's more, the number of women dying from
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:13.080]  prescription pill overdoses jumped 400% between 1999 and 2010.
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:17.080]  What did his doctors and healthcare providers say to him?
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:24.080]  Basically that he needed to continue to take the medication.
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:25.080]  All of them?
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:27.080]  All of them.
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:30.080]  When he came home, did he continue to take all the medication?
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:33.080]  He followed the doctor's orders.
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:36.080]  The next month, Green died in his sleep.
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:41.080]  This crisis is being largely overlooked by the general population.
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:44.080]  People are aware of it, but they're not angry about it in a way
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:48.080]  that's really commiserate with the scope of what we're facing
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:53.080]  today. A lot of people have described it to me as sort of what
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:57.080]  we experienced in the 1980s and 90s when we faced the AIDS
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:03:58.080]  epidemic.
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:03.080]  MM&M reported, it's one thing when a drug maker targets a doctor
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:06.080]  for delivering marketing talks because he or she is a dynamic
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:10.080]  speaker. It's quite another for the manufacturer to recruit the
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:15.080]  clinician because they're a high prescriber of a particular brand
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:19.080]  who can boost sales sometimes by writing scripts for unapproved
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:23.080]  uses. Unfortunately, the latter scenario has happened all too
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:27.080]  often at most major pharma companies. Most have paid fines for
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:30.080]  such malfeasance and have entered into so-called corporate
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:33.080]  integrity agreements with the government. But in most cases,
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:37.080]  there's been no admission of guilt for their promotional stunts.
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:40.080]  It was almost as if fines for the abuses were simply considered
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:44.080]  the cost of doing business. It's obvious that pharmaceutical
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.080]  lobbyists have rigged the game and there's little congresses
[03:04:47.080 --> 03:04:51.080]  willing to do about it other than continue to take their cut.
[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:52.080]  Fortune.
[03:04:55.080 --> 03:04:58.080]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:03.080]  speech in the western world history. This is a digital,
[03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:09.080]  AI-enforced gag order. Not to say the name Alex Jones or
[03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:11.080]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:16.080 --> 03:05:19.080]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is
[03:05:19.080 --> 03:05:24.080]  cartels. Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now.
[03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:26.080]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:31.080]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human,
[03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:35.080]  pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization. So they
[03:05:35.080 --> 03:05:39.080]  thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people
[03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:42.080]  say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:46.080]  would fall. The way to fight back is to support Infowars now
[03:05:46.080 --> 03:05:49.080]  more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:52.080]  speech. Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[03:05:52.080 --> 03:06:05.080]  They'll take everybody else down.
[03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:16.080]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:20.080]  Welcome back. I am Millie Weaver and my guest host here,
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:23.080]  Caitlin Bennett, the Kent State Gun Girl and you are watching
[03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:28.080]  the Alex Jones show. Well, we saw an amazing John Bown
[03:06:28.080 --> 03:06:31.080]  report during the break and he really gets into the opioid
[03:06:31.080 --> 03:06:35.080]  crisis and that really made me think about the opioid problem
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:39.080]  we're having actually in Ohio, your home state where you have
[03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:44.080]  these massive drug overdoses increasing in the nation and many
[03:06:44.080 --> 03:06:48.080]  of that is linked to the fentanyl use. They're actually
[03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:52.080]  putting fentanyl in many of these drugs now and most of these
[03:06:52.080 --> 03:06:56.080]  drug users don't know it and they take the drugs and they
[03:06:56.080 --> 03:07:01.080]  lethally overdose and this has caused the drug death toll to
[03:07:01.080 --> 03:07:05.080]  just skyrocket across the United States. This kind of goes
[03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:09.080]  more into the drug problems we have in the United States and
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:12.080]  how dangerous it is. Some people say, hey, we should just
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:17.080]  legalize everything. Others want to really crack down.
[03:07:17.080 --> 03:07:21.080]  Well, I'm kind of somewhere along the lines of I wouldn't
[03:07:21.080 --> 03:07:26.080]  want my loved one to take opiates on accident laced with
[03:07:26.080 --> 03:07:30.080]  fentanyl and overdose and die. That's a scary thing that's
[03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:34.080]  happening across the United States right now and it speaks to
[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:38.080]  the problem at the border where we have drugs flowing in from
[03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:42.080]  cartels. First we need to look at why we have such a drug
[03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:46.080]  problem and I'm a libertarian so I believe that you should be
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:50.080]  able to do what you want and the government shouldn't come in
[03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:54.080]  and be able to say, you know, like you can't do that but there
[03:07:54.080 --> 03:07:57.080]  is an overarching problem because the drug war started with the
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:00.080]  racist policy and now people have to lace their drugs to make
[03:08:00.080 --> 03:08:05.080]  them stronger because when you try to ban something it just
[03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:08.080]  makes it 10 times worse. So the black market for drugs is
[03:08:08.080 --> 03:08:11.080]  really bad right now and they're just making everything
[03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:15.080]  stronger in a little doses that they can get it across the
[03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:19.080]  border. They can sell it like that so boy this has been a
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:22.080]  problem in the making decades ago.
[03:08:22.080 --> 03:08:24.080]  Yeah for a very long time and you know we saw what has
[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:27.080]  happened in Colorado though. You know I lived in Colorado for
[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:31.080]  a while and I kind of witnessed a lot of the legalization and
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:35.080]  medicalization with cannabis and we saw how they were actually
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:38.080]  able to make sure that people who were going to use it
[03:08:38.080 --> 03:08:41.080]  regardless either for medical reasons whatever that they were
[03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:46.080]  able to get safe medicine or cannabis it's not going to be
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:48.080]  laced with something. They're not going to worry about
[03:08:48.080 --> 03:08:51.080]  overdosing so at least in that way it's safe. You put it in the
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:54.080]  hands of American businessmen rather than the hands of drug
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:58.080]  cartels. That's the bottom line. We don't want drug cartels
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:02.080]  being the ones who are gaining all this money, all this power
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:05.080]  because what do they do with that money? They buy guns and
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:08.080]  then they terrorize people in their home countries and that's
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:11.080]  what we've seen going on in Mexico and places like that.
[03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:14.080]  They terrorize people with their guns that American citizens
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:17.080]  can't, in cities where American citizens can't have guns to
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:21.080]  protect themselves in turn which is incredibly unfortunate
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:25.080]  and ironic. So the drug problem is just so overarching and it's
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:30.080]  just a problem that now because we started the drug war has
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:32.080]  become something that we don't know how to control because if
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:36.080]  we legalize everything you know what happens there but if we
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.080]  start going more into the drug war what happens there? It's
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:43.080]  something that is not easily answered. Maybe we need to
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:47.080]  change our society to be like don't take drugs instead of
[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:50.080]  being like oh it's so cool to do this and whatever maybe we
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:52.080]  should be telling people.
[03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:56.080]  There should be more like rehabilitation centers obviously
[03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:59.080]  more rehab and we know that Trump and others have talked
[03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:03.080]  about trying to loosen up harsh penalties on people that have
[03:10:03.080 --> 03:10:06.080]  been thrown in jail for decades for you know a little bit of
[03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:09.080]  cannabis or something. Yeah meanwhile Hillary Clinton and
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:12.080]  Comey and all of these Democrats can commit all these
[03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:17.080]  insane crimes against the country. Essentially tyrannical
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:22.080]  acts against the country yet they are free. You know that's
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:25.080]  one of the things I mean we just recently went out to cover
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:31.080]  the MAGA Bash 2019 down in Galveston and one of the main
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:34.080]  things that the Trump supporters out there were saying was
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:38.080]  they still want Hillary locked up. Americans are not letting
[03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:41.080]  go. They want Hillary locked up. The crimes that have been
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:44.080]  committed against the American people are just too much you
[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:48.080]  know. Absolutely I mean they're they still chant at Trump
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:51.080]  rallies lock her up because they still remember the mainstream
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:54.080]  media wants you to forget. They want you to forget. They
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:58.080]  don't want to show where the Trump supporters are chanting
[03:10:58.080 --> 03:11:01.080]  lock her up and when they do it's to demonize Trump supporters
[03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:05.080]  but we remember what happened in Benghazi. We remember the
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:08.080]  lies that she told everybody about that situation and
[03:11:08.080 --> 03:11:12.080]  that she still tells to this day something needs to happen to
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:15.080]  our politicians. They need to be held accountable for their
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:19.080]  actions. Not to mention Haiti. I mean all that money that
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:22.080]  was supposed to go to the Haitian people. Yeah and the
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:25.080]  Clinton Foundation just took all that. I mean that was ridiculous.
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:28.080]  Okay that was ridiculous but you know getting back to the
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:33.080]  whole the whole drug epidemic in America that's why so many
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:37.080]  people want the border wall. They want secure border because
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:41.080]  you don't want these cartels gaining power money and
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:44.080]  access to our country. I mean it's a security issue but
[03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:48.080]  what happens when you have drug dealing cartels like you
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:52.080]  know MS-13 and others roaming our streets in America selling
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:55.080]  drugs getting into violent shootouts and drug wars with
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:58.080]  each other in our country. That's not going to be good for
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:01.080]  our country and you know people in Mexico the reason they're
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:04.080]  all trying to come here is to get away from those cartels
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.080]  and because even when they're in Mexico they cannot defend
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:12.080]  themselves. They don't have a second amendment you know and
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:16.080]  you go out and debate so many liberal college kids that
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:20.080]  don't know anything about the country that we live in and
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:22.080]  why our rights are so important. I mean how many college
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:25.080]  kids are you hearing this from? They don't want a border
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:28.080]  wall but then they don't want people especially college
[03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:32.080]  students or anyone to have firearms to protect themselves
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:35.080]  against the people who are coming across that border wall
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:39.080]  and it's not families it's not mostly kids and women trying
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:43.080]  to find a better life it's terrorists. I mean Trump said
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:46.080]  it perfect they're not sending their best people across the
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:49.080]  wall that's plain and simple we know it's not happening and
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:52.080]  then the Democrats come in and they say we're going to let all
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.080]  of these people bringing drugs bringing their own guns
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:12:58.080]  bringing their own problems sex trafficking into the country
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:01.080]  and we're going to strip your gun rights away from you so
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:03.080]  we're going to let them in we're going to let them terrorize
[03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:06.080]  you and you can't protect yourself protect yourself.
[03:13:06.080 --> 03:13:10.080]  So I just think it's incredibly insulting it's insulting
[03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:14.080]  and I oftentimes try to have these conversations with
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:16.080]  college students to let them know like this is what's
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:19.080]  happening at the border this is why we need to protect ourselves
[03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:22.080]  and it's like I don't know if they just can't put the link
[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:24.080]  together but they don't because they're getting their
[03:13:24.080 --> 03:13:29.080]  information from college leftist professors and CNN and MSNBC
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:31.080]  so they're not going to listen to me.
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:34.080]  You know one thing Caitlyn I'm sure a lot of listeners
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:38.080]  and viewers out there are curious to know what made you
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:41.080]  get involved like why did you start going out because
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:43.080]  even before you worked at Infowars you were already out
[03:13:43.080 --> 03:13:47.080]  there you did your photo op you know with your your gun on
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:51.080]  campus you started going out and quizzing people and doing
[03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:54.080]  these reports what inspired you to do that.
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:57.080]  So I have always been a fan of you Millie I have watched
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:00.080]  your videos so I was like that would be so cool if I could
[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:03.080]  just be like Millie or whatever and do the things that she
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:08.080]  does I was once a fan of Cabot Phillips no longer and
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:12.080]  but I was like I would love to be able to do that and have
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:15.080]  a big name for myself because I think it would be so fun
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:18.080]  but what got me into everything was David Hogg I thought
[03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:21.080]  that he was incredibly fake he was a puppet he didn't know
[03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:24.080]  what he was talking about and the mainstream media
[03:14:24.080 --> 03:14:27.080]  propped him up like he was the saint he knew so much about
[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:31.080]  everything he's so brave and I was like oh my gosh this
[03:14:31.080 --> 03:14:34.080]  guy couldn't even lift a gun why is he talking about
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:38.080]  banning them so I was like I have to be that person that
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:41.080]  goes out and shows a different side and as a woman I think
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:44.080]  it makes it much more of an impact but from there I
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:48.080]  seized an opportunity I have a great work ethic and I did it
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:51.080]  and you've been so successful I mean Caitlin Bennett has
[03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:54.080]  generated tens of millions of views on social media and
[03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:59.080]  she's done a great job getting these issues and points out
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:02.080]  to many people by being controversial and sometimes
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:04.080]  you just have to go out there and do it and that's why
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:07.080]  you know I'm so glad that you're now with Info Wars and
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:10.080]  you know that's why we need your guys' support we need
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:13.080]  all the support we can get from you the listener because

[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:29.080]  uneducated, intolerant, crazy, emotionally incompetent
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:33.080]  people that they are so come back on the other side of this
[03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:37.080]  break we will be talking about abortion in this country
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:42.080]  and the debates that are sparking up on social media

[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:24.080]  Well, it's really great. It's like a multivitamin.
[03:19:24.080 --> 03:19:27.080]  I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:29.080]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:19:29.080 --> 03:19:32.080]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day,
[03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:33.080]  so I really like it.

[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:51.080]  I'm glad you plugged it. Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:25.080]  Welcome back. I'm Millie Weaver,
[03:20:25.080 --> 03:20:28.080]  and we have Caitlin Bennett guest-hosting,
[03:20:28.080 --> 03:20:31.080]  and you're watching the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:31.080 --> 03:20:36.080]  Now, the liberals, the SJWs, want to tell you that, you know,
[03:20:36.080 --> 03:20:37.080]  it's your body, your choice.
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:40.080]  You can choose whether or not to kill your baby,
[03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:43.080]  but you can't choose whether or not to vaccinate your baby.
[03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:46.080]  The Democrats don't want you to have a choice in that matter.
[03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:51.080]  And, you know, we see so many times these parents coming out
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:54.080]  and telling these stories about how their children,
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:56.080]  just the lights turn.
[03:20:56.080 --> 03:20:58.080]  They become autistic.
[03:20:58.080 --> 03:21:01.080]  They develop autoimmune diseases, disorders,
[03:21:01.080 --> 03:21:05.080]  and they watch their child literally go away.
[03:21:05.080 --> 03:21:08.080]  The lights in their eyes go away right before their eyes.
[03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:10.080]  And it's just insane.
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:13.080]  I, myself, I have a three-month-old baby now.
[03:21:13.080 --> 03:21:14.080]  I just had my baby daughter.
[03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:15.080]  Congratulations.
[03:21:15.080 --> 03:21:17.080]  Yes, thank you, Caitlin.
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:20.080]  And this isn't my first one. I have a son.
[03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:25.080]  But the bottom line is that the doctors always want to pressure you about vaccines.
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:29.080]  You know, I know we have slightly, you know, our own opinions
[03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:31.080]  all across the conservative realm.
[03:21:31.080 --> 03:21:33.080]  Everyone has opinions about vaccines.
[03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:36.080]  But I think the most important opinion is that we, the parents,
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:38.080]  should have the right to choose.
[03:21:38.080 --> 03:21:42.080]  Do we want this vaccine list, which is already insanely long,
[03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:45.080]  to get even longer and longer and longer,
[03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:48.080]  and then we don't have a choice whether or not we vaccinate our children?
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:50.080]  And then at what point is it we don't have a choice
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:52.080]  whether or not we get vaccinated?
[03:21:52.080 --> 03:21:55.080]  Do you want to have to get flu shots every year
[03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:57.080]  or multiple flu shots every year?
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:21:59.080]  Because that's what they're going with.
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:01.080]  That's where it's heading.
[03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:04.080]  And, you know, let's, here comes Alex Jones.
[03:22:04.080 --> 03:22:06.080]  I think he's got something to say on vaccines.
[03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:09.080]  No, no, no, it's crazy. We've got a special guest,
[03:22:09.080 --> 03:22:11.080]  Elmo in his real voice.
[03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:14.080]  Elmo wants to, this is going viral on Twitter right now.
[03:22:14.080 --> 03:22:16.080]  Paul watches it in Elmo's body.
[03:22:16.080 --> 03:22:19.080]  Yes, let's hear what Elmo has to say about vaccines.
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:28.080]  I don't know if you were happy that day,
[03:22:28.080 --> 03:22:30.080]  but I read on your Facebook page,
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:32.080]  you were getting a vaccination, you were singing.
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:37.080]  A PhD immunologist and vaccine proponent recently admitted during a conference
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:40.080]  that babies are only given shots up to age one
[03:22:40.080 --> 03:22:44.080]  in order to train the parents to get their children into the medical system.
[03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:46.080]  And they just stuck you with that.
[03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:48.080]  And that the vaccines are completely worthless.
[03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:51.080]  The notion that babies are being injected with vaccines
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:53.080]  in the first year of their life
[03:22:53.080 --> 03:22:57.080]  simply in order to brainwash parents into feeding their children
[03:22:57.080 --> 03:23:02.080]  into the medical system is an extremely disturbing premise.
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:08.080]  So that was Don Lemonhead, the talking mouthpiece pundit
[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:12.080]  interviewing Elmo with Paul Joseph Watson
[03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:15.080]  voiceovering some facts about vaccines there.
[03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:18.080]  So, I mean, Elmo seemed to have a lot to say about vaccines.
[03:23:18.080 --> 03:23:20.080]  Caitlin, what do you think about that?
[03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:22.080]  He had a lot to say and I'm shocked.
[03:23:22.080 --> 03:23:25.080]  I'm shocked that Elmo said that,
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:28.080]  like, Don Lemonhead, there was a...
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:29.080]  I mean, what do you think, Caitlin?
[03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:33.080]  You tend to be a little bit more libertarian leaning.
[03:23:33.080 --> 03:23:34.080]  What do you think?
[03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:37.080]  What's your opinion on the vaccine subject?
[03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:40.080]  Given that, you know, libertarians tend to be leaning more like
[03:23:40.080 --> 03:23:43.080]  they think the government shouldn't be telling them what to do.
[03:23:43.080 --> 03:23:45.080]  I mean, what's your stance on vaccines?
[03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:47.080]  So, I have a confession.
[03:23:47.080 --> 03:23:51.080]  I have always been very pro-vaccine.
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:56.080]  I went to school for a zoology degree slash biology degree
[03:23:56.080 --> 03:24:01.080]  and we talked a lot about vaccines in our classes,
[03:24:01.080 --> 03:24:03.080]  but we never talked about the dangers.
[03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:05.080]  So once I started getting into politics
[03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:08.080]  and I started watching Infowars and I heard all of these things,
[03:24:08.080 --> 03:24:12.080]  I was like, oh my gosh, like...
[03:24:12.080 --> 03:24:13.080]  Exactly, that's the truth.
[03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:14.080]  They don't want you.
[03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:16.080]  That's what the problem is.
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:20.080]  Many of these nurses, they vaccinate their children as well
[03:24:20.080 --> 03:24:23.080]  because they hear the same thing in medical school.
[03:24:23.080 --> 03:24:26.080]  They only tell you about, you know, why you need it,
[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:29.080]  what it does, and they don't ever talk about the negatives.
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:33.080]  What they also do is they bring up the fact that
[03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:36.080]  that one doctor said that it causes autism
[03:24:36.080 --> 03:24:39.080]  and then they really hound you with the fact that
[03:24:39.080 --> 03:24:42.080]  he lost his license to practice medicine
[03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:44.080]  and like, that's all fine and dandy.
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:47.080]  I don't really want to like get into the nitty gritty of vaccines
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:50.080]  or whatever, but they really push that
[03:24:50.080 --> 03:24:53.080]  instead of talking about like, what could actually happen.
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:56.080]  Do I think vaccines cause autism?
[03:24:56.080 --> 03:24:59.080]  Right now, no, I don't think that they cause autism.
[03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:03.080]  I think that there are a lot of bad things that are happening
[03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:05.080]  that we're just trying to...
[03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:07.080]  the mainstream media and doctors, the medical community
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:09.080]  is just trying to suppress.
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:11.080]  What they teach you in the medical schools,
[03:25:11.080 --> 03:25:14.080]  they teach nurses and people even for animals,
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:16.080]  I mean, they vaccinate the animals, right?
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:18.080]  They teach you only what they want you to know
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:20.080]  because a lot of the curriculum, the books,
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:22.080]  are funded by Big Pharma.
[03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:26.080]  So why is Big Pharma going to fund literature
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:29.080]  that shows that their stuff has adverse reactions?
[03:25:29.080 --> 03:25:32.080]  I mean, you can read, literally read the vaccine inserts
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:36.080]  and it tells you, yes, there's a possibility of autism on MMR,
[03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:38.080]  there's a possibility of autoimmune disease,
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:40.080]  it literally has a list.
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:43.080]  I could not believe when I took out the insert
[03:25:43.080 --> 03:25:45.080]  and I actually read it for myself.
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:47.080]  Okay, it's scary.
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:49.080]  And see, that's the thing is many nurses themselves,
[03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:51.080]  they go to medical school,
[03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:53.080]  they're told all the good things about vaccines
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:55.080]  that Big Pharma has paid for in the curriculum,
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:57.080]  but then they vaccinate their kids
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:01.080]  and then they watch their kids get adversely affected
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:04.080]  where they vaccinate the kid, the kid's nonstop screaming,
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:06.080]  having gastrointestinal distress,
[03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:08.080]  fevers, convulsions,
[03:26:08.080 --> 03:26:11.080]  and then the child just stops breathing and dies
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:13.080]  or the lights turn off,
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:17.080]  the child becomes a different person, gets brain damage.
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:20.080]  So you have all these testimonies
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:22.080]  from people who used to be nurses
[03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:26.080]  on that vaxed show where they go around,
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:27.080]  they tour around the United States,
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:29.080]  all these parents, they have that, right?
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:32.080]  So you can't deny that there's a possibility
[03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:34.080]  of an adverse reaction,
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:37.080]  but they don't want to teach the nurses that and the doctors that.
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:39.080]  And one of the reasons why it was interesting,
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:42.080]  you brought up how they said
[03:26:42.080 --> 03:26:45.080]  that they talk about the doctors losing their license
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:47.080]  if they're against vaccination.
[03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:48.080]  Yes.
[03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:49.080]  See how scary that is?
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:52.080]  You go to school, you take out all of these student loans,
[03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:54.080]  you're in debt hundreds of thousands of dollars
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:57.080]  so that you could become a doctor.
[03:26:57.080 --> 03:26:59.080]  You owe all this money to banks.
[03:26:59.080 --> 03:27:00.080]  Well, it was really scary.
[03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:02.080]  And then if you come out against it
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:04.080]  and you don't push the vaccines,
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:05.080]  how are you going to pay your bills?
[03:27:05.080 --> 03:27:06.080]  How are you going to pay your debt off?
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:07.080]  Right.
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:09.080]  Well, what's really scary about it
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:11.080]  is that I never really wanted kids,
[03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:12.080]  but my fiance does.
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:15.080]  So now I'm kind of like, you know, what do I do, whatever?
[03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:19.080]  And when I hear these testimonials about the vaccines,
[03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:21.080]  it honestly scares me.
[03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:23.080]  It makes me not want to even have kids
[03:27:23.080 --> 03:27:25.080]  because I don't want to have to sit with that struggle.
[03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:27.080]  Do I vaccinate? Do I not?
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:30.080]  What happens if I don't? What happens if I do?
[03:27:30.080 --> 03:27:32.080]  It's terrifying.
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:33.080]  They fearmonger.
[03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:34.080]  They terrify parents.
[03:27:34.080 --> 03:27:36.080]  And as soon as you're in that room with the doctor,
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:38.080]  the fearmongering begins.
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:41.080]  Your child's going to get all these third world diseases
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:42.080]  that are eradicated.
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:43.080]  Well, wait a second.
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:44.080]  Aren't these diseases eradicated?
[03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:46.080]  And here's the other thing.
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:48.080]  A large percentage of the 80-year-old
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:50.080]  and 90-year-old population in the United States
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:54.080]  still walks around today and is perfectly fine.
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.080]  You know, my husband's grandmother, 90 years old,
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:00.080]  has never had a vaccine
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:02.080]  because they weren't vaccinated when they were little.
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:04.080]  She didn't have any of it.
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:05.080]  Niven the polio.
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:07.080]  And she's out living her children.
[03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:08.080]  She's healthy.
[03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:12.080]  She chooses to go mow the lawn on a riding lawn mower
[03:28:12.080 --> 03:28:14.080]  every other weekend.
[03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:15.080]  This woman is healthy.
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:16.080]  Why?
[03:28:16.080 --> 03:28:19.080]  Because she literally will not go to the doctor.
[03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:20.080]  She will not.
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:21.080]  Any little thing.
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:22.080]  We're like, OK, maybe you should.
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:23.080]  Nope, nope, nope.
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:25.080]  All her siblings that went to the doctor
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:27.080]  took all their pills, all their pharmaceuticals,
[03:28:27.080 --> 03:28:29.080]  got the flu shots, all that stuff.
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:30.080]  They died.
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:32.080]  Why is she out living, everyone?
[03:28:32.080 --> 03:28:34.080]  Maybe there's something we can learn
[03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:38.080]  from my husband's grandma who's 90 years old
[03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:40.080]  and has never been vaccinated
[03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:44.080]  and is healthier than her children.
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:48.080]  Coming back, we'll be talking about the abortion debate.
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:55.080]  OK, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:28:56.080]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.080 --> 03:28:57.080]  Hey, what you doing?
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:28:58.080]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:28:58.080 --> 03:28:59.080]  Oh, yeah.
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:00.080]  So I'm making lists.
[03:29:00.080 --> 03:29:01.080]  Got to plan a trip to the store.
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:02.080]  Then need to save all the receipts
[03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:03.080]  in case she wants to return.
[03:29:03.080 --> 03:29:05.080]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[03:29:05.080 --> 03:29:06.080]  I'm guessing you do.
[03:29:06.080 --> 03:29:08.080]  Yes, I'm going to show you the easy, quick way

[03:29:58.080 --> 03:29:59.080]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[03:29:59.080 --> 03:30:01.080]  You are the man, Alex.
[03:30:01.080 --> 03:30:02.080]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:03.080]  I'm so excited.
[03:30:03.080 --> 03:30:04.080]  I'm such a big fan.
[03:30:04.080 --> 03:30:06.080]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[03:30:06.080 --> 03:30:08.080]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[03:30:08.080 --> 03:30:09.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:10.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:10.080 --> 03:30:11.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:11.080 --> 03:30:12.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:12.080 --> 03:30:13.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:14.080]  The bone broth.
[03:30:14.080 --> 03:30:17.080]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake.
[03:30:17.080 --> 03:30:19.080]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[03:30:19.080 --> 03:30:20.080]  It tastes like oval-team.
[03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:21.080]  It tastes like oval-team.
[03:30:21.080 --> 03:30:23.080]  It tastes like oval-team.
[03:30:23.080 --> 03:30:24.080]  Like good.
[03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:25.080]  Whoa.
[03:30:25.080 --> 03:30:27.080]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:30:27.080 --> 03:30:29.080]  Thank you.
[03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:33.080]  I've used Supermail vitality.
[03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:34.080]  A host of other products.
[03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:36.080]  Thank you so much for that as well.
[03:30:36.080 --> 03:30:38.080]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products,
[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:39.080]  keeping us on air.
[03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:40.080]  I'm thanking you.
[03:30:40.080 --> 03:30:41.080]  Yes.
[03:30:41.080 --> 03:30:43.080]  This is the Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:30:43.080 --> 03:30:44.080]  The turmeric.
[03:30:44.080 --> 03:30:45.080]  The chocolate mushroom.
[03:30:45.080 --> 03:30:46.080]  The true bone broth.
[03:30:46.080 --> 03:30:47.080]  It is next level.
[03:30:47.080 --> 03:30:48.080]  It really is good.
[03:30:48.080 --> 03:30:49.080]  So, thank you.
[03:30:49.080 --> 03:30:50.580]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:30:50.580 --> 03:30:52.080]  Thank you.

[03:32:42.440 --> 03:32:46.120]  streams and it's all free to air, anybody can use it, we upload it, do whatever you
[03:32:46.120 --> 03:32:47.120]  want.

[03:32:50.200 --> 03:32:57.000]  what things called websites, please go there.
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:24.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:34.480]  Welcome back, I'm Millie Weaver, Jess reporting for Alex Jones and I'm here with Caitlin
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:39.880]  Bennett, the Kent State Gun Girl and we're going to be talking about the abortion debate
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:44.440]  that just keeps on going in this nation and I really think that it's going to keep on
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:48.000]  going because babies are being killed.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:53.560]  I mean, I was talking to you the other day, Caitlin, I was saying, I really believe that
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:34:01.520]  society, maybe 20, 30 decades from now, is going to look back on this time period and
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:09.760]  think what barbaric people existed back then, how barbaric was our society that we literally
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:13.320]  allowed a massive holocaust of babies.
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:21.160]  That's about 60 million babies in the US that are gone, killed, murdered, their lives
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:24.640]  snuffed out since Roe vs. Wade.
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:25.640]  That's insane.
[03:34:25.640 --> 03:34:31.380]  Well, what's funny is we look back at slavery as we should and we say that was terrible.
[03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:34.920]  How could we have allowed that to happen in the first place?
[03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:39.560]  I can't believe that black people don't choose to be black, it's just the color of their
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:42.440]  skin, how could we treat them like that?
[03:34:42.440 --> 03:34:45.280]  Babies don't choose to be made.
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:51.320]  Babies are innocent, but we pick these certain circumstances that are innocent.
[03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:55.800]  Black people don't choose to be black, babies don't choose their circumstances for how they
[03:34:55.800 --> 03:35:01.440]  wound up in your womb, and that's why I'm so passionate about pro-life causes, even
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:03.840]  in the cases of rape and incest.
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:07.360]  I know that's a big controversy, even for conservatives, they're like, how could we
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:15.200]  force women to carry the baby of their rapist because the baby didn't do anything wrong
[03:35:15.200 --> 03:35:20.520]  and it's very common sense to me, and I'm sure our listeners have a lot of common sense
[03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:26.960]  too to understand this, but it just literally hurts my heart to even think that we have
[03:35:26.960 --> 03:35:33.280]  women out there marching in the streets demanding abortion, and it's not rare abortion where
[03:35:33.280 --> 03:35:37.160]  the mother's life is in danger, it's abortion on demand, they want it on demand.
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:42.600]  Definitely, they want even up until the day before, the moment before the baby's born,
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:47.640]  you know, and the Alabama governor was saying even after the baby mistakenly gets born,
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:52.240]  we'll wait and see what the mother wants to do, if she wants to kill it, then they think
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:35:53.240]  that it should be killed.
[03:35:53.240 --> 03:35:54.240]  That was Virginia, right?
[03:35:54.240 --> 03:36:00.000]  Oh yeah, Virginia, that's right, I mean this is crazy that the Democrats are pushing this
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:06.080]  because a very small percentage of our population actually supports their trimester abortion,
[03:36:06.080 --> 03:36:11.720]  and that's why I do believe that that conversation, that debate, is going to continue all throughout
[03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:17.760]  up until the 2020 presidential election because you have these Democrat candidates now who
[03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:23.120]  are coming out and getting behind that message, Beto O'Rourke, you know, I wouldn't question
[03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:29.320]  him at a bar when he was giving a speech there, asked him what his stance was on their trimester
[03:36:29.320 --> 03:36:35.440]  abortion, and he said he supported it, the woman's right to choose, it's her body, you
[03:36:35.440 --> 03:36:38.760]  know, it's her, and the audience applauded him.
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:42.600]  Oh yeah, they were just sharing the abortion, they were like sheep, they were like robots,
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:47.400]  like oh, abortion, I love it, that's great, yeah, let's have more.
[03:36:47.400 --> 03:36:52.000]  What really bothers me is that people don't understand why Alabama, and even in Ohio we
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:56.240]  have a heartbeat bill, and Missouri I believe it was, they don't understand why these states
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:02.680]  are taking such extreme measures to protect life because they see the abundance of states,
[03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:08.480]  liberal states that are pushing extreme measures to be able to abort your babies even after
[03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:10.640]  they're born.
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:15.560]  What did you guys expect to the Democrats, what did you guys expect to happen when you
[03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:21.680]  push the genocide of unborn babies and then include babies that are already born?
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:28.040]  I am so thankful, I am so happy that we have Republicans in office in these states like
[03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:33.400]  Alabama and Ohio that are saying that is enough, if you're gonna go to the extreme one side
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:37.520]  we're no longer going to tolerate it, and we're gonna make Ohio, we're gonna make Alabama
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:44.200]  a safe place for babies, and when we tell women that they can still have careers if
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:49.960]  they choose life, if they choose to have a baby, that is women empowerment, it is not
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:55.000]  empowering to tell women that they are not strong enough to have a baby and have a career,
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:38:00.880]  have a baby and go to school, I would be so insulted if someone looked at me and said
[03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:05.080]  you have to abort your baby because you can't handle a career and a baby.
[03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:10.240]  That's what's happening in China, I mean they have forced abortions there and that's
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:14.960]  why I think that it's so important that this precedent that's set that we stand up for
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:20.000]  life and say no, no one has the right to choose whether or not somebody else dies out of their
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:25.040]  own convenience because they don't want to have to take care of it, they just don't want
[03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:29.360]  it, at what point are the elderly gonna be being treated that way because no one wants
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:34.320]  to take care of them or look after them, it's a slippery slope.
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:39.600]  It's absolutely slippery slope because now, how far do we take it that, well this baby
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:45.520]  was conceived in rape, didn't choose it, it got put there but it was conceived in rape
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.920]  so that's an undesirable trait.
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:53.840]  And they use the smallest little population to try to set the precedent for the whole.
[03:38:53.840 --> 03:38:58.720]  Like the amount of babies, I was reading recently, like the amount of babies that are actually
[03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:06.520]  conceived in rape is unbelievably small and actually 75% of the women who are raped, they
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:11.440]  actually have the baby and they end up being happier for it.
[03:39:11.440 --> 03:39:16.800]  There's studies out there that when the woman has the baby or when the woman aborts the
[03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:21.320]  baby after rape, she's more likely to be suicidal.
[03:39:21.320 --> 03:39:27.160]  Women who have abortions typically have suicidal thoughts and the left wants to try to deny
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:28.160]  that.
[03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:33.680]  On Twitter, there is a short clip where I went to a pro-life protest against Brian Sims,
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:40.680]  the really disgusting Pennsylvania state rep whatever he is that was shaming and harassing
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:46.760]  women that were praying for unborn babies and there I asked people what is the biggest
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:52.120]  myth surrounding abortion and the number one answer I got was that the myth, the number
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:54.760]  one myth is that it's safe.
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:40:00.200]  One is not safe, one we can roll out even the argument that you can't have a safe procedure
[03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:06.080]  where you're ending the life and the heartbeat of another human, but also having your body
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:12.480]  reject what is natural for women to have babies, we are made to have babies, we are still
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:19.800]  animals, but to have your body reject and force to reject a pregnancy is not safe, it's
[03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:20.800]  not normal.
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:26.080]  It's not safe and one of the craziest things I heard was when I was doing my investigative
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:31.720]  report where when I was nine months pregnant, I tried to schedule an abortion and I was
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:36.800]  able to actually find clinics in New Mexico that would carry out an abortion procedure
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:41.800]  if I went there and paid them $17,000, it sounded like I was paying for a hit man to
[03:40:41.800 --> 03:40:46.440]  kill my baby, it was that crazy and they want you to essentially go through the process
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:51.720]  of actually giving birth in a clinic, okay, not in a hospital setting.
[03:40:51.720 --> 03:41:01.080]  So wait a second, a clinic will let me have a vaginal birth without doctors in order to
[03:41:01.080 --> 03:41:06.840]  have an abortion, but the hospital wouldn't even let me do a VBAC, they said it wasn't
[03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:10.400]  safe, I had to do a C-section, what are we coming to?
[03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:15.760]  This is insane, that means women's lives are in danger at risk to even have these not
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:20.960]  with doctors, not in hospital settings at clinics, it's not safe essentially and you
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:24.880]  know, before I just want to get to this really quick because we have this article here, Jim
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:26.760]  Carrey's pro-abortion tweet.
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:31.200]  I have a bone to pick with Jim Carrey because he's actually gone after me before and has
[03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:37.480]  blamed me for the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, which is so disgusting, but at
[03:41:37.480 --> 03:41:42.440]  least I can say Jim Carrey does who I am now, but I never liked him, he's not funny, he's
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:47.480]  disgusting and he's insane, now the order he gets, the crazier he gets, but maybe we
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:53.320]  can put it up on the screen, but there is a really disgusting photo that he drew of
[03:41:53.320 --> 03:41:59.440]  the Alabama governor getting suctioned out of the woman's womb.
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:04.600]  As a baby, they took an aborted fetus baby's body and put the face of the Alabama governor
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:07.840]  and basically they're saying she should have been aborted.
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:15.200]  So this picture shows a couple different things, one it shows that women feminists and Democrats
[03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:19.360]  say that, oh abortions don't really happen, where they stick something in and suck out
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:24.000]  the baby, well he drew it happening, so right there he disproves that is what's actually
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:26.200]  happening in abortion.
[03:42:26.200 --> 03:42:30.600]  The other thing is that when they say abortion is at murder, you're not taking away someone's
[03:42:30.600 --> 03:42:31.600]  life.
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:32.600]  Well yes you are.
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:37.640]  Exactly, well on the other side of this break, we are going to be talking about the medical
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:43.400]  nightmare I experienced with my newborn baby when she was born, so stay tuned, you aren't
[03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:53.240]  going to want to miss this.

[03:43:05.320 --> 03:43:06.320]  city.
[03:43:06.320 --> 03:43:09.960]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.

[03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:43.280]  you will notice the difference ladies and gentlemen with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your

[03:44:05.360 --> 03:44:10.600]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated

[03:44:13.480 --> 03:44:17.240]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:18.240]  they were sick.
[03:44:18.240 --> 03:44:22.120]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest

[03:45:47.720 --> 03:46:00.720]  Okay, it's true, I stayed up late last night so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[03:46:00.720 --> 03:46:12.720]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:37.720]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, the amino acids.
[03:46:37.720 --> 03:46:56.760]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, the amino acids, the amino acids, the amino
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:47:18.160]  acids, the amino acids, the amino acids, the amino acids.
[03:47:18.160 --> 03:47:22.640]  Welcome back, I'm Millie Weaver and this is Caitlin Bennett, the Kent State Gun Girl
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:27.240]  and we are guest hosting the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:31.840]  Now we've been talking about all kinds of things, abortion and one of the topics that's
[03:47:31.840 --> 03:47:37.880]  on the top of our mind is vaccines and you know essentially how parental rights with
[03:47:37.880 --> 03:47:43.120]  the medical establishment are being whittled away and Democrats are behind that push to
[03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:45.360]  whittle away your parental rights.
[03:47:45.360 --> 03:47:50.040]  So you can essentially choose to kill your baby but you can't choose whether or not
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:51.840]  you vaccinate your baby.
[03:47:51.840 --> 03:47:54.400]  I mean that sounds pretty wild.
[03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:59.440]  You know I know that the crew back there was talking about a medical study which even
[03:47:59.440 --> 03:48:05.520]  tries to say that mercury in vaccines is good for your baby, that somehow mercury is good
[03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:06.520]  for your baby.
[03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:12.720]  It's like they didn't read history when the Mad Hatters had their exposure to mercury because
[03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:17.000]  they used to use mercury to clean the buckles for people's hats.
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:21.120]  The reason they were called Mad Hatters was because they were mad, they were insane.
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:24.560]  They had mental problems because of all the mercury exposure.
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:27.800]  But no, mercury is good for your baby.
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:35.840]  This is insane and we are going to get into my personal story that I had because I just
[03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:42.160]  recently had a baby and she's now three months old but when she was a newborn I found out
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:52.880]  the hard way that now spinal taps are now routine procedures at children's hospitals
[03:48:52.880 --> 03:48:58.440]  if you bring in your newborn baby and your baby has a very slight fever.
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:05.600]  That means like if it's above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit your baby could get a spinal tap.
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:11.320]  I mean you think that a spinal tap could make your baby at more risk of getting some kind
[03:49:11.320 --> 03:49:13.720]  of infection in their spine.
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:18.120]  But Millie, your baby didn't even have a fever and they wanted to give her a spinal tap.
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:19.640]  That's exactly it.
[03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:21.080]  That's exactly it.
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:27.720]  So let's go ahead and roll to this report where I explain my medical nightmare with
[03:49:27.720 --> 03:49:30.120]  my newborn baby.
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:38.200]  This is Alma, my three month old baby daughter and she is what a perfectly healthy, unvaccinated
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:40.000]  baby looks like.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:45.480]  She's in all the top charts, she's off the records, I mean she is so healthy and the
[03:49:45.480 --> 03:49:51.920]  doctors in the beginning they tried to pressure me into vaccinating her but now she's surpassing
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:56.920]  all the other babies that she was behind initially that were vaccinated.
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:49:59.640]  So there she is.
[03:49:59.640 --> 03:50:05.320]  So she was born C-section and of course with C-section babies she was suctioned after
[03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:10.600]  she was born and that's when they kind of put a big suction thing in the back of your
[03:50:10.600 --> 03:50:16.320]  throat and kind of removed fluids but when she had her first baby checkup appointment
[03:50:16.320 --> 03:50:20.560]  they looked in the back of her throat and they saw that she had a little bit of a scratch
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:25.200]  or sore at the back of her throat and so the doctors freaked out.
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:30.680]  They thought that maybe she had a sore, maybe she came in contact with some herpes virus
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:32.400]  or something at the hospital.
[03:50:32.400 --> 03:50:36.160]  They were asking me about my medical history and I'm like no, I've never had any type of
[03:50:36.160 --> 03:50:41.840]  herpes or anything plus she wasn't even born vaginally, she was born with a C-section.
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:48.600]  Nonetheless, they wanted to send her to a hospital immediately but I was like no, I don't think
[03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:52.880]  she needs to be at a hospital, she doesn't have a fever, she's fine, she's healthy.
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:59.840]  They said go to Walgreens, Rite Aid, get a thermometer and monitor her if she spikes
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:05.360]  a fever even if it's over 100.3 bring her into the ER.
[03:51:05.360 --> 03:51:12.120]  So I was doing that and of course a day or two later I took her temperature and it said
[03:51:12.120 --> 03:51:18.040]  100.6 so I thought oh my gosh maybe she did come into contact with something at the hospital,
[03:51:18.040 --> 03:51:21.720]  I should take her into the ER and get her checked out.
[03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:27.240]  So of course I go, as soon as I get to the ER the doctors then take her temperature with
[03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:30.960]  their thermometer and it says she doesn't have a fever.
[03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:33.760]  So I then say wait a second, let's check mine.
[03:51:33.760 --> 03:51:37.760]  So I checked mine, it said she had a fever, they checked theirs again, no fever.
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:44.240]  So I quickly realized that this cheap little $5 thermometer I got at the drugstore was
[03:51:44.240 --> 03:51:49.400]  faulty, something wasn't very accurate, I trust the hospital's calibrated equipment
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:51.480]  more than this little cheap one.
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:52.480]  So what did they say?
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:56.600]  They said we need to get a blood sample and a urine sample.
[03:51:56.600 --> 03:52:01.800]  So of course I was thinking okay sure, maybe a little prick or heel like we've seen or
[03:52:01.800 --> 03:52:03.480]  somehow collect urine.
[03:52:03.480 --> 03:52:07.520]  No no no, all of a sudden before I knew it they're wheeling in all this crazy equipment,
[03:52:07.520 --> 03:52:14.280]  all these people come in, they shove a catheter in her and she's screaming and I was like
[03:52:14.280 --> 03:52:17.080]  whoa wait a second, no, what are we doing here?
[03:52:17.080 --> 03:52:19.320]  Oh this is the only way we can get urine.
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:25.320]  They start having nurses stick needles in her arms to try to get a vein.
[03:52:25.320 --> 03:52:30.240]  Of course she's reeling and screaming in pain and I start freaking out panicking and crying
[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:38.440]  because I'm watching my poor baby writhe in pain and I'm like stop, I don't want this,
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:42.520]  we need to go, I do not want to be here anymore, I want to take her out of here and they said
[03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:50.200]  no sorry ma'am, they were literally threatening me with CPS or you know the child protection
[03:52:50.200 --> 03:52:55.800]  services for medical neglect if I took her out of the hospital despite the fact that
[03:52:55.800 --> 03:53:00.280]  she didn't really have a fever at all but because they said she had some kind of marker
[03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:04.400]  scratch at the back of her throat you know they had to run all these tests on her.
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:10.280]  They had her all wired up like she was some sick baby, took us up to you know to stay
[03:53:10.280 --> 03:53:16.120]  overnight and everything and the doctors then started wanting to pressure me to allow them
[03:53:16.120 --> 03:53:27.360]  to start her on high dose antibiotics and do a spinal tap on a newborn baby without any
[03:53:27.360 --> 03:53:29.120]  evidence that she was sick.
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:32.800]  They literally had no evidence she was sick, no fever, nothing and they want to do a spinal
[03:53:32.800 --> 03:53:33.800]  tap on her.
[03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:38.520]  I kept saying no, no way in hell, we are not doing a spinal tap on a newborn baby, I started
[03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:43.520]  threatening them legally that I would sue them, that you are not allowed, like this
[03:53:43.520 --> 03:53:48.240]  is where I draw the line and this is where I threaten you legally that you are not going
[03:53:48.240 --> 03:53:51.320]  to do a spinal tap on my newborn baby.
[03:53:51.320 --> 03:53:57.280]  One of the doctors said to me you know if it were my baby I would want them to have
[03:53:57.280 --> 03:54:02.080]  a spinal tap, I would want them to immediately be put on high dose antibiotics.
[03:54:02.080 --> 03:54:07.400]  I said really even when your baby is perfectly healthy and doesn't have a fever at all they
[03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:11.680]  said well you don't know that and mind you the tests they took the night before had already
[03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:16.800]  come back to show that the mark in the back of her throat came back negative for anything,
[03:54:16.800 --> 03:54:21.760]  no herpes, no crazy viruses or any illnesses it came back negative.
[03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:26.240]  So even with the negative test they wanted me to do a spinal tap on my baby.
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:32.320]  I actually got into a long debate with one of the doctors who just he wanted to go at
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:37.720]  me with you know vaccines and he had all the arguments all the things to say and I was
[03:54:37.720 --> 03:54:43.960]  just like no I have my reasons I know for a fact and plus you know we have a thing in
[03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:49.560]  my family where babies get febrile seizures and I didn't want to risk anything going on
[03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:51.120]  with my baby.
[03:54:51.120 --> 03:54:56.000]  You know I said when you can show me on those inserts that it doesn't say risk of death,
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:00.640]  risk of autism, risk of all of these autoimmune diseases when you can show me those vaccine
[03:55:00.640 --> 03:55:01.640]  inserts don't say that.
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:02.640]  Well I mean that's the thing.
[03:55:02.640 --> 03:55:03.640]  Then we can talk.
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:07.160]  I mean I've got three dollars in the sun, none of them are tested for safety they have
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:11.760]  secret liability protection now it's hundreds of shots they want to give and they know what
[03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:15.440]  they're doing this is on purpose people we're not against science we're not even against
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:19.720]  vaccines itself in my view it's that they're not giving us quality vaccines there they've
[03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:23.840]  got contaminants and it's part of a larger agenda and these sweet little babies my children
[03:55:23.840 --> 03:55:28.520]  are all in the top 99 percentile everything just like this baby is and the doctors will
[03:55:28.520 --> 03:55:33.800]  tell you no we notice the difference with unvaccinated vaccinated it's a fact but regardless
[03:55:33.800 --> 03:55:38.880]  it's like a public health issue or like Yelp or reviews they're trying to say mothers and
[03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:43.200]  fathers and people or nurses can't have their views that vaccines have caused damage or
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:46.520]  they've been hurt by vaccines so they're trying to say that you as a consumer don't have a
[03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:51.000]  right to say you were hurt by a product that Big Pharma has that has liability protection
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:57.440]  with the whole history of Big Pharma and Bayer with HIV in the shots and the Oxycontin company
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:01.760]  knowing it would kill people I mean really we're going to just trust these people that
[03:56:01.760 --> 03:56:06.280]  this history of secret experimentation I really commend you guys your courage and other parents
[03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:09.280]  stand together God bless you.
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:15.040]  So there you have it that was my medical nightmare where my poor baby had to suffer through all
[03:56:15.040 --> 03:56:23.200]  because of a bunk thermometer and me not trusting my own mother's intuition and trusting to
[03:56:23.200 --> 03:56:28.480]  take her in when the doctors were panicking and oh yeah by the way that little scratch
[03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:35.720]  at the back of her throat they ended up deducing that it was most likely caused from the suction
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:39.240]  thing that they used on her when she was born in the hospital.
[03:56:39.240 --> 03:56:43.320]  So they caused this because they weren't careful when they were suctioning the fluids out of
[03:56:43.320 --> 03:56:48.720]  her lungs and then they want you to give her a spinal tap out of something that they caused
[03:56:48.720 --> 03:56:53.600]  and those were young doctors right the older doctor came in and was like what is she doing
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:54.600]  here?
[03:56:54.600 --> 03:56:57.760]  Yeah that's right even an older doctor came in and looked at the baby and says what is
[03:56:57.760 --> 03:57:01.400]  this baby doing here she's perfectly healthy let her go.
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:06.640]  This just goes to show that you know we have these white coats that think they know better
[03:57:06.640 --> 03:57:11.560]  than parents and they want to put your children through all these things.
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:15.400]  The spinal tap probably I mean who knows it could have caused her to get an infection
[03:57:15.400 --> 03:57:20.000]  in itself when she was already healthy to begin with that's the same thing with the vaccines
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:25.400]  you know they're fixing babies that were born healthy it doesn't make sense.
