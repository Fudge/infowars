[00:00.000 --> 00:28.160]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:28.160 --> 00:32.560]  The key component of human life is enlightenment.
[00:32.560 --> 00:37.720]  The awakening from the darkness of deception into the light of truth.
[00:37.720 --> 00:42.360]  The so-called great awakening has really been going on forever.
[00:42.360 --> 00:48.320]  And before MAGA and QAnon, the consensus was that the banks were at the top of the
[00:48.320 --> 00:50.240]  criminal pyramid structure.
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.280]  And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well, we
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.280]  realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society.
[01:01.280 --> 01:03.680]  It was the subject of several documentaries.
[01:03.680 --> 01:11.280]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one-world government,
[01:11.280 --> 01:14.000]  run by the banking industry, run by the bankers, right?
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.200]  There'll be no more cash.
[01:16.200 --> 01:19.960]  And this is going to be straight from Rockefeller himself, this is what they want to accomplish.
[01:19.960 --> 01:22.400]  And all money will be in your chips.
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.960]  And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just
[01:26.960 --> 01:30.040]  turn off your chip, and you have nothing.
[01:30.040 --> 01:34.080]  You can't buy food, you can't do anything, it's total control of people.
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.080]  And that chips connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do,
[01:38.080 --> 01:39.080]  what you sell.
[01:39.080 --> 01:40.080]  Everything, everything is in there.
[01:40.080 --> 01:45.400]  And it was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there.
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.400]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires, yes they manipulate, yes there are secret societies,
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.560]  yes there have been oligarchies throughout history, and yes today, in 2002, there is
[01:55.560 --> 02:04.080]  a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government,
[02:04.080 --> 02:10.320]  a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.840]  And by creating open borders, where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies
[02:14.840 --> 02:21.280]  that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing healthcare, the state becomes
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.680]  God, basically, when it comes to your health, and then by releasing diseases and viruses
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.520]  and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.680]  But now it's as if everyone has just accepted it, and found something else to fight about.
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.360]  Because the cashless society is being rolled out right now, and very few people seem bothered
[02:43.360 --> 02:50.440]  by it. In November of 2019, right before COVID, the Institute of Politics at Harvard
[02:50.440 --> 02:57.040]  Kennedy School had a live, tabletop exercise called Digital Currency Wars, which looked
[02:57.040 --> 03:03.120]  at how the United States can continue to leverage economic power in a world of national digital
[03:03.120 --> 03:09.480]  currencies, such as the Chinese Digital Yuan, which is already heavily competing in trade
[03:09.480 --> 03:16.440]  against the US dollar, and seems to be at the forefront of centralized digital currencies.
[03:16.440 --> 03:22.480]  And it has an expiry date. If you don't spend it by then, it becomes worthless, so people
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.840]  can no longer save money. The Bank of International Settlements has announced that the central
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.880]  bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations, and will have technologies
[03:33.880 --> 03:39.760]  to enforce it. The central bank of Brazil is planning to launch their centralized digital
[03:39.760 --> 03:47.200]  currency in 2024. Israel is about to launch theirs, and the Bank of England is now preparing
[03:47.200 --> 03:53.800]  a UK digital currency. Italy's new Prime Minister Maloney is speaking out against the
[03:53.800 --> 04:00.040]  cashless society, but she seems to stand alone on the world stage. In the Federal Reserve's
[04:00.040 --> 04:06.000]  Digital Currency Scheme, it appears that Hedera and Quant will be used on the technology
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.400]  side. They are already connected to everything. The cashless society is here, but everyone
[04:12.400 --> 04:19.200]  is talking about Hunter Biden's laptop. The goal was never to put an old senile puppet
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.320]  into the presidency to run havoc. The goal was to create a cashless society, and so while
[04:25.320 --> 04:31.880]  bringing Joe Biden to justice may feel like a victory, the tyrants are still getting exactly
[04:31.880 --> 04:37.320]  what they wanted. And once it's all said and done, then who will save you? And if you're
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.840]  like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.920]  chip, and you have nothing. You can't buy food. You can't do anything. Reporting for
[04:47.920 --> 05:00.920]  Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:00.920 --> 05:06.840]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.680]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed
[05:12.680 --> 05:20.360]  us to be. But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what
[05:20.360 --> 05:24.320]  the globalists have done. And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've
[05:24.320 --> 05:30.120]  got a real game changer now. We've never put anything out that's powerful. It's Infowars

[05:41.000 --> 05:47.240]  under the brand name and private label of Infowars Platinum at Infowarsstore.com. It's

[05:55.520 --> 06:19.600]  your way of life and your well-being to try these out and funding Infowar.
[06:25.520 --> 06:54.120]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late in my career? Where are the clowns?
[06:54.120 --> 07:09.720]  Where ought to be clowns? Well, maybe next year.
[07:09.720 --> 07:21.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live Wednesday, December 21st, 2022. Well, Zelensky is a
[07:21.880 --> 07:28.280]  millionaire. Zelensky has banned the oldest and largest church in Ukraine. He has taken
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.000]  over all the media. He has tortured to death tens of thousands of innocent people on record
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.600]  and put it on national television. The man is a complete monster, and he has an endless
[07:39.600 --> 07:47.040]  list of disgusting Hollywood trash and other globalist fawning after him. Now, does that
[07:47.040 --> 07:50.960]  mean Russia is permanent in Vladimir Putin's permanent? What they did is good. No. It's
[07:50.960 --> 07:57.640]  been a proxy war for nine years. Even CNN has popped globalists like George Soros on
[07:57.640 --> 08:02.720]  to brag about it, and now it's rabidly escalating into full-on nuclear war. Even Henry Kissinger
[08:02.720 --> 08:10.160]  said it should all stop, but it's not stopping because the Western political leptocratic
[08:10.160 --> 08:17.840]  elite is using it as a giant money laundering operation, endangering all of us. This is
[08:17.840 --> 08:24.280]  madness. This is insanity. This is what you see in the very final stages of a collapsing
[08:24.280 --> 08:34.760]  empire. We're going to tax those without and its minions within. Zelensky, who was elected,
[08:34.760 --> 08:41.880]  but Hitler was elected too. Then he became a dictator, the dictatorial usurpations of
[08:41.880 --> 08:47.680]  the people. And similar to Hitler, he even has Nazi forces that hail Hitler, serving
[08:47.680 --> 08:54.360]  him as his main Victorian guard in shock troops. You can't make this up. The much of world
[08:54.360 --> 09:02.680]  war two was obviously fought in Ukraine. And he is now in D.C. to address Congress and
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.160]  to have fawning meetings for the Democratic Party. We have people like Mitch McConnell
[09:07.160 --> 09:12.720]  coming out with a huge lie and saying, Republicans have been polled and they believe the war
[09:12.720 --> 09:19.560]  in Ukraine and the war against Russia is the number one issue that Republicans support.
[09:19.560 --> 09:23.560]  But I've seen all those same polls. It's 80 plus percent of Republican voters don't
[09:23.560 --> 09:29.240]  want the war. If you combine Democrat voters, it's almost 75 percent on average of Americans
[09:29.240 --> 09:34.200]  polled. You can look it up for yourself. So he inverted the numbers. He's saying the
[09:34.200 --> 09:39.840]  vast majority of Republicans want this war when it's actually the opposite and it's a
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.080]  bipartisan issue. No, the number one issue is inflation in the economy and the COVID
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.500]  tyranny and the open borders and the fentanyl and the pedo, drag queen time and the critical
[09:51.500 --> 09:56.240]  race theory and the entire leftist agenda that we can't get out from under it because
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.160]  of massive election fraud.
[10:03.160 --> 10:11.840]  We have Mitch McConnell, nevertheless, cue the clip up saying that providing assistance
[10:11.840 --> 10:15.720]  for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.960]  right now. According to most Republicans, that's how we see the challenges confronting
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.200]  the country at the moment. So the big issue is not the insider trading by both party leadership.
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.720]  It's not new lockdowns are trying to prepare and set up. No, no, not the collapse border.
[10:31.720 --> 10:39.120]  It's not the value currency. It is backing Zelensky that is arresting his peaceful opposition
[10:39.120 --> 10:42.920]  outlawing all other political parties, including liberal parties that have been aligned with
[10:42.920 --> 10:49.600]  him. When you outlaw all your political opposition, including your allies, you're a dictator.
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.560]  When you ban the biggest oldest church in the country, you're a dictator. When you arrest
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.120]  people and torture them and imprison them just because they don't support the war, you're
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.920]  a dictator. They put it on national TV all over the world and in Ukraine where they come
[11:02.920 --> 11:07.320]  to the house, knock down the door, drag away the husband and say, you were seen on social
[11:07.320 --> 11:14.000]  media saying the war should end and that Zelensky should do a peace deal. And they scream
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.760]  and you know, I fought the Ukrainian military. I'm a patriot. But yes, I don't support
[11:17.760 --> 11:24.920]  this war. And they start beating them right there on the street. And the left loves it.
[11:24.920 --> 11:31.120]  They love shipping 100 plus million dollars of weapons to the Ukrainians, including reportedly
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.840]  millions of small arms. They can have fully automatic guns, but citizens should be able
[11:35.840 --> 11:45.080]  to have anything here. So that's where we are right now. Here's Mitch McConnell telling
[11:45.080 --> 11:53.200]  a big lie, making sure the Defense Department can deal with the major threats coming from
[11:53.200 --> 12:01.840]  Russia and China, providing assistance for the Ukrainians to defeat the Russians. That's
[12:01.840 --> 12:08.520]  the number one priority for the United States right now, according to most Republicans.
[12:08.520 --> 12:16.400]  That's sort of how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment. Maybe he's talking
[12:16.400 --> 12:24.440]  about the Republican leadership, but the point is he's being deceptive. Mitch McConnell
[12:24.440 --> 12:29.560]  breaks with Kevin McCarthy, pledges to send more aid to Ukraine, Republicans win the Senate.
[12:29.560 --> 12:36.640]  Remember that? Just a few months ago? We're going to be drilling into all of this today.
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.160]  The war in Ukraine, the escalation, Henry Kissinger's warning of impending nuclear
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.440]  war, Putin's ongoing warnings. Now missile strikes going on for a month inside Russia
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.920]  with U.S. NATO backing and coordination. Russia is preparing a new offensive out of
[12:52.920 --> 13:00.160]  Belarus, north of Ukraine. I want to open the phones up on that subject. We had great
[13:00.160 --> 13:07.280]  calls yesterday as we were talking about two subjects, imploding border, poison vaccines,
[13:07.280 --> 13:14.800]  and your take on them. And now today I'd like to add a third topic. Zelensky's visit, your
[13:14.800 --> 13:19.480]  view on it, where you think it's all going, and obviously being used as a political smokescreen
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.720]  for the Newcastle Society rollout that is happening as we speak. And you know, Greg
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.520]  Rees files so many really deep penetrating, thought-provoking reports, but we can put
[13:30.520 --> 13:37.480]  on screen his latest video that just dropped this morning. I can say hands down it's the
[13:37.480 --> 13:43.040]  most important report he's ever put out. On the eve of a castle society, it's only
[13:43.040 --> 13:55.240]  four and a half minutes long. It really lays out.
[13:55.240 --> 14:01.400]  And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well, we
[14:01.400 --> 14:07.680]  realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society. It was the
[14:07.680 --> 14:12.960]  subject of several documentaries. The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the
[14:12.960 --> 14:19.720]  goal to create a one-world government, run by the banking industry, run by the bankers,
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.200]  right? There'll be no more cash. And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.880]  This is what they want to accomplish. And all money will be in your chips. And if you're
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.360]  like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, then you can just turn off
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.240]  your chip. And you have nothing. You can't buy foods. You can't do anything. It's total
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.600]  control of people. And that chip's connected to a database that has your purchasing records,
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.120]  what you do, what you sell. Everything, everything is in there. And it was also commonly discussed
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.160]  that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there. Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.840]  Yes, they manipulate. Yes, there are secret societies. Yes, there have been oligarchies
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.840]  throughout history. And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling
[15:03.840 --> 15:13.640]  itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders,
[15:13.640 --> 15:20.040]  total and complete tyranny. So again, there's just a little bit of the report on the eve
[15:20.040 --> 15:26.920]  of a cashless society. And as Tucker Carlson said a few weeks ago, if they get these global
[15:26.920 --> 15:37.320]  digital currencies in place, all centralized, run by the UN, literally selected and designed
[15:37.320 --> 15:43.280]  by the WEF, the hell that comes with this is just unspeakable. So it really is the big
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.640]  front and center issue. And again, they're using the viral release and the rest of it
[15:47.640 --> 15:53.280]  as the pretext to bring it in on the back of the vaccine passport. And it's now all
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.080]  admitted. It's all here. Are your church just talking about it? No, they're not.
[15:57.080 --> 15:58.080]  We'll be right back.
[15:58.080 --> 16:07.360]  I want you to remember two words. Info Wars Platinum. In the history of Info Wars supplements,

[19:45.680 --> 19:54.240]  and online store media and health advice. Come see the wellness company and go to online
[19:54.240 --> 20:03.920]  health now.com as a conduit to the wellness company leading a frontal assault on the lies
[20:03.920 --> 20:25.480]  of the new world order. It's Alex Jones in the beginning, God created the heaven and
[20:25.480 --> 20:34.440]  water and God said, let there be light and there was light and God saw the light. They
[20:34.440 --> 20:45.440]  was good and divided the light from the doctor. And God called the late day and the darkness
[20:45.440 --> 20:51.760]  he called light and the evening and the morning was a free day and God said, let there be
[20:51.760 --> 20:58.760]  a firmness of the water and let it divide the water from the water and God made the
[20:58.760 --> 21:03.760]  firmness and divided the water which were under the firmness and the water which were
[21:03.760 --> 21:10.760]  above the firmness and it was no. And God called the firmness and the evening and the
[21:10.760 --> 21:16.760]  morning was a second day and God said, let the light is a minute and we'll be gathered
[21:16.760 --> 21:23.760]  together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was no. And God called the dry
[21:23.760 --> 21:31.760]  land earth and the gathering together of the water and holy sand and God thought it was
[21:31.760 --> 21:40.760]  good. And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a merry Christmas
[21:40.760 --> 21:47.760]  and God will follow you, follow you on the good earth.
[22:10.760 --> 22:19.760]  Find this video and more at band.video. Hundreds of new important reports the enemy doesn't
[22:19.760 --> 22:25.760]  want you to see every single day. Not just in full orders in our Intrepid Crew, but hundreds
[22:25.760 --> 22:31.760]  of other band individuals fighting on at band.video. I hope you'll join us there and I hope you'll
[22:31.760 --> 22:38.760]  share the videos and trigger the chain reaction of awakening. All right, so I want to get
[22:38.760 --> 22:45.760]  to the borders, the poison shots. I want to get into Zelensky's visit where he says that
[22:45.760 --> 22:51.760]  45 billion additional this month is not enough. It's now well over 150 billion that we know
[22:51.760 --> 22:57.760]  of. I guess that'll bring it up to almost 200 billion. That's not enough. So much of it's
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.760]  being laundered right back. That's why he's this big hero. And the Russians are getting
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.760]  slaughtered obviously because they're up against super high tech weapons all directed by the
[23:06.760 --> 23:12.760]  Pentagon and NATO. This is the robot wars. The first big robot war. There have been autonomous
[23:12.760 --> 23:17.760]  drones obviously for decades and decades but now it's on. I want to take your calls on those
[23:17.760 --> 23:24.760]  subjects. Those are three huge subjects. Obviously more Twitter files were released yesterday
[23:24.760 --> 23:29.760]  last night and it's everything I told you in spades because I've experienced that I've
[23:29.760 --> 23:33.760]  gone through it. I went back and tracked the legislation that Obama signed to get it done
[23:33.760 --> 23:38.760]  and it's exactly the borders. I got to tell you it's very frustrating to be telling people
[23:38.760 --> 23:44.760]  this seven years ago, six years ago and then now it's oh there'll be Pulitzer prizes for
[23:44.760 --> 23:51.760]  this breaking. It's not that I even want the credit. I've seen our enemy run circles around
[23:51.760 --> 23:57.760]  us because people are so naive. Remember all the CNN reports? Jones is insane. He says there's
[23:57.760 --> 24:02.760]  a secret FBI CIA program interfacing with big tech to surveil and censor. Jones claims
[24:02.760 --> 24:07.760]  President Trump's being spied on. Jones claims U.S. intelligence agencies created the steel
[24:07.760 --> 24:15.760]  dossier. Why it's just preposterous but it wasn't preposterous. I received from a connection
[24:15.760 --> 24:25.760]  of Joe Arpaio seven years ago before Trump was even elected. A DEA list that we redacted
[24:25.760 --> 24:35.760]  only put parts of out and we erased it. From the NSA of their interface with the NSA spying
[24:35.760 --> 24:43.760]  on my phone line, Trump's phone lines, everything. Think about that. And of course we knew it
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.760]  wasn't just the DEA interfacing with the NSA. It was more than 100 agencies, not just the
[24:48.760 --> 24:54.760]  18 intelligence agencies. And now we know they gave top secret security clearances to
[24:54.760 --> 25:03.760]  the big tech people. Not just the CEOs, not just the head officers but hundreds and hundreds
[25:03.760 --> 25:10.760]  of people that we know of inside the tech companies in each company to engage in criminal
[25:10.760 --> 25:17.760]  racketeering operations. This is a million times worse, conservatively when I say that
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.760]  I mean a million times worse than anything Richard Nixon ever even imagined. And what
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.760]  Senator Frank Church's committee exposed in the late 1970s of FBI surveillance and censorship
[25:28.760 --> 25:35.760]  that was the equivalent of a grain of sand and was terrible at the beach. So what Nixon
[25:35.760 --> 25:43.760]  did was a grain of sand. What the globalists have done is the entire beach. And that's
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.760]  why Elon Musk has said to Congressman Schiff who's basically calling for his criminal
[25:49.760 --> 25:56.760]  arrest. Schiff's coming after Musk. Musk asked Schiff if he would approve state censorship
[25:56.760 --> 26:02.760]  and advocate modern church commission to investigate FBI corruption. And Schiff responded with a
[26:02.760 --> 26:13.760]  properly Orwellian term, a proper Orwellian response saying I don't support censorship
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.760]  also don't support hate speech. So exposing Hunter Biden's laptop and he's on the laptop
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.760]  when recording saying I get orders from the Chinese head of the intelligence agency and
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.760]  I don't know what to do because now the Chinese head's been disappeared. GZPings arrested him.
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.760]  What does that mean for me and my dad and the hundreds of millions we get from him? I've
[26:35.760 --> 26:42.760]  served China well. These are audio messages, audio files he's sending to people. Dad, where
[26:42.760 --> 26:50.760]  is the spy chief? He usually calls me every day and tells me what to do. That's on the
[26:50.760 --> 26:57.760]  laptop. We played it probably 50 times. Dad, my Chinese handler's gone. What do I do, daddy?
[26:57.760 --> 27:11.760]  He told me to follow orders from GZP. I did what he was telling me and no. Daddy, daddy.
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.760]  And there was the FBI the whole time behind the scenes threatening Twitter at one point
[27:17.760 --> 27:23.760]  that you're not doing enough banning anyone talking about it. What do you think the FBI
[27:23.760 --> 27:32.760]  will do? The Justice Department and the CIA if Congress doesn't rein them in? People usually
[27:32.760 --> 27:36.760]  say abolish them and everybody's saying abolish them, great abolish them. But the entire
[27:36.760 --> 27:40.760]  government's full of spies like this at every level that think it's their right to spy
[27:40.760 --> 27:49.760]  on you, bully you, lie about you, attack you. It's all a giant maze of crazy people. What
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.760]  lunatic would want to work in an agency like that and do things like this when it's textbook,
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.760]  crazy and illegal? And it's illegal because societies fall that have stuff in them like
[28:00.760 --> 28:08.760]  this. Oh, but they're the liberal Harvard and Princeton elite and they, when they do things
[28:08.760 --> 28:22.760]  like make Hitler blush or GZP proud or Kim Jong-un envious or Fidel Castro amazed and
[28:22.760 --> 28:31.760]  admiring, it's just, oh, that's what we do. Ha, ha, ha, ha. FBI agent Elvis Chan, pretty
[28:31.760 --> 28:38.760]  cool name. Had worked closely with Twitter, especially Mr. Roth to suppress information
[28:38.760 --> 28:46.760]  about the 2020 election fraud. Let's make him famous. Says adorable patriot Todd. Making
[28:46.760 --> 28:53.760]  famous, he's already famous. He's a rock star. He runs your life and he's just getting started.
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.760]  The death camps are built. They're called COVID centers.
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[29:03.760 --> 29:10.760]  of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum. Now, all three of these revolutionary

[33:22.760 --> 33:29.760]  Live from Freedom Command Central. It's the Alex Jones show. So I don't want to sit here
[33:29.760 --> 33:33.760]  and say I told you so, but I do want people to listen to me understand that I'm not playing
[33:33.760 --> 33:38.760]  games and I know what I'm talking about instead of my guest, instead of our callers. Speaking
[33:38.760 --> 33:41.760]  of that, I'm going to give the number out here in a moment, take calls throughout the
[33:41.760 --> 33:48.760]  full broadcast. It's like we did yesterday on these big topics. So start your engines,
[33:48.760 --> 33:56.760]  put the number out here in a moment. But do you understand? I specifically analyzed the
[33:56.760 --> 34:01.760]  deep state stay behind networks of Obama. I tracked the money. I hired multiple high
[34:01.760 --> 34:07.760]  powered law firms and paid them a lot of money to vet it all, put it into briefs and I had
[34:07.760 --> 34:15.760]  them hand delivered to President Trump in 2017 and 2018. Now everybody knew what was going
[34:15.760 --> 34:23.760]  on, but everybody was scared. They then tried to set me up as punishment for this with the
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.760]  FBI as a Russian agent. And of course, I exposed it all, had lawyers write letters to the FBI,
[34:29.760 --> 34:35.760]  confronted them with it and then the FBI and others are like, well, let's not discuss this
[34:35.760 --> 34:41.760]  national security, blah, blah, blah. But the point is, we know you're a very loyal American
[34:41.760 --> 34:47.760]  and all this crap. So what they've done is they have targeted the American people, they
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.760]  have turned the spy agencies loose on us. And I was telling you this four years ago that
[34:52.760 --> 35:00.760]  they specifically five years ago have targeted us. And we're the beta test, okay? Now you
[35:00.760 --> 35:06.760]  see all this out there. And if you coward of this, they're going to win. But let me tell
[35:06.760 --> 35:11.760]  you, the bureaucrats and the professors and the people in the government agencies and the
[35:11.760 --> 35:15.760]  military and everywhere that are mid level and high up that are going along with this.
[35:15.760 --> 35:20.760]  If you've ever opened a history book or even seen recent history, there's no honor among
[35:20.760 --> 35:27.760]  thieves. Why would anyone get rid of our checks and balances? Why would anyone get rid of a
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.760]  free republic and then bring in a tyranny just because you get to sit on top of the tyranny
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.760]  list? Anybody that studies tyrannies knows that it always destroys, who puts it in charge
[35:37.760 --> 35:46.760]  and it always destroys the minions that bring the new corrupt elite into power. I saw a
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.760]  Netflix special about the Ottoman Empire. I don't watch a lot of TV, but I watched it
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.760]  a few weeks ago. Kind of binge watched it over a week at night. It was like six, seven,
[35:57.760 --> 36:03.760]  eight episodes. And it was about the fall of Constantinople that then became Istanbul.
[36:03.760 --> 36:07.760]  And I'd read a few history books about it and knew it. But it reminded me because it's such
[36:07.760 --> 36:17.760]  an accurate historical representation that when the Ottoman leader took over Constantinople,
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.760]  what was left the Roman Empire, now about 600 years ago, he killed all the traders that
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.760]  they'd been working with inside the city, who had helped bring down the king and helped
[36:29.760 --> 36:36.760]  bring down what was left of the Roman Christian Empire, the eastern part of it. Rome itself
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.760]  in what is Italy today had fallen to Alaric, the Visigoth chief did in 410. So it was over
[36:41.760 --> 36:51.760]  a thousand years later that I think he was like the 12th in line of Augustine that built
[36:51.760 --> 36:59.760]  the system and built that fell. And the king, the Christian king, they were Orthodox, fought
[36:59.760 --> 37:07.760]  to the death in the city. But as soon as Mamet, I pronounced that right, the Muslim leader
[37:07.760 --> 37:12.760]  took over and he already had a big empire and his dad had defeated a bunch of other groups.
[37:12.760 --> 37:18.760]  As soon as he took over, he said, bring me everybody that was our spies on their side.
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.760]  And he had them all killed. And they came in and said, sir, thank you, we can't wait
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.760]  for part of your empire. And he said, how dare you do this to your people and your emperor,
[37:27.760 --> 37:36.760]  you are going to be tortured to death for this. It's always done that way. You never leave
[37:36.760 --> 37:44.760]  the traders that lower the drawbridge. You never give the traders that tell the Ottomans
[37:44.760 --> 37:54.760]  when the Christians are going to launch a counterattack against the Ottomans in the ocean
[37:54.760 --> 38:00.760]  right off the coast of the city. But they did that because they thought, well, this army
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.760]  of 100,000 troops is too big. We've only got 7,000 troops. And so I'm going to go ahead
[38:05.760 --> 38:11.760]  and start just preparing for the fall. And the Muslims almost lost and they wouldn't have won
[38:11.760 --> 38:17.760]  if it wasn't for the traders inside that were giving them all the intelligence. Do you think
[38:17.760 --> 38:24.760]  the Muslim warlord that was now the emperor of Rome, do you think he was going to leave
[38:24.760 --> 38:32.760]  a couple hundred traders that were high up who were jockeying for control in his new system?
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.760]  And that's why I go back to that. You people that join with evil are idiots. And I've
[38:37.760 --> 38:44.760]  explained how this works. If the globalists completely take over and win, I will be approached
[38:44.760 --> 38:49.760]  and I'll be given one last chance to join and work for the New World Order because I am
[38:49.760 --> 38:55.760]  an honorable person. They know if I actually sold out and got on my knee to them, I would
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.760]  actually serve them and would not work against them. I've never bowed my knee. I've never
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.760]  served them. I've never taken their offers. I've never double dealt. And they've tried
[39:04.760 --> 39:12.760]  to hire me more than 15 times. And the last few times they said, too bad for you, you're
[39:12.760 --> 39:15.760]  going to get it now. And I said, you're going to get it. Look at history, you're going to
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.760]  fail. So that's the level I'm at. And it's not about bragging to the audience, it's about
[39:20.760 --> 39:26.760]  realizing the level you're at when you tune into this broadcast. This is the real level
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.760]  here, ladies and gentlemen. And all you idiots bringing in this tyranny, they're going to
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.760]  call left-wing revolution if they win. And that's a 5, 10 years. This is their reorganization,
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.760]  their reeducation, their cultural revolution. But when they're done, if you look at what
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.760]  they did to Mao and his cultural revolution, they were done. They locked up his wife, poisoned
[39:44.760 --> 39:51.760]  Mao, and moved on. And it's the same thing. So all of you idiots, I'm not talking about
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.760]  our general audience, but all of you people that serve the system that tune in and laugh
[39:55.760 --> 39:59.760]  and giggle and love deception and love going along with evil, you're crapping in your own
[39:59.760 --> 40:05.760]  bed, you're burning down your own house, you're destroying your own future, you are fools. You
[40:05.760 --> 40:12.760]  are absolute fools. The first group that any revolution taking over gets rid of is the
[40:12.760 --> 40:23.760]  traders that helped them get into power. The first order of business for the new world
[40:23.760 --> 40:33.760]  order when they take over is getting rid of all of you. But you're not going to listen.
[40:33.760 --> 40:46.760]  Maybe some of you are, but you just don't know the rules of history. Now, I'm going to
[40:46.760 --> 40:53.760]  give the number out and we're taking calls on four huge subjects. The Dick Tedders of
[40:53.760 --> 40:57.760]  Lensky in D.C. now and his big address coming up and all the parties tonight, them demanding
[40:57.760 --> 41:04.760]  more than $45 billion is their latest promise for this month. The open borders totally
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.760]  collapsed and what's happening there. I got a lot of clips and news there. The poisoned
[41:08.760 --> 41:11.760]  shots, maybe you love the shots, call in and tell us your story about how great it was.
[41:11.760 --> 41:15.760]  Nobody ever calls in that thinks they had a good experience, but phones are open for
[41:15.760 --> 41:18.760]  them. We don't screen them other than a good clean phone line. You're ready to make your
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.760]  point. I'd love to hear from all of you. We're going to take a lot of calls today. The toll
[41:23.760 --> 41:37.760]  free number is 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. We had a lot of amazing calls yesterday. We're
[41:37.760 --> 41:43.760]  going to take your calls today on three subjects I mentioned. The fourth is the intelligence
[41:43.760 --> 41:49.760]  agencies illegally with select corporations shutting off their competition, going in and
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.760]  de-platforming new startup internet companies and harassing platforms like Parler and Gab
[41:54.760 --> 41:59.760]  and Info Wars. This is all illegal as hell. It's one thing if big tech wants to censor
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.760]  its competition and shut them out. That's violate section 230 and it's wrong and it's
[42:03.760 --> 42:07.760]  illegal and it shouldn't be done. But when you collude with the government or a political
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.760]  party and with the UN who brags that they direct, that came out two months ago, the head
[42:12.760 --> 42:18.760]  of the UN operations bureau said, oh, we tell the big tech what to do. We already know that,
[42:18.760 --> 42:25.760]  but it's official and it's illegal. Just like how the UN tell the NGOs they control on the
[42:25.760 --> 42:29.760]  border and the NGOs control the border patrol. It's all on record. It's illegal. Finally,
[42:29.760 --> 42:35.760]  Greg Abbott's opened the criminal investigation. Good. But this is all completely illegitimate,
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.760]  completely insane. On a scale of 1 to 10 of tyranny, it's a 10. And it always leads to
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.760]  giant camps, mass arrest extermination. That's the next phase of this. Once they get their
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.760]  castle society in place. So those are the big topics. We talk castle society as well.
[42:49.760 --> 42:57.760]  That's five topics. But just on those five topics, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, your calls
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.760]  are coming up. Stay with us.

[43:06.760 --> 43:12.760]  exclusively for Infowars life. The main ingredient in the real red pill plus is
[43:12.760 --> 43:18.760]  Pregnanolone, a little known neuro steroid that assists in our body's natural hormone
[43:18.760 --> 43:25.760]  production and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function and unhealthy aging.
[43:25.760 --> 43:32.760]  The real red pill plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium
[43:32.760 --> 43:39.760]  and zinc. Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine and theobromine, the energy blend
[43:39.760 --> 43:45.760]  inside the real red pill plus provides an extra pick me up for your day that goes beyond

[44:31.760 --> 44:36.760]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.760]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[44:41.760 --> 44:46.760]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[44:46.760 --> 44:51.760]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations

[47:01.760 --> 47:22.760]  And we are back live on your host Alex Jones. I was giving an example of a fall in Constantinople
[47:22.760 --> 47:28.760]  almost 600 years ago when the Muslim Ottoman Empire took it over with the help of traders
[47:28.760 --> 47:48.760]  and they all got tortured and executed for helping. And why do you think the Muslim emperor
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.760]  did that? He didn't just do it so that those traders wouldn't be around to sell him out.
[47:53.760 --> 48:00.760]  He did it so that other people in his government would not ever think about double crossing him.
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.760]  And again, I'm trying to explain to the minions of the New World War or something.
[48:04.760 --> 48:13.760]  There are historic rules that are followed in war for a reason and the globalist above
[48:13.760 --> 48:18.760]  the little trader class still follow those rules.
[48:18.760 --> 48:27.760]  An example of that is the head of the Russian military secretly made a trip a few months ago
[48:27.760 --> 48:33.760]  to the front lines of Ukraine and it's now come out and Russia has confirmed it's true.
[48:33.760 --> 48:40.760]  And with the satellites of all their systems, they knew right where he was and could have killed him.
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.760]  Even though they killed 20 plus other Russian generals, they made the decision because he was the leader
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.760]  of the Russian military not to do it. You know, why do they do that?
[48:48.760 --> 48:55.760]  Why they let Napoleon go the first time they defeated him, then he came back and took over again?
[48:55.760 --> 49:03.760]  Because they want the rules set where if they ever get defeated, they're going to get out of jail free card.
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.760]  They didn't let the head Russian general live because they liked him.
[49:07.760 --> 49:15.760]  They did it because they're continuing that art of chivalry forward but only for the ruling elites.
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.760]  You don't get that same rule because you're seen as an animal.
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.760]  And I know I'm trying to talk to the animals that serve the New World Order and think there may be some humanity left in you
[49:25.760 --> 49:28.760]  but just please look at the economy falling apart.
[49:28.760 --> 49:31.760]  Look at things degenerating. Look at the crime. Look at the evil.
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.760]  If any of you have children, why would you do that? Why would you do this?
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.760]  You're being used by the globalists in a much larger plan and when the New World Order talks about 80-90%
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.760]  of the population of the earth, if any of you have done what that process is going to look like,
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.760]  I have a very good idea, and I've been forecasting it for decades.
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.760]  Almost none of you are going to live that serve this and those that do live are going to wish you were dead.
[49:56.760 --> 50:02.760]  So I'm just here saying this way is destruction, this way is nuclear war, this way is total collapse,
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.760]  this way is impoverishment and pain. The globalists on top want to get rid of this civilization
[50:07.760 --> 50:10.760]  and they're willing to do it and they believe they're going to protect themselves from the process
[50:10.760 --> 50:12.760]  but they know they're still gambling.
[50:12.760 --> 50:17.760]  But for those of you that don't have tens of billions of dollars and secret armored redoubts,
[50:17.760 --> 50:24.760]  500 miles from any town and underground warehouses of gold and stockpiles of medicine,
[50:24.760 --> 50:35.760]  which believe me, the rulers do have, you are crazy.
[50:35.760 --> 50:37.760]  Wednesday live, World War III alert.
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.760]  Ukrainian dictators and Linsky visits Washington, demands hundreds of billions of dollars in support for nuclear war.
[50:43.760 --> 50:48.760]  And he fired missiles into Poland a month ago and said the Russians did it and demanded nuclear strikes on Russia
[50:48.760 --> 50:53.760]  hoping we would just pull the trigger. I mean, what is he thinking?
[50:53.760 --> 51:01.760]  I mean, he's a gay porn star. What do you think he's thinking? Not thinking much.
[51:01.760 --> 51:08.760]  So he's totally compromised. You got to ask who are the forces behind Zelensky that behave like this
[51:08.760 --> 51:12.760]  and act like this and they're doing this. They're nihilists, they're flirting with destruction,
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.760]  they're demonically inclined.
[51:16.760 --> 51:24.760]  Now, we got a ton of calls here, loaded phone lines, Russell, Tom, Ron, Jay, Alkiller, Adrian, Justin, Josh, Stan, Henry, Ed,
[51:24.760 --> 51:31.760]  first-time callers, long-time callers, everybody is here today. Welcome.
[51:31.760 --> 51:35.760]  And we're going to go over all these big topics with you and I have some incredible clips we're going to get to.
[51:35.760 --> 51:42.760]  In fact, I'm going to get to one of Dr. Michael Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer who retired one year before they released COVID.
[51:42.760 --> 51:48.760]  Listen to what he says here in a moment. He says, I've not been a Christian and I didn't believe in God or religion,
[51:48.760 --> 51:58.760]  but basically now I do. There is a demonic intelligence to this and this is satanic and the people doing it are destroying themselves in the process.
[51:58.760 --> 52:04.760]  Yeah, exactly. He's got it. Guys got like 170 IQ on record.
[52:04.760 --> 52:15.760]  He's going, I believe in God now because he sees elites doing things that hurt themselves as well to kill people and the total control and evil and what it's all about.
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.760]  And he's now gotten to the realization it's satanic. That's coming up in a moment.
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.760]  But first, I want to thank the listeners. I've sent out the bat signal many times, but we are maxed out.
[52:25.760 --> 52:29.760]  Our legal bills are going down because we're on appeal. I'm in bankruptcy.
[52:29.760 --> 52:38.760]  It's chapter 11 sub chapter five. It's a reorganization. As long as we can be solvent and somewhat profitable, then the money will go to run this operation.
[52:38.760 --> 52:41.760]  Keep us on the air for years while the appeals go forward.
[52:41.760 --> 52:48.760]  The only way to be taken off the air is if you don't support the broadcast and if you don't buy great products that you already need.
[52:48.760 --> 52:50.760]  So it's a win-win just make the decision.
[52:50.760 --> 52:56.760]  And I thank you to go to info or short.com and get products you need. Take vitamin mineral fusion.
[52:56.760 --> 53:00.760]  More of this is not coming in until February at the earliest.
[53:00.760 --> 53:09.760]  It's all the best vitamins, all the key minerals, all the key amino acids, everything you need in one scoop, put it in the water, put it in the refrigerator, drink it in the morning, night, whatever, tastes great.
[53:09.760 --> 53:16.760]  And it's everything you need. So many problems. Most of the problems are deficiency or one or the other. This is what you need.
[53:16.760 --> 53:26.760]  Despite the fact it's going to sell out in the next couple of weeks, maybe even sooner, 50% off I want you to have it and I want to incentivize those of you on the fence to become info or customers at info or store.com.
[53:26.760 --> 53:33.760]  Sign up for auto ship and they hold one back for you and you get double patriot points as well and 10% off on the next order.
[53:33.760 --> 53:39.760]  Now people are really excited about this and this this is pulling us out of the red into the black here very soon.
[53:39.760 --> 53:49.760]  So thank all you that remember how great the red pill plus is. I don't have 10 minutes or everything that's in it, but it has preglonone, the precursor that your body produces naturally that helps your body.
[53:49.760 --> 53:58.760]  You've got to have it create all your other hormones, just stamina, libido, energy. So many people are missing preglonone, especially those 40 or older.
[53:58.760 --> 54:04.760]  It has a good dose of the highest quality preglonone in it and then it's got all these other key trace elements in it.
[54:04.760 --> 54:11.760]  So many people are missing that work as cofactors with regular minerals and vitamins and then it's got a bunch of other things.
[54:11.760 --> 54:18.760]  It would take five minutes to read all the ingredients. This is really a game changer, real red pill plus backup stock up for two years being sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[54:18.760 --> 54:25.760]  It is 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[54:25.760 --> 54:32.760]  Then there's the new info wars MD line. We can only discount 25% off because there's not much markup in it.
[54:32.760 --> 54:40.760]  These are clones of already best selling products around the country from a top supplement maker with listeners that are letting us private label it and put our name on it.
[54:40.760 --> 54:46.760]  And they ship it out of their facility so you'd get it even quicker and they're not shipping it to us and then having to add that cost to it.
[54:46.760 --> 54:53.760]  That's how we're able to do free shipping again at infowarstore.com on order three dollars or more and the regular shipping cost has been cut in half.
[54:53.760 --> 55:00.760]  So a lot of big changes, a lot of innovations at infowarstore.com like the turmeric 95 is the same formula as bodies.
[55:00.760 --> 55:07.760]  This is a little bit lower price, turmeric 95, infowarstore.com nitric boost. Everybody should be taking it for your heart and lungs and cardiovascular.
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.760]  They're about to sell out of the super high quality CBD at about half the price. Other great CBDs that are amazing for pain and joint pain and more.
[55:14.760 --> 55:23.760]  We've got all that infowarstore.com. Check out the info wars MD line and a whole another pharmaceutical maker that also makes top line supplements.
[55:23.760 --> 55:31.760]  It says three number one best sellers. I said, what are your best sellers? They said our top three are these and you can private label them and sell them for up to 50% off.
[55:31.760 --> 55:41.760]  But they're sold in stores under the info wars platinum name 1776 testosterone boost is the name I gave the already number one best selling testosterone booster in the country.
[55:41.760 --> 55:54.760]  I've been labeled HCH max boost and pain MD all 50% off out of the gates info wars platinum brand at infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[55:54.760 --> 56:01.760]  We're a few minutes to break so I can't get to Dr. Michael yon yet we'll go to break come back play it.
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.760]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls and so much more but wait to hear what Sean Penn said.
[56:05.760 --> 56:13.760]  This isn't all the leftist a year ago two years ago saying arresting and vaccinated. He said this yesterday. I've had dinner with Sean Penn. I know Sean Penn.
[56:13.760 --> 56:21.760]  You can't blame Sean Penn. He is literally an empty suit. The man has probably a 75 IQ.
[56:21.760 --> 56:25.760]  But people think he's smart because he pauses and talks slow.
[56:25.760 --> 56:35.760]  But if you work glasses somebody thinks you're smarter. I mean the man is a puppet. The man is a meat sock. The man is a meat marionette.
[56:35.760 --> 56:42.760]  And he is one of the stupidest people I've ever been around here. We're taking out a super gorgeous woman.
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.760]  But she's so stupid you just drop her off at home. There's just nothing nothing grosser folks in her.
[56:47.760 --> 56:54.760]  And then you get one of these leftist men that is so dumb. I mean you just feel like you're in you feel like an idiot even being in their presence.
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.760]  Sean Penn is the is the is the epitome of Hollywood.
[56:59.760 --> 57:10.760]  And then to see somebody like Tom Cruise who's been right about drugging the kids and so much more have people thrown off his set that aren't vaccinated with the poison aren't wearing masks frothing and groveling.
[57:10.760 --> 57:20.760]  It's disgusting. These people are fakes and they're frauds and they're anathema and they're soulless and we should have nothing to do with any of them.
[57:20.760 --> 57:28.760]  So burn in hell. Sean Penn you mental dwarf.
[57:28.760 --> 57:33.760]  All right. Our number two with your calls and so much more is straight ahead.
[57:33.760 --> 57:37.760]  Take the live feed from info wars dot com forward slash show and share it.
[57:37.760 --> 57:41.760]  It's literally the equivalent of punching the new world order politically nonviolently in the nose.
[57:41.760 --> 57:49.760]  Punch George Soros in the nose. Share the links info wars dot com forward slash show.
[57:49.760 --> 57:57.760]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[57:57.760 --> 58:03.760]  And now with all the things were bombarded with the water and the food and the feminizing factors.
[58:03.760 --> 58:05.760]  It is more important than ever to use the compounds.
[58:05.760 --> 58:08.760]  God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[58:08.760 --> 58:10.760]  These products work great for women as well.
[58:10.760 --> 58:12.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have pain.
[58:12.760 --> 58:20.760]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name. We got a discounted for 40% off info wars store dot com under the label.
[58:20.760 --> 58:21.760]  Info wars platinum.
[58:21.760 --> 58:23.760]  They've also got HGH max boost.
[58:23.760 --> 58:24.760]  Read all about it.
[58:24.760 --> 58:26.760]  Be very safe with it.
[58:26.760 --> 58:29.760]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[58:29.760 --> 58:31.760]  Don't do it during the day.
[58:31.760 --> 58:33.760]  1776 testosterone boost.

[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.760]  All right, I want all the stations to hear your calls.

[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760]  But first, I want to replay this report.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.760]  It's so important on the eve of the casual society from Gregory's.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:22.760]  This is so vital here in us.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.760]  A key component of human life is enlightenment.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.760]  The awakening from the darkness of deception into the light of truth.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.760]  The so-called great awakening has really been going on forever.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:44.760]  And before MAGA and QAnon, the consensus was that the banks were at the top of the criminal pyramid structure.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well,
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.760]  we realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.760]  It was the subject of several documentaries.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:08.760]  The goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one-world government run by the banking industry, run by the bankers.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.760]  There'll be no more cash.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.760]  And this is going to be straight from Rockefeller himself.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.760]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.760]  And all money will be in your chips.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.760]  And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.760]  And you have nothing.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760]  You can't buy food.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.760]  You can't do anything. It's total control of people.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.760]  And that chips connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do, what you sell.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760]  Everything. Everything is in there.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.760]  And he was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.760]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]  Yes, they manipulate.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.760]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:54.760]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order,
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:03.760]  pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.760]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources,
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.760]  by centralizing and socializing healthcare, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:25.760]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.760]  But now it's as if everyone has just accepted it and found something else to fight about,
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.760]  because the cashless society is being rolled out right now.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  And very few people seem bothered by it.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:50.760]  In November of 2019, right before COVID, the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School had a live tabletop exercise called Digital Currency Wars,
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:58.760]  which looked at how the United States can continue to leverage economic power in a world of national digital currencies,
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:10.760]  such as the Chinese Digital Yuan, which is already heavily competing in trade against the US dollar, and seems to be at the forefront of centralized digital currencies.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.760]  And it has an expiry date.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.760]  If you don't spend it by then, it becomes worthless, so people can no longer save money.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  The Bank of International Settlements has announced that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations, and will have technologies to enforce it.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.760]  The central bank of Brazil is planning to launch their centralized digital currency in 2024.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:43.760]  Israel is about to launch theirs, and the Bank of England is now preparing a UK digital currency.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:52.760]  Italy's new Prime Minister Maloney is speaking out against the cashless society, but she seems to stand alone on the world stage.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:04:00.760]  In the Federal Reserve's Digital Currency Scheme, it appears that Hedera and Quant will be used on the technology side.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.760]  They are already connected to everything.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.760]  The cashless society is here, but everyone is talking about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.760]  The goal was never to put an old senile puppet into the presidency to run havoc.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:26.760]  The goal was to create a cashless society, and so while bringing Joe Biden to justice may feel like a victory, the tyrants are still getting exactly what they wanted.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.760]  And once it's all said and done, then who will save you?
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:41.760]  And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip, and you have nothing. You can't buy foods. You can't do anything.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.760]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:59.760]  By the way, people say that interview with Rousseff's from 2009, he actually died in 2007. Right after the end game came out, I did an interview with him in 2006.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:08.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of Infowars under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:18.760]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:30.760]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:37.760]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:46.760]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:56.760]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your health care provider.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:18.760]  Those are so powerful. Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  That's right. Thanks to the audience. We've been hard to shut down. I salute you all for keeping us on air and everything you do. That goes to our affiliates, our sponsors, the crew, and our wonderful, beautiful listeners.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:35.760]  All right. I'm going to take phone calls for the next two hours, ladies and gentlemen. Then we'll go into the fourth hour covering news and more.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:42.760]  We've got loaded phone lines here. So I'm going to go to your phone calls right now. Just please make your points. We can get to the next person. I want to hear from you all.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.760]  Tom in Canada on the Ukraine war and the poison shots. Go ahead.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:58.760]  Alex, the first time I heard the term vaccine passport was on your show in May 2020. You nailed it.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:06.760]  We must never forget about what happened. Stay strong. I drove with the Freedom Convoy in Canada.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:13.760]  And your dictator says you're a criminal and not allowed to protest.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.760]  That's correct. The man's a lunatic.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.760]  And for those that don't know, people say, how is he a dictator? He's elected. He got, what, 30% of the vote?
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:29.760]  But he manipulates the parliament so he stays in power. But it doesn't matter. Even if you're elected, if you do dictatorial things, folks, you're a dictator.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:38.760]  He has not won the popular vote since 2015.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:44.760]  What's your view on the Ukraine war in Zelensky coming here demanding more than 48 billion this week?
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:08:00.760]  The USA should cut all funding to that conflict. Putin should build a demilitarized zone so he can hold the Donbass and the war.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:10.760]  Well, that's what Kissinger says is given those areas that are like 98% Russia that's always a part of Russia and give Putin an exit or this is going to lead to nuclear war. Anything else, sir?
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.760]  Crimea and Donbass belong with Russia, but the rest of the country should stay with Ukraine.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:24.760]  Thank you for the call. By the way, I said 48 billion. They're offering him 45 billion. He's demanding 100 billion or more.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:31.760]  Hell, he'd have been at a trillion a few weeks ago. The guy's just something else. Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Kentucky. Jay, you're on the air.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.760]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760]  Hey, brother.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:42.760]  You're very eloquent with your words and I appreciate you. And I may not be very conservative.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:55.760]  You and I go to a synagogue and a lot of the people I shared your links with their eyes are opening up to the point that I'm getting messages back from people.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:08.760]  And I sent that link about Fauci and I sent the link Fauci criminal crimes and I sent the link to the rumble thing suddenly died.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:18.760]  And these people, you know, I'm actually witnessing what's going on with people losing babies and having to have special operations to try to conceal.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:25.760]  Well, that was my point with Jay when he was going off on the ridiculous Hitler thing was, hey, you know, Israel's being hit harder than anybody with these poison shots.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.760]  If the Jews run everything, why didn't they get the message to not take the shots?
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:39.760]  People are people and the globalist or consortium of evil groups that are all vying for power and we all, whether we're Christian or Muslim or Jewish or agnostic,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.760]  have to come together and transcend political labels and just call for a pro human future.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  When I'm getting from you as you think a lot of Jews, you know, that are saying conservative at least or orthodox or maybe they're not orthodox, they're really starting to wake up.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.760]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  Propaganda was strong, but now you can't, you can't not see what's going on with even my rabbi that I love.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:10.760]  He got the shot, the COVID shot there and he was, you know, and he was sick with COVID.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.760]  And we had a little discussion and I said, I really wish you didn't get that shot.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760]  And he said, me too.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]  But it's a little late now.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.760]  But, you know, these people.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.760]  Dr. Zalinko that came from a long rabbinical family, but became a doctor himself.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.760]  That was one of the main leaders warning everybody.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760]  So folks should really listen to him.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.760]  Yeah, I missed Zalinko.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:44.760]  And I liked the one thing that I liked a lot that he said that the one thing that I really liked is whether you're waiting for the Messiah to come for the first time or the second time, we need a Messiah right now.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]  We do.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.760]  And, man, you know, but I'll cut you loose. I really do appreciate you in your program. Thank you.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.760]  Well, God bless you, Jay. Good news folks are waking up. Thank you. That's what I'm saying.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.760]  Hell, even all these big Hollywood stars are coming out and apologizing.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.760]  I meant to get to that clip yesterday.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760]  What's the guy?
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  He's an actor from Shawshank Redemption.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.760]  He's a good actor, but he's always saying Tim Robbins.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.760]  He's always saying stupid liberal stuff, but more and more, he's coming out and saying, no, no, we're wrong.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760]  This is wrong.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.760]  So a lot of these liberals mean well, folks, they just don't know.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.760]  We can wake them up and you're going to see whether they're going to wake up or not.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.760]  I mean, take, I mean, there's so many examples of this, so many examples of this.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Arizona.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760]  Ron, let's talk about the open border. Go ahead.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.760]  Good morning, Alex Jones. Great to talk to you, sir.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:47.760]  You know, I got up this morning, I put on my system and I says we're, our great McConnell says, oh, the Ukraine war is the greatest challenge or, you know, the greatest thing that's facing the United States.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  And you went on a lie and say that Republicans overall, that's the number one issue for them.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  And last night I went to an all night gas station here in Phoenix, where I live close to the interstate, the north-south interstate.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:15.760]  And it was about two in the morning and I go into the store and it's a national chain of gas stations and side.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:22.760]  And there's 10 men in line, okay, across the coffee machines, up to the men's room.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.760]  Notice they're all about the same age, same size, everything.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.760]  And one of them comes out of the men's restroom and another one goes in.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760]  And I said, what the heck's going on?
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  And I get to the front of the line and I just open the door and I look and none of these men realize there's multiple urinals, multiple stalls in this gas station.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760]  They've never seen.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  Let me, let me tell folks where you're going.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:53.760]  I showed this about five years ago, they're at the truck stops on I-35, almost all of them have this.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.760]  It tells you in Spanish, put your toilet paper in the toilet.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.760]  And so a lot of these guys crap in the corner or piss in the corner.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:09.760]  And I'm not putting them down, but these are literally farm boys from Central and South America that have never even been in a bathroom.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.760]  And they think you crap on the floor.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.760]  I mean, can you imagine how the globalist, I'm sorry, I'm stealing your thunder. Tell the rest of the story.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  Okay, though, I didn't realize that because they were polite.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:27.760]  You know, when I walked by them, they put their heads down, you know, they, it's not like they were, you know, trying to make a problem, but they were trying to stay out of the way.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760]  So I'm curious.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760]  I'm an info warrior.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.760]  I'm waiting and they all come out and they all pile into these white vans.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.760]  There was two white vans identical with Utah plates.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760]  Yep.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  Yeah, that's what's happening.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.760]  They left us controlled areas.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.760]  People don't know Utah is kind of leftist.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760]  They do it too.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.760]  They get people there, then they sign them up for welfare, then they skim the money off the top.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.760]  You know, and I'm like, what am I supposed to do?
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.760]  Am I, you know, I'm not the type to strap on and I'm not going to, you know, make an issue of fighting that.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.760]  And if I tell anybody this, they think I'm crazy.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.760]  And, you know, it's all you got to do is step out of your house here in Arizona.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.760]  We got a war.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.760]  It's not a war.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  Brother, you ain't got to tell me I've been to the border.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.760]  It is crazy town.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.760]  20,000 a day.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  Now, it was 14,000 a day before 20,000 a day in El Paso alone.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.760]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760]  And then put on national news.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.760]  They say, well, you haven't seen anything yet.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760]  Wait until 42.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.760]  And I'm like, I haven't seen anything yet.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  Well, just imagine where these people come from that they don't know what a toilet's for.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  And the exposure to our population, you know, the pristine nature of what the United States used to be is being.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]  Right.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]  I totally agree.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  Central and South America are something like 80% rural.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.760]  And so these folks grow up in farms.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.760]  They work.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760]  They produce the food that everybody eats.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.760]  And then they did two years of lockdowns.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.760]  They no longer have jobs.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.760]  They did a big survey earlier this year and they asked, why are you coming?
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.760]  97% said because they won't let me work.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.760]  I'm starving to death.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760]  So it's not their fault.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  They're having the UN lockdowns that went for two years in their countries.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760]  And they're being told, come here.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  And they don't even know how to use a toilet.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.760]  Anything else, Ron?
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.760]  No, that's it.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  So you nailed it.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.760]  And I'm so happy you're on radio and hanging on my man.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  Good luck.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.760]  I'm trying.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.760]  It's all up to you guys.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  And I'm not putting it on you.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.760]  I'm not bitching.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:25.760]  You want to take me out of the game, folks?
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.760]  Don't buy the products.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760]  Don't spread the word.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760]  Because it's neck and neck.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.760]  We've never been more influential, but at the same time, the economy and everything going on,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760]  people are like, well, you're bankrupt.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.760]  I mean, a billion-dollar judgment.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.760]  You're going away.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760]  No, we're not.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760]  We're appealing it for two years.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.760]  Somebody has to worry about products you buy from us going to the left or any of this crap.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  We're in bankruptcy to reorganize, and we have two years of appeals.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.760]  So that's what's bittersweet about this.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  Because I have almost no money, so they're getting all this money.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.760]  We'll be right back with your call.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:06.760]  I want you to remember two words, InfoWars Platinum, in the history of InfoWars supplements, and
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.760]  they're amazing.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.760]  This is hands-down the most powerful game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.760]  Now, all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.760]  pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.760]  And the owner's a listener and a supporter.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.760]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what they're
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.760]  sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.760]  These are incredible.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:41.760]  Paying MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course, 1776, testosterone boost.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.760]  Read about them at InfoWarsTour.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.760]  And I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.

[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:33.760]  My eyes are blind, but I'm in the sea.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:41.760]  There's no place in all the trees.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  Wow, so guys, a mother has left her kids behind here.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:24.760]  So, is tu mamá, o usted es la mamá?
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.760]  All right, guys, I'm going to start walking with what, it's a caravan now.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.760]  So, this is mothers leaving their children behind, and then shows up to 20,000 people
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]  with barbed wire.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.760]  They just open the barbed wire, let them in.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760]  This is a humanitarian disaster.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:47.760]  The left is caused by Biden telling the Democrats to go out and promote everywhere and telling
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.760]  the illegals, immediately rush the border and you'll be led into the country.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.760]  I want to go back to your calls, but this is important to document this here on air,
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.760]  on radio and TV.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.760]  Let's go to these clips.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.760]  Here's an MSNBC reporter says she spoke to illegal immigrants who told her they haven't
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.760]  had any interaction with U.S. immigration authorities.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.760]  But, again, there is no border crisis, and if there is a border crisis, it's the Republicans
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.760]  fault, and the Republicans told them to come here, ABC News and CNN and the White House have
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760]  told us.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760]  I mean, this is beyond gaslighting.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.760]  But they've just normalized this level of lying, and the media doesn't call them out.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]  Here's a clip.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.760]  We were even able to see, as of last night, a lot of migrants just crossing, and migrants
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.440]  I spoke to this morning saying they haven't had any interaction with U.S. immigration
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  authorities.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440]  They just walked right in.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.480]  Really, what we're seeing here is a city that is overwhelmed and in chaos.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.160]  These families behind me here, these are some of the lucky ones.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.240]  We're inside a shelter, but a lot of shelters are overwhelmed.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.200]  I just came from the streets this morning.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.440]  There are hundreds of people sleeping in the airports, at bus stations, on the streets,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.000]  and it's actually really cold here.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.840]  It was 33 degrees when we woke up this morning.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.840]  Migrants were huddling together under blankets for warmth, because even though Title 42 hasn't
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.680]  lifted yet, so many people have been able to come across.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.040]  Not every nationality gets expelled.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.280]  But we just spoke to people at this shelter here, Ruben Garcia, who runs this shelter,
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.160]  who says, look, already there are people sleeping on the streets.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.560]  The numbers that will be sleeping on the streets if Title 42 lists is unfathomable, and he says
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.160]  the federal government will have to do more.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.840]  Yeah, more funding so they can even flood the border even more.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.840]  That's how it works.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.800]  They flooded Europe's border the last 10 years, then demand more spending to bring even more
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800]  in.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.400]  That's what Biden said, hey, let the Republicans pass a law to give us a limited money.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.200]  We'll fix the crisis by getting more funding to bring even more in.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.520]  This Fox News fact checks the Biden administration for claiming they're not in favor of repealing
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.020]  Title 42.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.080]  So even here in how we got to get rid of it, it's the worst thing ever.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.080]  Suddenly on a dime, they're not for repealing Title 42.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080]  Here it is.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.560]  They've also been distancing themselves from this push the White House has to even end
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.360]  Title 42 in the first place.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360]  Listen to this.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.800]  That is a quarter order that is telling us to lift Title 42, and we're going to comply
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.360]  because we follow the rule of law.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.200]  Others should start to let that is, but it is a quarter order that is started by you
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.200]  guys.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.520]  It was a quarter order that has been provided to us.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.040]  The president made clear who wanted it back in April.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.440]  I give you a straight answer.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:28.960]  We had proposed to eliminate that policy by the end of May.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.320]  And when the courts have previously blocked the administration's push, the press secretary
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.960]  said the administration disagrees with the court's ruling.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.800]  So this current court action means that there is a chance that Title 42 stays in place either
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.120]  for the short term or indefinitely.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.680]  The White House, as we said, is moving forward as though this is going to lift.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.520]  But according to them, it is the courts that want to lift Title 42.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.280]  It is Republicans standing in the way of securing the border.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.200]  What the president has done on this issue so far has been a success, even though under
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.600]  the president's leadership, illegal crossings have hit all-time highs.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.600]  And anyone who suggests that the border is open is just spreading misinformation for
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.320]  the smugglers' hares.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  That's right.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.240]  Remember, Biden said, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.680]  And then they went and filed cases to get rid of 42 and had Democrat-appointed judges
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.560]  by Obama and others say it's illegal.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.080]  Think about how dumb they think we are.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.640]  But we're not dumb.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.960]  They're just training us that they lie to us and they don't get in trouble.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.600]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Biden saying surge the border.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.080]  I'm proud to have served with him.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.560]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.720]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.280]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.800]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800]  That's who we are.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.240]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.240]  come.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.240]  All right.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.400]  So I wanted to play some of those clips.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:08.520]  As you showed me a clip during a break earlier in El Paso last night, where it shows tens
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:12.040]  of thousands and then they just opened the bar bar and just let them all in.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.920]  I mean, we got plenty of footage of that in the past, but this is currently going on.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:24.520]  Trump completely stopped this, shipped back everybody, and the Democrats now say the Republicans
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.800]  are the ones doing this.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.920]  I mean, the footage coming out, it's all on infohorses.com.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.840]  The footage coming out is just spectacular.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:39.160]  We've got two long segments coming up, so I'm going to go to Al Killer and Adrian and
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.360]  Justin and Josh and Stan and Henry and Ed and Russell and George, everybody else on
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  the other side.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360]  And we're going to be covering a whole bunch of other issues as well.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.360]  I also haven't gotten to Dr. Mike Yedon talking about the vaccines being the work of Satan.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.640]  He's the former chief scientist at Pfizer.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.640]  He didn't believe in God until now.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.280]  God is coming up as well at the start of the next segment, but let me just briefly explain
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.280]  this.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  We have incredible products.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.480]  It's like our information is game changing.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.080]  Our products, particularly our supplements, are the very best, highest-rated key compounds
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.000]  the globalists don't want you to have.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.240]  And the real Red Pill Plus after two years plus of not being available because of supply
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:24.080]  chain issues is back, and it's got so many ingredients you should learn about, will take
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.920]  me hours to explain it.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.760]  Let's look into preglonome.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.640]  The precursor to all hormones in humans that your body produces naturally, but as you get
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.600]  older, you stop producing it.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  So anybody over 40 particularly should be taking preglonome, but this has all the trace
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.040]  elements and other minerals and vitamins and other key compounds that are for brain function
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.440]  and joints in your heart and your libido and your energy.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.440]  It just does so much.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.520]  You'll feel the effects in just a week or so of taking real Red Pill.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.920]  I mean, you'll feel some of the ingredients in 30 minutes.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.960]  It's got a lot of natural, healthy quality stimulants in it, but you'll feel the real
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.840]  effects in about a week or so.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.240]  Take it every night before you go to bed, ladies and gentlemen, it's what I, well, not
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.640]  because it has the stimulant in it.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.440]  Take it, that was the first Red Pill you could take at night.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.040]  Don't take this before you go to bed.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.480]  Take it when you get up in the morning, and it is incredible.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:24.360]  Real Red Pill Plus, we just added some natural stimulant to it, but it's Real Red Pill Plus
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.080]  InfoAwareStore.com, 50% off.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.800]  We also have the new over-the-top InfoAware Platinum line that has three already best
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.320]  selling products under a national pharmaceutical company that makes supplements, but already
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.920]  three best sellers in the market.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:47.880]  We were able to private label 1776 testosterone boosts, HGH boost, and pain MD, all 50% off
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.000]  out of the gates, they're incredible, and they keep us on air, so please experience
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  them and try them.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.120]  We'll be right back on the other side, oh, and the vitamin refusions selling out, but
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.680]  it's still 50% off.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:03.040]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.680]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.400]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:19.680]  Through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.120]  have done, and I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.120]  now.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.240]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:34.360]  It's InfoAware's Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoAwareStore.com.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.520]  This is private labeled, three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:43.840]  it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoAware's Platinum
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.960]  at InfoAwareStore.com.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:53.080]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.480]  Yule it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.480]  the InfoAware.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:03.200]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.960]  effects, and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.200]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water, and the food, and the
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:17.080]  feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.760]  our natural male potential.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.640]  These products work great for women as well.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD, it's the number one natural best seller under
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]  another name.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.040]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfoAwareStore.com under the label InfoAware's Platinum.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:37.160]  We've also got HGH Max Boost, read all about it, be very safe with it, I take only a fraction
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:40.840]  of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night, don't do it during
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:41.840]  the day.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.320]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:51.440]  Go read about them, learn more about them at InfoAwareStore.com in the InfoAware's Platinum
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:58.440]  section, and you get 40% off on these already best-selling products under the new name InfoAware's
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440]  Platinum.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.080]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered, and InfoAware's has been the tip of spear against
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.080]  tyranny.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.920]  But when it comes to the products we sell to funder operation, they're just like our
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:13.320]  news and information, they are powerful and they change the world.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.440]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years it's been sold out
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.200]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.520]  It's finally back at stock for 50% off InfoAwareStore.com.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.520]  Now in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it, but
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.600]  this sucker is amazing.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.000]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.320]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.720]  Just look at the preglenome that we've got that's in this product.

[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.440]  This is as close as the Matrix Red Pill as you're going to get.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.240]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off InfoAwareStore.com.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:05.720]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.080]  these mail-in ballots.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:14.440]  It's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:19.800]  election month, Alex, it's not election day, and that's the problem.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.800]  Everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:28.720]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.800]  mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.080]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:37.360]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.880]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:47.720]  problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:54.280]  question our election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.280]  way they are.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:00.120]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:06.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:16.120]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:37.400]  Here's the deal, you got 20,000 illegal aliens a day hitting the border just in the El Paso
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:43.360]  area every day, and it's our border patrol and our taxpayers that have to try to process
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.880]  all these people so they don't just starve to death over there.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.680]  Now you got cold weather set to hit the next two days, a little less than 48 hours, it's
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.320]  going to be 16 degrees, even down in South Texas.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.560]  And this is Biden saying, come here, this is the UN setting up refugee camps, and then
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.200]  dumping on us, knowing we have a good Samaritan attitude.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:10.600]  But there's never going to be an end to this, this is just the beginning.
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.600]  This is replacement migration.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:21.120]  The UN said 10 years ago they want 640-something million illegal aliens brought into the US
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.560]  alone and it's game over.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.360]  No education, no background, no nothing, don't know what toilets are, they're going to be
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:30.760]  brainwashed and they're going to do what the communists tell them, and it's game over
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.520]  end of our free society.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.160]  But that's what happens to all great civilizations, they forget who they are, they give it up
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160]  and they die.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.040]  We've got a chance to turn this around and then try to educate the groups they've already
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.280]  brought in, but it goes on much longer, I don't know what we're going to do folks, this
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  is so cold-blooded.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:54.760]  Meanwhile, you've got Soros has gotten over 800 district attorneys and county attorneys
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.440]  elected and stalled around the country, he's got like 22 attorney generals at the state
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.720]  level and now he's trying to shut down the police, they don't fully control.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.920]  Big headline on infowars.com, report Soros non-provids donated more than 35 million
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.480]  to aid anti-police groups just this year so far, and that's not to get rid of the police,
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.520]  it's to take them over, these people mean business, I've already dealt with two Soros
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.520]  judges and they're rigged trials against me, total weaponization.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:29.520]  All right, let's go to your calls, Al Killer in Virginia, go ahead.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:38.680]  You know, Steve Bannon was at the turning point, USA, over the weekend and he was on
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:45.160]  Tim Poole's segment and he hit on the fact that we can't compete with the Federal Reserve
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:52.680]  when they're able to print money out of thin air and at this point, where is the solution
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.320]  on our end?
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.920]  We already know what the globalists want, they have their great reset, what is the solution
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.640]  on the end of this that we want?
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.400]  Well, you know what I was about to say, look at what Soros is worried about, he's worried
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:09.280]  about district attorneys, county attorneys, state attorney generals, you got a bunch of
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.200]  state attorney generals standing up against the carbon tax, standing up against open borders,
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.400]  standing up against the fentanyl, standing up against the human smuggling, you've got
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.120]  the Texas Governor and Attorney General doing criminal investigations of the UN NGOs running
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:28.240]  the border collapse, we need indictments now, we need the states to step in where we still
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.760]  have attorney generals that still have prosecutors and we've got to start prosecuting the deep
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.240]  state Democrats.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240]  What?
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.800]  Even so, they can do an investigation until they're blue in the face, look, if what came
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:49.200]  out on Twitter yesterday was any indication, with a Republican president, they had the
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.440]  army doing a thigh-up knowing that the Hunter Biden stuff laptop was a real...
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.400]  You know, they had all the federal agencies working against the president and the American
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.240]  people with all the big tech companies illegally, yes, you're right, I appreciate your call,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:11.320]  it's absolutely criminal, it's a coup, we're living inside a globalist big tech governmental
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.240]  corporate coup, I mean, we're in it, it ain't coming folks, you're in the new world order
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.680]  now, Adrian in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:26.720]  Hey, this is awesome, I want to thank you for the Real Red Pill Plus coming back in,
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.080]  because for two years, my mom has not stopped talking about when is it going to get it back
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.040]  in, is it going to come back in, I even looked at the bottle for the formulation to see if
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.360]  I can match it with the Heron beer to get some other stuff, but there's just too much
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.840]  going on in there.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.080]  Well, describe for us what it did for your mother, because it really helps old folks.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.320]  Well, my mom has a lot of health problems, she's been on disability for years, since
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:00.920]  I was probably about 12, I'm 40 now, and between that, the turmeric, the X2, she feels amazing,
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.960]  the only thing that she would want me to ask is, when's the down and out coming back?
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.680]  Well, that's our problem, we haven't had enough money to order all the products we used to
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.440]  have, and that's why we're going to catch 22, that's why I may need to just do our fundraiser
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:18.880]  to try to get like $400,000, $500,000 to then buy product, and then we can sell it and make
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.040]  a profit, and it's kind of a self-fulfilling deal, that's how that works.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.480]  It's kind of like a farmer will have that last crop, they don't have enough money to
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.200]  buy more seed, the next year they got to shut down, and so we're kind of at that nexus point
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.320]  of really needing more support, we're going to catch 22 of selling things at discounts
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.840]  so not enough money comes in, but I've got some fundraising ideas in the new year that
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.800]  should help keep us on air, if everybody just buys the products we've gotten down, real
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:50.600]  red pill plus is back, we'll be able to stay on air, but it's very close.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  So a challenge and a proposal I have for listeners is, I didn't buy products for years, but I
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.480]  love the information, and I woke people up, and it was very popular because people very
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.840]  surprised that there was something else actually happening outside of the mainstream media,
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.720]  and then I started to buy the products, and started to feel amazing, and then get other
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.040]  people to buy the product, so if you're a listener who doesn't buy products, you're
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:21.280]  taking something special away from this broadcast, buy one product a month, give it to a friend,
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:27.080]  use it yourself, give it to a loved one, and I think that way, because we are in a war,
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:33.280]  it's a fifth generation information war, asymmetrical, everything Dr. Malone said,
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.400]  everything you said, that's absolutely true.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:42.840]  So in order to keep you alive, and through this process, with all the information we're
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.600]  going to need, especially into the future, because it's just beginning now, what we're
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.600]  going to hit.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:55.480]  I would say buy one product a month, and use it, give it to somebody, but keep it open
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.480]  and keep it going.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.200]  Now, before I take up too much time, Daniel asked, you guys did a lot of great work together
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:08.280]  in the past, he has a great book called 2045 Global Projects at War, and in the melee
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.120]  of where we are right now, globally, he does a great job breaking down that there are multiple
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:19.200]  projects at war that are fighting for supremacy around the planet.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.160]  I think that'd be an excellent interview, plus he does the trans evolution book on the trans
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.160]  humanism.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.160]  That's right, I haven't had that going on in probably six, seven years, let's get Daniel
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  Eslan on.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.480]  I haven't read his new book, but you're right, there are, I'm going to explain it.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.080]  Globalists all want AI, they all want robots, they all want GMO, they all want chip centers,
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.440]  but there are different globalist power blocks at interface who are competing with each other
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.240]  over who will finally get the total global system of the AI, and that's in the documents
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:53.520]  about will the US have the new digital currency or will it be the Chinese?
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:58.040]  And you're right, there's all these competing forces that are working for control of Satan's
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  kingdom.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.400]  So I haven't read the book, what's it, what's it break down?
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.960]  Well, it breaks down exactly what you're saying, and you know, as we see this language
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:11.720]  coming up, these buzzwords, multipolar world order, and you know, it seems like this group's
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.400]  clicking up with this group and they're against that group.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.880]  As all the global currencies are collapsing, I mean, we're watching the entire crypto market
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.680]  collapse, which is bringing down the bond market, which is going to introduce us into
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:28.080]  the new panic problem reaction solution, which says, oh, well, here's the digital money.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.160]  And then we're in any trap.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.040]  So just the book, the book will be great for you guys to talk about.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.040]  It ties in with everything.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.120]  Well, he's really smart and he's really connected and I agree they're competing globalist forces.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.600]  Thank you so much for the call, Adrian.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.760]  All right, I only got to a little bit of calls that segment, but I'm going to do good.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:49.240]  I'm going to take calls the whole next hour as well.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.240]  But let's do this.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.240]  I'm going to do this.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.320]  No matter how good the calls are, I'm going to cut you off in two minutes.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  So we're going to go to Justin.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.320]  We're going to go to Josh.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.320]  We're going to go to Stan.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.320]  We're going to go to Henry.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  We're going to go to Ed.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.320]  Next segment.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.880]  We're going to get five calls in.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:09.880]  It's a 10 and a half minute segment, so we're going to get to your calls coming up right
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:10.880]  out of the gates.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  I'm going right to you.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.840]  And then Russell, Jordan, Carlos, Jefferson, and many, many others that are joining us.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:23.640]  But absolutely, folks, look, you don't know how much the new owner hates the show.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.640]  They hate you.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  They hate our guests.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640]  They hate me.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.480]  They hate the idea that we're still here to spot all the attacks.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.640]  We are everything they can't stand.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.120]  So when you share the articles or share the videos or share the live link and say, this
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.160]  is forbidden, check it out until others are checking it out, until them are checking it
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.920]  out, and tell them to check it out, and them to check it out, when you do that, it's over.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.400]  But if we don't, we can just roll over and die, or I guess you can go join the New World
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.400]  Order if you want.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.240]  I mean, that's your options.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.880]  But joining the New World Order is a fate worse than death.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.880]  We'll be right back with your calls straight ahead.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:59.720]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.760]  InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.080]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:12.440]  way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air, and I almost forgot,
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.640]  you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.560]  same products in stores around the country.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.600]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.120]  some of the top names.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.120]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner is a listener, and we're
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.560]  able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.040]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.040]  sell it.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.880]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram, you're not going to find
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.840]  tumor at 95% or humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:45.560]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:50.840]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:51.840]  these.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:59.440]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com, a true 360 win.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:05.320]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:10.680]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.760]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:14.120]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.560]  Their ability to speak freely.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.760]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.200]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on their 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.680]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.680]  your support.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.800]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.280]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global agenda.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.240]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240]  of your past support.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.440]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.840]  three double your efforts of visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.840]  on air.

[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:59.560]  The destination is infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.120]  It's a post COVID world now.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.880]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.120]  There's a solution.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120]  The Wellness Company.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.400]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:36.680]  can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.800]  post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.400]  to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:54.160]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the Wellness Company for a low monthly fee.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:59.640]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.440]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing infowars, attacking myself and
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.480]  the crew and our other hosts?
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.320]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.040]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.600]  They know we've got their number.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:17.360]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.960]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:25.200]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.240]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:39.920]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.880]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.880]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:55.280]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:00.240]  Get the Red Pill Plus exclusively infowarstore.com.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:06.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.480]  All these other globalists are going against God.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.440]  They're only here to make us stronger and test us.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.320]  God that made the universe is infinite.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:46.520]  His creation is infinite and our communion with God's spirit is eternal.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:53.680]  All right, I'm not been trying to weigh your appetite.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.920]  I'm going to play this Dr. Michael Yeadon incredible clip.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.720]  I just keep taking your calls, but next hour I will get to it early.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.560]  Right now, as I promised, let's take five phone calls in the next 10 minutes.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.680]  Justin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.720]  Hey, Alex Jones, man, I love you, brother.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.040]  I'm going to first time caller and I'm going to try to find out what it's like to ride
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.200]  the tip of the spear, man.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  This is awesome.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.520]  Listen, as I've been waking up over the last 68 years, I've been trying to figure out ways
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.200]  I can reach my friends, neighbors, coworkers, my own family members.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:31.160]  And as I first started off trying to explain globalism and these globalist organizations
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:37.480]  that are moving us towards this one world government, if you will, I found like that's
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.880]  trying to connect the bottom of the pyramid with the top of the pyramid and you lose people
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  there.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:49.720]  And what Elon's been doing over the last two or three weeks, exposing our own governments
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720]  corrupt.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.560]  To say what Elon's been doing is no way it doesn't hurt the new world order.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.560]  And that's so paradoxical.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.960]  I disagree with a lot of what he does.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.520]  I don't completely trust him.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.800]  He's keeping me banned.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.240]  But I would be a liar if I didn't say he's the new Alex Jones.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.320]  He's doing more in a month than I've done the last five years.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.000]  He is wrecking their system.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.880]  Hey, brother, I don't trust him.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:14.240]  No father that I can throw him, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.640]  And we need to actually, I know he probably has his own agenda at the end of all this,
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.160]  which is probably his own version of control.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.800]  But we need, you know, if we stay vigilant, we, you know, and that's what the founders
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  said.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.680]  Separation of powers is you use one would be dictator against the other dictator.
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.680]  Absolutely.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:38.080]  But and what I found is as the Elon's doing this, I'm trying to wake people up around
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.520]  me is that, you know, most people, if you try to talk to them that are a political,
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.320]  they'll say, Hey, listen, they're, they're all corrupt and, you know, both parties.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.880]  And absolutely that's right.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.680]  And, but there's no doubt the Democrats are the leading edge.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:56.720]  I mean, they are the better 100%, but you have your key Republicans in higher, in the
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.720]  higher levels of our government that are, that are just as bad as not worse.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:05.120]  Like you mentioned the open borders, you know, Lindsey Graham, all these globalists, they're
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.520]  just as much open borders as a Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.200]  But the point I was trying to make is that when we, you know, try to wake up our neighbors
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.040]  and friends to connect, you know, the middle of the premier pyramid to the top.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.080]  And that's our, our, our deep state, our globalist government.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.320]  And the reason why most people on both sides of the aisle are frustrated with government
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:28.640]  as a whole is because they don't realize that these people, there's a permanent bureaucracy
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.760]  in both parties, frustrating the will of the American people at every level.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.720]  The beachhead of populism is the Republican party.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.120]  That's why it's threatening the new world order.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.120]  Great points.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  Thank you.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.120]  Josh in FEMA region three.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120]  Go ahead.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.120]  You're on the air.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:50.240]  I just wanted to touch, I called in before I plugged X2 about how it had me dreaming
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.520]  again after not dreaming for 15 years.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.480]  Well, I just wanted to give an update to that real quick.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.760]  My son had really high lead levels and I did a little investigating and it turns out iodine
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.520]  works really well for that.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:07.920]  So I've been giving it to him for about a month and a half now, just one drop and it's
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.560]  cut his lead levels down in half.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.800]  He was a 10, he's now a 5.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:13.800]  Well, that's right.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.800]  Your body can't offload toxins without iodine.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.760]  I wish we weren't sold out of it.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.760]  Yeah.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:24.240]  And so it's just, you know, it's been a real, like I'm just real thankful for that because
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.240]  you know, it's kind of...
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.840]  Well, you understand most iodines are not atomic and are garbage.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.040]  That's why it's got to be atomic.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.040]  Right.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.040]  Yeah.
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:36.200]  I love the X2, the X3, you know, I can't wait for you guys to get it back up.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.600]  I'm signed up for an alert for when it comes back.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.680]  But yeah, that was just on that.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:50.320]  On the border and funding Zelensky and all these criminals, we just have to stop providing
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.000]  them the funds.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.880]  It really comes down to that, that's simple because who's paying for all this?
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.240]  They're not paying for it.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240]  We are.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.680]  The people, you know, and it's hard to see it.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:03.840]  You think about the homelessness and how they're taking people's houses.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.960]  I know people, the IRS is taking their house after one missed IRS payment.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.720]  I know people, Wells Fargo just got caught doing it, who missed one mortgage payment
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.400]  they're taking their house, the outside of law.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:17.680]  The American people are being raped of every race, color, and creed.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:20.320]  And then they're telling us, oh, we've got to take care of this third world population
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.400]  where they shut them down for two years and made them come here.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:27.320]  So they're not my enemies, but they're still being used as a weapon.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.320]  Correct.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.320]  Correct.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.320]  Yeah, it's just, we just have to stop funding it no matter what it takes.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.320]  You know what I mean?
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:38.760]  Anybody that can get to rural area and work on a farm or start your own farm or learn
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.000]  to barter, the whole future is going to be that.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.120]  That's so clear.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:45.800]  The entire future is going to be getting out of the mega cities and this whole mark of
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.800]  the beast.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.800]  We're just getting ready right now.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.000]  Get as many people warned as possible.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  We're going to go through hell, but God's on the other side.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Absolutely God bless.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  Alex.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Love you, brother.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Absolutely.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Let's talk to Stan in Utah.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  Stan, you're on the air.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  Go ahead.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.760]  Yeah, thanks for that last statement.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.760]  I did do that.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.320]  Me and my family were moved to a rural community and Utah love it.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.320]  We're doing a hobby farm.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.920]  They have raised chickens and all that good stuff.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.560]  A reason I'm calling is the memory of my father.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.760]  I have a relative who passed away because they were euthanized in a hospital in New
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.760]  Zealand.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]  Give me their back.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]  I'll give you a phone just a little bit.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760]  Oh, sorry.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:31.840]  Euthanized in a hospital in New Zealand and we have the 18 page medical report that
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:38.040]  proves the timing and the medicines used that caused the death of my father.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  Let me guess.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:40.040]  Randesivir?
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.040]  Nope.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:48.000]  When he went in, we said, no remdesivir, no intubation.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.640]  That may have been like a red flag for the hospital.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:58.440]  Anyway, we started with that requirement, but as he was in hospital within a 24-hour
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:03.840]  period, he was already talking, coherent, was able to breathe without oxygen 11 days
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.360]  later he did.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:14.480]  What reason I'm calling is to ask the medical professionals around the world, have a conscience.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.760]  Please listen to your conscience.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:21.160]  If you're questioning what medical authorities are telling you what to do and how to administer
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:26.560]  certain protocols that are just aberrations of the medical system, please stand up and
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.640]  say something like, these good doctors, Dr. Peter McCullough and...
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.640]  No, you're right.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.080]  So, Stan, did you move from New Zealand or Australia to Utah?
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.080]  New Zealand.
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.080]  I'm an American patriot.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  Oh, we love you.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.320]  I can just hear your accent.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  Wow.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  What is it like for you to see?
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.280]  I'm so sad about your dad.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  You're totally right.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.280]  Everybody needs to learn medical protocols.
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.280]  Everybody's got to learn.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:50.840]  It's easy with any illness to know what works and what doesn't when you go to these hospitals
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:54.120]  because they're ordered to carry out protocols that kill people and a lot of hospitals are
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.840]  good, some are bad, but the point is you've got to know your rights.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.480]  But what is it like for you to see what New Zealand's turned into since you left it?
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.680]  Well, at the age of 12, I watched a movie that was made by the New Zealand government
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:07.480]  called Sleeping Dogs.
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:13.240]  It stars Sam Neal before he became famous, and it's about how New Zealand becomes a police
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.240]  state.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.680]  So, we're talking about it in our social studies class, like, well, this can never happen in
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.680]  New Zealand.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:25.160]  And lo and behold, almost 50 years later, it's here.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.920]  That's what's stunning about this.
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.400]  You know, the secret combination of the conspiracies is 100% real.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.960]  I started, I woke up by studying the United States Constitution.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.120]  I had the great love for that document and what the Founding Fathers did.
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:45.680]  So, I've learned that this is a spiritual battle, most of all, if I have faith in the
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.680]  Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.680]  You're right, Stan.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.680]  It is 100% spiritual.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:49.680]  It's all a task.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.680]  That's what she takes the call.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.080]  One more call if we're going to break.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.080]  Henry in Arizona.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.080]  Oh, no, sorry.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.080]  Russell's next.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.080]  I'm jumping around here.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:58.080]  I apologize.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.080]  Russell in Oregon.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.080]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.080]  Aloha, Uncle Alex.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.080]  God bless you, sir.
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:09.120]  I just wanted to bring up briefly that yesterday it was announced that Elon Musk has committed
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:16.800]  10,000 more Starlink antenna to Ukraine in addition to the 22,000 that are currently
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:22.640]  operational, which is the foundation for government, civilian, and military communications
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.640]  for Ukraine.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:29.640]  So, to me, this is the leverage for him to be able to call for peace negotiations and
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.320]  instead he is giving them more infrastructure.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  Well, that's what he does.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.320]  He plays both sides.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.160]  It's like, he does all this great stuff on one hand and bad things on the other.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.600]  Well, you know, and I just thought that it was worth mentioning to you and to the callers
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.880]  because that's, you know, 50% increase in the infrastructure that they already have
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.800]  and the operation is DARPA and NASA funded and we're paying for this and he's making
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:03.040]  money off of it and this is the opportunity to be able to say, hey, we demand, you know,
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.720]  a pathway to peace negotiations and it's not happening.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:08.160]  No, Henry, let me explain what's happened with Musk.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:12.200]  He's a front guy of the military industrial complex and so it's not that they're anti-neural
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.200]  order.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.920]  They want to control over how leftist and globalist it gets.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:24.040]  So Musk is just a throttle or a control arm for them to control what they do with it because
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.320]  if they don't control the left, it's out of control.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:27.600]  So they control the left and right.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.560]  Do you see how it's an instrumental situation?
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.360]  I absolutely do, Alex.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  Hold on.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  Don't hang up.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  Don't hang up, Russell.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.360]  We'll give you more time.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  You come back.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.360]  You've got to cut short.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  And then Ed in Texas and Henry and Cindy and Bart and Paul, we're going to take your
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.560]  calls you order the received back in T-minus two minutes with our number three.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:56.440]  Have you tried taking the real red pill, a one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.120]  exclusively for Infowars Life?
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:04.600]  The main ingredients in the real red pill plus is pregnanolone, a little-known neuro
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:10.960]  steroid that assists in our body's natural hormone production and low levels are associated
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.280]  with fatigue, low brain function and unhealthy aging.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:22.320]  The real red pill plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:28.240]  and zinc, featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine and theobromine.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:33.120]  The energy blend inside the real red pill plus provides an extra pick me up for your
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.640]  day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:43.360]  So visit InfowarsStore.com, go down the rabbit hole and try taking the real red pill to see
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.320]  what it's really all about.
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:48.720]  That's InfowarsStore.com.

[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:58.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:05.960]  Let's try it.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:10.960]  In the hour number three, ladies and gentlemen, take your phone call.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.840]  Russell and Oregon have some more good points to make about Starlink and Elon Musk.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840]  Please continue Russell.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:25.360]  Well, Alex, I just feel like this is again the point of leverage between negotiating
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:33.720]  for peace and for continuing to expand the war and Starlink actually.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.840]  It's directing the drones, all of it, it's directing the whole robot attack.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.840]  Exactly.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:46.320]  Starlink was conscripted in August of 2022 this year by DARPA with a lot of-
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:52.640]  No, it's a total giant weapon system beyond GPS rolled out under Elon Musk auspices.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.800]  That way, they can't say the Pentagon is attacking Russia.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.320]  Oh, it's just Elon Musk.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.320]  Exactly.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:02.360]  And they're creating a system called BACN and that's going to be a total global network
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.080]  of infrastructure of these low earth orbiting-
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.040]  They're going to drive the cell driving cars, all the AI, it's bad.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:17.000]  And just on a totally unrelated subject, I just want to recommend, if it's possible,
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.600]  could you invite Whitney Webb on to do a long format interview with you.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.240]  She is an amazing voice for truth and-
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:26.240]  Sure.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:27.240]  Who is Whitney Webb?
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.320]  What's her website?
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:35.840]  Unlimitedhangout.com and she is one of the most incredible journalists in the world right
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:36.840]  now.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:41.120]  She's an American in exile in Chile and she has-
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.480]  All right, let's get Whitney Webb on.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.480]  I'll believe you.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.080]  We'll get her on Whitney Webb, Unlimited Hangout.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.840]  I really appreciate the time, Alex, and just hope you have a great Christmas and God bless
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:52.840]  you.
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  Appreciate you, brother.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  All right, let's go to Ed in Texas.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840]  Ed, thank you for holding.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  Good afternoon, sir.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.840]  Pleasure, Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.840]  Welcome.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:06.040]  I just wanted to let you know I'm a cross-country truck driver and I've been noticing a lot
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:09.320]  of unmarked buses at night.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.400]  They're traveling at night.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.840]  I don't see them during the day.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.840]  Oh, they admit that.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.720]  They're processing and transferring the illegals during the night to cover it up.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:17.720]  That's admitted.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:18.720]  That came out from the Biden administration.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.880]  Then they stop at hotels that are totally rented out just for the illegals and then
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.040]  they move to the next site.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.040]  It's incredible, isn't it?
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:31.880]  Yeah, I've been seeing them at truck stops, at Pilot, Flying J. They lock up the bathrooms.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:37.360]  You know, a lot of people are going in and out and the employees at these places are
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.520]  always on edge because they think they're going to steal something.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.240]  I just think it's pretty nutty.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:45.960]  What else would you like to add as a truck driver?
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.960]  I know you see a lot of stuff, brother.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:53.800]  I saw yesterday, I've seen a unmarked white van with random children in it.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:55.800]  They don't look like any of them were.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.880]  I've been seeing a lot of weird stuff, Mr. Jones.
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:59.040]  A lot of weird stuff.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.560]  A lot of people being motorized around the country.
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.560]  I should put it that way.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.560]  Where are the children going?
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.440]  We videotaped the white vans where they just put babies, two-year-olds, six-year-olds,
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.800]  seven-year-olds, boys and girls.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.800]  They just get on them.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.800]  No parents.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:12.800]  Goodbye.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.800]  It's not even government vans.
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.800]  They just disappear.
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.800]  No idea.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  But this is happening.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.800]  Everything you're saying is happening.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.560]  People just need to open their eyes and just pay closer attention.
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.560]  I mean, I see it because I'm always on the road.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.120]  Brother, you should start, obviously not use your name or they'll go after you through
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.120]  your company.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.080]  But you should start a YouTube, a Twitter, a Facebook, or send us clips at ShowtipsandInfoWars.com
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:38.120]  and just shoot video of the stuff you see, brother.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.120]  I will.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.120]  I will.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:41.120]  For sure.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  Well, we love you.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.120]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  Well, Mr. Jones, I love you.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  Thank you.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  Thank you for the crew.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.120]  Thank you for your product.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.120]  I've got your coins.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.120]  I've got your book.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.120]  Keep on fighting.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  Stay strong.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  I love you.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.120]  Happy holidays.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.120]  Well, you say you love me.
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  I love you.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.120]  Let me just be clear.
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120]  You're already married.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:04.080]  You have my word of honor that all the stuff you see in the news is either a total lie or
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.080]  a twisted fact.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:06.100]  We don't have extra money.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.620]  It's all BS.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:12.880]  We're going to stay on air for at least two years of appeals in this show if you simply
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:15.600]  fund InfoWars.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.880]  The good news is we're only about $250,000 a month behind.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:21.220]  That sounds like a lot for an operation this big.
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.860]  Our bandwidth costs more than that.
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:23.860]  We're right there.
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:24.860]  It's just so frustrating.
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:25.860]  I'm like, God.
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:29.860]  I could focus more on the show if I wasn't scrambling to get money all day, I spent half
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:34.340]  my time trying to get funds and I'm not complaining, I just, that's not what I should be doing.
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:38.700]  I want to follow special reports, I want to do interviews, but I just, God's in control
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.140]  and God's working through you, but just please go to InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:11.940]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.940]  front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:18.740]  Well I love taking your calls, if you take us in so many amazing directions we'll go
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:22.340]  back to the calls, here in just a few minutes but first let's hit the COVID stack of the
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:23.340]  day.
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:26.540]  I was usually hit at the start of the show but I get people get COVID fatigue but this
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:30.460]  is one of their main takeover arms, bringing on the casual society, the worldwide vaccine
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:38.780]  passport but here's Dr. Michael Yidon, massive patent holder, head of Pfizer's vaccine program,
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:43.220]  then their head of all their science division, the actual head of the product production.
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:47.460]  You'll like have the head of the NSA as a politician, you'll have the head of technical
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:58.220]  like Dr. William Benny, this was the head until 2018 when he retired.
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:05.220]  So he comes out in 2020 with an emergency letter with the head lawyer of the EU, the
[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:11.900]  head lawyer of their medical system, Wolfgang Wudard and they file an emergency multi-hundred
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:16.380]  page report with all the links saying you need emergency injunction, these shots will
[02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:23.180]  cause heart attacks, myocarditis, infertility, blood clots, they've already done mice studies
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:28.580]  with mRNA shots for coronavirus because mice get that as well and mice again act just the
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:29.580]  same as us.
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:34.900]  Two animals act identical to humans with any poison, any virus, any pathogen.
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:42.340]  They are mice and rats which are the same family and pigs, basically a hundred percent
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:45.460]  identical when it comes to how we respond.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:50.100]  And so they already had the studies just like the CDC document in October 2000 said it'll
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:53.700]  cause heart attacks, blood clots, all that.
[02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:58.460]  He is not a Christian, he's a scientist, he didn't believe in God and I've seen speeches
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:07:59.460]  he's given.
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:04.300]  He says now after watching this, he thinks it's satanic.
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:09.740]  The coordination is like not human, it's next level, anybody that studies this pulls back
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:15.740]  and goes whoa, this is spiritual, this is interdimensional, that's what spiritual means.
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:19.500]  You only see in the light spectrum less than ten percent of the light spectrum, the light
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:25.420]  spectrum depending on what analysis you look at is like one billionth of the data.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:29.700]  Just like you don't see cell phone radiation, you don't see radiation from a block of uranium
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:36.220]  or plutonium, most laser beams you can't even see, most stuff we can't see, alright, that's
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:42.820]  all that is and he's saying this is Satan worship.
[02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:43.820]  What do these shots do?
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:44.820]  Here he is.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:48.940]  The clinical trials were fraudulent, there are court cases ongoing right now.
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:53.940]  The manufacturing was fraudulent, they didn't do the production R&D required, it would take
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:56.940]  at least two years to do that.
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:09:01.100]  That means the regulatory authorizations were fraudulent.
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:07.420]  So FDN, CDC, the European medicine agency, the MHRA in Britain, they've all behaved
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:11.220]  fraudulently, pretty much by closing their eyes and just rubber stamping it.
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:15.020]  So they've not been tested, they're not safe, they don't work, they could never have worked
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:19.900]  in the elderly and yet they are toxic and then I talked at Lin and I went for you with
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:23.540]  it again, that the very design of them could not have been more dangerous.
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:28.980]  They picked the only part of this purported pathogen, the spike protein, to express in
[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:29.980]  your bodies.
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:33.740]  By the way, hit pause, back it up 10 seconds.
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:41.820]  The part of the virus they chose could not have been more deadly and dangerous, of course.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:46.820]  And then they have your body produce that which is the most deadly part, in fact the
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.900]  only part of the virus causing illness.
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:52.460]  Its power is that it's highly communicable.
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:55.660]  Its power is it's news so scientists see it and get scared.
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:10:00.180]  Didn't they give you a vaccine to counter it, that isn't a vaccine, continue.
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:04.660]  I'll be with it again, that the very design of them could not have been more dangerous.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:09.940]  They picked the only part of this purported pathogen, the spike proteins, to express
[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:10.940]  in your bodies.
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:16.260]  Your bodies are turned into a spike protein factory and spike proteins are definitely
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:20.260]  acutely toxic in loads of different ways.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:25.580]  Major immunity, blood clots, neurological problems, impacts on fertility and so on.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:29.780]  So I've told you that they've created the impression of a scare, they've smashed the
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:35.580]  economy and civil society using useless measures, they've got you to wait for a rushed so-called
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:40.860]  vaccine that was not shown to be effective or safe, that never could have worked even
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:46.740]  if the original setup about a viral threat was correct and yet they've jabbed, I don't
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:49.860]  know, 4 billion, 6 billion poor souls.
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:54.500]  Even like 1 in 1,000 people have died, we don't know how many more will die.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:58.060]  But we're into double figures of millions who've definitely been killed as a consequence
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:59.300]  of this policy.
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:04.660]  And that tells you that the people who are doing this are ruthless, I'd say, diabolical.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:13.180]  We be on good and right, we're in the good versus evil, I've not been a religious person
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:17.700]  but I'm absolutely clear on my mind, the only people, the kind of planning and thinking
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:23.340]  it takes to have done what has happened are people who would worship Satan, they're not
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:24.340]  normal people.
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:30.100]  I couldn't do one part of this and continue to be alive after I've done it.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:33.380]  Back it up, 25 seconds.
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:39.620]  The type of planning and work that's gone into this could only be done by the type of
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:42.940]  people that worship Satan.
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:50.300]  Yeah, bingo, it ain't human to run.
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:56.260]  I can tell you I've been around the top globalist, nobody's home, they're not running jack crab,
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.380]  they're avatars.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:04.580]  James Cameron tells you in this movie, oh yeah, you think this is a person walking around?
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:10.300]  It's a meat puppet, folks, they had free will, something came and knocked on the door, I'll
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:18.380]  give you some, sure, and then they get you to commit crimes which moves the Holy Spirit
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:23.100]  because when you commit crimes against children, crimes against innocents, God's transmission
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:28.580]  gets jammed and as soon as that transmission that you're not possessed by but you're influenced
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:38.100]  by is removed, now you're alone and right then they come in and they get your ass.
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:43.940]  David Eich talks about being in a BBC broadcast green room with the former British Prime Minister
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:49.420]  who's later connected to kidnapped dead children of his mainstream news and he's sitting there
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:53.580]  by the makeup room having his makeup taken off and he stands up next to David Eich and
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:54.580]  gets ready to go on the show.
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:58.820]  He's got the makeup rooms, I've been in the main BBC headquarters one that Eich's talking
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:05.820]  about, the same rooms and there's makeup, there's little rooms and the former British
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:09.940]  Prime Minister gets up and they're sitting there in a room that's lit, he looks right
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:22.700]  at him and the eyes go black, like the gate opens and he goes, he scans him head to toe
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:26.740]  and Eich's sitting there, this is what woke Eich up was seeing stuff like this, he's in
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:31.220]  the BBC headquarters folks, that's like the New World Order Command Base where these
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:35.820]  fricking things are at and yes, an alien, he was there with an alien but it was a human
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:39.860]  body, people think about movies like A Flying Saucer Crashes, Little Grey Men, Get Out in
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:46.620]  All the Scrap, no, they take over your body folks but when they opened that gate up, whenever
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:52.540]  they had coming through, opened the dimension up, black space, black eyes, nothing there,
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:14:03.220]  it was an instrument and it was skinning David Eich head to toe and I've experienced that
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:08.060]  around Globals as well and I've talked to other talk show hosts and people, I mean he
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:12.700]  told the story and I didn't even know the production company who it was because I've
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:16.140]  been involved in a made TV shows that was run by the same company, I've never met with
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.500]  a guy but the head of this major, like the number two reality TV show company in the
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:24.660]  world, they've been number one sometimes and they call him in and they say, hey, you're
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:29.900]  going to do a show with one of the guys from Motley Crue, conspiracy show, you've got the
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:37.980]  job but all we need you to do is pledge allegiance to Lucifer and Mark Dice said, well, I mean
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:38.980]  is this a joke?
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:40.980]  He said, no, we really need you to do this.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:41.980]  They said, I'm not going to do it.
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:44.940]  They said, we thought you weren't, you can go.
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:52.180]  Had the deal, had already met with the Motley Crue guy, already done shoots, everything.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:54.980]  At the end of the day, they even pledged allegiance to Lucifer.
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:59.940]  I know another national talk show host, very well known name, who had a show as big as
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:06.860]  Howard Stearns in the mid nineties and they called him into one of those meetings in LA.
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:13.860]  The lights were very low and he goes in with this CEO in the meeting and the guy sitting
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:22.300]  there at the desk and right in front of him turned into like what he would describe as
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:30.140]  a lizard with hair for just 10 seconds and said, now you know who we are, are you going
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.140]  to get down on your knees?
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:33.940]  You're going to work with us and he got up and he left.
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:34.940]  That's Mankow.
[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:38.940]  That happened to Mankow and this is real folks.
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:42.420]  This is a hundred percent real.
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:44.820]  In my experience, one of these global states looked at me and they said, you think you're
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:49.260]  powerful Jones, went like that and their eyes literally glowed green right there five feet
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:50.260]  from them.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:51.260]  They laughed at me.
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.260]  These are aliens folks.
[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:53.260]  Let's get it out of the open.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:54.260]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:16:01.260]  Info Wars MD is finally here.

[02:16:53.260 --> 02:17:19.260]  sales.
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:29.260]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.260]  had.
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:36.940]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:40.860]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:43.700]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:44.700]  God bless you all.
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:50.340]  I salute you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:53.220]  are over the target and this streak is happening.
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:57.900]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:02.860]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against
[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:07.460]  tyranny and when it comes to the products we sell to fund our operation, they're just
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:12.140]  like our news and information, they are powerful and they change the world.
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:16.300]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers but for over two years it's been sold out
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:18.020]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:22.140]  It's finally back at stock for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:26.380]  Now in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it but
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:28.420]  this sucker is amazing.
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:33.780]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is ladies and gentlemen.

[02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:04.420]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Info Wars, attacking myself and
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:06.460]  the crew and our other hosts?
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:10.620]  Because they know we're pro-human, they know we're telling the truth, they know we've
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:16.340]  got their number, they know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:20.940]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:24.220]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:30.220]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[02:19:30.220 --> 02:19:38.940]  like preglerone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:42.900]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.860]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.

[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:18.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:22.340]  Walk out tonight if there's a clear sky and look up at all those stars.
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:23.340]  The moon.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:28.980]  Remember you're on the planet, orbiting around the sun, you think we're all alone?
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:35.380]  Think again, this planet's very special, it's teeming with energy, there's a battle
[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:38.460]  happening here.
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:44.780]  God sends his children here to be tested, a present planet to make the faithful strong
[02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:46.980]  and the weak submit to evil.
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:53.140]  Yes, God gives us free will, but he puts us to the furnace side who will serve him on
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.660]  the next level.
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:21:02.620]  Be a fool and serve Satan, and only transcend Satan by reaching out to God.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:04.340]  God's hand is waiting.
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:07.180]  Henry and Arizona are on the air, welcome, go ahead.
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:12.780]  God bless you, sir, I just to let you know, I used to be a minute man, I used to sit on
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:16.780]  the board waiting for the drugs to come over and we thought we'd pop the bag to, we were
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.980]  doing good, but now we're under, we're being invaded, everybody can look up to the invasion
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:21.980]  of America.
[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:26.020]  I used to be a minute man and the Tea Party people write warning of this, it's all happened
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.020]  now.
[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.020]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:31.620]  First, I just want to say, we all do love you and pray for you, but I want to say a
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:32.620]  prayer because I believe in Jesus.
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:36.220]  In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray for Alex Jones, his family and all the people and the
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:43.020]  truths of America, and bless this message, Lord, and bless Alex Jones and his family
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:46.380]  and that they prosper and be strong, amen.
[02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:50.460]  We think that you should start the Alex Jones School of Journalism, teach this all to be
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:51.460]  like you.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:53.700]  It would be nice to have 10,000 Alex Jones.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:58.020]  Well, it would be good to have a School of Journalism because I'm not that good and I've
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:21:59.620]  been truthful, but I made a lot of mistakes.
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:02.740]  So I could definitely teach people the ins and outs and how stuff really works.
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:06.300]  That would, if I had the energy, the time, the money and the wherewithal, it would be
[02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:07.620]  great to have a School of Journalism.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:08.620]  That's a great idea.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:11.580]  A thousand, we need a thousand Alex Jones, but let's get right to it.
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:18.220]  Brian Terry was a friend of mine and Brian Terry was murdered by Narko Cartel traffickers
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:24.020]  and what's going on right now down here in Arizona is they want Arizona.
[02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:27.260]  They're trying to take Arizona, but we're going to, I want to make a sworn statement
[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:32.180]  that any judge, anybody can have, FBI, you can write a sworn statement and all truth
[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:34.860]  and other the truth of God right here on air.
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:39.820]  The feds got a little junk car out in front of our ranch that they're spying on us, but
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:40.820]  we know they're there.
[02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:42.580]  Here's the deal.
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:48.180]  Adrian Pontes is running for Secretary of State.
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:52.580]  He's actually a Cartel member from Senoa Cartel who's never even born in America.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:56.940]  Well, I don't know about that guy, I don't really know, but I do know in Austin they
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:00.940]  busted the mayor's brother running a safe out with kidnapped people and they were torturing
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:01.940]  for money.
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:06.660]  So yes, many of the so-called leaders you see are actually Cartel leaders.
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.980]  Yeah, well actually he is actually a hundred percent.
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:13.180]  Adrian Pontes, who's running for Secretary of State, there's nothing but a defense attorney
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:15.820]  who helped the guys that killed Brian Terry.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.540]  Well, that's what I found.
[02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:22.340]  It's liberal immigration lawyers and defense lawyers are actually the leaders of the Cartel
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:24.420]  arm in the U.S.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:30.980]  And Hector Sanchez-Barba, he's the head of the World Planned Parenthood and he's running
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:37.380]  Me Family of Votes that also infects Texas and Me Family of Votes injects a lot of votes
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:40.900]  into the election that totally offsets the election.
[02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:47.420]  Now, he also is responsible for a lot of the organ harvesting that's been going on and
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:52.740]  they have testimonies, foreign testimonies already on record where they stuffed dead
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:55.620]  baby bodies with the drugs.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:00.500]  Hector Sanchez-Barba and Me Family of Votes needs to be shut down right now and subtract
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:01.500]  those votes.
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:02.500]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:05.580]  I don't really know those names, those people, but I know that stuff goes on, but I appreciate
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:06.580]  your call.
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:07.580]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:08.580]  Jordan and Florida, you're on the air.
[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:09.580]  Go ahead.
[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:10.580]  Hey, Ari.
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:11.580]  Alex.
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:12.580]  Come on, brother.
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:13.580]  Go ahead.
[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:17.540]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about the FTX scandal a little bit.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:22.300]  I feel like that's really the smoking gun going on with the Democrats with the money laundering.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:25.580]  I feel like that could blow this whole thing wide open and put a lot of the new world order
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:26.580]  behind bars.
[02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:31.940]  Oh, I think Sam Bankman Fried or Freed is going to be Epstein.
[02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.780]  He's even got Epstein's lawyer.
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:40.500]  Yeah, I think he needs to be really, really kept a close eye on, because I seriously feel
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:41.780]  like this is the smoking gun.
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:47.660]  I mean, most of that goes by the media not covering him so much, not covering this whole
[02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:48.660]  thing.
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:53.620]  The lack of media coverage is what really sets a red flag off in my head, you know.
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:54.620]  No, I agree.
[02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:57.380]  They've been really bearing that, haven't they?
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:59.380]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:06.540]  Well, he was supposed to testify by Congress, but he got arrested.
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:07.540]  I didn't hang up on you.
[02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:08.540]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:09.540]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:10.540]  Go ahead.
[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:11.540]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:12.540]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:18.540]  Earlier, you were talking about the tyranny and how the minions were going to go along
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:20.980]  with the tyranny, and they were going to pay for it because they're going to get killed
[02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:21.980]  off.
[02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:26.260]  But we live in a very strange time where they can kill almost everybody they want to.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:29.780]  Brzezinski told us this, it's easier to kill a million people now than it is to convince
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:31.220]  them to go your way.
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:32.220]  That's right.
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:33.380]  He told, in fact, guys, pull that up.
[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:34.780]  It's about 10 years ago.
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:41.500]  So, maybe Brzezinski tells Canadian CFR, or just Brzezinski says it's easier to kill
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:45.580]  a million people than to control a million people, is a quote.
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:46.580]  Correct.
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:48.940]  And that means they're going for broke here.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:53.940]  They will hit us with everything they have to to win this war.
[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:56.260]  There's no chivalry left in this battle.
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:57.820]  They are going to go for broke.
[02:25:57.820 --> 02:26:02.620]  They will hit us with EMP weapons of our own to shut down our system if they want to.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:03.620]  I agree.
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:04.620]  The sky's the limit.
[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:05.620]  They'll blame it on Russia.
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:06.620]  Right.
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:08.020]  So, they think they're going to win.
[02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:10.940]  They're going to get away with it so that the people that are going along with it think
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:11.940]  they'll be the elect.
[02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:15.220]  They'll be the selected people that get to the dodge the bullet.
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:19.940]  And then they'll be able to use these suppressed technologies to rebuild the world the way
[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:26.940]  they want it to be and use the robots and the AI to run things and they'll never think
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:27.940]  twice about us.
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:28.940]  They're going for broke.
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:29.940]  I agree.
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:31.820]  So, what do we do, Jefferson?
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.420]  Well, we have to figure out what their Achilles heel is.
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:36.700]  What is their one weakness?
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.740]  What's the one thing that makes them pause?
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:44.020]  It's the same thing that makes us pause is what about their children?
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:46.540]  What about their progeny?
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:50.620]  How can we make them wonder about whether they're going to be able to continue living?
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:54.700]  A lot of Republicans are saying we should ballot harvest and cheat now and that's how
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:55.700]  to beat them.
[02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:56.700]  But then we just become them.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:27:04.300]  But, yeah, but imagine, I mean, I just, the problem is, if you take out the top 50
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:06.540]  globalists, they've got more scum behind them.
[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:09.540]  I think we have to tell their ideas.
[02:27:09.540 --> 02:27:13.580]  That's why you need them to confess to what they're doing and you can convince them to
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:17.900]  confess in a number of different ways, but, you know, you have to think about it from
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.900]  your terms.
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:22.260]  What's the one thing that would make you stop fighting if they had a hold of your kids?
[02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:23.980]  Nope, it would make me stop.
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:27.700]  Well, they start sending body parts to you.
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.580]  Well, they're dead already, aren't they?
[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:32.980]  We're going to lose them all anyways.
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:40.820]  No, I, so you're saying go out and kidnap globalist children and cut their fingers off
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.780]  and mail it to them in the mail.
[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.740]  I'm saying that's what it's going to boil down to.
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:49.380]  We're going to have to bite the bullet here and figure out that if we're not willing to
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:53.420]  ask for God's forgiveness for having done what we needed to do, if we're worried about
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.300]  our souls, then what we should be worried about is winning.
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:28:01.780]  There's a funny line in the West Wing, Toby Ziegler used to say, they'll love us after
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:02.780]  we win.
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:07.780]  You have to stop worrying about how you win because they don't care how they win.
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:08.780]  They broke the rules first.
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:12.980]  But don't you see how the devil wins by getting them to break the rules and we do?
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:16.140]  Well, we're allowed to ask for forgiveness for anything we do.
[02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:20.740]  All right, listen, I appreciate your call, but I do not want to kidnap globalist children
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:26.060]  and cut their fingers off and mail it to them.
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:32.500]  I'd rather wake up the globalist children and have them join us, but the world they've
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:34.460]  created is where we're going.
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:37.820]  And so they'll hurt enough people or what you're saying is going to happen, but I don't
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.660]  support it.
[02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:42.660]  That's where we're going.
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:48.380]  Yeah, our like Carlos and others stay with us.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:51.100]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:57.940]  These calls are hard core.
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:02.460]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects
[02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:06.300]  and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:11.060]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:15.500]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:17.060]  natural male potential.
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:18.980]  These products work great for women as well.
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:21.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.

[02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:38.420]  night.
[02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:43.660]  Don't do it during the day, 1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.

[02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:15.900]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:38.580]  I don't tell the story to Brad or to their horn but you know how effective we've been
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:43.140]  over the years.
[02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:48.180]  That Bellamy Amuse was already number one rock star at the time 13, 14 years ago and
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:54.220]  I learned he was a listener he was wearing info war shirts on air, on concerts and so
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:57.900]  he came to Austin and we met once and he was on the show a few times and they came after
[02:33:57.900 --> 02:34:01.900]  and said we're going to destroy you if you don't do it so he came out and said well I
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:06.700]  don't believe those views anymore I've grown up but it doesn't matter those songs he put
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:10.700]  out that were number one a whole bunch of them were directly inspired by this broadcast
[02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:15.300]  and by you supporting the broadcast and that's how many things just so many cultural things
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:21.780]  we look at were influenced by info wars and had huge effects and all of you have that
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:29.540]  power as well you just don't know how powerful you are and sometimes the effects we had really
[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:35.500]  weren't even that political that's when I learned the power of persuasion the power
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:39.940]  of what we do even jokes I did and things I covered that I wasn't thinking was having
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:44.460]  an effect had the biggest effects when I met Mike judge were good friends many many years
[02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:52.820]  ago I've known Mike now personally more than a decade and I met with him a few times he
[02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:55.940]  had dinner a few times he said hey come by my house I want to show you something he had
[02:34:55.940 --> 02:35:01.180]  the old VHS tapes of him in the mid 1990s we was first riding king of the hill after
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:07.620]  he was about it and he said did you know that you and two other guys off access TV and people
[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:13.900]  I grew up around in garland outside Dallas are the influence of Hank Hill and Dale Gribble
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:17.380]  and the other guy you see the episodes of the American flag with the gold friends and
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:21.580]  the conspiracies and all that and then that was me and it's all like oh look I influence
[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:27.060]  king of the hill no I didn't influence King Hill I'm one third of the influence in those
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:32.660]  characters that's massive and he gave us an interview and said that remember I told one
[02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:37.620]  of my friends Pat Riley about eight nine years ago when I first met him he was talking about
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:42.420]  how much he loved Mike judge and I said yeah did you know that I'm one of the main influences
[02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:46.020]  of king of the hill he goes okay I've known you I know you're a talk show I think you're
[02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:49.660]  crazy I said here I just did the interview a month ago with him he watched the interview
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:53.380]  was totally blown away and I said the next day I said hey I'm going out to Mike judge's
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:57.380]  ranch north of Austin do some shooting that was when they were starting about the start
[02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:02.780]  of a year before they started uh Silicon Valley with this was a whole nice basically cast
[02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:06.420]  Silicon Valley out there he was just like really I said yeah let me just take you to
[02:36:06.420 --> 02:36:12.420]  meet my judge but the point is is that people don't recognize greatness when they see it
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:17.780]  especially when it's so friendly and you know right up front and and and and just just talking
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:21.940]  to folks so so I don't tell those stories to say oh aren't we impressive when I tell
[02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:29.620]  you the mark dies story about them trying to pledge himself to Lucifer before he got
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:34.340]  his contract for a national tv show that happened he told me probably about it two years before
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:42.980]  he went public when I tell you about the story these told on air about um David I it's real
[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:47.060]  I believe him because I've seen something very similar and and it's like I'm at the point
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:51.620]  of like do I tell them this because it sounds so crazy it's the truth I'm just gonna tell
[02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:58.500]  you there's even more folks show once you're connected to god the veil opens and once you're
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:02.820]  connected to satan it opens as well but different veil they have knowledge of evil knowledge
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:07.940]  of satan knowledge of this whole thing going on we open up the veil to god and god opens
[02:37:07.940 --> 02:37:12.980]  the veil to us and we see so much more than even satan to see but let me tell you it's
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:17.460]  going to be wild you really get the holy spirit you're not going to dream once a week you're
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:21.780]  not going to dream during REM sleep when you've been asleep seven hours for the last half hour
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:27.300]  of sleep you're going to dream for eight hours straight like I do I went to bed at 10 o'clock
[02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:34.420]  last night woke up at midnight after just dream after dream after dream lifetimes of dreams incredible
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:40.820]  dreams and we got up got some water took a piss went back to bed three more hours of non-stop
[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:46.260]  dreams went back to sleep woke up at 5 a.m. I said I want to see some more of this baby I
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:52.980]  got went back to sleep till 7 a.m. and I had adventures you couldn't imagine didn't have those
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:59.620]  dreams till I got lined up with God so there's a lot going on while we're asleep scientists now
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:04.740]  confirm what the ancient mystics told us our brain can go into higher dimensions full space
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:10.500]  go different places you name it not just work through problems of the subconscious and when
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:20.580]  you are connected to God man it's incredible and so just what I get in my dream life is worth being
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:26.820]  lined up at a firing squad to shot because I get that third eye being opened and I saw a clip I was
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:30.100]  going to play Sunday when you guys queue it up I'll go back to calls if you can find about the
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:34.420]  third eye it's like two minutes long and it's an individual talking about Pinocchio
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:41.780]  and the archetype of the pineal gland which is 100% true in the allegory of Pinocchio and I saw a
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.180]  lot of the comments on Twitter saying this guy is an occultist don't open your third eye you're
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:51.140]  going to go to hell if you do it no opening your third eye means you become spiritually connected
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:54.660]  yes if you're already into evil it'll become worse for you you're already connected to God
[02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:59.140]  that's what happens and I meant to show it yesterday we got if you could find it the Twitter
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:09.620]  the the Argentinian team won the game you know the big world cup and the capital team
[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:17.060]  put his hands up like this you know all five fingers out like yay we're winning and he
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:26.020]  he held the trophy like this two fingers when there's other fingers out was finger like that
[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:32.580]  and all the fake Pharisee Christians said look it's bat them at he's giving a bat them at symbol
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:37.700]  even when I give you an example of it they'll grab clips of me and say here's Jones giving the
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:42.580]  bat them at symbol but that's not what the head of the Argentinian team was doing he was holding
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:50.500]  a trophy and his fingers out excited holding the trophy so not every not you know a swastika on
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:57.060]  a booze temple is on a nazi swastika or if I go hey everything's okay that's the symbol of okay
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:40:01.460]  doesn't mean just because the Alameda uses that it's the intention that matters it's what you mean
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:07.220]  by it every symbol we've got God gave us and it's been expropriated by the enemy
[02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:15.300]  so the Satanist don't want you to open your third eye unless they've got full control of you and
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:19.860]  they can use that but God the Holy Spirit will open your third eye you guys found it look at that
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:26.500]  over there oh look at the Argentinian captain he's bat them at no he's not he's holding a trophy
[02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:36.340]  and puts his fingers out that's evil to accuse somebody that's done nothing of being a Satanist
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:40.980]  when it turns out that guy's a Christian I looked it up no holding a trophy and putting
[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:45.700]  your two fingers out it's not satanic and I've given many examples where I go when people do the UT
[02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:54.900]  symbol which is the hook of horns that's not satanic that means a cow and when I do that the
[02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:59.060]  people that attack me the fake Christians they go look Jones is doing hell Satan no I'm educating
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:07.300]  people of what the symbol means it's like I love you symbols like that the Bolsonaro did that
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:12.020]  people said oh Bolsonaro's a satanist oh really judge is treated by the fruit I've tacked a real
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:14.500]  satanist that are out of the open here's the clip on Pinocchio
[02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:23.220]  Pinocchio is the third eye when you read the story of Pinocchio Pinocchio has two words pine
[02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:32.340]  pinion on your brain and occhio is ocular occhio in Italian is eye that's why you go to an ocular
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:41.620]  so Pinocchio means the pineal gland Pinocchio is a puppet he's not a real person in order to become
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:47.140]  a real person to ascend you have to activate your pineal gland you have to stop turning eyes
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:52.580]  you have to stop being deceived by your friends you have to stop going to the circuses and the shows
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:42:00.260]  as all the philosophers have ever said getting drunk you intoxicated you drugs and to be sober
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:06.900]  so the pineal gland is the third eye and it's our highest consciousness if you want to be real
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:14.100]  just read the story Pinocchio and activate your Pinocchio and so he's telling you don't use drugs
[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:19.300]  connect to god it's oh my god this is the devil works for third eye no the fluoride attacks it in
[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:23.940]  scientific studies the pineal glands real is directly connected to higher dimensional and
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:28.820]  higher brain waves in the body and eye and eye directly clears that out that's why they take it
[02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:34.580]  out of the food take it out of the salt take strip it because then you're a zombie they know what
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:40.740]  they're doing all right we're gonna go to break come back with Carlos everybody else i promise

[02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:16.500]  thank you alex um i want to talk about ukraine and if possible about um zealinsky
[02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:27.780]  the prussian military philosopher claus witt said clearly that the aim of the commander is to
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:35.460]  destroy the military equipment of the enemy not to seize real estate and with that victim i have
[02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:41.780]  noticed only three analysts that really have understood the russian approach to the military
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:49.700]  operation one was i'm for robert barnes i agree with him 100 because i had been thinking why are
[02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:56.180]  the russians parked just outside kiev doing nothing you know what the idea was was to have
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:50:02.100]  the attention focused on the taking of the capital while from two other sides they were
[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:08.260]  taking the south and they were taking uh part of the dumb bass back then they moved the troops
[02:50:08.260 --> 02:50:13.700]  towards carlos we know that was the plan but the russians are up against nato in the us
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:18.900]  and and are having incredible losses even putin admits this is much harder than i thought well
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:24.580]  of course because the russians never expected to be fighting a proxy war with nato they didn't
[02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:29.860]  never wanted to declare war against russia uh against ukraine he was basically a military
[02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:35.460]  operation and and another thing people don't understand is that putin is not an absolute
[02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:41.700]  them uh dictator he has limits upon what she can use he was given permission to engage in a
[02:50:41.700 --> 02:50:47.780]  conventional military operation but not to declare war on ukraine that was something totally out of
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:53.380]  the order and there have been no reason for it the only thing that's left for russia to do is just
[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:59.620]  to keep cool to keep doing what they're doing destroying the military equipment to set a perimeter
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:04.660]  of security sure why do you think they blew up another russian pipeline yesterday why is nato
[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:09.060]  cutting the gas off to europe i guess just so they have no other choice but to fight russia
[02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:14.900]  because russia then can't use the leverage the pipelines over them no because israel is coming
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:20.740]  in from the south with l and g and and and it was uh the plan for no you're right and they just
[02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:27.140]  turned on the day that the pipeline was blown up uh that new northern europe pipeline exactly so
[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:32.420]  that's the whole point right and and and so what you're going to be seeing from now on is and people
[02:51:32.420 --> 02:51:37.300]  should understand when they see salinsky talking to the to the government of united states is that
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:42.740]  he's using the money from the united states and the heimar's equipment to kill civilians because
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:47.940]  they're using it to shoot people in areas in the donbass that have no military no no no
[02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:52.900]  salinsky is a dictator is committing war crimes he's banned the major uh oldest church in the
[02:51:52.900 --> 02:51:58.500]  country it's outrageous and the man is a dictator he banned all political parties with his including
[02:51:58.500 --> 02:52:03.140]  leftist the support of him i mean that is a dictator we are now supporting a dictator in
[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:07.540]  this war it is shameful thank you carlos let's talk to paul in texas you're on the air
[02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:12.420]  yeah i like someone to start off by saying i appreciate what you're doing for freedom of

[02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:32.580]  because i knew this was coming but now sir i don't have a choice about the fight with everything i
[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:38.260]  got that they are literally trying to destroy me and my family and my crew right now so thank you
[02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:42.660]  understand now i'm fully committed to the fight and i can only win this with your help so please
[02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:48.020]  help me i'm just telling you i'm i'm i'm a very desperate person uh just like we all are once
[02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:52.660]  you realize where we're at but thank you sir well i i really appreciate what you're doing and we're
[02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:57.860]  definitely supporting you um i have friends who are democrats friends who are republicans and
[02:52:57.860 --> 02:53:02.500]  friends are independent and the one thing that all of my friends have in common is we're americans
[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:07.060]  oh i should say two things we're americans and we believe in freedom of speech
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:14.180]  and the word that falls into that line is liberal there are republicans who are liberal there are
[02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:19.300]  there are independents who are liberal and there are democrats that are liberal the far left are
[02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:26.020]  not liberal they don't believe in an exchange of ideas they are authoritarian really communist
[02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:32.260]  fascists exactly they are suppressionist and i think i hate i don't want to get on your case
[02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:36.900]  about this but i wish in the future you'd quit calling them liberals call them suppression
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:41.620]  no you're absolutely right liberal is too thomas jefferson was a liberal for more freedom more food
[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:46.980]  more money more guns more personal autonomy a classical liberal is a conservative today
[02:53:48.020 --> 02:53:52.260]  trying to conserve our our classical liberal values you're right i just use the terms the public
[02:53:52.260 --> 02:53:59.540]  knows these are authoritarian french revolution uh neo communist just tyrants they are suppressionist
[02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:04.820]  they are control freaks they are a power cult they have they have very little very George are well
[02:54:04.820 --> 02:54:10.740]  before he died who'd worked at the hot top of os s and mi6 their head propagandists number two in
[02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:15.700]  the whole agency said there is no left and right there's only a power cult that wants to rule the
[02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:23.700]  people exactly i i believe the first thing we should do in our fight is grip them of their mask
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:30.580]  stop calling them liberals take away that fall listen i promise you paul anytime the crew catches
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:36.100]  me anytime i call them liberals the crew needs to get in my ear they don't do this but i wanted
[02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:41.780]  to do you're right they are not liberals liberal means more freedom not lockdowns and four shots
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:47.540]  liberal means more money not less not oh you'll own nothing and have nothing and like it exactly
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:55.460]  claus swabs not a liberal he is a evil control freak that wants to suppress us exactly exactly
[02:54:55.460 --> 02:55:02.980]  and Pelosi and chip and the others they're just suppressionist you're right they want to suppress
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:08.980]  our freedom they want to suppress our freedom you know people have the term uh you know be tolerant
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:16.100]  or or i am tolerant they're not tolerant of us and and they're trying to change our vocabulary
[02:55:16.100 --> 02:55:19.780]  words no longer mean any well the new thing officially is don't say the word american
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:26.100]  yes don't say the word american liberal does not mean in fact i'm putting a t-shirt out

[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:44.660]  way to go let me tell you i appreciate your call i went to a event uh in when was it it was uh
[02:55:44.660 --> 02:55:50.900]  about three years ago and it was called donald trump alex jones and fake news and they shut down
[02:55:50.900 --> 02:55:55.860]  downtown part of congress street and they had my name up there and everything and i show up at a
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:56:00.580]  free event with thousands of people who try to throw me out we have video of it and
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:08.100]  i go ahead and get up there where they can hear me on the mic and i say we're all americans let's
[02:56:08.100 --> 02:56:13.780]  come together let's stop and they went when i said american it was like high noon to vampires or
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:21.860]  you know eternalites on the cockroaches run they went ah they hate us having a country
[02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:24.500]  they hate what the country stands for they're trying to use serpent
[02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:29.220]  that's why i love it the great movie uh by uh
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:34.980]  whatever his name is that made to escape from new york and so many other great movies like the
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:39.940]  thing john carpenter who was a classical liberal and he's still alive i guess but john carpenter
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:44.820]  they got snake plisken about to send him into new york and they go snake plisken american
[02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:50.020]  lieutenant special forces but the whole point is is they go american and it's the way lee van
[02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:56.100]  cleef says snake plisken american and at the end of the day that's what we are and that's what we
[02:56:56.100 --> 02:57:02.660]  stand for and what that term american stands for classical liberalism freedom and justice
[02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:07.460]  standing up for the little people and you want to say one thing about american or about alex jones
[02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:12.820]  it's american i want to be known as american i loved it when trump would call me the texan
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:17.300]  and roger said yeah he calls you the texan and they talk about all the time in the white house
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:21.540]  blah blah and trump would call me he goes how's that texan doing because out of the whole pantheon
[02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:26.500]  of america i kind of see texas as special this is some of its story passed but yeah it's just

[03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:04.420]  that are syndicating our feeds in fact i meant to mobilize you guys and we should plug these
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:09.940]  and create a list so they'll use that to blacklist it of all the people re-streaming our feeds so you
[03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:15.220]  can share those on twitter facebook youtube uh on your instagram on your email and not get censored
[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:19.140]  because the censoring email too folks especially google tell people how they find the feed of the

[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:49.060]  how delusional and ignorant the third world has been dumbed down i'll give you an example i was
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:53.620]  unfortunate i married one of these women from the third world and we had a child and i told her
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:59.460]  you need to put our baby in a car seat and she said why and we couldn't even find one in the
[03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:05.620]  philippines they don't even sell they don't even protect their children well the thing is nothing
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:09.540]  against the third world it's just that they have no history of freedom that's why the globalists
[03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:15.300]  have done the sociological actuaries and want to bring them here yes they've been dumbed down
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:23.700]  well let's explain it let's explain it argentina and brazil 50 years ago were as good as america
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:29.860]  so was venezuela mexico is still the most civilized richest country in latin america
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:34.020]  it's way below the us and that they're a fell society we're about to be as well not putting
[03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:38.420]  them down but exactly you bring people in though from the worst latin america countries it is like
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:44.340]  my dad's didn't work down there free medical work and stuff in in places you know in south america
[03:02:44.340 --> 03:02:47.620]  and it is just it's scary as hell and people don't know what we're importing
[03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:55.860]  yeah where is this governor abad he's doing nothing but talk well at least he's finally
[03:02:55.860 --> 03:03:01.380]  talking about criminal charges you can't have a un ngo that ran the collapse of europe for 10 years
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:07.460]  there's i've been there i've shown video they command the border patrol sjw's tell the border
[03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:12.820]  patrol what to do brother yeah we need to talk about succeeding from the union now there's maybe
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:16.740]  another other choice here well i agree with that but not just to see to get rid of the union we
[03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:22.260]  could have a state compact pullout and say the government's occupied and peacefully then reconstitute
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:26.420]  the republic by the states that's how it happened the beginning uh with the colonies that's how it
[03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:33.060]  should happen yeah one last thing i want to say arrest dr falchion and and bill gates and the west

[03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:52.500]  the sweater if we keep pulling on it it's the easiest track to follow the money back to
[03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:59.460]  you know the the flows out of our country into the ukraine the laundering and then back to the
[03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:03.540]  the democratic establishment yeah they're not even hiding it congress want to do an investigation
[03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:08.100]  or the money's going there's no monitoring of a hundred and fifty billion and now zalinsky wants

[03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:35.140]  battle call that right let me tell you let me tell you how i turned my whole neighborhood onto you
[03:13:35.140 --> 03:13:41.380]  i just moved to arizona from scumbag seattle about a year ago and the first time i went out
[03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:47.220]  in my backyard when it was hot and i have a swimming pool i put my little blue juice out there
[03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:52.980]  and i had your show on and i had it on loud because i wanted to hear it and i thought man am i being
[03:13:52.980 --> 03:14:01.700]  rude to my neighbors and i thought hell no i'm going to red pill my neighbors right now i i kept
[03:14:01.700 --> 03:14:08.580]  that blue tooth on as loud as i could get it and you know what the very next day one of my neighbors
[03:14:08.580 --> 03:14:15.620]  came over and said hey you listen to what i listen to so we became bugs i kept it up and i had three
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:22.660]  people come to my front door and within two weeks and say hey i i can't quite catch it all but
[03:14:22.660 --> 03:14:27.060]  every now and then i catch something you're listening to ready what are you listening to
[03:14:27.060 --> 03:14:34.820]  and i totally banned videoed them and it's a great thing i will continue to do the work and the key
[03:14:34.820 --> 03:14:38.980]  is tell them now to blare it and then their neighbors will blare it and their neighbors will
[03:14:38.980 --> 03:14:45.620]  blare it goes and that is the that is the chain reaction exactly i'm hoping by the end of this
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:51.300]  summer we're having neighborhood meetings i love it we'll just tell your neighbors to start blaring
[03:14:51.300 --> 03:14:56.340]  it's the next neighbor gets it and of course you get that chain reaction yeah they won't be able to

[03:20:56.580 --> 03:21:01.700]  twitter has always been funded by the government owned by the government it's a fact so same with
[03:21:01.700 --> 03:21:07.860]  facebook and all of them okay and so i i know that the left is trying to destroy this country
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:13.540]  i know that the rhinos in this country are sort of going along with it right and not really stopping
[03:21:13.540 --> 03:21:18.900]  anything in fact sometimes actively destroying the country too just really depends on the issue
[03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:25.620]  but here's the deal i kind of jokingly refer to the republican party as uh as a bra i know i said it
[03:21:25.620 --> 03:21:32.100]  as a bra okay because uh they don't ever change anything too drastically if you know what i mean
[03:21:32.100 --> 03:21:38.260]  but they always hold the boobs in place okay and so these boobs are in uh in congress and the senate
[03:21:38.260 --> 03:21:44.500]  and they always will be and uh fraud will deliver them there and that's a problem for us the republicans
[03:21:44.500 --> 03:21:49.940]  and all of the dem some republican some rhinos did do they did nothing when it came to election fraud
[03:21:49.940 --> 03:21:57.220]  they did nothing okay in fact they kind of actively squashed it this case is about those individuals
[03:21:57.220 --> 03:22:02.820]  who said no to an investigation just said no to a simple investigation and if you have a crime
[03:22:02.820 --> 03:22:07.460]  you're going to investigate that crime right to find out if there was a crime they actually said no
[03:22:08.020 --> 03:22:12.100]  this case with loy brunson is really fascinating because the date is
[03:22:12.100 --> 03:22:17.220]  suddenly approaching and i want to talk about some of the miracles i'm usually very pessimistic
[03:22:17.220 --> 03:22:22.420]  kind of cynical really cynical about the goings on or the things that could help us this wouldn't
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:28.020]  save us but it would certainly change things for us if we were willing to learn a lot and take those
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:33.780]  things and do something with them okay and so let's bring on loy brunson he and his brothers are i
[03:22:33.780 --> 03:22:40.260]  think you'll remember the trumpeteers right the trumpeters from the brunson brothers who actually
[03:22:40.260 --> 03:22:45.780]  provided entertainment nationally on a lot of national stages i'm so happy to have a loy with
[03:22:45.780 --> 03:22:50.500]  me because he has a fascinating case you're going to want to pay attention to this one like i said
[03:22:50.500 --> 03:22:56.180]  the date is quietly approaching but he's suing he and his brothers are suing 388 members of the senate
[03:22:56.180 --> 03:23:00.100]  the congress and of course king fraud a lot and hormola you know i can't call her anything else
[03:23:00.980 --> 03:23:06.260]  and this case even though you might go oh i don't know if that would actually happen
[03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:10.900]  just wait till you hear the details of this case that's what got me really intrigued about this
[03:23:10.900 --> 03:23:18.100]  welcome loy how are you i'm doing great thanks thanks for having me on incredible so you're suing
[03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:25.220]  388 members including uh the fraudulent presidency and you're suing them for violating their oath
[03:23:25.220 --> 03:23:30.260]  talk about this case yeah well people need to understand first of all the power of this case
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:35.140]  is what you said this is probably the first the probably the most powerful case in front of the
[03:23:35.140 --> 03:23:40.580]  supreme court ever uh we filed under rule 11 of the supreme court which characterized the court
[03:23:40.580 --> 03:23:44.580]  characterized it as an emergency case or they wouldn't have let it move forward without the
[03:23:44.580 --> 03:23:50.580]  tensor for the pill's decision but uh so the power that they have with this case is like you said
[03:23:50.580 --> 03:23:55.620]  they literally have the power to completely adjudicate the whole complaint most cases in front
[03:23:55.620 --> 03:24:00.500]  of the supreme court are upholding a decision or reversing a decision this is completely different
[03:24:00.500 --> 03:24:05.140]  this actually gives the supreme court the power to remove as you said to remove from
[03:24:05.140 --> 03:24:12.340]  office 385 current members of the us house and us senate a sitting president and vice president
[03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:17.620]  and hold them um actually bar them from holding public office the rest of their lives including
[03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:24.420]  mike pence uh who is not holding us right now so so that's the power of the case now they're
[03:24:24.420 --> 03:24:30.820]  there go ahead go ahead go ahead there's some there's some unique things that have happened
[03:24:30.820 --> 03:24:35.460]  to this case first of all a rule 11 petition has never been docketed successfully which ours has
[03:24:35.460 --> 03:24:41.060]  been docketed with the supreme court since uh probably the 70s and it was the the government
[03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:46.100]  u.s. government brought a case against uh someone having to do with the nixon administration so
[03:24:46.100 --> 03:24:50.340]  someone checked that an attorney checked the docket he thinks he's might have seen one other so first
[03:24:50.340 --> 03:24:57.460]  of all having a docketed case under rule 11ism is unheard of and that's what they accepted but
[03:24:57.460 --> 03:25:01.620]  that's the 10th circuit court of appeals i think found out about this and they heard and made a
[03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:05.860]  decision i can kind of tell you the story i'm kind of getting ahead of the story if you want uh should
[03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:12.980]  i kind of start from the beginning explain how how you took on this case and you said and i think
[03:25:12.980 --> 03:25:18.100]  the thing that intrigued me so much about this was that the supreme court reached out to him
[03:25:18.100 --> 03:25:24.900]  several times to help him bypass the lower courts to be able to get one of the two cases that were
[03:25:24.900 --> 03:25:28.820]  filed that was a brilliant move by the way because one was going to make it right at least one of
[03:25:28.820 --> 03:25:33.700]  those cases so brilliant move but the supreme court reached out to you to make sure that this
[03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:39.780]  got on the the docket to be able to get a hearing it is almost impossible to get a case this far
[03:25:40.340 --> 03:25:44.980]  and uh and so that to me was really really shocking about this case and i want people to
[03:25:44.980 --> 03:25:49.540]  really think about that for a moment because that could either go very very good in my eyes
[03:25:49.540 --> 03:25:53.700]  are very very bad right we all think of setups we think of january six setups and all those
[03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:59.140]  kinds of things but they could have just let this die right they wanted to make sure that this got
[03:25:59.140 --> 03:26:04.260]  on their in their purview yeah so we were stuck in the 10th circuit court of appeals with the
[03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:08.340]  second one the first one got stuck in federal court they actually served they ordered the federal
[03:26:08.340 --> 03:26:12.660]  court actually ordered the us marshal service to serve my case or serve my summons complaint
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:17.780]  against Nancy Pelosi and 385 others so after about 85 were served the federal court the next
[03:26:17.780 --> 03:26:24.180]  day called it back they canceled the filing and on the docket it'll show that they classified it as a
[03:26:24.900 --> 03:26:30.660]  a mistake and my complaint was deficient so they can't do that so we took them to the 10th
[03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:35.380]  circuit court of appeals we didn't win there so we took both courts to state court and finally
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:40.020]  after that battling they reinstated my case and they ordered the clerk of the court to
[03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:45.460]  to actually issue the summonses so that's still alive that case is still alive identical to the
[03:26:45.460 --> 03:26:49.620]  one that's in front of the supreme court right now so that one with my brother's name under
[03:26:49.620 --> 03:26:54.340]  walland started in state court went to federal court and then went to the court of appeals
[03:26:54.340 --> 03:26:58.980]  they delayed they wouldn't make a decision so after four months we decided we needed to do
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:05.060]  something we found rule 11 the supreme court and we delivered it to them and in five days we
[03:27:05.060 --> 03:27:08.980]  received a call from the clerk of the court's office now the clerk of the court for the
[03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:14.980]  us supreme court is not a justice clerk this person is scott sessions harris and for 11 years
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:20.420]  he was the attorney for the supreme court so his office a case analyst from his office calls us
[03:27:20.420 --> 03:27:26.100]  and tells us that they've decided to accept our petition without a decision from the 10th circuit
[03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:31.060]  and that we can move forward with a rule 11 petition for the us supreme court and then they
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:35.860]  asked us to insert some special documents in it that were not required they got into the docket
[03:27:35.860 --> 03:27:41.380]  and saw the whole case and they asked us to to actually include some extra documents so we did
[03:27:41.380 --> 03:27:45.540]  we got all that ready unless we were ready to get that off to them someone must have let the
[03:27:45.540 --> 03:27:49.060]  the 10th circuit court know there are three judges there to make a decision because they
[03:27:49.060 --> 03:27:53.860]  were even made a decision i guess they didn't want to go down in history is blocking or sitting on
[03:27:53.860 --> 03:27:58.500]  a national emergency case right so they had to do something and so here we are so we call the court
[03:27:58.500 --> 03:28:02.580]  and we'll hey we're going to get this to you but they've made a decision so should we change the
[03:28:02.580 --> 03:28:07.620]  rule 11 part of it and it's still they said yes go ahead and take that out you don't need that
[03:28:07.620 --> 03:28:12.500]  anymore it'll just get it to us and make sure you put in what we've asked you to put in and how
[03:28:12.500 --> 03:28:17.380]  soon can you get it to us and we said well Roland it was taking the call said well it's going to
[03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:22.580]  take about two weeks and the uh the analyst says we need it sooner than that can you get it to us
[03:28:22.580 --> 03:28:27.300]  sooner than two weeks and he said well we'll do what we can and so he was kind of shocked we were
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:31.060]  all shocked that they were really kind of putting us putting some pressure on to get it and they also
[03:28:31.060 --> 03:28:36.020]  says make sure you put in what we asked you to put in so instead of two weeks we got it to a week
[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:41.140]  a week okay so this case we're going to come right back with loy brunson and this is the
[03:28:41.140 --> 03:28:46.100]  case to keep your eyes on folks the date that they gave is approaching and the date just made

[03:33:12.180 --> 03:33:16.340]  back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host so glad to be with you today this
[03:33:16.340 --> 03:33:22.100]  case is so important my guest loy brunson is with me to talk about this case that is not getting
[03:33:22.100 --> 03:33:27.300]  of course the mainstream media attention at all they don't even want you to know about this case
[03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:33.220]  in fact this this case is not about the outcome of the election this case is about the fact
[03:33:33.220 --> 03:33:39.460]  that 388 members of our senate or congress this includes the administration are being sued for
[03:33:39.460 --> 03:33:46.740]  violating their oath of office in not uh or in voting against an investigation a simple investigation
[03:33:46.740 --> 03:33:52.500]  with a hundred witnesses a hundred witnesses brought forth and they said that was not compelling
[03:33:52.500 --> 03:33:59.460]  enough to have an investigation and so it's a violation of their oath correct loy that is correct
[03:33:59.460 --> 03:34:04.660]  that they created a huge national security breach by doing that uh they're supposed to defend us and
[03:34:04.660 --> 03:34:10.580]  the constitution from enemies domestic and foreign and when you have crimes and evidence of mal stuff
[03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:15.460]  going on that's bad you investigate it it's sort of like you're on a ship and you and your watchman
[03:34:15.460 --> 03:34:20.740]  sees a tip of an iceberg and says oh it's just a little one it's said this is much bigger than that
[03:34:20.740 --> 03:34:25.540]  so uh you want me to continue with the story where we left off it was the the the court it was
[03:34:25.540 --> 03:34:31.380]  supposed to take two weeks and it took how long just a week so we were able to overnight mail it
[03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:37.140]  to them on a thursday they got a friday and uh they documented it on monday and they showed
[03:34:37.140 --> 03:34:42.740]  filed on the docket that it was filed the day we sent it and then uh they also notified the
[03:34:42.740 --> 03:34:48.260]  u.s attorneys that they had until november 23rd which is about 30 days to respond the u.s attorneys
[03:34:48.260 --> 03:34:52.740]  at this point have one opportunity to fight this before it goes into conference where the nine
[03:34:52.740 --> 03:34:58.500]  justices get together and vote they haven't moved forward or not and so uh they it comes november
[03:34:58.500 --> 03:35:03.300]  23rd rolls around and they haven't done anything at all they hadn't filed a waiver and that's another
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:08.020]  document that my brother received in the mill from the from the uh supreme court asking him
[03:35:08.020 --> 03:35:13.620]  to send a waiver waving their right to file an opposition so that they could move forward with
[03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:18.660]  this more quickly but the u.s attorneys did not uh sign the waiver they didn't do anything so the
[03:35:18.660 --> 03:35:23.380]  23rd rolls around nothing's happened but at one o'clock in the afternoon we see the docket
[03:35:23.380 --> 03:35:28.020]  shows that the u.s attorneys are no longer representing the 388 defendants instead the
[03:35:28.020 --> 03:35:32.740]  united states solicitor general is now on board representing the defendants and she does not ask
[03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:39.860]  for an extension to file the waiver and she does not uh oppose she doesn't file the waiver but instead
[03:35:39.860 --> 03:35:45.700]  no and actually she files the waiver she doesn't file an opposition she files the waiver and that's
[03:35:45.700 --> 03:35:51.300]  what really stunned us and then after that they set a conference date of january 6 so just a few
[03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:56.500]  days later after they had signed and filed the waiver january 6 pops up on the calendar as the
[03:35:56.500 --> 03:36:02.660]  date for the conference so that was pretty stunning and exciting to see that that was that was jaw
[03:36:02.660 --> 03:36:08.580]  dropping i'm sure january 6 and let me remind everybody again you don't just get a case this far
[03:36:08.580 --> 03:36:13.940]  this is almost impossible to do this and the fact that they were instructing and helping it gives me
[03:36:13.940 --> 03:36:18.980]  a little hope right because they didn't have to do that um but they wanted to make sure to get this
[03:36:18.980 --> 03:36:22.900]  case in front of them that's why i said it could go very very good or for cynical me it could go
[03:36:22.900 --> 03:36:28.020]  you know very very bad but here's the here's the deal though i don't know how it could go bad at
[03:36:28.020 --> 03:36:32.500]  this point you've got you've got well i do but i mean i don't know that that would come to fruition
[03:36:32.500 --> 03:36:37.460]  you've got you've got these people that want to do the hearing so so this conference that comes
[03:36:37.460 --> 03:36:43.220]  first on january 6 is the precursor to whether or not they're going to hear the the case both sides
[03:36:43.220 --> 03:36:48.660]  correct exactly that's right the conference by themselves the justices go in and vote nine of
[03:36:48.660 --> 03:36:53.540]  them vote if four of them uh vote to for to move forward then it moves forward and i just want to
[03:36:53.540 --> 03:36:57.860]  emphasize again that they allowed us to file without getting the 10th circuit court decision
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:02.020]  they could have easily just tossed it back and said you can't come to this it's the supreme court
[03:37:02.020 --> 03:37:05.700]  until you get the final decision from the 10th circuit court of appeals right but they let us
[03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:10.340]  bypass that and then after we did then the 10th circuit made a decision so they already characterize
[03:37:10.340 --> 03:37:14.980]  this as a national emergency and then they put pressure on us to get it sooner and and and so
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:20.420]  we have a lot of and then january 16 the date per conference is just like this has got to be
[03:37:20.420 --> 03:37:26.260]  assigned to read people that they're that they they're doing the right thing it's jaw dropping
[03:37:26.260 --> 03:37:32.980]  january 6 and gives me a little glimmer of hope actually for cynical me uh so i'm i'm loving this
[03:37:32.980 --> 03:37:37.460]  and this is the other thing too if people wonder why this is so rare it's because we have what's
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:41.860]  called i think title 28 right where it protects all of these people from all the crimes that they're
[03:37:41.860 --> 03:37:47.380]  doing currently and and have been for many many decades it actually provides this protection
[03:37:47.380 --> 03:37:52.660]  but this case would actually take away that protection so that in the future if you ever
[03:37:52.660 --> 03:37:58.580]  wanted to sue to take those these people to court for violating their oath you could absolutely do
[03:37:58.580 --> 03:38:04.340]  that this is a total game changer if this is able to go forward and actually have a victorious outcome
[03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:10.420]  here correct yeah exactly and why would they even let it come into the court because it's like once
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:16.260]  they let it in it's it's going to be huge decision either way so they put themselves at risk with
[03:38:16.260 --> 03:38:20.900]  either side by taking it on and so we're pretty confident we believe it's going to be a nine to
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:26.180]  zero uh the u.s. solicitor general has a reputation for doing whatever she wants without consulting
[03:38:26.180 --> 03:38:31.060]  with anyone she's a pretty independent united states solicitor general so we believe it's very
[03:38:31.060 --> 03:38:35.140]  possible that she went through the documents and saw that it was just about the oath of office that
[03:38:35.140 --> 03:38:39.860]  it wasn't about any kind of interpretation of the constitution or any kind of political agenda
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:44.100]  and she can see this is a no-brainer of course we want investigations of course we want to
[03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:48.260]  make sure that the oath of office is real and enforceable article six of the constitution
[03:38:48.260 --> 03:38:54.420]  is very clear it states that they shall be bound by oath to this constitution well they can't be
[03:38:54.420 --> 03:39:00.100]  bound by what you said when they have immunity but that immunity those immunity statutes are
[03:39:00.100 --> 03:39:06.660]  unconstitutional in california they have a statute a state statute that excludes perjury charges
[03:39:07.540 --> 03:39:13.540]  politicians taking the oath of office it's like talk about a flagrant in your face violation of
[03:39:13.540 --> 03:39:18.660]  the constitution so this is a major constitutional issue easy decision i think for the justices and
[03:39:18.660 --> 03:39:22.500]  they can say it had nothing to do with politics look they're both sides of the aisle of this
[03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:27.460]  defendants or republican defendants or democrat defendants there's even a socialist defendant
[03:39:27.460 --> 03:39:32.340]  so it's nothing about politics nothing about special interpretations of the constitution it's a no
[03:39:32.340 --> 03:39:38.660]  brainer oh absolutely in fact this is all the democrats and then of course your choice select
[03:39:38.660 --> 03:39:43.540]  rhinos which we all know who those people are they're a disgrace to the country i think very
[03:39:43.540 --> 03:39:48.740]  traitorous and i know they hate that word right can't just toss that word around but that's exactly
[03:39:48.740 --> 03:39:54.020]  what's happened and when they all said no to an investigation what were they so afraid of and why
[03:39:54.020 --> 03:39:59.380]  did they do it well we all know the answer to that and so what's what what's wonderful about this is
[03:39:59.380 --> 03:40:04.420]  number one you were able to bypass the the lower court on this that's usually where everybody gets
[03:40:04.420 --> 03:40:10.260]  shut down is the lower court and they know it but for some reason they wanted this case they wanted
[03:40:10.260 --> 03:40:15.300]  this case in the public domain they wanted to make sure people understood this case heard this case
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:20.260]  and then of course with these protections being annihilated people would think twice about running
[03:40:20.260 --> 03:40:25.220]  for office if they knew that they could get sued right now you can conduct i guess every crime in
[03:40:25.220 --> 03:40:30.500]  the book and get away with it if you're a senator or a congressman which most of them are doing and
[03:40:30.500 --> 03:40:35.860]  so and or you know being bought and sold in the way that they are and so what's amazing is is
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:41.220]  maybe just maybe it won't save us but it would do something where it would open up a gateway because
[03:40:41.220 --> 03:40:47.620]  this all this would be 388 people out it would completely transform everything right and if
[03:40:47.620 --> 03:40:53.460]  they had to get out right if we were able to push them out and they could never run for office again
[03:40:53.460 --> 03:40:59.060]  you will have another select group of rhinos and lefties and all of these people but this does give
[03:40:59.060 --> 03:41:05.460]  us a chance it gives us a chance and i think this is kind of a god thing it gives us a chance to maybe
[03:41:05.460 --> 03:41:11.780]  possibly become educated enough and change enough in who we would cast a vote for in the future and
[03:41:11.780 --> 03:41:16.580]  then hold their feet to the fire i know that's asking a lot for cynical me but let me just say
[03:41:16.580 --> 03:41:20.900]  there's a hope there that we would save ourselves because no one's going to save us this case isn't
[03:41:20.900 --> 03:41:26.420]  going to save us but it could certainly open a door to absolutely reinvent the senate and the
[03:41:26.420 --> 03:41:32.660]  congress and of course the presidency right well absolutely and this would be a filtering process
[03:41:32.660 --> 03:41:37.380]  you wouldn't have the same kinds of candidates running for office when they know that there's
[03:41:37.380 --> 03:41:40.820]  you can be accountable to the oath and the constitution so i think we would we wouldn't
[03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:45.140]  see the rhinos and we wouldn't see the the unconstitutional candidates that we've seen in
[03:41:45.140 --> 03:41:49.780]  the past there are a lot of heroes that have given their lives and are willing to give their
[03:41:49.780 --> 03:41:53.860]  lives for the constitution and liberty and freedom and those are the kind of candidates that have
[03:41:53.860 --> 03:41:57.700]  been pushed out of the political system because of corruption and those are the ones that would
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:42:04.580]  replace the others so i think we would see a much more constitutional uh group of candidates coming
[03:42:04.580 --> 03:42:10.340]  and taking those uh taking those places filling those vacancies absolutely i'm just loving this
[03:42:10.340 --> 03:42:15.220]  case and it's really something to keep our eyes on the other thing is what is the senate or what is
[03:42:15.220 --> 03:42:20.900]  the scotus the supreme court what could they be challenged by right now there's probably a few
[03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:26.900]  things that they might be a little nervous about i know that uh all of these hardcore leftists would
[03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:30.660]  like to provide us with term limits in scotus they would like to do these things which would
[03:42:30.660 --> 03:42:35.620]  mean clarence thomas was out there's a there you know pack the court all these ideas that they've
[03:42:35.620 --> 03:42:41.060]  tried to float now do any of them have legs not quite sure but i know that there might be
[03:42:41.060 --> 03:42:47.940]  some within the scotus that think there needs to be a stop to the well-laid plans of some of these
[03:42:47.940 --> 03:42:53.220]  hardcore leftists if they were able to do some of the things like removing the electoral college
[03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:58.580]  the things that make us very american i'll be right back on the alex jones show have you tried

[03:47:15.940 --> 03:47:21.380]  and a couple of things i just want to i just want to say we've got christmas coming and christmas
[03:47:21.380 --> 03:47:28.260]  gave hope to it delivered hope to mankind for the entire world and and all those that were to follow
[03:47:28.260 --> 03:47:33.380]  and what a wonderful time of year this is and i wanted to showcase today's show usually i would
[03:47:33.380 --> 03:47:38.340]  do a christmas message or something like that but this is the one thing i have my eye on as far as
[03:47:38.340 --> 03:47:43.300]  being very intriguing and something to watch and you know we talk about all these things when i
[03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:47.700]  started out the show i was talking about different things we number one we've got a silent holocaust
[03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:53.060]  going on with between abortion and between what these shots are doing what the entire vaccine
[03:47:53.060 --> 03:47:58.660]  program is doing to us the second thing is i talked about elon musk i talked about timing remember
[03:47:58.660 --> 03:48:04.100]  and timing is interesting because everything has an aspect of timing to it why didn't elon do that
[03:48:04.100 --> 03:48:10.580]  a year ago you know it's it's timing and usually that timing is distractions and we talk about that
[03:48:10.580 --> 03:48:17.780]  a lot yet there are sometimes good timings with with things that i think god can do too and make
[03:48:17.780 --> 03:48:24.020]  a way for and that's why today's message instead you know christmas i i do a lot on christmas and
[03:48:24.020 --> 03:48:29.220]  i love christmas and this time of year but we also need a little bit of hope as well and that's
[03:48:29.220 --> 03:48:36.260]  what this case is my guest uh loy brunson um has filed this lawsuit 388 members of the senate of
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:41.300]  the congress and the fraudulent administration and it would actually throw them out for violating
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:46.660]  their oath they've never been sued for violating their oath why is that you know and so this case
[03:48:46.660 --> 03:48:51.140]  would actually do so because they said no to an investigation when they had a hundred witnesses
[03:48:51.140 --> 03:48:56.500]  for election fraud and they turned their back on it and they said no for whatever reason whoever
[03:48:56.500 --> 03:49:01.860]  was telling them to say no whatever the case may be you know what i mean and here we are with this
[03:49:01.860 --> 03:49:08.820]  case documented for january 6th by the supreme court the supreme court helped him to not have to go
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:14.660]  through the lower courts actually did this on rule 11 which would be the national emergency
[03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:20.740]  which is really interesting very intriguing a way to do that and now as we come upon this
[03:49:20.740 --> 03:49:25.140]  conference it'll be really interesting to see it move forward i have a feeling it will if they work
[03:49:25.140 --> 03:49:30.180]  this hard to get you to get you in this place at this time because you guys this is just unreal
[03:49:30.180 --> 03:49:34.900]  this just never happens uh lawyer i'm sure there's been a lot of miracles along the way
[03:49:35.860 --> 03:49:40.500]  yes there have there are three brothers we're in this together and darin is the legal mind behind
[03:49:40.500 --> 03:49:47.780]  it all and you know i think the january 6th date is a christmas gift and uh and and when we say
[03:49:47.780 --> 03:49:51.780]  toss them out of office it really could be quite smooth the way i believe it would happen is there
[03:49:51.780 --> 03:49:57.700]  would a court would the uh the u.s. martial service would be the ones to deliver an order
[03:49:57.700 --> 03:50:03.460]  from the federal court to the to the sergeant in arms with a list of credentials to be canceled so
[03:50:03.460 --> 03:50:07.780]  they could cancel the credentials right there there could be special government teams broadcast
[03:50:07.780 --> 03:50:13.140]  teams that go into the media to make sure that they're not you know inciting a riots and false
[03:50:13.140 --> 03:50:17.860]  information producing a lot of violence and so they could we probably all of a sudden would see
[03:50:17.860 --> 03:50:22.180]  new faces on television where they're reporting the news explaining what's happening that it's a
[03:50:22.180 --> 03:50:28.100]  smooth transition that we're not losing our republic and nothing's happening wrong but it's a good
[03:50:28.100 --> 03:50:32.740]  transition and then the the three directors of the federal communication commission have taken
[03:50:32.740 --> 03:50:37.060]  those to the constitution too so they've had an obligation that they've neglected and violated
[03:50:37.060 --> 03:50:43.060]  their oath by allowing anything through the broadcast waves to generate any kind of negative
[03:50:43.060 --> 03:50:48.660]  feelings or criticism of our great constitution they have an obligation is for and defend it
[03:50:48.660 --> 03:50:53.220]  and so i think there could actually be a pretty smooth transition i tell i have friends that
[03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:58.340]  are democrats and republicans and i i've asked them what what is it that you really want from
[03:50:58.340 --> 03:51:03.060]  your representatives and they all say the same thing honesty well that's what this case is about
[03:51:03.060 --> 03:51:07.700]  is simply about making our representatives honest whether you're a democrat or republican and so
[03:51:07.700 --> 03:51:13.380]  this would this would enforce the the oath and it would cause the representatives to be honest
[03:51:13.380 --> 03:51:19.380]  that's basically what it is i love this you can go to sevendiscoveries.com and you can help them
[03:51:19.380 --> 03:51:23.700]  do this it's become a full-time job now because they don't have millions of dollars for attorneys
[03:51:23.700 --> 03:51:28.420]  they just don't have it and so they're asking for your help because they've gotten this far
[03:51:28.420 --> 03:51:34.260]  and certainly this would turn the country on a dime i mean can you imagine 388 moved out of
[03:51:34.260 --> 03:51:38.500]  office immediately for violating their oaths and then what that would do to the future
[03:51:38.500 --> 03:51:42.340]  but let's just hope we can get educated enough to know what to look for in these representatives
[03:51:42.340 --> 03:51:45.940]  instead of voting for somebody because you want to go to dinner with them which is pretty much
[03:51:45.940 --> 03:51:50.340]  our criteria right now what i like to go to dinner with this guy that's our whole criteria
[03:51:50.340 --> 03:51:55.300]  maybe we could get back to actually you know fielding out what they actually stand for and do
[03:51:55.300 --> 03:51:59.380]  they have a backbone and some courage right to do what's right in the in office and actually
[03:51:59.380 --> 03:52:04.820]  represent the constitution but i like this case because you've gotten this far and many many
[03:52:04.820 --> 03:52:09.220]  things have happened in your favor to do so and this case could change everything it wouldn't
[03:52:09.220 --> 03:52:14.980]  save us but it could certainly open up a window of opportunity and i think that god and in his
[03:52:14.980 --> 03:52:20.900]  good graces would certainly open up an opportunity if that was how this was supposed to go down i
[03:52:20.900 --> 03:52:24.980]  could see something like this happening people could think this was very chaotic but like you
[03:52:24.980 --> 03:52:29.700]  said it actually could be pretty smooth smoother than what people would think it would be some
[03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:34.900]  people ask would ask at this point would that mean trump would be in office because of the
[03:52:34.900 --> 03:52:40.180]  election results and and what we absolutely know what happened with the electoral college count
[03:52:40.180 --> 03:52:46.740]  but did not get revealed and so would that happen who knows it's possible we've had
[03:52:47.300 --> 03:52:51.700]  discussion with constitutional attorneys and stuff about this it's really up to the supreme
[03:52:51.700 --> 03:52:57.300]  court this is sort of an this could be considered an act of war when you have that much evidence
[03:52:57.300 --> 03:53:04.180]  of infiltration to our to our sacred election process and then people won't investigate it
[03:53:04.180 --> 03:53:08.580]  and so this actually gives the supreme court complete discretion and power to do whatever
[03:53:08.580 --> 03:53:13.860]  they think is deemed necessary to secure our security in this country and so they could
[03:53:13.860 --> 03:53:17.860]  completely adjudicate this whole case before the six the whole complaint they could actually
[03:53:17.860 --> 03:53:23.300]  execute it and completely take care of it before january 6th and i'd like to just focus again on
[03:53:23.300 --> 03:53:28.180]  january 6th why would they set the date january 6th that's kind of an in-your-face date that's
[03:53:28.180 --> 03:53:32.900]  a two anniversary of what we're doing and i think it's a it's a confidence they can't really go public
[03:53:32.900 --> 03:53:38.420]  with us but they can let us know that they've got it and the fact that they they knew we would i'm
[03:53:38.420 --> 03:53:42.180]  sure they didn't ask us to sign a non-disclosure agreement when they were working with us and
[03:53:42.180 --> 03:53:47.860]  telling us that they accepted this as a national emergency type case so i think it's we have every
[03:53:47.860 --> 03:53:53.460]  reason in the world to be hopeful and positive and and even if the worst case scenario happened
[03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:58.660]  we can do a motion for reconsideration and there are i think we've received about 15 000 letters
[03:53:58.660 --> 03:54:02.740]  so far copies of what they've sent to the supreme court friends of the court so people can
[03:54:02.740 --> 03:54:07.140]  write a letter to the court encouraging them to do the right thing is totally legal and that's growing
[03:54:07.140 --> 03:54:13.060]  and as it grows if it's not allowed to move forward we can do a motion of reconsideration
[03:54:13.060 --> 03:54:17.860]  and then we have much more public support to push it over and then we still have another case it's
[03:54:17.860 --> 03:54:23.780]  just right there coming up behind this one but i think now is the time to act we've got to act
[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:28.500]  in the most effective way and right now there's too much damage being done for this not to happen
[03:54:28.500 --> 03:54:33.140]  immediately so i think the justices are smart i think they'll get it done you can go to seven
[03:54:33.140 --> 03:54:38.900]  discoveries dot com and you can help them you can get a copy of the entire case you can look at
[03:54:38.900 --> 03:54:43.780]  everything that they that they told them and scotis and and it would be nice to see scotis do the
[03:54:43.780 --> 03:54:48.660]  right thing they've made some pretty bad moves it would be it would be nice to see that it would
[03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:53.380]  restore maybe a little faith in the process i mean don't think for a second i don't understand
[03:54:53.380 --> 03:55:00.660]  that there's so much theater going on um at every turn trust me i get it yet at the same time there
[03:55:00.660 --> 03:55:05.460]  are some things that we can still do the constitution still in play and they're very much afraid of
[03:55:05.460 --> 03:55:10.660]  that they're afraid of the constitution so that tells you that the constitution still has its power
[03:55:10.660 --> 03:55:15.700]  otherwise we'd be cooked right now so so this is something we can work with we don't need to fight
[03:55:15.700 --> 03:55:21.380]  another revolution it's already been fought and one what we do need to do is like what loy brenton
[03:55:21.380 --> 03:55:26.500]  and his brothers are doing sounding the trumpet if you will they are the hey they're trumpeters
[03:55:26.500 --> 03:55:32.260]  what can i say i love this about them and also to be able to do something within the system
[03:55:32.260 --> 03:55:38.340]  that could actually maybe go the distance and maybe change things um and maybe set new precedents
[03:55:38.340 --> 03:55:43.940]  and that's what this would do it would remove the protections um and when they violate their
[03:55:43.940 --> 03:55:49.780]  oath of office as they always do it seems um they would maybe be a little more afraid in the future
[03:55:49.780 --> 03:55:54.420]  to violate it and to do the things that they're doing to be so bought and sold sorry to say it
[03:55:54.420 --> 03:55:58.820]  but it's so the truth and everybody seems to be some even some of what we think are these
[03:55:58.820 --> 03:56:05.460]  patriots out there blaming every single thing that they can for the election fraud blaming uh sam
[03:56:05.460 --> 03:56:11.300]  and the ukraine and money laundering and then of course blaming democrats and blaming money no
[03:56:11.300 --> 03:56:17.300]  this is fraud in our voting system and we need to take care of this because nothing's going to change
[03:56:17.300 --> 03:56:22.260]  right this was the most obvious fraud that ever took place and so the fact that it's the most
[03:56:22.260 --> 03:56:28.260]  obvious then presents this this other reason that this case moving forward is such a um
[03:56:28.260 --> 03:56:33.220]  wonderful little christmas present i love this anything else you'd like to add loy in this last
[03:56:33.220 --> 03:56:39.860]  minute well sure three of the justices have actually voted in favor of uh trump-related
[03:56:39.860 --> 03:56:43.940]  cases and the three that voted against were the trump appointed ones well since then they've all
[03:56:43.940 --> 03:56:49.060]  been unified like rovers's way they really stuck their necks out on that so i think that's an
[03:56:49.060 --> 03:56:53.220]  excellent indicator of what's going to happen with this and i just want to thank everyone for

[03:58:49.780 --> 03:58:55.220]  i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding
[03:58:55.220 --> 03:58:59.860]  on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the
[03:58:59.860 --> 03:59:04.740]  original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came
[03:59:04.740 --> 03:59:08.820]  out with that you had you know with a deeper source you know and i got really excited about that so i
[03:59:08.820 --> 03:59:15.620]  took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened

[03:59:39.460 --> 03:59:44.660]  take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling god
