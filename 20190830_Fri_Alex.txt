[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live August 28th, 2019.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  We're basically already in full-bore war with China.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's all coming up.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  But first, what do the elite know that we don't know?
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  No matter how useful these damn things are,
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  because technology is fine, but it's what they jack it with.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  I've got to get rid of it.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  I've got to at least start having weekends free,
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  no cell phones, go back to land lines.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  We're doing it.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  They're all going away.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  They're all getting locked up.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Every day when I get home, I'm done with them.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  And a lot of smart folks like Matt Drugs years ago,
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  you'll refuse to have them, because they're a little portable,
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  super high-tech computer with more tech in this
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  than 30 years ago could be in a 10-story building.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  And it knows your heartbeat.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  It already knows everything.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  It's listening to you all the time.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  This is your little digital minder.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  It might as well be a chip in your brain.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  It's already frying your brain.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  It's already giving you cancer.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  And so I always say I'm a hypocrite.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  I admit things are bad, then I still do them.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  But if you're a radio listener and you're not seeing this,
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  mind control by cell phone scientific American.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  I mean, this is not my opinion.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  People keep saying, why is it all coming out?
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  Why are you right about everything?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Because it was all in the medical and scientific literature
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  50 years ago on average.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  They're about 45-50 years ahead from the research and development
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  to when they deploy it to us.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  And when they deploy it, it's always bad.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  It's always the worst possible thing.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  It doesn't just destroy your attention span.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.000]  It doesn't just study.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  It's making we don't have friends and family.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  It doesn't just make you depressed.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  It doesn't just surveil on you.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It doesn't just kill you and give you cancer.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  It manipulates all of us and knows our dreams
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  so they can always be ahead of us with trends.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  It's our warden.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  It's our jail guard.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's our slave master.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  It's our king.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  It's our God.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  It's our mommy and our daddy.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  We spend more time with it than we do with our newborn babies.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  And so this week, and last week,
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  I was talking about the heat coming off the thing.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  So I got another one.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  This bastard did it, was it today or yesterday?
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  Again.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  Because I know heat when I feel it.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  You're like, whoa, that's, it's beaming.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  It's got some pulse power where it's got like a real microwave,
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  like you're inside a microwave.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  I mean, that takes power to go, whoa.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  That's what they've always said.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  They can remotely kill people.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  They don't like, I guess, with these.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  So I think at an instinctive level,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I have to just get rid of them completely
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  because it's slow killing us.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  So they want to, and there's been reports on this.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  They can kill you quickly with 5G particularly.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  So from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s,
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  we've been developing microwave weapons right up to today.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  And they are incredibly sophisticated today.
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  So if any government says that microwaves have no effect on you,
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  the question is, why have you been spending billions
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  upon billions of dollars with the military
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  for the last 60 years improving them?
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Everybody's habituated.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Now they tell you, oh, 5G smartphones caused cancer.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  Wired magazine last year.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  The inconvenient truth about cancer and mobile phones.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  The Guardian.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  So they're telling you.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  Big report about how it's all embedded.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  California Bands 5G cell tower overclaims it causes cancer.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  At a school where 20% of the kids got cancer.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  I mean, you didn't used to get one kid with cancer
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  out of a million in the 1950s, folks.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  Now you can't swing a stick and not, you know,
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  hit a kid that's got it.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  5G smartphones caused cancer.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Other headline.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  These are all just boom, boom, boom.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Now, here's where you'll stop them.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  Because once somebody's habituated to something,
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  whether it's cigarettes or whether it's liquor,
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  whether it's being abused, whether it's significant other,
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  they tend to put up with it. We adapt to being in our environment.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  They have these zones all over the world.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Now we're discovering, and this is one of the cutting edge things
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  that I've been working on, where they're building communities
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  that don't allow radio transmitters, shell phones, anything.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  And they always excuses, oh, we're studying birds and bees here
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  to see if electromagnetic's hurting them.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  They know it's killing them.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  Or, oh, we've got a SETI government NASA program here,
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  and so it jams it if there's any electromagnetic radiation.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  And if you look at it, the land values and everything
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  are skyrocketing those areas, and they're getting some
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  of the highest per capita people moving in,
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  and there's shell corporations buying it up,
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  and there's heavy earth equipment and things going in,
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  and they're building underground bunkers in West Virginia
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  in the tens of thousands of square mile area
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  where the government has laws that you can have
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  no transmission systems of any type.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words,
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  to merge with AI gods.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  is our bodies.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  for the forestlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  that was incredibly high quality medical bottle man
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  It is amazing.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  Experience pure medical bottle man B12 for yourself
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  and fund the second American Revolution
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com,
[05:54.000 --> 06:10.000]  infowarslife.com, or triple A 253-3139.
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.000 --> 06:27.000]  Well, we definitely had a policy of truth here.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, live on this August 28th,
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  2019, Wednesday edition in defiance of the globalist,
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  in defiance of their tyranny, in defiance of their attempt
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  to create a post-human era, the only way that dictators,
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  psychopaths, and control freaks could ever win
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  against humanity is to exterminate us.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  And remember, I started the broadcast off yesterday
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  with NBC News cover story, their top story,
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  saying that the age of humans is over
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  and that we will soon be extincted perhaps in our lifetimes.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  Because if the globalist can exterminate 99%
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  of the population, they truly will not
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  have the competition anymore.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  And there it is, not long after that,
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  homo sapiens could vanish from Earth entirely
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  in our own lifetimes.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Now, if Hitler wrote that, you'd say it was even more
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  of a madman, but when it's James Lovelock,
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  the transhumanist environmentalist,
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  it's so sexy.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  And where does James Lovelock go?
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  I looked it up.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  James Lovelock has gone spoken to the Albert Einstein Institute.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  And who was the omnibudsman of that for the last 20 years?
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  Jeffrey, come on down, Epstein.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  But when it started to come out,
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  he was running a eugenics transhumanist operation.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  They didn't know what to do.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  He said, oh, he's a kooky transhumanist.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  The kooks are into that.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  Really.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  Well, almost everybody in Hollywood,
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  almost everybody in the highest levels of governments
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  of the Democratic Party, are all obsessed
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  with having their heads and genitals chopped off at death
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  and frozen.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  There's dozens of these facilities around the world
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  so they can be reanimated.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  They've got systems they're trying to develop to download
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  their souls to do what the ancient pharaohs tried and failed.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  And that, of course, is cheat death.
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  And those that try to cheat death will find eternal death.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Those that embrace life and don't fear death
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  because they know the Creator already
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  know that there's eternal life with God.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  But with the death cult,
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  if you energetically radiate to that,
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  all you're going to find is eternal death.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  Now, I said yesterday that I was going to come in today
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  with all these exhibits and do most of the show
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  on the bottom of the rabbit hole,
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  where the globalists are taking us.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  It's not the top of a pyramid.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's really the bottom of the rat hole.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I'm going to do some of that today.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  But really, I need to do more preparation
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  because this is so important to really lay out their quotes,
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  their statements, and to really get to the bottom of this.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  So I mean, they're going to do that tomorrow.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  I'll do it on Friday. I'm not complaining.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  But today has been law enforcement day.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  I had the feds call me this morning
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  when I was trying to get ready for the show on another issue,
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  which was not a problem.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  And then we had somebody steal a backpack here,
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  and our head of security wasn't even here at the time.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  He drove down from North Austin,
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  looked at all the convenience stores around here,
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  and within 30 minutes found the guys.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Citizens arrested them.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  That's still in the books. You find horse thieves.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  You can bring them into the magistrate,
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  and the police wouldn't arrest them.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  So I was dealing with that.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  I'm not complaining.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  There was just a bunch of other hell that broke loose this morning.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  I mean, a lot more than that,
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'm not going to get into on air.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  But when it rains, it pours.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  And so I got a little distracted,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  a little distracted from we sitting an hour in my office
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  and focusing and writing some more notes
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  on what I want to get to,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  because let me explain something,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  and I know you know this already,
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  but there isn't anything bigger except God
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  than the globalist desire to kill humanity.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  And they've been given a big delusion on why they're doing that.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  And you look at the pathetic, arrogant slaves
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  of Satan like Jeffrey Epstein,
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  and maybe you guys can find the footage.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  I should have told you.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  It's the one where the Prince Andrew,
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  type in Prince Andrew at Epstein's New York mansion,
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  and you see the door open to the dark,
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  and he's making this weird little vampire bat smile
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  and a young lady or girl is going out.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  Epstein's wearing like three big peacocking coats,
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  and you look at the satisfied look in his eyes
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  and how powerful he thinks he is
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  and how he's strutting around,
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  and it really picks up the essence.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  You can't find it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  We'll add it in post later when we post it.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  TemphillWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  It's just type in Prince Andrew, click images.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  Prince Andrew, Epstein, it's everywhere.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  And you see in that little clip of video
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  and all the other film clips and photos he's in,
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  just how he's in love with himself.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  He's drunk in the eyes with, he's a superman,
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and he's going to live forever,
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  and he's got to be able to impregnate
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  thousands of women to share
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  his incredible, unstoppable genetics.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  And he's got all these secret breeding facilities
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  and occult facilities.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And you're like, that's really freaky.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  That's really crazy.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  But it's not freaky.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's not crazy for them.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  That's standard default position.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  Again, if you just go,
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.000]  watch my film for free online,
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  in-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  If you simply research what's in that
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  two and a half hour film,
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  and look it up for yourself,
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  then you understand everything.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  Because that's their religion,
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  that's their system.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  They're told by their God,
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  the earth is bad, humans are bad.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  You're going to be God.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  You're going to overwrite it.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  The survival of the fittest.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  You're going to conquer all life,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  and new life forms will rise out of that,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  and then you will conquer the universe
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  and be a God.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  Well, that's what the devil said to Eve
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  in the Garden of Eden.
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  They had knowledge of good and evil,
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  as we would think of it,
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  but the knowledge of good
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  is the knowledge of how to run
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  good systems to be honorable.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  The knowledge of evil is the infection
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and the code and the system
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  to carry out parasitic systems
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  against humanity
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  that would end in humanity's destruction.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  Knowledge of evil is knowledge
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  of how to set up evil systems.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  It's not the awareness that bad exists.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  It is the downloading into your psyche
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  the spirit of the devil,
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  the spirit of rebellion
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  against God's perfect order.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  And so, yes, when I had a sargon
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  of a cod here in studio,
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and I said, well, you know,
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  they all went and hung out with Epstein
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  at the scientific institutes
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  they had in New York
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  and the Albert Einstein Institute.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  They're like, well, I didn't know that, Alex.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  I'll have to see if that's true.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  Well, we just put The Wall Street Journal
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  in The New York Times, The Washington Post,
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  ABC News.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  We can put all those on screen for you.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  They've been going there for years.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's why Bill Gates won't say
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  why he went and met with Epstein.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  We already know why.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  It is a transhumanist cult.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  And to transcend humanity,
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  their God has told them that,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  oh, yeah, go back to that last one
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  because there's also video of this.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  There's video that run on the news.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  I'll find it in the break.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  No big deal.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  But just go back to the other photo, please.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  No, the other way.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  One more over.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  That's it. Stay there.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Look at the smug look on Epstein's face.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  And everyone's just going around
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  acting like they're powerful,
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  acting like they're enlightened.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  But he ended up in a puddle of his own piss
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  with his neck broken by two gorillas.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  That's where he is now.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's what all his supposed power
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  and his globalist acumen
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  and all of it signified
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  was that he was a nobody.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  But you get in and around these meetings
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  and you read the minutes of these meetings
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  that have leaked.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  They all just worship each other
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  and call themselves supreme beings and gods.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And they're trying to build the technology
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  that we've developed,
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  the systems they can pretend to do that.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  But all they are is perverts.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  All they are is devil worshipers
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  always doing more and more heinous things
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  in the name of their supremacy
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  that they have a right to do it.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  I beat the IRS then
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  I can help you too.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay,
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  don't wait another day.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  solar survival backup system
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  this will be the most important message
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  you'll ever hear.
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  with historically low prices
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  on our PPX microgrid system
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  that's going to let you produce
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  The clearance price is a result
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  of the historic flooding we're having here
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Because of the flooding,
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  to a temporary location
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  we thought we'd offer the system
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  at myownpowergrid.com.

[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  And the best part?
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.

[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  the excitement and tradition of slingbow.

[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  Thanks for holding.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Hey, I just wanted to say,
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  your show's a breath of fresh air.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  to get Trump to go to a war
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  because they know that that's the only way
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  approaching 2020.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  other than assassinating him.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  I agree entirely.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  I'm trying to shut you down,
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  But if they do shut you down,
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  You've won a lot of battles.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  fired up for liberty.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  I'm not sure if we're calling.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  And we aren't going to back down.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  is the world that want to intimidate people
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  And the human spirit lives at infowars.com
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  and newswars.com.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do,
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  spread those links because we are the light,
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  the dark of the night.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  We are the resistance.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  Face these people up.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  Finally nothing.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  High news.
[20:28.000 --> 20:29.000]  Black �.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  Rolling below the asphalt.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Drive, drive.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  Are concrete fascination.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  Screaming to the edge.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Edge of nothing.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  This is what it is.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  Monday through Friday,
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  ladies and gentlemen, we're here live.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.640]  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[20:51.640 --> 20:53.680]  And of course, right after the transmission,
[20:53.680 --> 20:55.600]  there's the war room with Owen Schreuer,
[20:55.600 --> 20:57.360]  the rest of his great crew.
[20:57.360 --> 20:59.360]  And of course, David Knight starts it all off
[20:59.360 --> 21:01.920]  weekday mornings at 8 a.m. central
[21:01.920 --> 21:04.080]  with the David Knight transmission.
[21:04.920 --> 21:06.600]  Okay, so here's what I intend to do
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.120]  to shake the transmission up.
[21:09.080 --> 21:12.240]  I want to open the phones up early in the show,
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.560]  specifically on treason.
[21:14.560 --> 21:18.520]  And there's nothing but treason going on
[21:18.520 --> 21:19.680]  by the Democratic Party,
[21:19.680 --> 21:21.800]  by the multinational corporations
[21:21.800 --> 21:24.280]  that are still based in this country,
[21:24.280 --> 21:27.400]  that have set up shop in China in the last 40 years
[21:27.400 --> 21:29.320]  and who were trying to complete
[21:29.320 --> 21:33.560]  their economic and cultural conquest
[21:33.560 --> 21:38.560]  and usurpation of what's left of the West.
[21:38.560 --> 21:40.120]  And particularly the jewel
[21:40.120 --> 21:42.320]  in the crown of the United States.
[21:42.320 --> 21:44.120]  Remember this headline last week?
[21:44.120 --> 21:49.120]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him
[21:49.640 --> 21:52.120]  and weaken America.
[21:52.120 --> 21:54.880]  Xi, the dictator of China,
[21:55.960 --> 22:00.720]  or the 100 plus dead million under the party's belt,
[22:00.720 --> 22:04.000]  save us from the tyrannous,
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.040]  the tyrant king, the elected President Trump.
[22:09.560 --> 22:11.680]  You read the article, it reads like something
[22:11.680 --> 22:14.400]  that the Communist Party put out last night.
[22:14.400 --> 22:16.840]  Story's up on infowars.com.
[22:16.840 --> 22:20.600]  My Steve Watson, Communist Chinese quote,
[22:20.600 --> 22:24.840]  Taylor Swift in attack on President Trump.
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.200]  Isn't that just darling?
[22:28.200 --> 22:30.640]  And then it's got her quoted in here saying,
[22:30.640 --> 22:32.000]  I'll read the quote,
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.640]  how dare Trump do what he's doing
[22:33.640 --> 22:34.880]  with the economy in China.
[22:34.880 --> 22:37.840]  And I'm so ashamed, I didn't campaign for Hillary.
[22:37.840 --> 22:39.560]  It's just terrible.
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.040]  And the Communist Party quotes her
[22:42.040 --> 22:45.880]  and says, see Americans, see what you've done.
[22:47.240 --> 22:49.080]  So we have the Washington Post
[22:49.960 --> 22:54.960]  openly siding with Communist China over America.
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.080]  When they have a zero corporate tax, we have a 15,
[22:59.080 --> 23:00.960]  meaning all our jobs still go there.
[23:00.960 --> 23:02.880]  Trump lowered it from 40 to 15,
[23:02.880 --> 23:05.120]  thinking we get some corporations to come back.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.840]  And so Biden's trying to raise it back to 40 or 39.9
[23:10.960 --> 23:12.440]  to make it prohibitive to be here.
[23:12.440 --> 23:15.280]  It's like, oh no, some companies are coming back.
[23:15.280 --> 23:16.880]  America was never great.
[23:16.880 --> 23:19.040]  America will never be great,
[23:19.040 --> 23:20.480]  said the governor of New York.
[23:22.160 --> 23:23.160]  Meanwhile, Trump tweeted,
[23:23.160 --> 23:27.400]  our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars
[23:27.400 --> 23:29.200]  with China over many years.
[23:29.200 --> 23:30.960]  They have stolen intellectual property
[23:30.960 --> 23:33.200]  at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.720]  and they want to continue.
[23:34.720 --> 23:36.520]  I won't let that happen.
[23:36.520 --> 23:39.480]  We don't need China and frankly,
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.240]  we far better off without them.
[23:41.240 --> 23:42.760]  And that's the truth.
[23:42.760 --> 23:44.400]  The vast amounts of money made by,
[23:44.400 --> 23:47.960]  stolen by China from United States year after year
[23:47.960 --> 23:50.960]  and the decades will and must stop.
[23:50.960 --> 23:53.680]  Our great American companies are hereby ordered
[23:53.680 --> 23:56.400]  to immediately start looking for alternative to China,
[23:56.400 --> 24:00.200]  including bringing factories back to the United States.
[24:00.200 --> 24:03.480]  Trump said that a week ago.
[24:04.960 --> 24:08.960]  He said it last Friday, almost a week ago.
[24:08.960 --> 24:11.040]  And they began to freak out everywhere
[24:11.040 --> 24:13.040]  that he's an idiot, he's a moron.
[24:13.040 --> 24:17.000]  Meanwhile, again, China has $900 billion
[24:18.440 --> 24:20.400]  in trade deficit and stolen assets
[24:20.400 --> 24:22.880]  and intellectual property every year conservatively.
[24:22.880 --> 24:27.160]  $900 billion for stuff that I won't even buy toys
[24:27.160 --> 24:28.440]  for my children anymore,
[24:28.440 --> 24:30.160]  unless they're like made in the US or Europe,
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.320]  the old fashioned toys.
[24:31.320 --> 24:34.720]  Literally Chinese toys break half the time
[24:34.720 --> 24:36.240]  when you get them out of the box.
[24:36.240 --> 24:38.200]  The other half the time when you play with them
[24:38.200 --> 24:40.120]  like an hour, they break.
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.880]  I will not buy made in Chinese toys,
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.720]  made in China toys.
[24:45.720 --> 24:48.080]  And then you've got China involved in our politics.
[24:48.080 --> 24:49.920]  You've got to manipulating our currency
[24:49.920 --> 24:51.400]  because they own our currency now,
[24:51.400 --> 24:53.360]  the biggest piece of it, buying up our media.
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.160]  I know I harp on this a lot,
[24:55.160 --> 24:58.760]  but it's really, really a big deal
[24:58.760 --> 25:01.920]  that as a society, we've gotten to this point
[25:01.920 --> 25:04.880]  and that so many Americans believe it's okay
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.400]  to openly root against America for China.
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.000]  When China doesn't have welfare environmental standards,
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.240]  their rivers catch on fire,
[25:12.240 --> 25:14.760]  they have no scrubbers on their coal power plants.
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.600]  Their daycare system is chaining children up to poles
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.000]  for most people, hundreds of millions of children living
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.560]  near death level environments.
[25:25.560 --> 25:27.680]  And then we're supposed to compete with that.
[25:27.680 --> 25:29.760]  And the left tells us all day
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.160]  how we can't have any industry here, even if it's clean.
[25:32.160 --> 25:33.920]  This was all designed to conquer us.
[25:33.920 --> 25:35.800]  You wonder how America would get conquered?
[25:35.800 --> 25:36.840]  This was the plan.
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.720]  So yes, Trump does some things like
[25:42.720 --> 25:44.120]  give lip service to red flag laws.
[25:44.120 --> 25:44.960]  It's really bad.
[25:44.960 --> 25:46.880]  You notice he shelved that.
[25:46.880 --> 25:48.600]  We've got congressmen that are Republican
[25:48.600 --> 25:49.440]  still pushing it.
[25:49.440 --> 25:51.760]  We'll talk about Mr. Crenshaw bottom of the next hour
[25:51.760 --> 25:52.920]  of Caitlyn Bennett.
[25:52.920 --> 25:54.920]  He really sent her some nasty messages.
[25:55.920 --> 25:57.360]  And yes, Trump's got some issues.
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.440]  He hasn't come out to stop the censorship.
[26:00.720 --> 26:02.960]  The epic times, it's been around decades,
[26:02.960 --> 26:05.360]  owned by Falon Gong, first straight newspaper,
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.160]  original reporting, said the whole Russiagate was fake,
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.080]  showed all the proof, put out those big maps
[26:11.080 --> 26:13.800]  that showed how the deep state did it.
[26:13.800 --> 26:15.640]  Just invaluable reporting.
[26:15.640 --> 26:18.000]  Something the New York Times never did.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.840]  Something the Washington Post wished they did.
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.080]  They've been banned on Facebook.
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.120]  Now they've got ABC News hit pieces against them.
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.040]  Now groups are coming after them.
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.320]  All because the Communist Chinese,
[26:29.320 --> 26:32.760]  like we're a sock puppet, are working through
[26:32.760 --> 26:33.840]  the corporate media and through their
[26:33.840 --> 26:35.760]  Kermit Party to go right down the line
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.960]  and shut down every one of their enemies.
[26:39.920 --> 26:43.400]  And now they take away and block Mitch McConnell's Twitter's.
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.000]  And then they take away Michelle Malkin's.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.360]  And then they're taking everybody's
[26:48.360 --> 26:50.200]  communication systems away.
[26:50.200 --> 26:53.000]  And the leader of the Senate won't even act
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.320]  when he's being silenced.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.480]  Because, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.760]  the Democrats still control these central systems.
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.360]  The Democrats still control the major apparatus
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.200]  inside big tech, which was set up by our government.
[27:09.200 --> 27:11.920]  And the Clinton and Obama people and the Bush people
[27:11.920 --> 27:13.720]  are still in place in government.
[27:13.720 --> 27:15.800]  And Trump's only scratched the surface,
[27:15.800 --> 27:18.600]  removing them and putting good people in.
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.440]  And he's got to boldly go after them
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.640]  or they're going to steal the election.
[27:22.640 --> 27:24.800]  I want to open the phones up.
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.120]  I want to get your take on the treason of our media
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.720]  and our systems openly rooting for China
[27:29.720 --> 27:31.520]  and how outrageous it is that so many Americans
[27:31.520 --> 27:34.400]  are siding against their own interests and common sense
[27:35.320 --> 27:38.120]  with the heavyweight champion mass murderers of all history.
[27:39.200 --> 27:40.920]  And then you see the Hong Kong folks standing up
[27:40.920 --> 27:43.840]  and fighting back on our own media demonizing them.
[27:43.840 --> 27:46.440]  The toll-free numbers, 877-789-ALUX,
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.760]  877-789, first-time callers today,
[27:48.760 --> 27:50.480]  or callers that called him, it didn't get through.
[27:50.480 --> 27:55.000]  877-789-ALUX, 877-789-2539.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.040]  We're going to go to break in a moment,
[27:56.040 --> 27:59.240]  but here's Taylor Swift shooting her mouth off
[27:59.240 --> 28:02.960]  about Trump wishing she'd worked harder to get Hillary in.
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.040]  So I guess Hillary was obviously a chai-com operative.
[28:06.040 --> 28:07.280]  So here is Taylor Swift.
[28:09.800 --> 28:12.400]  Taylor Swift winning her second video of the year,
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.720]  Moon Man for her Equality Anthem, you need to calm down.
[28:16.720 --> 28:18.720]  But Swift was pretty fired up
[28:18.720 --> 28:20.440]  about why the Trump White House
[28:20.440 --> 28:23.760]  has not acknowledged her Equality Act petition
[28:23.760 --> 28:27.280]  for LGBTQ rights, which was launched with that signal.
[28:27.280 --> 28:28.400]  Single.
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.800]  The Chinese ex-execute gaze.
[28:29.800 --> 28:31.680]  I think in this video there was a petition
[28:31.680 --> 28:33.400]  and there still is a petition.
[28:33.400 --> 28:34.240]  Woo!
[28:36.520 --> 28:38.920]  For the Equality Act, which basically just says
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.480]  we all deserve equal rights under the law.
[28:41.480 --> 28:49.480]  It now has half a million signatures, which is five times
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.800]  the amount that it needs to warrant a response.
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.200]  Think about the irony.
[28:53.200 --> 28:58.200]  China executes gaze, but she's rooting for China.
[28:58.200 --> 29:00.200]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[29:00.200 --> 29:03.080]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[29:03.080 --> 29:05.600]  levels may not be fully detected by you.
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.120]  But the symptoms are there.
[29:07.120 --> 29:09.840]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops,
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.080]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.080]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[29:14.080 --> 29:15.480]  that something is wrong.
[29:15.480 --> 29:18.600]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference
[29:18.600 --> 29:21.360]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.200]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.440]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.880]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[29:27.880 --> 29:29.840]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[30:58.360 --> 31:02.840]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[31:02.840 --> 31:05.080]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[31:05.080 --> 31:07.440]  could be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[31:07.440 --> 31:10.400]  close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would
[31:10.400 --> 31:11.560]  end up saving the nation.
[31:11.560 --> 31:14.840]  And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming
[31:14.840 --> 31:16.200]  goods a week ago.
[31:16.200 --> 31:18.920]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[31:18.920 --> 31:20.560]  support for the president.
[31:20.560 --> 31:22.240]  And what he's doing in this trade war,
[31:22.240 --> 31:25.120]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[31:25.120 --> 31:26.080]  That's beautiful.
[31:26.080 --> 31:28.040]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[31:28.040 --> 31:29.560]  And we aren't going to back down.
[31:29.560 --> 31:32.720]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's
[31:32.720 --> 31:35.200]  the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back
[31:35.200 --> 31:37.200]  down, we're never going to give up.
[31:37.200 --> 31:39.600]  And all you've done is a wake of the human spirit.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.720]  The human spirit lives at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[31:43.720 --> 31:46.000]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do,
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.960]  spread those links because we are the light and the dark of
[31:48.960 --> 31:49.560]  the night.

[31:50.640 --> 31:53.000]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[31:53.000 --> 31:59.320]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new
[31:59.320 --> 32:00.960]  supplement routine.

[32:19.480 --> 32:23.120]  Messy bottles laying across the counter or 20-minute morning
[32:23.120 --> 32:24.360]  habits.

[32:33.560 --> 32:37.680]  knowledge, stacks of bottles and complicated routine.

[32:40.680 --> 32:44.320]  health and wellness, you can find what you like and get even

[32:50.560 --> 33:19.560]  today and jumpstart your supplement routine.
[33:19.560 --> 33:23.560]  He never gives up.
[33:23.560 --> 33:27.560]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas
[33:27.560 --> 33:29.560]  worldwide.
[33:29.560 --> 33:37.560]  You know, they're saying Joe Rogan is the most trusted man in
[33:37.560 --> 33:39.560]  America, the new Walter Cronkite.
[33:39.560 --> 33:43.560]  And I know he's probably one of the most popular talk show
[33:43.560 --> 33:46.560]  hosts in the country that's actually trusted because he has
[33:46.560 --> 33:48.560]  a lot of reviews and ideas on them.
[33:48.560 --> 33:52.560]  And I think it's emblematic of the fall of the corporate
[33:52.560 --> 33:55.560]  establishment media that somebody, my old friend of 20 plus
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.560]  years, Joe Rogan, would be in that position.
[33:59.560 --> 34:00.560]  I think that's a fair statement.
[34:00.560 --> 34:05.560]  You know, I just want to be known as the Sam Adams of
[34:05.560 --> 34:10.560]  America because he was in news as well financing pamphlets
[34:10.560 --> 34:13.560]  across the country to awaken folks to King George.
[34:13.560 --> 34:14.560]  But I got to tell you something.
[34:14.560 --> 34:17.560]  All of you, if you choose this mission to take action and
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.560]  those of you that have spread the word, you're not just Sam
[34:21.560 --> 34:22.560]  Adams.
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.560]  Who you really are is Paul Revere.
[34:26.560 --> 34:28.560]  You could be black.
[34:28.560 --> 34:29.560]  You could be white.
[34:29.560 --> 34:30.560]  You could be Hispanic.
[34:30.560 --> 34:31.560]  You could be Asian.
[34:31.560 --> 34:32.560]  You could be old.
[34:32.560 --> 34:33.560]  You could be young.
[34:33.560 --> 34:35.560]  You could be an immigrant that came here and wants to be
[34:35.560 --> 34:37.560]  part of this country and came here legally.
[34:37.560 --> 34:39.560]  And if you care about freedom and the unborn, you care about
[34:39.560 --> 34:41.560]  justice and you know there's good and evil in the world and
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.560]  you choose God, then you are the light in the universe that
[34:46.560 --> 34:49.560]  God has brought forth to expose the darkness.
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.560]  You are the salt of the earth and I salute you.
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.560]  You are the Paul Revere's and it's only through you and
[34:57.560 --> 35:04.560]  you're precious, incredibly powerful word of mouth that
[35:04.560 --> 35:07.560]  we're overriding the system right now and they're getting
[35:07.560 --> 35:08.560]  madder.
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.560]  They're getting more angry.
[35:09.560 --> 35:10.560]  They're getting more out of control.
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.560]  But I hardly ever say that more and more I do it.
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.560]  Play a clip twice in the same show, but I'm going to air
[35:18.560 --> 35:20.560]  the Taylor Swift again because some of you probably just
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.560]  joined us and I didn't have time to really finish commenting
[35:24.560 --> 35:25.560]  on it.
[35:25.560 --> 35:28.560]  Not only is she quoted in the official communist China
[35:28.560 --> 35:32.560]  newspapers and in others against President Trump and
[35:32.560 --> 35:36.560]  saying, oh, China is trying to save the American people by
[35:36.560 --> 35:37.560]  saving us from Trump.
[35:37.560 --> 35:40.560]  These are actual quotes by the communist Chinese government
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.560]  and by the Washington Post parroting word for word what
[35:45.560 --> 35:48.560]  they're saying.
[35:48.560 --> 35:53.560]  They don't tell you that it's actual communist party
[35:53.560 --> 35:57.560]  talking points from them.
[35:57.560 --> 36:00.560]  You see it from them when they officially put it out, but
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.560]  then you see it repeated by the Washington Post and others.
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.560]  That is beyond insane, but that's the point we've gotten
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.560]  to when even one of my oldest crew members been here 18 years.
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.560]  His sister will not talk to his mother and will not let them
[36:20.560 --> 36:23.560]  see the grandchildren and barely talks to him and just says,
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.560]  I just hope China can be Trump.
[36:25.560 --> 36:27.560]  They're so good.
[36:27.560 --> 36:31.560]  I wish we had a leader like Xi and my friend says to her,
[36:31.560 --> 36:33.560]  that's crazy, honey.
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.560]  He's a mass murderer.
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.560]  You shut up, that's pro-Trump propaganda.
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.560]  They can teach them to love a literal mass murder.
[36:44.560 --> 36:46.560]  And we showed this last week, they put huge hammer and
[36:46.560 --> 36:49.560]  sickles all around the neighborhood where we're at and
[36:49.560 --> 36:54.560]  saying, Antifa, rise up, crush the state.
[36:54.560 --> 36:56.560]  Well, the state in America is we the people, our
[36:56.560 --> 36:59.560]  Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our due process.
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.560]  It's not perfect, but it's the opposite of communist China.
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.560]  If you've got two pole stars, America looking for liberty,
[37:07.560 --> 37:10.560]  not perfect, but trying to get there in a much better history,
[37:10.560 --> 37:13.560]  China is the all-time greatest oppressor.
[37:13.560 --> 37:18.560]  Not in 6,000 years of recorded human history.
[37:18.560 --> 37:20.560]  Have we seen anything that comes close?
[37:20.560 --> 37:21.560]  Nothing.
[37:21.560 --> 37:24.560]  Hitler, Stalin, nothing comes close.
[37:24.560 --> 37:27.560]  Pol Pot, nothing comes close than to the
[37:27.560 --> 37:28.560]  communist Chinese.
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.560]  And so I harp on this and I harp on this because it's all
[37:32.560 --> 37:33.560]  you got to know.
[37:33.560 --> 37:36.560]  I mean, every day they're eclipsing Trump is worse than
[37:36.560 --> 37:37.560]  Hitler.
[37:37.560 --> 37:40.560]  Trump needs to be killed, they say.
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.560]  It just gets crazier and crazier and more out of control by
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.560]  the minute.
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.560]  I mean, we played this clip a few days ago.
[37:48.560 --> 37:50.560]  We're going to play it in a few minutes.
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.560]  If we play Taylor Swift again and then go to your calls,
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.560]  where they have Washington Post columnists saying,
[37:57.560 --> 38:05.560]  we've got to burn down conservatives' facilities.
[38:05.560 --> 38:06.560]  Literally.
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.560]  They're not even saying figuratively anymore because
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.560]  they're gearing up realizing they're not going to win at the
[38:13.560 --> 38:15.560]  ballot box.
[38:15.560 --> 38:18.560]  And they say we've got to eradicate their culture.
[38:18.560 --> 38:19.560]  It always grows back.
[38:19.560 --> 38:21.560]  It's too powerful.
[38:21.560 --> 38:23.560]  Yeah.
[38:23.560 --> 38:26.560]  Being pro-family, pro-God, pro-private property, pro-gun,
[38:26.560 --> 38:28.560]  pro-self-defense.
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.560]  What person doesn't know that just because some antifa crazy
[38:32.560 --> 38:35.560]  person goes and kills a bunch of folks that we should turn our
[38:35.560 --> 38:36.560]  guns in?
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.560]  That's why we have our guns.
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.560]  Just like when some Islamic runs over a couple hundred people
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.560]  in France, including dozens of little kids and kills them, we
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.560]  don't ban 18-wheelers because some psycho stole one.
[38:48.560 --> 38:51.560]  I was to walk up and smash this coffee cup across somebody's
[38:51.560 --> 38:53.560]  face.
[38:53.560 --> 38:58.560]  They wouldn't ban coffee cups.
[38:58.560 --> 39:00.560]  I could probably kill somebody with this coffee cup,
[39:00.560 --> 39:03.560]  ramming it into their temple.
[39:03.560 --> 39:05.560]  Are you going to blame the coffee cup or are you going to blame
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.560]  me?
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.560]  So here's Taylor Swift quoted, she should have voted for Hillary.
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.560]  Trump's screwing everything up in the Communist Party, China.
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.560]  Meanwhile, she's at a Taylor Swift event with a bunch of
[39:18.560 --> 39:21.560]  obese men dressed up like babies.
[39:21.560 --> 39:23.560]  That's the kid club movement.
[39:23.560 --> 39:26.560]  That's the whole simulated pedophilia thing which they now
[39:26.560 --> 39:27.560]  admit.
[39:27.560 --> 39:33.560]  And she's there saying, oh, my gosh, Trump, you didn't pass my
[39:33.560 --> 39:35.560]  equality bill or whatever.
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.560]  That means brainwashing of kids, paying for sex changes.
[39:39.560 --> 39:42.560]  I mean, if you want to get your testicles cut off, go ahead.
[39:42.560 --> 39:43.560]  I'm not paying for it.
[39:43.560 --> 39:44.560]  You want to have your nose cut off.
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.560]  You want body modification?
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.560]  You want to cut your ears off?
[39:46.560 --> 39:47.560]  Put horns on your head?
[39:47.560 --> 39:48.560]  Great.
[39:48.560 --> 39:50.560]  I'm not paying for your breast implants.
[39:50.560 --> 39:52.560]  I'm not paying for your abortion.
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.560]  I'm not paying to get your tallywacker cut off.
[39:54.560 --> 39:57.560]  This is all common sense stuff.
[39:57.560 --> 39:59.560]  You're mentally ill and want to cut your Johnson off?
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.560]  I'm not paying for it.
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.560]  And so in China, some will be arrested promoting this.
[40:06.560 --> 40:07.560]  The gays get executed.
[40:07.560 --> 40:09.560]  But none of that's lost on her.
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.560]  She's rooting against Trump.
[40:11.560 --> 40:14.560]  They know that that type of lifestyle, when it gets all of the
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.560]  craziness, destroys cultures, does every time in cycles.
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.560]  And so they'll put you in jail for it.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.560]  But she doesn't say a word about them.
[40:23.560 --> 40:24.560]  It's all about how Trump's bad.
[40:24.560 --> 40:53.560]  Here it is.
[40:54.560 --> 41:14.560]  It's all about promoting an agenda to depopulate the nation and weaken it.
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.560]  I don't hate people individually for their sexual proclivities.
[41:17.560 --> 41:20.560]  I'm saying the pushing of all this is to sabotage the nation.
[41:20.560 --> 41:23.560]  China openly funds it here, but outlaws it there.
[41:23.560 --> 41:25.560]  I don't want to put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[41:25.560 --> 41:27.560]  Now, I spoke about this.
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.560]  We played the full clip a couple of days ago.
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.560]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is critical to understand that
[41:34.560 --> 41:38.560]  the Washington Post columnist goes on TV and says it's time to
[41:38.560 --> 41:40.560]  burn down conservatives with no survivors.
[41:40.560 --> 41:42.560]  Close quote here it is.
[41:42.560 --> 41:44.560]  In essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.560]  We have to level them because if there are survivors, if there are
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.560]  people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[41:52.560 --> 41:54.560]  They will take this as confirmation that, hey,
[41:54.560 --> 41:56.560]  it just pays to ride the waves.
[41:56.560 --> 41:57.560]  Look at me.
[41:57.560 --> 41:58.560]  I've made it through.
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.560]  And so up and down the ticket, federal, state, local offices,
[42:02.560 --> 42:04.560]  the country has to repudiate this.
[42:04.560 --> 42:06.560]  It is not a normal administration.
[42:06.560 --> 42:08.560]  And when these people say, oh, you can't criticize us,
[42:08.560 --> 42:10.560]  it will deter public service.
[42:10.560 --> 42:14.560]  It will deter people who are liars, who are enablers,
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.560]  who are really bad people, and they should be deterred.
[42:18.560 --> 42:21.560]  Back that up five seconds and just hit pause for TV viewers.
[42:21.560 --> 42:23.560]  If you want to know what traders look like,
[42:23.560 --> 42:26.560]  if you want to know what sandbags look like,
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.560]  what astro turf looks like, if you ever wanted in your life to see
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.560]  the problem in culture and the problem in society,
[42:37.560 --> 42:38.560]  then that's it.
[42:38.560 --> 42:40.560]  Can we just put the video or just play it again?
[42:40.560 --> 42:42.560]  If we can do that, that'd be great.
[42:42.560 --> 42:46.560]  That's what people just see, the folks that I'm talking about right there.
[42:46.560 --> 42:48.560]  Look at the looks in their eyes.
[42:48.560 --> 42:49.560]  Look at the arrogance.
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.560]  Look at the hate.
[42:50.560 --> 42:51.560]  Look at the weirdness.
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.560]  Crush us, burn us down, bully us, intimidate us.
[42:54.560 --> 43:22.560]  These people are authoritarian.
[43:22.560 --> 43:25.560]  With the PM pack and the eight pack power stack,
[43:25.560 --> 43:28.560]  you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[43:28.560 --> 43:30.560]  Containing four original formulas,
[43:30.560 --> 43:33.560]  the PM rest and recover pack will build up your body's defenses
[43:33.560 --> 43:37.560]  and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.560]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas.
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.560]  The PM packet was created to support
[43:43.560 --> 43:46.560]  improving your body's bones and immune system,
[43:46.560 --> 43:48.560]  all while you rest from the day's work.
[43:48.560 --> 43:50.560]  When combined with the AM wake up and work packet,
[43:50.560 --> 43:52.560]  it makes the eight pack power stack
[43:52.560 --> 43:58.560]  the new can't miss info wars life product.
[43:58.560 --> 44:01.560]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people,
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.560]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[44:04.560 --> 44:06.560]  in that if you go back five, six years ago,
[44:06.560 --> 44:09.560]  before all the censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[44:09.560 --> 44:11.560]  I would talk about how great the products are
[44:11.560 --> 44:13.560]  and how they were the best and why they were,
[44:13.560 --> 44:15.560]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[44:15.560 --> 44:18.560]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us,
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.560]  or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements,
[44:20.560 --> 44:22.560]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[44:22.560 --> 44:24.560]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.560]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[44:28.560 --> 44:31.560]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[44:31.560 --> 44:34.560]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[44:34.560 --> 44:36.560]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[44:36.560 --> 44:39.560]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them,
[44:39.560 --> 44:42.560]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.560]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[44:44.560 --> 44:46.560]  And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects,
[44:46.560 --> 44:49.560]  not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing
[44:49.560 --> 44:51.560]  about God's medicine chest.
[44:51.560 --> 45:17.560]  Thank you.
[45:17.560 --> 45:43.560]  Thank you.
[45:43.560 --> 46:09.560]  Thank you.
[46:09.560 --> 46:35.560]  Thank you.
[46:35.560 --> 47:01.560]  Thank you.
[47:01.560 --> 47:09.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.560 --> 47:38.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:38.560 --> 47:41.560]  It's like Biden said it's a physical revolution,
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.560]  and they're openly allied with the Communist Chinese.
[47:45.560 --> 47:48.560]  He says there must be no survivors.
[47:48.560 --> 47:50.560]  And then you look at the panel,
[47:50.560 --> 47:52.560]  and I've got plenty of new news,
[47:52.560 --> 47:53.560]  but why am I going back to this?
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.560]  Because what do you think in full wars is?
[47:56.560 --> 47:58.560]  What do you think we're going through?
[47:58.560 --> 48:00.560]  You're the target, though,
[48:00.560 --> 48:02.560]  but I've dared challenge their Queen Hillary.
[48:02.560 --> 48:05.560]  I dared mobilize the population.
[48:05.560 --> 48:07.560]  You dared mobilize the population.
[48:07.560 --> 48:09.560]  The George Report.com
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.560]  dared link to us in defiance of all the threats I know he got.
[48:13.560 --> 48:17.560]  And we're here, and we have energized the core of the nation,
[48:17.560 --> 48:20.560]  black, white, old, young.
[48:20.560 --> 48:23.560]  And people don't buy the propaganda anymore.
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.560]  I have so many people walking to me, and they say,
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.560]  you know, I didn't even used to be a fan of yours
[48:27.560 --> 48:28.560]  until I heard them lie about you,
[48:28.560 --> 48:30.560]  and I had to go hear what you were saying to find out
[48:30.560 --> 48:31.560]  why they were after you,
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.560]  and man, you've got an amazing broadcast.
[48:34.560 --> 48:37.560]  I'm shaking more hands than I've ever shook.
[48:37.560 --> 48:40.560]  I'm getting more support on the ground,
[48:40.560 --> 48:43.560]  but not financial,
[48:43.560 --> 48:45.560]  because it's only a core audience
[48:45.560 --> 48:46.560]  that actually buys the products.
[48:46.560 --> 48:47.560]  I'm going to go to your calls,
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.560]  but we're doing something very special,
[48:49.560 --> 48:53.560]  and I can tell you this special
[48:53.560 --> 48:56.560]  is the very best special we've ever done,
[48:56.560 --> 48:59.560]  particularly with this type of sale.
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.560]  It's a type of sale we've never engaged in.
[49:02.560 --> 49:04.560]  We've had sales where you get 50% off free shipping.
[49:04.560 --> 49:07.560]  We've had sales where you can get one bottle
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.560]  and get another one free.
[49:09.560 --> 49:12.560]  We've done sales that are excellent,
[49:12.560 --> 49:13.560]  because we don't market up that much.
[49:13.560 --> 49:15.560]  When we do a sale like this,
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.560]  in some cases we're making like 25%.
[49:17.560 --> 49:18.560]  We sell a ton of it,
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.560]  but I've kind of put myself in that trap,
[49:20.560 --> 49:22.560]  because the listeners, they always want the very best deal,
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.560]  and there's not a lot of fat there to fund the operation.
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.560]  But DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQTin,
[49:28.560 --> 49:30.560]  and everything else you need for your telomeres,
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.560]  your cells, energy,
[49:32.560 --> 49:34.560]  it's the base you need for everything.
[49:34.560 --> 49:35.560]  If you don't have this,
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.560]  no amount of energy drink is going to help you.
[49:38.560 --> 49:40.560]  It's the fount of it all.
[49:40.560 --> 49:42.560]  It's the very best, you name it,
[49:42.560 --> 49:44.560]  Neutropic Antioxidant for your cells.
[49:44.560 --> 49:46.560]  And this has got a bunch of patented stuff
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.560]  you can make claims on.
[49:47.560 --> 49:49.560]  It's unbelievable.
[49:49.560 --> 49:52.560]  98% reviews, then Forceware.com.
[49:52.560 --> 49:54.560]  It's 50% off,
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.560]  even though at current sales
[49:56.560 --> 49:58.560]  we've got five weeks of it left,
[49:58.560 --> 50:01.560]  and more isn't coming in for 10 weeks.
[50:01.560 --> 50:03.560]  I signed a huge contract a year ago
[50:03.560 --> 50:07.560]  to order even more of it to get the price down.
[50:07.560 --> 50:09.560]  We're talking 30-something dollars
[50:09.560 --> 50:11.560]  with the product in each bottle.
[50:11.560 --> 50:13.560]  Let me go further.
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.560]  Carnivore, digestive enzymes.
[50:17.560 --> 50:19.560]  This is a product that's been popular
[50:19.560 --> 50:20.560]  to people that know what they're doing,
[50:20.560 --> 50:23.560]  but overall, not a popular product.
[50:23.560 --> 50:27.560]  They're $17 and something cents,
[50:27.560 --> 50:30.560]  80-something cents in each glass bottle of this.
[50:30.560 --> 50:32.560]  I'm not going to get into
[50:32.560 --> 50:34.560]  what these expensive enzymes do.
[50:34.560 --> 50:36.560]  They don't just help you break down fat
[50:36.560 --> 50:38.560]  or break down protein in the gut.
[50:38.560 --> 50:40.560]  It does it in the intestines,
[50:40.560 --> 50:42.560]  and if you want to get flushed out,
[50:42.560 --> 50:44.560]  this is beyond probiotics,
[50:44.560 --> 50:50.560]  just like our anti-mold and yeast product is.
[50:50.560 --> 50:53.560]  Carnivore, if you want to flush out
[50:53.560 --> 50:54.560]  the meat you've been eating
[50:54.560 --> 50:56.560]  and you want to really get healthy,
[50:56.560 --> 50:59.560]  this is amazing, it's next level.
[50:59.560 --> 51:01.560]  And so, guess what I'm doing?
[51:01.560 --> 51:04.560]  It costs us $17.
[51:04.560 --> 51:07.560]  I don't want to discontinue this product.
[51:07.560 --> 51:09.560]  In fact, I've decided to reorder it for next year,
[51:09.560 --> 51:10.560]  but it won't be here until next year,
[51:10.560 --> 51:11.560]  and I'm going to hype it up
[51:11.560 --> 51:12.560]  and tell you how great it is.
[51:12.560 --> 51:13.560]  I never really launched this product,
[51:13.560 --> 51:14.560]  never really talked about it,
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.560]  but to buy the product for next year,
[51:16.560 --> 51:18.560]  we're going to sell it for like $35,
[51:18.560 --> 51:20.560]  so we make like 20 bucks or whatever.
[51:20.560 --> 51:25.560]  We are going to give it to you free.
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.560]  Every bottle of DNA Force Plus,
[51:27.560 --> 51:29.560]  even though we're going to sell out of it,
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.560]  you get a free bottle,
[51:33.560 --> 51:36.560]  the big bottle,
[51:36.560 --> 51:39.560]  that has the 90 capsules in it,
[51:39.560 --> 51:42.560]  that cost us almost $18.
[51:42.560 --> 51:47.560]  Nobody puts $18 in a meat enzyme pill.
[51:47.560 --> 51:49.560]  This is, I wanted the best.
[51:49.560 --> 51:50.560]  I did it.
[51:50.560 --> 51:52.560]  Most brands out there have $2 in them,
[51:52.560 --> 51:53.560]  and it still works.
[51:53.560 --> 51:55.560]  This has $17 in it.
[51:55.560 --> 51:56.560]  It's incredible,
[51:56.560 --> 51:58.560]  and yes, the pun has intended,
[51:58.560 --> 52:00.560]  it's explosive.
[52:00.560 --> 52:01.560]  You want to go next level probiotic?
[52:01.560 --> 52:03.560]  This is beyond probiotic.
[52:03.560 --> 52:05.560]  And it goes great with the Myco ZX,
[52:05.560 --> 52:06.560]  it hits the candida, the mold,
[52:06.560 --> 52:07.560]  the yeast, all of it.
[52:07.560 --> 52:10.560]  Now, Super Mill Vitality is our second best seller.
[52:10.560 --> 52:12.560]  I don't need to sit there
[52:12.560 --> 52:14.560]  and tell you how great it is.
[52:14.560 --> 52:17.560]  Cold pressed herbs, wild harvested,
[52:17.560 --> 52:21.560]  so that they keep their psycho-active,
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.560]  I mean, it's the brain, everything.
[52:23.560 --> 52:26.560]  Libido, energy stamina, much weaker
[52:26.560 --> 52:30.560]  than something like our alpha force
[52:30.560 --> 52:31.560]  and our alpha power,
[52:31.560 --> 52:33.560]  that's got the same herbs in it,
[52:33.560 --> 52:35.560]  they're organic, but they're dry.
[52:35.560 --> 52:38.560]  Its dose is way stronger than this.
[52:38.560 --> 52:39.560]  A lot of people think,
[52:39.560 --> 52:41.560]  and I agree, it depends on your physiology,
[52:41.560 --> 52:43.560]  this is better, because it's cold pressed.
[52:43.560 --> 52:44.560]  It's less of the herbs,
[52:44.560 --> 52:46.560]  but they're cold pressed.
[52:46.560 --> 52:47.560]  They were never heated up,
[52:47.560 --> 52:49.560]  they were never dried.
[52:49.560 --> 52:52.560]  When you get it 50% off,
[52:52.560 --> 52:55.560]  you get a free bottle
[52:55.560 --> 52:59.560]  with a 30 count of carnivore digestive enzyme
[52:59.560 --> 53:01.560]  in the glass bottle, 30 count.
[53:01.560 --> 53:05.560]  And this baby costs us over $7.
[53:05.560 --> 53:08.560]  Now understand, most people mark things up
[53:08.560 --> 53:10.560]  five to seven times.
[53:10.560 --> 53:13.560]  We mark stuff up 150%,
[53:13.560 --> 53:15.560]  we always discount 50%,
[53:15.560 --> 53:18.560]  so stuff when you get it is 100% marked up
[53:18.560 --> 53:22.560]  when it's on the regular 25% off sale.
[53:22.560 --> 53:24.560]  This is the biggest sale
[53:24.560 --> 53:26.560]  of these two items we've ever done,
[53:26.560 --> 53:29.560]  because I want to sell out of this,
[53:29.560 --> 53:30.560]  be able to reorder it,
[53:30.560 --> 53:31.560]  and then I'm going to promote it
[53:31.560 --> 53:32.560]  and actually brand it,
[53:32.560 --> 53:33.560]  because what happens, I got busy
[53:33.560 --> 53:34.560]  in the last few years
[53:34.560 --> 53:36.560]  and didn't brand any of our new products,
[53:36.560 --> 53:38.560]  like carnivore and things like that,
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.560]  that are some of our best products.
[53:40.560 --> 53:42.560]  So I'm just giving it to you,
[53:42.560 --> 53:44.560]  knowing that you're going to want
[53:44.560 --> 53:47.560]  to order it next year for $35,
[53:47.560 --> 53:49.560]  and then we'll bring in, I don't know,
[53:49.560 --> 53:51.560]  $17, $18 in funder operation.
[53:51.560 --> 53:53.560]  It's free.
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.560]  There's only a few thousand of each of these,
[53:55.560 --> 53:57.560]  and there's only a few thousand
[53:57.560 --> 53:59.560]  at the sale price left to DNA Force.
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.560]  As soon as we pass that amount
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.560]  of a couple thousand DNA Force sold,
[54:03.560 --> 54:04.560]  I'm going to stop it
[54:04.560 --> 54:06.560]  so that we have enough
[54:06.560 --> 54:08.560]  at the normal sales rate of DNA Force
[54:08.560 --> 54:10.560]  for another 10 weeks.
[54:10.560 --> 54:11.560]  You want to take advantage of this?
[54:11.560 --> 54:12.560]  Now is the time,
[54:12.560 --> 54:17.560]  infowarstore.com or triple-8253-3139,
[54:17.560 --> 54:18.560]  and that's how we fund our operation.
[54:18.560 --> 54:19.560]  It's really all up to you.
[54:19.560 --> 54:20.560]  Thank you for your support.
[54:20.560 --> 54:22.560]  That's at infowarstore.com.
[54:22.560 --> 54:25.560]  We also introduced the new Super Silver skin cream,
[54:25.560 --> 54:26.560]  exclusive infowarstore.com.
[54:26.560 --> 54:29.560]  25% off, it's got the hyaluronic acid,
[54:29.560 --> 54:32.560]  and it's got so much more in it.
[54:32.560 --> 54:34.560]  It's got the nano silver, silver salt technology
[54:34.560 --> 54:37.560]  to blowing people away.
[54:37.560 --> 54:39.560]  Now that said, I'm going to go to Bright,
[54:39.560 --> 54:40.560]  come back, and I promise,
[54:40.560 --> 54:42.560]  take nothing but your calls until our guest joins us
[54:42.560 --> 54:44.560]  on the treason of the globalists
[54:44.560 --> 54:45.560]  selling us out to China,
[54:45.560 --> 54:46.560]  and Trump fighting back
[54:46.560 --> 54:49.560]  and being called a traitor.
[54:49.560 --> 54:51.560]  And I just want to add this one caveat.
[54:51.560 --> 54:52.560]  Whatever you do,
[54:52.560 --> 54:55.560]  if you're listening to an AM or FM station,
[54:55.560 --> 54:57.560]  or you're watching us on a local TV station,
[54:57.560 --> 55:00.560]  call the local UHF, VHA, or cable,
[55:00.560 --> 55:01.560]  thank them.
[55:01.560 --> 55:03.560]  Call their sponsors and thank them.
[55:03.560 --> 55:05.560]  Become a sponsor.
[55:05.560 --> 55:06.560]  Cable's very inexpensive.
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.560]  Local TV's inexpensive.
[55:07.560 --> 55:09.560]  Advertise your steakhouse,
[55:09.560 --> 55:10.560]  your Mexican food place,
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.560]  your laundry place,
[55:13.560 --> 55:15.560]  your church, whatever,
[55:15.560 --> 55:16.560]  on that station,
[55:16.560 --> 55:18.560]  because we have great active listeners.
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.560]  Or just mail them a $20 check once a month
[55:21.560 --> 55:23.560]  and make that your tithe.
[55:23.560 --> 55:24.560]  Because I can guarantee you,
[55:24.560 --> 55:26.560]  that local radio station,
[55:26.560 --> 55:28.560]  where it's WBCR in places like Tennessee,
[55:28.560 --> 55:29.560]  or you name it,
[55:29.560 --> 55:31.560]  is doing a lot more for the Lord's work
[55:31.560 --> 55:33.560]  and fighting for the unborn,
[55:33.560 --> 55:34.560]  though they're already born,
[55:34.560 --> 55:36.560]  than any of these so-called churches.
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.560]  There are some good churches, but not many.
[55:38.560 --> 55:41.560]  They all want to hide out, do whatever.
[55:41.560 --> 55:43.560]  They don't say a word about the antichrist,
[55:43.560 --> 55:44.560]  the market of the bees,
[55:44.560 --> 55:46.560]  the microchipping, it's all here.
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.560]  And so if you think supporting this show is important,
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.560]  it is just, listen to me, please,
[55:51.560 --> 55:53.560]  because you're the wind in our sails, you're everything.
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.560]  It is just as important to support
[55:55.560 --> 55:57.560]  your local TV and radio stations
[55:57.560 --> 56:00.560]  as it is to support the mothership broadcast.
[56:00.560 --> 56:01.560]  So I'm thanking you for the support,
[56:01.560 --> 56:03.560]  but I'm asking you humbly,
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.560]  please reach out and support those local stations.
[56:07.560 --> 56:08.560]  It's absolutely critical.
[56:08.560 --> 56:10.560]  If you call a station and they go,
[56:10.560 --> 56:12.560]  well, we don't really take donations,
[56:12.560 --> 56:15.560]  say, okay, then have a coffee mug that's $50,
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.560]  that you mug club like Crowder does
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.560]  where you buy the mug for 50 bucks
[56:20.560 --> 56:22.560]  and you do it each year.
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.560]  Because the NPR gets billions in taxpayer money,
[56:26.560 --> 56:29.560]  and then they get all this foundation money that's tax-free,
[56:29.560 --> 56:31.560]  and they beg for money every month.
[56:31.560 --> 56:33.560]  Meanwhile, conservative talk radio is under attack.
[56:33.560 --> 56:36.560]  They're shutting it down all over the place
[56:36.560 --> 56:38.560]  because they don't want you to have a voice.
[56:38.560 --> 56:40.560]  Don't let them get away with it.
[56:40.560 --> 56:41.560]  You heard that lady earlier.
[56:41.560 --> 56:44.560]  Let's go out to break with her saying,
[56:44.560 --> 56:45.560]  shut us down.
[56:45.560 --> 56:46.560]  Don't let us weather the storm.
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.560]  No, we're going to all weather the storm together.
[56:48.560 --> 56:50.560]  We're going to hang together, hang separate.
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.560]  As Benjamin Franklin said, here it is.
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.560]  It's not only that Trump has to lose,
[56:54.560 --> 56:57.560]  but that all his enablers have to lose.
[56:57.560 --> 56:59.560]  We have to collectively, in essence,
[56:59.560 --> 57:01.560]  burn down the Republican Party.
[57:01.560 --> 57:03.560]  We have to level them,
[57:03.560 --> 57:05.560]  because if there are survivors,
[57:05.560 --> 57:08.560]  if there are people who weather this storm,
[57:08.560 --> 57:09.560]  they will do it again.
[57:09.560 --> 57:11.560]  They will take this as confirmation that, hey,
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.560]  it just pays to ride the waves.
[57:13.560 --> 57:15.560]  Look at me. I've made it through.
[57:15.560 --> 57:17.560]  And so up and down the ticket,
[57:17.560 --> 57:19.560]  federal, state, local offices,
[57:19.560 --> 57:21.560]  the country has to repudiate this.
[57:21.560 --> 57:23.560]  It is not a normal administration.
[57:23.560 --> 57:25.560]  And when these people say, oh, you can't criticize us,
[57:25.560 --> 57:27.560]  it will deter public service.
[57:27.560 --> 57:30.560]  It will deter people who are liars,
[57:30.560 --> 57:33.560]  who are enablers, who are really bad people,
[57:33.560 --> 57:34.560]  and they should be.
[57:34.560 --> 57:36.560]  Listen, witch, you're a really bad person.
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.560]  You're an authoritarian, dirtbag bully.
[57:38.560 --> 57:40.560]  I've heard your challenge. I accept it.
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.560]  And so does my audience of activists.
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.560]  Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.
[57:50.560 --> 57:53.560]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[57:53.560 --> 57:55.560]  Make no mistake.
[57:55.560 --> 57:57.560]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[57:57.560 --> 57:59.560]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[57:59.560 --> 58:02.560]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[58:05.560 --> 58:07.560]  I don't think we've seen division like this
[58:07.560 --> 58:10.560]  in America since Vietnam, because it's a form of fascism.
[58:10.560 --> 58:13.560]  The High Court will examine free speech rights
[58:13.560 --> 58:14.560]  and social media.
[58:14.560 --> 58:17.560]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down
[58:17.560 --> 58:21.560]  content associated with Alex Jones and Infowars.
[58:25.560 --> 58:27.560]  First they come for Alex Jones.
[58:27.560 --> 58:29.560]  Everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[58:29.560 --> 58:51.560]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[58:59.560 --> 59:01.560]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[59:29.560 --> 59:33.560]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[59:33.560 --> 59:36.560]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[59:36.560 --> 59:39.560]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today.
[59:39.560 --> 01:00:01.560]  Alpha Power, head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:14.560]  We patiently await the Democrats to narrow down their field
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.560]  of presidential hopefuls.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.560]  We can analyze the differences between the Democrats' leading
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.560]  candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, who maintains
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.560]  a double-digit lead over the rest of the Democratic field
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.560]  and our current President, Donald J. Trump.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.560]  They both made recent speeches in the key granite state
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.560]  of New Hampshire, which is always the first to vote
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]  in the primaries.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:47.560]  I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560]  And I said that I'm tied.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.560]  I'm tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560]  I'm tied in New Hampshire.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  I don't think so.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  Consider it a preview of what's to come if Joe Biden manages
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.560]  not to grope anyone or gaff himself into oblivion
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.560]  and makes it to the 2020 presidential debate stage.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.560]  You know, well, I love you too, and I love this town.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.560]  The danger might come back so often I may not leave.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560]  This is God's country, man.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]  What a beautiful town.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.560]  We're actually here today to officially launch our campaign
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.560]  to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.560]  The first detail is blatantly obvious, crowd size.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.560]  We know Biden's crowd is small regardless of the illusion
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.560]  of television, but Trump's crowd, well, even a five-year-old
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.560]  or possibly even CNN could see the massive difference.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.560]  The president is returning to an old favorite of session,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.560]  the size of the crowds at his rallies.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.560]  I think they said 17,000 people outside that couldn't get in.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.560]  The fire marshals closed it at a certain level.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.560]  The arena announced, I don't know the people at the arena,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560]  that I broke Elton John's record.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.560]  The thing is, pretty much everybody reported that
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.560]  the president had a big crowd in New Hampshire,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.560]  though there was a viral tweet that showed some empty seats.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.560]  And we know how seriously the president takes his Twitter,
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560]  so maybe that had something to do with it.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.560]  But CNN confirmed today that President Trump
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.560]  broke the attendance record at his rally last week,
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.560]  even beating Elton John.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560]  Secondly, rhetoric.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.560]  Biden is somewhere between a moderate broken record
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.560]  and an undecided liberal socialist Democrat.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.560]  We, the people, in order to form a more perfect union,
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:52.560]  it's unique in history. No nation, no tyrant can take us down.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560]  Only America can rip itself apart.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  And Biden apparently has no idea that the more he exaggerates
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.560]  the truth of what was spoken by a sitting president,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.560]  the more he angers anyone with half a brain
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560]  that knows which way the wind blows.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.560]  You know, can you think of any president
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.560]  who, when you saw what happened in Charlottesville,
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.560]  said they're good people on both sides?
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.560]  And third, Biden's foreign policy is backwards.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.560]  Claiming that he would stand up to China is laughable,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.560]  in the face of Hunter Biden's billion-dollar pay-to-play deal
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.560]  known as Bohai Harvest,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.560]  which has still managed to avoid the scrutiny it deserves.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.560]  While Trump is waging a trade war with a communist country
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.560]  that has dug its claws deep into the heart of America
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.560]  for decades...
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560]  And as part of my trade deal with China,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.560]  it's been very important.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.560]  And President Xi said he's going to do it.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.560]  So far, he has not done it.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.560]  But I said, you have to stop sending us fentanyl.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.560]  You have to.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.560]  And you have to criminalize in China
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.560]  the making of fentanyl.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.560]  And so far, he has not come through,
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560]  but I think he will.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.560]  And of course, with Biden, the gaffes never stop.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.560]  This time around, he thought he was in Vermont,
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  rather than New Hampshire,
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560]  according to an exchange he had with a reporter.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.560]  Anyone interested in the future of this country
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.560]  can plainly see that Trump is going to tear into Biden
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  like Mike Tyson in his prime.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.560]  President Trump is only getting started,
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.560]  and a lot of Americans want to see what is around the corner.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.560]  But Joe Biden is as stale as day-old bread.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.560]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.560]  That's right. Trump's brain is stuck on winning.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.560]  Biden is emblematic of the rotting emphasis.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560]  It is the traitors that have sold us out.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560]  Our surrender is over.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.560]  The surrender is over.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.560]  The spirit of liberty is loose.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.560]  It is rising.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:07.560]  Nothing will stand in its way.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560]  With the World Health Organization estimating
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.560]  that nearly 50 million people still suffer
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.560]  from some kind of mental impairment
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.560]  related to iodine deficiency.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.560]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.560]  The only source of 99.999%

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.560]  So, the Democratic Party is openly siding with China.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.560]  The Washington Post, New York Times have headlines like this.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.560]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump, or save him and weaken America.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.560]  Chinese government puts out those exact same statements.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]  Oh, Americans, we need you to bring down Trump.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.560]  We're going to save you. We're your friends, yes.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560]  That's why it's a death penalty of your film
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.560]  of fentanyl and China.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.560]  They allow its mass production and legal shipping to the U.S.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.560]  There's massive bust every day of it.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.560]  Tons of it being shipped in.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.560]  Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Chai Kong gun parts
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.560]  illegally being shipped into the U.S.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.560]  That's gun control I support,
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.560]  because it's a communist regime circumventing our laws
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.560]  and shipping weapons to the gangs they control.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.560]  I first learned about that back in 1997,
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560]  back when the L.A. Times was still
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.560]  somewhat of a reputable newspaper.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.560]  What do you make of the treason? How brazen?
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.560]  How naked? How insane?
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.560]  The open-rooting, by the left now,
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.560]  as Xi, as seen as this bulwark against Trump.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.560]  I mean, I knew two and a half years ago at Debo's,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.560]  they bragged that Xi would stop Trump.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560]  Him and Yunker made statements like that
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.560]  about how, oh, we'll crush America in a trade war.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.560]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.560]  We're actually winning right now.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.560]  And you can hear the screams and the peeling
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.560]  and the, no, Trump will get you, the American people.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.560]  You never stop us.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.560]  It was our time to rule.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560]  Hillary, totally on their payroll.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.560]  They're the ones that hate America.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560]  Then they tell us, oh, Trump's a Russian.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560]  He's an outsider.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.560]  That's why he's trying to save the country.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.560]  These people are sick.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.560]  But coming up at her calls,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560]  Taylor Bennett joins us.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.560]  She's mad at Trump about red flag laws.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560]  I was mad, too, but I was told, and it was true,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560]  that he was ropa-doping them
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560]  to get them to ask for total gun confiscation,
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.560]  and they get nothing.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.560]  You'll get nothing and like it, Judge Smales tells Spaulding.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.560]  I still don't like playing that game,
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.560]  but that's what Trump's doing is jerking their chain.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560]  I agree he shouldn't even do that.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.560]  He should attack Big Pharma and the mass murder pills.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560]  He's already pissed at drugs, period.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560]  It killed his brother, alcohol.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.560]  He's a T-toddler.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.560]  And if you get him on the Prozac route
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.560]  of those hundreds of type drugs
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560]  and he learns what those are doing, they're done.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.560]  They'll shut up about guns all day
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.560]  because 99% of crazy shooters are on those.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  But instead of bitching about Trump and red flag laws,
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.560]  he was never going to do it, folks, for my intel.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.560]  Go after him and say,
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.560]  go after the mass murder suicide pills.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560]  Like I told Pierce Morgan.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560]  Okay, we're going to go to George.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.560]  We're going to go to Duke.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560]  We're going to go to John.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560]  We're going to go to everybody.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]  Well, you're on the air.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560]  George, thanks for holding from New Mexico, sir.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560]  China is definitely the biggest threat,
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.560]  you know, to our Constitution or sovereignty
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.560]  and the tentacles that they planted
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560]  and so deep into our society is just insidious.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.560]  But, you know, let's face it.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.560]  I mean, President Trump is by far
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.560]  the greatest president that we've ever got to experience
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.560]  in our modern day time.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560]  We know that for a fact.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.560]  And thank God for him because of him.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.560]  He's been able to kind of basically, you know,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.560]  halt the complete takeover of the globalist agenda.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.560]  And we're grateful for that.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.560]  And isn't it incredible that we're actually living and seeing it
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.560]  and then more people aren't more thankful on the right
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.560]  that at least, look, let's keep him honest.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.560]  Let's stay on his ass, light fires under his butt.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.560]  But let's at least thank God that we've come this far.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.560]  Let's appreciate something.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.560]  Well, the swamp runs deep, man, you know,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.560]  and it's infiltrated both sides
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.560]  and we're in a great battle right now.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.560]  But the truth is, you know,
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.560]  Trump has been able to kind of keep us alive.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.560]  You know, my biggest fear, Alex, though,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.560]  what's going to happen when Trump is not around?
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.560]  Because we know Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.560]  He's waking up a lot of people
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560]  and a lot of things are happening because of him.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.560]  But my biggest fear, Alex, is what's going to happen
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.560]  when we don't have, you know, our commander in chief, you know,
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.560]  and what's going to happen after Trump comes in.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560]  That's my biggest fear.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560]  I totally agree with you.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.560]  That's my biggest concern.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.560]  And we better start making preparations for them to steal 2020
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560]  because he knows they're fake polls.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.560]  He's done internal polling.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560]  We've done it as well.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.560]  They add 15 points more Democrats on the average poll.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.560]  So that's how they cook at day one.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.560]  They also only target people via email and phone call,
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.560]  but they already know where Democrats are at a certain skew.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560]  That's how they do it again.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.560]  I mean, remember, CNN was having polls where Hillary wins by 68 percent.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560]  New York Times, 98 percent chance Hillary wins.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560]  Scientific algorithm.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.560]  That means they pull it out of their globalist rear end,
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.560]  you know, in the Chinese government in there.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.560]  But in between breaks of, you know, them raping the country,
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.560]  they engage in that activity.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.560]  And so we should have a whole show where we open the phones up
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.560]  and ask the question, what do we do when Trump's gone?
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560]  Because that's a great point.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560]  Tolskals has made that.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.560]  If we don't basically finish the Democratic Party,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.560]  like they're trying to finish us, the pro-Americans, the populist,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.560]  they're going to eradicate everything.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560]  I just played it last hour.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560]  That's their battle cry.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.560]  Eradication, shut it down into the free country.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.560]  And so these are globalists working with outside powers.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560]  We've got to try them.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]  They've got to get arrested.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560]  They're the ones working for foreign powers.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560]  They're the ones saying they want to kill us.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.560]  They want to arrest us.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560]  They want to bully us.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560]  Well, we have to stop playing games politically
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.560]  and really call them out for what they are.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.560]  And that's happening.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.560]  Right now they're losing.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560]  I believe if we can keep America awake
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560]  and realizing how serious the fight is
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.560]  and not going to sleep because Trump's there,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.560]  we will win if we don't.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560]  We're screwed.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560]  Thank you for the call.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]  Great points, sir.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560]  It was an excellent point he made.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560]  Duke in Maine.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.560]  You're on the air, Duke.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.560]  Good, brother.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.560]  I just wanted to make this point
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.560]  that I haven't heard anybody talk about.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.560]  I heard you talk about it back in 2012
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.560]  about how Obama allowed Chinese generals
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560]  to tour our military bases.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.560]  And I have not heard anybody talk about that since you.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.560]  And I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.560]  And I'll take your answer off the air.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.560]  Well, I remember it was even in the defense publications.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.560]  It didn't make a lot on the national news.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.560]  But they did detailed tours,
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560]  and they even had exchange programs
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.560]  with communist Chinese in secure areas.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.560]  And we know that it was Obama
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560]  that gave them the operations manuals.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560]  It was Obama that gave them
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560]  the Office of Personnel Management Act,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.560]  21 million names.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.560]  I mean, basically,
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.560]  Obama totally sold us out to China.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.560]  Because, again, they're all invested in China,
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.560]  and China's supposed to take over in this century.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560]  And so I do remember that.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560]  That would be well worth revisiting.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.560]  Remember back in 1996, 97, Bill Clinton
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  had Chinese generals in the White House
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560]  more than, what was it, more than 30 times
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.560]  with briefcases, big square briefcases,
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.560]  the big ones, like you carry a typewriter in,
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560]  full of $100 bills.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.560]  And that was confirmed.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.560]  They went, oh, executive privilege.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.560]  He can take money from foreign powers.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.560]  If Trump had Russians in the White House
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560]  giving him suitcases of cash,
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560]  I'd say try his ass for treason
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560]  and hang him up by his toenails.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560]  But that didn't happen.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560]  It was, again, Herr Clinton.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560]  Thank you for calling. Thank you for holding, sir.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.560]  Really was excellent questions.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.560]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.560]  Let's talk to Daniel in Arizona.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.560]  Thanks for holding her on the ear, Daniel.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560]  Good afternoon. Good morning, Alex.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560]  How are you doing there?
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  Good, sir. Welcome.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.560]  Good.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.560]  Honored to be talking with you.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.560]  I've been waking up people for years.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.560]  And I was just wondering how you feel about the courage
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.560]  of the people in Hong Kong.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  They are just, there's old, young.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560]  It's amazing.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.560]  And that's what we should be doing in our street.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.560]  Well, I agree.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  You know, Antifa goes out and beats up prayer,
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.560]  vigils, and veterans events.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560]  A bunch of meth head.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560]  Democratic party operatives.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.560]  In fact, I haven't even gotten to that.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.560]  It's an m4wars.com and newswars.com.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.560]  Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.560]  Martial law considered in Hong Kong
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.560]  to crush pro-democracy protest
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.560]  could lead to total destruction
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560]  of Hong Kong capitalist system.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]  Again, why do I support it?
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.560]  Mao took over China as a dictator.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560]  The State Department backed it. Our military didn't.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560]  A bunch of our own operatives got killed
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560]  by Mao's people, like John Birch.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.560]  70 years ago, these folks' grandparents
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560]  ran there.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.560]  They're now there.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.560]  They're secretly arresting people.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.560]  China has a client government in,
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.560]  now in Hong Kong.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.560]  They built a bridge to invade the biggest in the world.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560]  And they're saying that they're already
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560]  disappearing people.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560]  They're trying to pass a lot of disappeared people.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560]  And now they're saying they're getting ready to declare
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560]  martial law.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560]  So they're waving American flags.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560]  They're taking over government buildings peacefully.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560]  And now they're threatening martial law.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560]  And I agree with them that
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.560]  the Communist Party of China
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.560]  is not going to be able to survive a new giant
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560]  Tiananmen Square, the countries of powder keg.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.560]  What do you think?
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.560]  It's amazing what's going on over there.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.560]  I just can't believe it.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560]  I think they're secretly or watching
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.560]  what Trump is doing over here.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.560]  I'm glad we finally have somebody
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.560]  in the office that has some big brass balls.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.560]  And shows an example around the world.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560]  I want you to finish up, Daniel.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.560]  We'll come back to more calls. Stay there, Daniel.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.560]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560]  Everyone is telling me now how much
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.560]  healthier I look and I'm telling everyone
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.560]  how much healthier I feel.

[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.560]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold pics

[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560]  used to manufacture dozens of

[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.560]  consult with financial professionals before purchasing
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560]  not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.560]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news

[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.560]  silver skin cream.

[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.560]  Robert Barnes, what does big tech
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.560]  become? A big tech are big babies
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.560]  that have become big bullies and the way they did
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560]  so is because they face no consequence
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560]  of social, economic, political or legal
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.560]  for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.560]  Because of that, that's why the courts, the judges,
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.560]  the juries, the members of the independent free
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.560]  press that care about this, the ordinary
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.560]  members of the public and the audience that care about
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.560]  this has to bring real social, political,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.560]  economic consequence to their course of
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.560]  conduct. Otherwise they will never change
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.560]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs,
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.560]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560]  century who ran American politics and ran
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560]  American economy almost into the ground
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560]  until we were able to recover after the Great
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560]  Depression. The inforwars audience is the fuel
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.560]  that flames the light of liberty
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560]  to make real the actions of independent free
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.560]  speech, to make real the original
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.560]  promise of an independent free press.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.560]  Real collusion is big tech and big media
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.560]  manipulating and working with each other
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.560]  shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.560]  of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.560]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.560]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:06.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.560]  It's demonized because it's exposing
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.560]  the traders in our government and corporations
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.560]  merged with the Chinese communists
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.560]  and basically defeated this country
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.560]  until America woke up and elected
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.560]  Trump. Whatever you do, don't visit
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560]  infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.560]  Whatever you do, don't share the videos
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.560]  and the articles to submit to Hillary
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.560]  and the globalist. Of course
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.560]  I'm being sarcastic. I got a lot of other news
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560]  I want to hit. We're continuing with your phone calls
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560]  right now on
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560]  the treason of China.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.560]  That is the treason of people working
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.560]  with China in our government, in our
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.560]  corporations, in our media
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.560]  and openly coming out in the Washington
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.560]  Post, CNN, you name it and saying,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.560]  jeez, good, Trump's bad. Thank God, jeez,
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.560]  standing up to that monster Trump
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.560]  when all they have is these internal
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.560]  tariffs and systems against us
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.560]  and are absolutely shellacking
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.560]  us up one side and
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.560]  down the other.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.560]  So going back to Daniel
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.560]  I've even seen some right-wing or fake
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.560]  libertarian pushback in the comments on infowars.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.560]  Oh!
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.560]  You've got all your reporters over there supporting a war,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.560]  supporting
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.560]  strife in Hong Kong.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.560]  No, that's where the free people in China ran
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.560]  after we saved them from the Japanese in World War II
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.560]  and now the communists came in
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.560]  and chased them into there and they have a right
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.560]  to want to be independent and not under an
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560]  unelected system that secretly
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.560]  arrests people and kills them. I mean, I can't help
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  but support them. That's a real independence
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.560]  movement.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.560]  It's like funding the Arab Spring and overthrowing
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.560]  governments that are
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560]  leaving Christians alone and putting ISIS in.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.560]  I did not support those regime changes.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.560]  So to me it's a no-brainer
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.560]  and yeah, the Briggs is a great example.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.560]  Putin is a great example of nationalism
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.560]  against the globalist.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.560]  Trump's the biggest example. Now you've got
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.560]  the president down in Brazil.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.560]  It's incredible
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.560]  what's happening. It's an amazing time
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.560]  to be alive ladies and gentlemen
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.560]  and we're all part of it but we're seeing
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.560]  the globalists try to bully us back in the
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.560]  submission. Some other points you wanted to add
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.560]  about Trump being a great example Daniel, why do
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.560]  you support the folks? They don't want independence.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.560]  They just want to not be secretly arrested
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.560]  not have face-scanning cameras
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.560]  and not have a Chinese communist social score
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.560]  where if they don't support the party, they
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.560]  suddenly can't get on a train or an airplane.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.560]  I mean, we better be doing what the folks in
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.560]  Hong Kong are doing right now. There's the same
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.560]  systems coming in here.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.560]  Yeah, they just want to live a peaceful life
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.560]  with love in it.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.560]  I've got a couple things to say here.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.560]  The bravado of
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.560]  Trump is freaking awesome.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.560]  I know he's typing everything out
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.560]  but bring on the freaking
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.560]  Storm Trump.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.560]  And all the
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.560]  Dems, they're just sharding in their pants
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.560]  right now. They are
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560]  just infuriated that
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560]  Trump is there and he's not playing
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.560]  that old game anymore.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.560]  It's just incredible.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.560]  I cheer up listening to
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.560]  Trump and what he's saying sometimes.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.560]  Oh, he's definitely, look, they've been trying
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560]  to demoralize us. Hollywood, the Chi-Coms.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.560]  This is a demoralization tactic
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.560]  of a foreign military. We are under
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.560]  foreign globalist attack. That's what it is
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.560]  cut and dry. That's what they're saying.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560]  You shouldn't even have a nation. We shouldn't have
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.560]  borders. Why Trump's saying we should love
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.560]  our country's white supremacist.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.560]  This is literal
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.560]  foreign military garbage. Thank you for the call.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.560]  And it just
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.560]  rages me that more Democrats
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.560]  don't wake up and say no to this.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.560]  But see, once they get them hating Trump
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560]  they will then hate everything.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.560]  Once they take that poison
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.560]  pill, it's like putting a cyanide
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.560]  tablet in a big chunk of beef
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.560]  and giving it to a dog.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.560]  The dog's going to slurp it down and die.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.560]  And once the Democrats decide
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.560]  to believe whatever they're told by the media
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.560]  they actually believe we're Russian agents.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.560]  They actually believe
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.560]  that Trump's a Nazi
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.560]  and they're siding
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.560]  with the chai cops.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.560]  I mean, that's mind control.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.560]  All right, who's been holding longest now?
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560]  That would be
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560]  that would be John in Georgia.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.560]  John, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.560]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.560]  It's an honor to be on here with you.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.560]  Honored to talk to you, sir.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.560]  Yeah, just want to tell you that
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.560]  I have been
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.560]  a suspect of bomber number two in
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.560]  Oklahoma building. I could talk to you about that
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.560]  as well.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560]  But I want to tell you an experience I had
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.560]  Do you have your phones breaking up a little?
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560]  Just talk right in the receiver.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560]  Okay. I'd gotten Lyme disease
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.560]  from a tick.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.560]  I took the cordial silver. I doubled up
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.560]  on the doses and
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.560]  totally cleared up the Lyme disease.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.560]  I wanted to share that with you. Wow, that's incredible
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.560]  because antibiotics can hardly knock it out.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.560]  Well, I took the antibiotics
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560]  for a long time and pain went
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.560]  from my knees all the way into my back
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.560]  and elbows.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  But the cordial silver completely
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.560]  wiped it out. I hadn't had an episode yet.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.560]  Well, that's beautiful, brother.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.560]  My question to you
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.560]  is, you know, we know
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.560]  that the track columns are in every facet
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.560]  of our society.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.560]  They're in the media.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.560]  They're in our telecommunications.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.560]  They're in the government.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.560]  Nancy Pelosi had her
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560]  driver house.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560]  It was dying fine.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.560]  They all, as part of getting
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.560]  the Chai Con money through U.S. companies,
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  you put an agent in your office
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.560]  and that's why Obama literally
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.560]  gave them the Office of Personnel Management
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  hack. I mean, so you're absolutely right.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560]  So, knowing
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  that they're in all these areas
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.560]  and facets, how can
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.560]  we even hope to think that we can
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560]  fight the Chinese
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560]  off the continent if we can't even take care
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.560]  of it in the continent? Well, that's why
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.560]  getting Trump in as a beachhead,
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560]  literally like a king
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560]  surrounded, you know, a lion surrounded by hyenas
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560]  and so he's able
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.560]  with the executive power under the Constitution
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.560]  to give those orders and that's why
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.560]  they're so upset and fighting him so hard
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560]  is because a lot of their people are
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.560]  still staying behind. Now,
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.560]  as the Chai Con money gets cut off,
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.560]  they're starting to panic even more
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.560]  trying to get the Chai Coms back in power
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  and it's not just the Chai Coms.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.560]  It's the globalist that parlayed
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.560]  U.S. power to the Chai Coms
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.560]  and then basically
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.560]  collapsed a lot of our power
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.560]  in the last few years of Obama
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.560]  and then since they saw Trump got in,
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.560]  they tried to even finish that but it hasn't worked.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.560]  So, we've really grabbed victory
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.560]  from the jaws of defeat on this
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560]  but we're not out of the woods yet but you're right.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  It is, listen, George Washington
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560]  and I'm not saying to this
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.560]  but George Washington when he was president
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560]  they would just go arrest these people
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  and then they would have trials
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.560]  and you know what they would do
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.560]  if they were in agents would also just be grabbed
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560]  and would be given trials
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.560]  and then they'd be executed
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.560]  and that's really what you do.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.560]  I mean, in China or anywhere else,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.560]  they've caught U.S. spies and they executed them
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560]  with the Office of Personnel Management Act.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  Obama said, listen, I'm really for you.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.560]  I really hate America.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.560]  Here's all of our agents worldwide.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.560]  Here's all their social security numbers.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.560]  Here's all the government employees' numbers.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  Here's the keys to everything
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.560]  and they gave China that
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.560]  code keys to all your devices
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560]  and China basically
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.560]  is now interfaced with YouTube and Google
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560]  not just Southern Property Law Center
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.560]  and they're the ones in your accounts.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.560]  I mean, this is all admitted.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.560]  So yeah, Trump really needs
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560]  to just
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560]  declare an actual emergency
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.560]  and seize control of telecommunications
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.560]  because the Chinese have already seized it with the globalists
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.560]  and so only a response like that
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560]  will fix it and that's why they're so scared
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.560]  that any minute he might actually
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.560]  make the default proper move.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.560]  Now, I respect the president.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  If he thinks he can remove this face sucker
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.560]  by cutting the money off the Chai comms
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.560]  and making them negotiate
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.560]  and stop their attempted takeover,
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.560]  that's probably better.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.560]  The problem is
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560]  they haven't showed any inclination of stopping.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560]  They have a real disrespect for us
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.560]  that they were able to buy off most of the public universities.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.560]  That they were able to get the Washington Post
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.560]  to say, side with China against Trump.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.560]  They have a real disrespect
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.560]  for us and see us as weak and decadent.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.560]  And a large part of us are.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  A large part of us aren't.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.560]  And so they've really misread America
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.560]  like Hitler and the Japanese
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.560]  and others did before.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]  And so great points. Anything else, John?
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.560]  Yeah, one of my main concerns
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.560]  is, too, is that there's so much
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560]  Chinese tech floating around in America.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560]  We knew that in desert
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.560]  storms, I mean the...
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.560]  Hold on, I'm going to have you finish. I apologize. Just a little bit more.

[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.560]  I buy so much in the store because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.560]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.560]  And I'm getting quality products. The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.560]  I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.560]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.560]  My son used to get these little sore throats
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.560]  and he puts X2 in water and drinks it
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.560]  and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560]  Well sir, let me break this down for you.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.560]  I want high quality stuff in there. I want a good price.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560]  But I've kind of habituated everybody
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560]  to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.560]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.560]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.560]  or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.560]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.560]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.560]  a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.560]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.560]  then we're doing 50% off
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.560]  and if you do something like that
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.560]  where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.560]  But that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.560]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.560]  They are technocrats.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.560]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.560]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560]  and make your own decisions
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.560]  gets to the way of their great destiny
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560]  to merge with AI gods.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.560]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.560]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.560]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.560]  to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.560]  is our bodies.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.560]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.560]  from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.560]  That's why we decided to
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.560]  take our original secret 12
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.560]  that was incredibly high quality
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.560]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.560]  of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.560]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.560]  the strongest, highest quality B12
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.560]  over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.560]  It is amazing.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.560]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.560]  for yourself and fund the second American Revolution
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.560]  against the tyrants

[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.560] .
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:38.560] .
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560]  As the caller, John, was saying
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.560]  we're going to finish up with him
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.560]  and go to Caitlin Bennet in the Moirier calls.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.560]  as John was saying in
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.560]  my segment even back during
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.560]  Desert Shield Desert Storm
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:59.760]  1990, 1991, it came out that I'm going from memory, like 25% of the defense chips and
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:05.040]  missiles and avionics and other systems were CHICOM made and had back doors for them built
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.680]  in where they could get into them. Well, now that's all admitted. And when you realize
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.440]  that something like 90% of our drugs, I saw this number a few years ago and couldn't believe
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:22.520]  it, but it's upwards of 90% of the drugs in this country are made in China. Then they
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:29.560]  make the illegal fentanyl and ship it in in mass. And it's something like 100 times stronger
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:36.480]  produced in heroin. They just received massive tonnage of it last week coming in through
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:47.080]  the land corridor into Mexico into the US. And it's just it's just huge. When you start
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:53.000]  thinking about the level of treason, the Confucian institutes that took over all the major universities
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.160]  with hundreds of millions of dollars per school in some cases like UT over $100 million the
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:04.440]  last 10 years or so was given to UT. And I was told about this by the feds and people
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.840]  I know five years ago, this year they shut down the funding to UT saying was run by a
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:14.600]  Chinese general. They caught SMU being run by it. I mean, this is just in Texas in my
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.480]  local newspapers. So when we talk about this, folks, we're not just hyping this. When they
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:30.080]  say Russia is involved, that is a joke. The CHICOMs are dominating and the callers are
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.680]  rightfully saying why doesn't Trump just arrest him or whatever? What it'll do to the stock
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:41.640]  market? What it'll do? It'll be a disaster. But not as big as a disaster as if we let
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.480]  them keep doing this. So Trump has totally taken the gloves off. He's ordered the US
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:52.160]  government to tell US companies to move out of China as fast as they can. And you bet
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:59.400]  it's a disruption. More than 70% of the stuff made in the world's made in China now. It's
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:08.360]  a joke of consumer goods. And that's the position the globalists put us in. And they've totally
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.160]  abused us and they have nothing but arrogance towards us. So that's the position we're
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.640]  in. And I just marvel at all these people still betting against America with China.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:23.520]  It's going to be a big deal. But the biggest is Apple giving the code keys early last year,
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:29.560]  in Reuters, to all of the Apple IDs. And Apple said, well, when you headquarter in China,
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.880]  that's what you do. The Chinese government is in control of all Apple products. They
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:39.400]  can get right into your phone any time they want. Google's over there with them. And finally,
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.120]  Marco Rubio's talking about it. So when Marco Rubio, I talked to him last year, he made fun
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.520]  of me. He said, get out of my face when I politely brought it up. Well, now when the
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:55.200]  Feringi ambassador is finally talking about something, then you know it's about to hit.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.440]  So we're in a full war. Trump's being calm and polite about it. But we are in a war,
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.560]  not just a trade war. Finishing up with John in Georgia, you had some other points to make
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.560]  about that.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:14.240]  Yeah, exactly what you just say. And my main concern is that China is so in depth in control
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.200]  of a lot of tech in the United States. You'd even mentioned on a few shows ago about the
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.840]  Batman scenario where they could actually map out and see things through the telecom.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:32.120]  So now that China has Apple and Huawei, we call them in every facet. They've been called.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:40.200]  They haven't hit nothing. My concern is the awesome power that they now have to be able
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:49.400]  to listen to our phones, map out things and get any information they want at any time.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.040]  Military bases. Just think of soldiers that have these phones on military bases or in
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.040]  secret places.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.640]  Well, you just said I should have led the show with that. They're banning Huawei phones
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.760]  a couple of years ago and now Huawei 5G because they notice the Chai comms are putting it in
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.160]  for those that don't know at cost in rural communities. But then the Pentagon two years
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:12.360]  ago went, wait a minute, they're putting them in only in rural communities right by military
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:19.920]  bases, particularly up in Iowa at the sack base and other areas like that. So absolutely.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.280]  And so Trump has to block it. He has to arrest the head of the company. I mean, we've got
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:30.600]  to take the gloves off and Trump's doing it and they need to take control of Apple and
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.600]  all the space.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.400]  Well, that was my next point is, and I forgot to make it. Thank you for reminding me. Apple
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.800]  is a bigger threat than Huawei. Apple is doing exactly what Huawei is. Apple has merged with
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  the Chai comms. Great point.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.120]  Yeah, that's that's all I have. I appreciate it.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.080]  Well, I interrupted you. Go ahead and make your point. You're just you just be so excited
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.680]  to like you just there's so many points we know and I can't even lay them all out. You're
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.240]  just reminding me. It's insane. We could sit here for 10 days talking about Chinese infiltration.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.960]  Right. When you put them all together, though, just think of the awesome power that they
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:11.120]  now control. You have Google. You have Facebook. All these companies are aligned with China.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.960]  Apple. Not only that, not only the small tech that we don't even talk about the computers
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:24.520]  chips and the technologies and refrigerators, car, everything. Everything we have, Trump
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.960]  at some point has a piece of it.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.880]  And just think of the awesome power when you take all that technology and put it to the
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.320]  computer and you want information, you're going to get it.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.560]  Absolutely. God bless you. Well, that's why Google announced it two years ago. We're not
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.240]  working with the Pentagon or the US government anymore. We are moving to China to work on
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:52.400]  their deep mind and we're going to give them all the AI. China has been chosen because
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.600]  they'll have clones. They'll have killing of Christians, killing of Buddhists. They are
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.280]  totally evil and the globalists are totally evil. So it is a match made in hell. Now we're
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.960]  going to go to break and for 15 minutes to the next hour, Caitlin Bennett is going to
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:10.320]  join us and we'll continue with calls as well. And there's also a central Texas gun shop
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.480]  owner and gun trainer, a good friend of mine, Michael Cargill has been on the show many
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.040]  times over the years. He's all over the news now because right by where his really nice
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:25.080]  offices are in South Austin, there are homeless camps set up. There's homeless camps set up
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.880]  around where we're at in our area of Austin. And so you want to know about San Francisco
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:38.480]  or you want to know about all these places? The mayor admits that they are trying to collapse
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.680]  the society so that we quote, take care of the poor. Now they're just advertising drug
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:51.000]  addicts and others coming into the cities, coming into the areas and just lounging around.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.280]  The video they were about to show we'll get to later is almost got shooting up heroin
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.400]  on his company's porch and then pooping. And that's what they do. They shoot the heroin,
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.600]  they pass out, they crap all over the place. And when you go on Skid Row, you see people
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.400]  everywhere just covered in feces, covered in flies, having sex. It's, it's, it's, it's
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.240]  quite a sight. I'm not trying to be grossier, folks, but you think you've seen Hellraiser?
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.680]  You think you've seen horror movies? It's nothing on Skid Row. Imagine Tranny's having
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.920]  sex in piles of feces with flies all over them. Yes, I've seen it. I've smelled it,
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:29.680]  ladies and gentlemen. And I began getting to vomit. And we started walking fast and
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:35.160]  we ended up running with Katie Hopkins running. I've never run from a fight, but I did run
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:41.040]  from the shriveled Tranny's with, with a period. Well, I'm not going to give you more descriptions,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:48.600]  but it was about 100 degrees. And it was hell on earth. And I must stop there. We're going
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.520]  to break and come back. Sorry. I'm going back to that horrible nightmare place.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:57.840]  Caitlyn Bennett, of course, is the Penn State gun girl. She's gotten famous the last two
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.360]  years. She just goes out and does good, sweet interviews that are smart. And they threaten
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:05.600]  to rape her. They threaten to kill her. They threaten to attack her. They do attack her.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  The left does. But who would ever know that Dan Crenshaw, also known as the gay pirate,
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.280]  but nothing against the fact that he's a gay pirate. That's the nickname the girls have
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:23.280]  for him here in the office. Dan Crenshaw, the Navy SEAL, who is for gun control and
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.360]  who basically, you know, Texans, he lost his primary at first, thought that he was a Democrat,
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.080]  the stuff he checked off on. But the left's attacked him. And we don't agree with the left
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.680]  saying they want to kill him. So I think the young Turks are trying to prop him up, though.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:41.240]  But old Dan Crenshaw doesn't just talk about red flag laws. He still wants them. And by
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.440]  golly, he believes without any judicial stuff or even any threats that your gun should be
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  taken. Oh, he sends some really mean messages to him in a minute. And we'll talk more about
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.440]  that, not just that when we come back. Stay with us. We're not going to just dwell on
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:43:04.920]  the gay pirate. It's just heavy, heavy, heavy. Make no mistake. It's, we're not in Kansas
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:14.920]  anymore. We're not in Kansas anymore. If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.560]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam, because it's a form

[01:30:35.980 --> 01:47:51.240]  Everything's going to be all right. As long as we take action or a cable
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.940]  to the left in a minute, I'll continue your phone calls. I see some on red flag laws as
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:02.860]  well. A lot of listeners actually got mad at me when I came out and I said, listen, Trump's
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:06.800]  not going to actually do the red flag laws. This is a tactic to get the left to come out
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.560]  and say they want total gun bans. Then they get nothing. But I said Trump still play with
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:21.280]  fire. I don't like it because it gives lip service to the lie that extra judicial confiscation
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.160]  of guns without due process without somebody breaking along is exactly what they've done
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.080]  in Europe and everywhere else and it will lead to total confiscation. Well, Dan Crenshaw
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.520]  went further and he put out his red flag ideas. He said, well, we're just talking about a
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.560]  family member that's concerned or a police officer. You mean a police officer that swears
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:44.640]  out a report that you threatened to kill somebody? Yeah, then take them until we find out what
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:53.480]  you're planning to do. That's already on the books. 42 times the crazed shooter last February
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.440]  last year in Florida Parkland said he was going to kill people. He's known as a school
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.480]  shooter. He'd been kicked out of school under a leftist law. They passed that minorities
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.520]  could commit crimes four times and not go to jail for it. Many cases. Mr. Cruz was allowed
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.440]  to do that. He also threatened the FBI twice when they came to see him said I'll kill you.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.960]  He walked around saying I'm going to kill you. Why did he have guns? He wasn't even legal
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:20.960]  for him to have them. And every other time it's the same. You have this anti for shooter
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.320]  in Ohio. This other guy in Texas was they just changed his social media. So Dan Crenshaw.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:28.960]  Hey, great. You went over and fought in the Middle East. Wonderful. Lost your eyeball.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.800]  I don't agree with the young Turks. Hasan pecker or picker, whatever his name is saying,
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.400]  you want you know that you deserve to die or whatever. But we don't need to compromise
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.960]  on the Second Amendment. The Democrats say it's not about sensible gun laws. It's about
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:47.920]  taking our guns. And that's how the Revolutionary War started 1776. They didn't say, oh, at
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.000]  Bunker Hill, well, some crazy guy might get a gun someday and hurt somebody. So you got
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  to turn yours in. They said, we're coming to conquer you. We're taking your guns. So
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.760]  Danny boy, you ought to go join the Democratic Party and be honest about what you're doing.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:06.520]  Now, I don't want to spend time on him because he's not that important. Um, you know, I know
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:09.600]  Saturday Night Live attacked him and that's what made him popular. And he probably would
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.000]  have got elected for that. Sometimes I think the left's making these statements against
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.360]  him to prop him up because it made him get elected when he was losing. And it's the same
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.520]  thing with the young Turks saying they want to, you know, kill him or whatever. And that
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:26.120]  makes him popular. I think we've got a Trojan horse here on our hands. A lot of Texans think
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:31.800]  that too. But that doesn't matter. The guy is now a pirate that wants to board us and
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.480]  take our guns. Now people say, well, that aren't you mad at Trump? Well, you know, Trump
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.080]  shelved it. Crenshaw still pushing it. And I don't want to be enemies of Crenshaw. Maybe
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:44.680]  he's a good guy. Okay. But other than the I patch mystique, uh, you know, we've got
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.120]  a problem here. I don't want to spend all the time. I want to get into your concerns
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:52.080]  about red flag laws and Trump, Caitlin, because that's really who's important as President
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.680]  Trump. But, uh, obviously you did a video about this. It's on your web page. We'll put
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:01.120]  on screen a Liberty Hangout. Tell folks that URL and you did a nice 20 minute video that
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:05.680]  breaks it down, but specifically he ridiculed you. He used psychological warfare tactics
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.920]  to tell you you were small and nobody and never responded to your very, very nice link.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.640]  The, uh, messages when he first contacted you. So he thinks clearly he's smarter than
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:20.880]  everybody else. Yeah, you think he's some intellectual genius over here. Uh, what he
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.440]  failed to really do is sit there and tell me I will protect your rights. I'll make sure
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.840]  no one is able to hurt you and you're able to defend yourself. You could tell that he
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:36.600]  was so bothered by a little girl going out there and making a meme about him. Uh, all
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:40.920]  you wanted to do was criticize my activism, the way I do my reporting. And that's fine.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.520]  That doesn't bother me. I don't, Dan Crenshaw wasn't going to hurt my feelings, but what
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:51.160]  even if I were like the worst person in the world, that has nothing to do with his position
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:55.800]  in power to be able to take my rights away from me. And all I was looking for was to
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:01.920]  convince him that his ideas of Republican red flag laws are no different than the last.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:07.240]  That's like saying that democratic socialism is the same or different than socialism.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.880]  And let's not forget, we don't have time to go through it all. I want you to give people
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.160]  your URL and also the name of the video that's gone viral because I mean you, you show it
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:19.040]  and you read the whole thing. His messages to you private messages on Twitter. He says,
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:24.320]  Oh, we saw the bad thing you did at the burning event. You go in politely sit there and they
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.480]  throw you out and he makes fun of you and goes, Oh, look, you're a victim. Your first
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:34.080]  amendment. This guy sounds like a punk ass. Yeah. So he just wanted to insult me and the
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.080]  title of the video is just Dan Crenshaw messaged me and that's at Liberty Hangout on our YouTube
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.800]  and I break it all down. I go through and I wasn't going to release the messages at
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:46.800]  first because I wanted to be respectful even though he wasn't respectful towards me. But
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:51.560]  the more I read it, I was like, what the heck people deserve to know what he's doing. So
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:55.880]  he kept trying to beat me into being rude to him. He kept trying to beat me into insulting
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:00.560]  him or making fun of him because when he first messaged me, I just wanted to be like, okay,
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.640]  like you're stupid. You're a grown man. Like not only is he a Congress member, he's a grown
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:11.760]  man upset at a little girl tweeting about him. So he's kind of a soy boy if I'm being
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.320]  honest and Texans aren't going to reelect him. So I'm not too worried about his position
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.960]  and power because he barely won, but he lost his primary barely won when they did a runoff
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:28.080]  election. So I don't think that he's going to get reelected. And if I have anything to
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:32.240]  do with that, I'll take that with a badge of honor. Well, folks, you go to libertyhangout.org
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.000]  and find all your powerful videos. They should bookmark it. They should share it. I watched
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.040]  it this weekend, but for memories, we can put it up on screen. What's the name of your
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:45.400]  Dan Crenshaw videos? The folks can find it. This is Dan Crenshaw messaged me. That's
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:50.600]  right. It's on info wars.com and news wars.com Dan Crenshaw message conservative. Put that
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:54.280]  back up for me real quick. Guys, I'd really appreciate that the info or story. Thank you.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:58.360]  Dan Crenshaw message conservative reporter. What the Congressman reached out to info wars
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.960]  Caitlin Bennett. And again, it took you 20 minutes to read all the messages back and
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.960]  forth, but people really ought to go hear it because it sounds like some frat boy or
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.640]  something. And I don't mean a cool frat guy. I mean, like the bad guy in the frat because
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:18.840]  he he can tell he's using psychological warfare on you, but it's very amateurish. It's it's
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.520]  very, very trying to ridicule you, trying to make fun of you. And that's why would he
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:29.480]  even spend his time doing that? This is weird. Well, what I say in what I told him and people
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:34.200]  will see that if they watch the whole 20 minute video is that the fact that he felt the need
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:40.040]  to message me shows that he's bothered enough to know that what he's doing is wrong. And
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:44.760]  I feel like he's so deep into the rabbit hole of supporting red flag laws that when he gets
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:51.200]  called out, he has to try to insult somebody to like, maybe I guess silence them. I don't
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.920]  know if he was trying to silence me or if he was just trying to make me feel bad for
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.120]  calling him a rhino. I don't know, but what he doesn't understand is I've been through
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.440]  so much. I get ridiculed so much from the right. It doesn't bother me anymore. I know
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:08.200]  who I am. Exactly. We're going to continue with you in the next hour and we'll let you
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:11.640]  make these points and take some calls on red flag laws. But listen, you're an eloquent,
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:14.840]  smart, great lady. We're so honored to have you working with Info Wars. You've gone through
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:20.000]  so much, you know, de-platforming harassment and you've stood the test of time. So we wish
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.560]  he as a Navy SEAL big, strong, you know, tough guy, we wish he'd come here and defend that
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.440]  most precious of amendments, the Second Amendment and not ridicule you for your first inside
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:34.680]  with Bernie Sanders. I think that's the big bombshell. But let me say this as we go to
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:38.200]  break and we'll come back with you. I don't know why he's called the gay pirate online.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.240]  It's okay if he's gay. I think he's got a family and he's from Houston, a multi-generational
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.480]  Texan. That's great. But you know, he's known as the gay pirate. He's known as the, you
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.040]  know, the gun confiscator, the anti-gun pirate. But really the name that sticks with me that
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:58.240]  he's been called is McCain 2.0. He needs to come out, say he's wrong, come out for the
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:04.360]  Second Amendment, McCain 2.0. We do not need Dan Crenshaw to do this and to be the new
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.600]  John McCain. We're going to come right back to you, Kate, one minute and just a moment.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:12.320]  Please don't forget. Only way we get the word out, only way we stay on air is you financially
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.760]  buying the products. You are our sponsor. You keep us on air. And we have two of the
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.920]  biggest sales ever on specific items, only 10 days left because that's how long we can
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:27.600]  do it at the sale. 50% off DNA Force Plus, the amazing, best product we've got overall.

[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:50.600]  90-count deal of carnivore. That cost us $17 a bottle, the enzyme that dissolves the meat
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:56.000]  in your gut, in your intestines. It's so good. It's the next level. Beyond probiotics, just
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.800]  like Myco ZX is beyond probiotics as it hits the yeast, the candida, the mold that's in
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.560]  your gut. Probiotics just create good bacteria and displace the bad ones. They're critical.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:13.320]  But carnivore is the digestive enzyme, a 90-count free. It costs us $17 a bottle, folks. That's

[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.840]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.240]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.040]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today, the Communist
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.720]  Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago, and we've seen massive increases
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.800]  in polls to support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.600]  put pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied, and
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:20.480]  we aren't going to back down. So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.560]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:30.040]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and

[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:15.840]  Alright, after Caitlin Bennett leaves us, I promise we'll get to Rex and Adam and Josh
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:16.840]  and Ben and Robert and Chad. If you can't hold, I understand. It's great. We have 20-something
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:19.240]  phone lines, social bags. I already took like 10 calls. But I want to continue with your
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:23.440]  calls. But we've got Caitlin Bennett on us right now. We've got Mr. Cargill popping in
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.160]  as well. Let's talk about the homeless problem and how the Democrats do about design. And
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:32.120]  we've got Mark, who's a police officer, wants to talk about red flag laws and we'll do that
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:35.400]  with Caitlin Bennett in the next segment. But Caitlin, again, I don't like attacking
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:40.760]  Dan Crenshaw. We're barely keeping Texas red. But what's the use of having Republicans
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:45.680]  if they act like Democrats? And so a lot of people got pissed at me when I didn't attack
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:51.160]  Crenshaw a few weeks ago when he was out there, you know, playing kissy face with all the
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:57.720]  Democrats being praised all over CNN, MSNBC. Because I knew Trump was manipulating him.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:01.160]  I still don't like playing politics. I don't like it. But I told you Trump would shelve
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:04.600]  it. I know you're still mildly angry at Trump. You have that right. And I think it was people
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:08.360]  being mad that made you know, Trump at the final equation back off even quicker. But
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.000]  Crenshaw is still out there flogging this dead horse. And so that tells me he's pretty
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  bad.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.080]  Well, what I didn't know before I made this video, and I did some research about him and
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.160]  I found out all these things. He actually met with mom's demand action, which is a gun
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:28.160]  control group back in February. And he told me, I think one of the most damning things
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.200]  about the messages was that he told me he's been thinking about this for years. He's been
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:38.840]  thinking about red flag laws and gun control and implementing them for years. So what's
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:44.640]  the use? Like you said, oh my gosh, I'm only interrupting because it's so key when you read
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:49.480]  all the transcripts. She got back and forth like 10 times or whatever. He said, Oh, I've
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.800]  been supporting this for years. This is my policy. But then he told everybody he wasn't
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.440]  for it during the campaign. So he's a damn liar. Oh yeah, he's probably a closet bagger.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.520]  I don't think he's been here six generations. We'll find out. Yeah, well, he was actually
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:10.160]  born, I think in Sweden, I think, but he had born to American parents. So I don't really
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:16.760]  know the whole story with that. But it's just really, really upsetting seeing how the Democrats
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:22.240]  are so passionate about gun control and confiscating firearms and taking them from us. We need
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:27.520]  someone on the right that's just as passionate about the opposite about keeping firearms in
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:33.360]  the hands of people. So I think as right wingers, as conservatives, as Trump supporters, we
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.400]  have to call it out. And I'm not attacking Dan Crenshaw. I'm not doing that. And that's
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:42.920]  why I kept it very polite in my messages. I wanted to go, you know, my usual aggressive
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:48.720]  self and just tell him that he's ridiculous. He's a soy boy. He's acting like a child. But
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.800]  I kept it cool and I was hoping to change his mind. And I didn't. One thing that the
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:03:00.360]  Democrats have is that when they get backlash for something, they might apologize or just
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.520]  ignore it entirely. He's not doing anything. He is doubling down. He is attacking people
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.680]  who he needs on his side. He even said it in the messages. If you go to the video and
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:14.880]  watch it, and I really encourage everybody to do that's 20 minutes, but seriously go
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:20.200]  and watch it. He tells me he attacks me for not supporting him. And he even says I reached
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.720]  out to a lot of influencers on social media because he knows we're mad at him. We don't
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:30.520]  support this. So he has to try to alienate us, make us feel bad so that we change your
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:35.120]  mind so that we don't get attacked by Dan Crenshaw. He's not that scared. He's not that
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:39.800]  scary. He doesn't scare me. He doesn't intimidate me. I know what I believe in. And shame on
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:45.520]  him, honestly, for trying to attack my personality instead of my ideas.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.440]  Well, you're right. I mean, I've read the big transcript. It's in your video. It's posted
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.080]  under the article. People need to really see it at libertyhangout.org. And like Matt Drudge
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:01.160]  said, he was here in studio almost four years ago. Everybody has to build their own sites
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:05.320]  again. We have to surf the web again. We have to build our own internal systems, our own
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:10.000]  audio, our own video. InfoWars has done that. We're going to start having more contributors
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.120]  that are able to access our systems to back up their videos. We can't have it open to
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.440]  the public or they'll go post child porn or whatever to try to shut us down. But we are
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.320]  going to have contributors that are able to double down unlike Crenshaw for the Second
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:27.840]  Amendment and post audio and video to our site for people that are members. We're going
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.440]  to announce this soon so that people have a home where they know what they put up will
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.920]  not be erased or removed. We're going to take some calls on this subject with Taitlin Bennett
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.080]  straight ahead. You got to go watch your video. It's long. She reads through it all. She devastates
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:47.000]  every argument. And she shows that Dan Crenshaw will show you the photos of video. They already
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.280]  showed him literally at gun control conferences. I mean, this guy is working for the other
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:55.560]  side, unfortunately.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.480]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:04.000]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.840]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:12.560]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent of
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:17.760]  all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.040]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:26.160]  at the beginning of the country. They actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.600]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.640]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.160]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the persons
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:43.080]  allowed to have or express or hear. And the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:47.480]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.160]  freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:06:08.800]  lawfare and libel targeting youth. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:17.000]  worldwide it's Alex Jones. Well we need every pro second amendment congressman we've got
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:22.200]  this fight to restore the republic. First amendment's under attack, second amendment's under attack.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:27.440]  And I sat not on the fence but I wasn't too loud about it. When Trump came out and said
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:31.600]  okay I don't like mentally ill people getting guns. We've got to stop them getting it. Maybe
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.720]  some of these red flag laws would be good. Well then he learned what was in the red flag
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:40.760]  laws and how unpopular it was. And Trump shelved it and said we're not going to do that. He
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:45.760]  said because it wouldn't do anything. All these people said they're going to kill people.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.760]  First I'm getting the guns illegally. I've already gone over that. 40 plus times that
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:56.000]  the lunatic cook that shot all those people in Parkland, Florida last year. 40 plus times
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.120]  the police were called saying he's going to kill people. He'd walk around saying I'm coming
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.160]  to school to kill you. He committed all these crimes and was let go by a liberal law they
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:08.000]  passed where you can commit all these crimes and not go to jail if you're a quota minority.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.840]  Cruz wasn't even Hispanic but he was adopted by Hispanics who both had died recently. It's
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:19.000]  a very suspicious story. The point is is that this wouldn't protect us. But people got mad
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.960]  at Trump and rightfully so. But he's backed off on that on a few chinks in Trump's armor.
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:31.200]  But Dan Crenshaw is still doubling down putting on all the sale he can to get that boat going
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:37.640]  as fast as he can. And the last straw for me was watching Caitlyn Bennett's piece on
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:43.200]  infoworks.com this weekend where he sends her a mean message. She goes back and forth.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.600]  He tries to belittle her and then we learn he's hanging out with gun control groups.
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:53.160]  And once no due process, your guns are taken. Caitlyn marks the police officer in Texas.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.480]  He wants to comment on this. But other points you haven't had a chance to make before I
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:02.640]  go to him. I would just say please watch the video, share the links, everything like that.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:05.440]  Yeah, let's go to the police officer. I'm really interested to hear what he has to
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:09.360]  say. Well, listen, Caitlyn do this. Tell people your Twitter retweet it right after
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:13.240]  you're off in a few minutes so people can find it easier there. We'll also repost it
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:17.640]  because we're not trying to hurt Crenshaw. He's hurting us. He's coming for the rights
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:25.400]  that our veterans going back to 1776 fought for. And when he does that any good work he's
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:30.120]  ever done for this country, he betrays Benedict Arnold was one of our greatest generals. Of
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:32.800]  course, he'd been a double agent the last three years of the war because he thought
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.840]  the British were going to win. We almost lost the war because of him. So now he's the worst
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:41.520]  of traders and we have to stop going along with this. Let these rhinos know. Oh, by the
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.480]  way, briefly tell folks we'll go to the police officer. What originally triggered him? It
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:51.760]  was a photo of him with a plastic rhino. Yeah, so I was in Boston in Quincy Market and I
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.160]  took a photo with a fake rhino that's decorated with, you know, stars and stripes. And I was
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:01.360]  like, look, I'm with Dan Crenshaw. I only got like 1000 likes, but he was so bothered
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:06.320]  by it that he had to start messaging me saying, Oh, you don't care about me. You don't care
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:11.120]  about the right. You, you just want to alienate people. And I'm like, if that's what you get
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:16.400]  out of that, then fine. I'm trying to criticize your actions and your policies, but he just
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:17.400]  but hurt.
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:24.480]  Well, it shows that he's really afraid. Again, the last straw for me and we'll go to call
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:29.080]  us. In fact, you have the transcript there, but he said, Oh, look at you at the Bernie
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.720]  Sanders thing. Oh, you poor little victim. You weren't a victim. You went in there to
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.600]  cover what he was doing. They threw you out. The police said it was wrong. It was a public
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.840]  venue. It was a school auditorium. And then Crenshaw is making fun of your first amendment.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:46.360]  So I mean, this guy's got a real problem. I mean, he has a serious problem with trying
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:52.320]  to go after people who are trying to criticize ideas. What is really funny about him mentioning
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:56.560]  me about the Bernie Sanders thing is that he's trying to say I had a victimhood mentality
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:01.320]  during that when I did it. And if he would have answered my first message when I asked
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.880]  him to share the video, he would have seen it and he would have actually talked to me
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:09.160]  about it, but he's calling me a victim saying that I'm playing the victim card. That video
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:13.800]  was months ago and that's what he chooses to try and come after me for. So I think there's
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.880]  a lot of insults and belittlement that he's trying to get thrown at me and trying. I think
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.680]  he was trying to bait me into being mean to him. So maybe he was trying to demoralize
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:27.600]  you like the chicoms are trying to do to America, but it's not going to work. Let's go to Mark
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.160]  in Texas, a police officer wants to comment on red flag laws. The police officers I've
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:36.040]  talked to say it's unconstitutional, plus it wouldn't have ever saved anybody with these
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:39.520]  mass shootings. People are always getting warned. The laws are on the books. You're
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:43.680]  saying you're going to kill somebody. We can have your guns taken if it's a credible threat.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:48.400]  But what about what this will do to police turning you guys into an army of gun confiscating
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.360]  Gestapo? That doesn't sound like a very safe profession.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:59.080]  Well, God bless him for worse. We have a Facebook page Town Hall for Crenshaw. It's Town Hall
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:03.440]  for Crenshaw. We are bringing him back to the district September the 7th at 9 a.m. at
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:09.120]  Crosby Church so he can come explain his tax act and red flag laws. We're not happy in
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:15.360]  the district. We're volunteers. We work really hard for him and we want some answers here.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:22.360]  Well, please tell us tell us how you work for him and why you're upset. Well, as a matter
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:28.000]  of fact, my buddy and my and myself, we got a fundraiser together for him brought in a
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.120]  lot of money. We've worked the polls. We walked the neighborhoods talked to people and we did
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:38.320]  a lot of good work for him and a lot of hard work for him. And now we're getting slapped
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.720]  with this. We love our country. We love our constitution. We love our second amendment
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:48.480]  and we're not going to tolerate that. Uh, I would also like to say to, uh, Taitlin that
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:55.680]  I saw the video and I appreciate your style of activism very much. Uh, you, they continue
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:03.960]  the mission and stay strong out there. Alex has changed my life. Y'all rock. And also
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:10.440]  before, uh, yo, let me go. Uh, I have body armor for your, uh, reporters so you could
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.560]  send you back to the screener and I'll be happy to give it to y'all if you would like
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:16.560]  to have it. Well, you're very nice to say that, sir, but I don't want to, I don't want
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:19.920]  to put you through any experience. I mean, in fact, the reporters want body armor. We
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:22.920]  should probably buy it for him. It's kind of not at that point, but we'll do that. But
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.920]  you sound like a pretty level headed smart police officer. Why are you against red flag
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.400]  laws just because they're unconstitutional? Plus look at all the cases. There's almost
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.480]  never been a case where extra judicial taking guns with almost every case. These guys are
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.280]  telling everyone I'm going to kill everybody. I love Satan. I'm going to go kill people
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:45.480]  and then they're not being arrested. Right? Well, we do find I find it unconstitutional
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:53.080]  and this tax act is a grant to have a local law enforcement do what the feds want. Uh,
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:58.560]  these people are our friends and neighbors. I don't want to go collect their guns. And
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:04.080]  I'm a police officer. I'm not a psychiatrist. What are they thinking and expand on expand
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.240]  on how his particular red flag law from what I've seen is one of the worst, uh, about how
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:14.920]  it federalizes you explain that because you're an expert on that. Well, it is a grant and
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.440]  I do work in an area where there are grants. Grants are driven by stats. Want that grant
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.940]  money? You better produce very dangerous, especially when you start talking about our
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:31.200]  constitutional right. You're saying as they're putting a bounty on gun complication extra
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.320]  judicially where just because a crazy neighbor or I mean, or leftist or ever says, Oh, I
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.080]  saw his guns. They scare me. I see that all the time in California. Bloomberg reported
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:45.200]  last year. That's their model. If someone's uncomfortable, I see the case all the time
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:49.520]  where an old guy's cleaning guns in his garage and the neighbor thinks they're illegal and
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:55.040]  calls the SWAT team. Well, Alex, I've been reading the bill and for me, the scariest
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.720]  part of the bill is that it's so vague. It's simply creating the framework for a new entity
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.680]  that's going to do this, but it doesn't say what they're looking for. How it's going to
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:10.840]  operate. It's just showing that the director of Homeland Security or Secretary of Homeland
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.680]  Security is going to be in charge of this. Now, can you imagine if Janet the Poletano
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:22.480]  was our director of Homeland Security again? You know, Islam was not our big threat. Those
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.600]  are veterans returning home. So maybe if these if this past best pass under President Trump,
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:32.640]  we may be okay for a while. But who knows if we ever get President Warren or President
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.920]  Sanders, where's this beast going to go? You're absolutely right. And I'll say this, I will
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.120]  not support President Trump if he actually gets behind any of these bills. I mean, if
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:46.240]  he says, oh, we need to have stronger enforcement of the background check or something like
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:50.120]  that, where all the time the people have been in mental institutions, like the Texas shooter
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:53.760]  at the church last year, he'd been in a mental institution, he'd been adjudicated, not be
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.400]  able to own guns, had a disorderly discharge or a bad discharge from the military dishonorables
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:05.520]  the word, and he shouldn't have been able to own guns. And the Pentagon, the Air Force,
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.480]  never put his name in the database. So if Trump had some funding to have a better database
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:14.360]  or something to stop mentally ill people, that'd be fine with me, but not psychiatrists,
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:19.040]  psychologists, just random people wave a magic wand. They're the same ones saying Trump's
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:25.240]  crazy. God bless you, Mark. Great points. Caitlin, we're out of time. Thank you so much.

[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:01.920]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:05.720]  you go back five, six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:08.640]  and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:12.120]  the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:15.880]  good and instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:18.600]  shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:22.000]  great they are and how wonderful they work. And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.200]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:32.680]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.240]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:40.720]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:44.240]  it and do different things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.840]  mother nature, but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:55.320]  or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:14.760]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:20.720]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:26.880]  system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:33.200]  be empty in three days. Having storeable foods and the ability to purify water will give

[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:07.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:25.480]  All right, Alex Jones here back live with us for two segments. Then if you want to stay
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:29.800]  on hold callers. I love you to death. I'll get to you in the segment after that the segment
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:35.320]  after that tomorrow in the fourth hour. We're going to have reporters who were embedded with
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:40.800]  the Hong Kong resistance who just got back. They are going to be hosting the fourth hour
[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:47.080]  Savannah Hernandez and of course Greg Reese and others. So look for that tomorrow in the
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:51.920]  fourth hour. A lot of other surprise guests and things that are coming up here throughout
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:58.040]  the week. Now Michael Cargill is a veteran. He's a entrepreneur. He's got a very successful
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:04.680]  gun shop and firearms training Institute and he's who I got my concealed carry through
[02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:08.520]  as well. And he's a frequent guest. I mean he's probably in the last seven, eight years
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:11.920]  been in here a hundred times. He's always welcome. He just tells us when he wants to
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:16.640]  come on and he comes on. But I called him today and he came right over not just because
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.400]  he keeps exposing the homeless crisis that the mayor admits they're making worse to
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:24.400]  quote get more funding which then brings more homeless, which then gets more funding. Literal
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:28.920]  heroin heads everywhere, crapping all over the street. He video taped it. So I'll tell
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:32.640]  you when to turn away. That's coming up next segment. But I wanted to get him on about the
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:38.480]  red flag laws and a focus on how dangerous they are and how bad they are. What Trump
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:42.520]  was being told is it's just more funding for people that we know are mentally ill to be
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:45.320]  able to take guns when they're threatened to kill people. Well Trump's like we already
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:50.120]  have that on the books. That's why he said and shelved it last week. Still it's frightening.
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:55.280]  He would look at that. I agree. But but but but Dan Crenshaw, he's been pushing the worst
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:22:00.700]  forms of it and won't stop. So I'm really upset to learn that we've got a Democrat in
[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:04.520]  Republican clothing. I don't want to go off on a jag against him. But what is your take
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:09.240]  on the red flag fiasco? We, you know, Alex, we already have laws on the books right now,
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:13.920]  you know, and you really can't legislate crazy. You know, so we can't create new laws that
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:18.000]  are going to, you know, stop someone from doing something they really want to do. This
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:24.120]  guy, you know, that we're talking about drove from what Dallas, Texas to El Paso, you know,
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:28.960]  10 hours to actually kill random people. So you have someone that's dead set on doing
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.160]  something like this. There's there are no new laws that we can come up with. What you
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:37.640]  can do is say, hey, you know, if you the mother, the father who was a counselor noticed something
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:41.040]  was wrong with their son, they should have got him some help. You know, but it's not
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:46.080]  up up to us, you know, to actually do something about that before you remove your microphone
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.920]  every little bit is cutting out. Sure, you're making great points. Well, look at Ohio, the
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:53.560]  guy was a devil worshipping Antifa. And the guy in Texas was an Antifa. They just erased
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:57.640]  his pages and put up that he was a right winger. I'm really worried that Antifa is staging
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:01.200]  these events to get our guns. I mean, the guy in Ohio admitted it.
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:06.200]  Yeah, and very dangerous people. What we need to do is I suggest everyone, you know, you
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:10.120]  go out there, you train up, you arm yourself, you get yourself prepared and you get yourself
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:14.640]  ready because there are people that are dead set and Tifa, wherever they are dead set on
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:18.960]  committing just carnage around this nation. And it's really up to us to make sure that
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.520]  we're prepared to handle that we could take care of our families, we can take care of
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:26.680]  ourselves and that we stay trained and stay armed. Michael Cargill of Central Texas Gun
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:31.560]  Works dot com, a veteran, an entrepreneur and a person teaching the Second Amendment. You
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:35.240]  know, the left tries to indoctrinate our children. The way to defend the Second Amendment,
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:40.880]  I believe is to exercise it properly, inform others and train others and really bring them
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:44.920]  out of the slavery of not being able to defend yourself. Absolutely. You know, and I try
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:48.600]  to do that for my, you know, my students. I try to release the change from their wrists
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:52.000]  and from their ankles and free them and say, Hey, you know, here's the knowledge, here's
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.360]  the power, go out there and do great things and be great citizens of this country.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:01.280]  Let's talk about Crenshaw because everybody was calling me, including a lot of military
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:04.080]  people that I'm friends with saying, go after Crenshaw. After Crenshaw, I wasn't really
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:10.360]  paying attention. Then I saw that he's been supporting all sorts of stuff and I don't want
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:17.040]  to make him a target politically. I just want him to get back with, you know, the law and
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.040]  find Jesus, basically.
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:23.920]  Yeah. You know, Dan Crenshaw, he's gone off the path right now. I don't know what's going
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.760]  on with him, you know, where he's getting off on, you know, talking about red flag
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:34.040]  laws and all this little tangent that he's on. But he needs to remember his base, remember
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:40.200]  that the people that sent him to DC sent him there for a reason and that is, you know,
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.520]  Texans want to be, we love our firearms. We love our second amendment. We love, you know,
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:49.960]  praising the Lord and past the ammunition. We do not need a U.S. Congressman telling
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:53.640]  us, you know, that you're going to walk into our homes and take our guns because that's
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.200]  not going to happen here in Texas. That's not going to stand in the United States.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  We're just not going to put up for any of that stuff.
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:03.560]  And it's because people know guns, they know their rights and they're dug in. If we knew
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:07.080]  all our other rights and we're dug in, the system would never be able to take our other
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:08.080]  rights.
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:11.240]  Absolutely. And it's important that you, you know, educate yourself on all the different
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:16.720]  laws. Understand our Constitution. Understand how we got to where we are today. Learn history
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.720]  and all that stuff. And Alex, you know all this stuff, you know, because like in Austin,
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:26.040]  we're talking about like the homeless and all that stuff. I mean, they literally, someone,
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:30.280]  it started way back in like the fifties where they went into the asylums and actually shut
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.360]  them down. And now we have people that are just living amongst us that are just, you
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:35.600]  know, crazy and just losing it.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.720]  I think that's about half of it. And the rest is they'll give them a city check and a federal
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:44.800]  check and come out with vans and cater to them a couple of times a week, giving them
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.360]  free goodies. They put it all into heroin, all into meth, all into alcohol and all around
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:52.560]  my office, all around your office. It used to be nice areas. They're just people lounging
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:56.360]  around in easy chairs, shooting heroin up. You'll drive by. They're just crapping right
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.160]  in the street in front of you. Your kids are like, Daddy, what's that? And they're just
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.400]  like monstrous, you know, mean, gross drug addicts.
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:07.960]  And I don't want to come off as someone that's, you know, being heartless and, and picking
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:12.400]  on the homeless, you know, but we're talking lawlessness. You know, it's, yeah, a person
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:17.400]  has a right to, you should have a right to, to live, you know, and, and not be responsible
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.160]  person if you don't want to, but take care of yourself. That that's all fine.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:25.640]  I mean, I mean, like you said, half of them mentally ill, but, but the rest are just absolutely
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.680]  out of control drug addicts, lawlessness, just complete lawlessness. And we're just,
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:32.960]  we're just going to have to take some tough love because we have people that are, you
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:36.960]  know, being sent here from other states. They bust them here. Yes. From other cities.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.560]  And they're saying, Hey, you know what, we don't want them. And the mayor knows that.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.080]  I'm sure. Did you hear the mayor when he was on the CalBJ about a month ago and he said,
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.320]  I'm making the law where they can camp in your front yard. That's the law. Except for
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.480]  the city council. I'm not joking about hypocrisy. So that we get more money and fix the problem.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:55.400]  That's just going to bring more of them here. Absolutely. They're, they're, and they're
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:59.120]  coming. Yeah. We're seeing this every single day. You go down to the bus station, they're
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.800]  rolling in and no one's doing anything. We've got to reverse what the city of Austin has
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:09.400]  done because as goes the city of Austin, we'll go to every other city in this state and every
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:14.600]  other city and state in this nation. And again, folks, they can on the sidewalk in front of
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:18.800]  your house because before the cops would stop them in neighborhoods. Well, now they want
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:22.320]  to be in your neighborhood, folks. When we come back, we'll show the video. This is your
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.200]  nice facility. They're out there. We're not gonna show the video yet. Describe what you
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.160]  just catch on daily basis. It's sad. It's, it's, you know, I have, you know, customers
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:34.840]  coming in, customers leaving and they're, you know, witnessing this stuff. And it's
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:38.560]  just really sad. It's something that we really shouldn't have to put up with. But this is
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.240]  where we are. You know, this is the, the place that we made. This is the state of Texas that
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.680]  we're, you're turning into. We have people that are moving here from California, moving
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.280]  from Washington state, from Oregon, and they're bringing those ideas with them. And, and we've
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:56.520]  got to do something. We've got to push back and say, you know what, this has got to stop
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:02.600]  this complete lawlessness, just lounging around, doing nothing, not being productive to society
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.000]  and just committing crime, stealing, and it's got to stop.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.040]  Richard Linkletter back in the nineties made the famous film, Slacker, but it's not an
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:15.480]  owner's manual. And again, we shouldn't pay for people's sex changes and we shouldn't
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.760]  pay for homeless to just lay around and inject heroin all day. We're going to come back and
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.360]  play this video, but describe it in one video you got on the news. He's inject heroin and
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:25.200]  this is what they do. Then he craps all over the place.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.880]  Oh, he's defecating and he's, he's actually trying to shoot up all at the same time, all
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.240]  in one stride, not even breathing, just shooting up and crapping all in the same place, literally
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.320]  turning the city of Austin into a liberal shithole.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:41.320]  We'll delay that, but Austin, folks, it's a formula. The Democrats do it everywhere. It's
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.160]  a plan. It's a plan. We'll explain how to stop it on the other side, throw their dirty
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.920]  asses out. That includes the homeless that are criminals and the mayor of Austin, the
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:54.080]  chief criminal amongst them.
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.200]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.440]  backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:07.360]  important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here, I want to tell you about a huge sale
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:12.200]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.800]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:20.800]  flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:24.800]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:28.480]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:32.040]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:37.680]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:48.280]  of bonuses too. And the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or $500 or even 200.

[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:18.560]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:32.160]  We're back broadcasting worldwide right now. There's 10 days left to buy. Supermetal
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:40.320]  Vitality at 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, and get a free bottle of Carnivore 30 for
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:45.240]  absolutely free. And by the way, call the crew across the street because I did this
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:52.040]  special myself. It's 50% off, not 25% off. So anybody that's already ordered will honor
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.920]  it 50 and change that for you. So because I was here last night getting these special
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:04.840]  set up. So 10 days left to buy. Supermetal Vitality at 50% off and get Carnivore 30 absolutely
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:13.920]  free with all these great enzymes that are in it. And it's 50% off DNA force plus the
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.680]  amazing Neutropic, the amazing system that's good for energy, your mitochondrial DNA, the
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:27.480]  PQQ, the CoQ10, all of it, ladies and gentlemen at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com is
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:32.120]  one of our best specials ever. And again, we've got the Myco ZX that goes in and knocks
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:36.840]  out the candida, the mold, the yeast and the gut. Normal probiotics are great. They're
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:40.320]  good bacteria that displace the bad ones. That's only part of the equation. They've
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.320]  got the mold, the yeast and all the rest of it. That's so bad nowadays that knocks it
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.600]  out. Then you add something like the carnivore that's got this really powerful enzyme in
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:54.560]  it that helps dissolve the protein and the fat in your stomach, in your guts. And it
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:35:00.640]  is the trifecta together. It's a great product or 17 plus dollars of product in the carnivore
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:05.640]  bottle. So this is almost a loss leader with 50% off DNA force plus. But they may have
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:10.640]  just had 25% off this because maybe it loses money because, I mean, I told them what to
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:14.560]  do a couple of days ago in last night in the meetings about our new pitch and I saw this.
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:17.840]  Maybe we'll keep it at that. I don't know. Maybe it's losing money because this costs
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:24.120]  us like almost $8 for the carnivore 30. This costs us 17, 80 something for the carnivore
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:28.000]  of 90. This is a great product and I want you to see how amazing it is. So I'm giving
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:33.080]  you a free bottle of it because of all the probiotic type stuff out there. This isn't
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:38.000]  just the best. It's an area that most people don't supplement in and it's one of the most
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.800]  dramatic. So take advantage of those huge sales at infoorstore.com for a very limited
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.480]  time because we only have a couple thousand bottles of each to be part of this sale.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:52.480]  We've got to keep the rest back because a lot of this isn't coming in for 10 weeks.
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:55.640]  Done talking about that. Now we're going to just roll this video in the background while
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:59.880]  you speak about it. It's gross so a lot of folks won't want to watch it but we're documenting
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:05.400]  what's going on for radio listeners. Describe just daily. A couple years ago I bought a
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.880]  lot of guns at your place or been over there taking classes from you. Never saw homeless.
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:13.800]  Now whether you're in North Austin, whether you're in Westlake, whether you're in South
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:18.400]  Austin, nice areas, bad areas, they're just homeless encampments everywhere encroaching
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.800]  now even at the businesses.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:26.760]  Yeah. And I'm not trying to talk bad about the homeless itself. I'm really focused on
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.160]  the lawlessness that we're seeing here and you're absolutely correct. We're seeing this
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:38.600]  everywhere and it was not like this over a year ago but now it's just terrible. I walk
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:44.160]  outside my door and literally I'm standing here, I'm looking at this guy. This guy is
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:52.160]  doing the number two and he's shooting it up at the same time. Literally right by my
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:56.520]  front door where my customers are coming in and going out. And this is a very busy
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:03.040]  area. There's a transit station, a bus station right next door to us. We have people that
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:07.720]  are going in to get acupuncture done. We have people going in to get physical therapy. A
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:10.480]  lot of stuff is going on. It's a very heavy traffic area.
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:11.480]  There's a restaurant.
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:16.040]  Yeah, a restaurant there as well. And that's what you see when you're walking across the
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:22.240]  parking lot. You see someone who's defecating and shooting up all at the same time right
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:24.200]  in front of your face in broad daylight.
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.720]  And let's be clear that some are mentally ill. We should take care of them. The churches,
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:31.880]  the system used to do that. There's a lot more mental illness now though because of
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:35.560]  all the corruption in drugs. That's causing mental illness. Weaponized marijuana is causing
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.280]  massive schizophrenia increases. But a lot of them are just piratical, rude. Like the
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.840]  drag rats are a gang of mainly white kids that have around at least 20 years that beat
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  up and rob people down on the UT drag and the police aren't able to do anything about
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.440]  it. So a lot of these are violent gangs as well.
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:56.280]  What's funny about it is the University of Texas is pushing back. You have the UT police
[02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:59.880]  chief just released a statement today. He's saying, hey, you know, something needs to
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:03.520]  be done. This is actually pretty funny because you have the progressive Democrats that are
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:06.560]  pushing against the correct progressive Democrats.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.560]  That's incredible.
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:11.560]  Yeah, the University of Texas, they're saying, hey, it's too much for them. And they're
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:14.860]  the ones that say, you know, bring us your poor, bring us everything, you know, we can
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:19.800]  handle it. We're very, we're the progressive liberals here and it's too much for the University
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:20.800]  of Texas.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:24.640]  Well, it even made the newspaper, as you know, we put it up on screen earlier when the mayor
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:30.040]  went on local talk radio and said, I did this to show you the homeless problem, so that
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:33.880]  we get more funding, but he's inviting them here from all over the country. The end game
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:39.320]  is the city services all this, the city gets money to take care of the homeless and then
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:43.960]  city council members, family members and folks run the groups that skim money off the top,
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:46.880]  the drug dealer selling the drugs. I mean, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:53.320]  Yeah, you have ladies that are being raped on a weekly basis in this town. Sexual assault
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:58.920]  is happening in our crimes exploding. Yes, in our parks. And they're just you know, encampments
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.520]  are growing in the parks. And that's the place that it wasn't supposed to be. He said, you're
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.200]  not going to be able to do this on at City Hall property. You're not going to be able
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:10.280]  to do this also in the parks, but that's not what's happening. We're seeing this happening
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:15.120]  right now. Law enforcement is not doing anything about it. And you have kids that are scared.
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:19.080]  You have the little girls, little boys that are scared to go to school to walk to school.
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:24.640]  It's just not safe for them anymore. Well, I went to Seattle last year, early last year
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:31.040]  and we were staying at a four star hotel, not a nice area town. There were crack pipes
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:35.480]  and needles right outside when you walked out with my children. And then when I would
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:41.080]  try to go places, there was feces all over the place and homeless, encampments everywhere.
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.280]  And they're on heroin that the chikoms are shipping in. And that's really what it is.
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.760]  Heroin epidemic. And I don't even know what to say to that. That's just that's sad, you
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.360]  know, because you're talking needles. You have to bypass my goodness. That is not something
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:00.360]  that's supposed to happen. And we've got Democrats leaving California and Oregon and
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:06.240]  places to come here, but they bring their culture with them. Yes. Yes, exactly. And
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:09.960]  we don't want that in Texas. This is Texas, the Lone Star State. We don't want that. You
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:14.800]  know, don't we? We don't want to be a lone poop state. Why do you think every blue city
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:19.640]  is infested with rats, feces and needles and getting worse? It's the leadership, the leadership
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:24.600]  that people are voting into those cities. You have is happening in Dallas, in El Paso,
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.440]  San Antonio. That leadership is allowing this type of behavior to happen. And let's be clear.
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.720]  Almost every city in Texas is blue now. Yeah. Almost every major city, your large cities
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:39.840]  except your, you know, out in West Texas, East Texas, your smaller towns, they're remaining
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.360]  red and strong and they don't have these issues. And once the Democrats get control of a city,
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:49.160]  you never go red again because they engage in election fraud. Absolutely. They take charge
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:53.640]  and then we've lost it forever. You know, they're very close by the next election. The one after
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:58.000]  that winning Texas and all these good old boys won't go out and warn people won't rally
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.880]  them to vote. It'll never happen. Texas, California was as right wing as we were 30 years ago.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.760]  You need to wake up and wake up now and smell the coffee. Because if you don't, you know,
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:09.960]  we're going to lose, you're going to lose the second amendment. You're going to have
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.280]  red flag laws in the state of Texas. You know, and I never thought in a million years I would
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:19.200]  be talking about having a red flag law, talking about universal background checks. But that's
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:22.920]  all you're hearing now. I'm hearing this coming from the governor's office. I'm hearing this
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:30.200]  coming from some of our, you know, so-called Republican elected officials that are in D.C.
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.960]  and they're saying, hey, we need to, you know, let's do universal background checks. I'm
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.800]  like, what are you, what are you talking about universal background checks for? And I want
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.600]  people to understand what does that really mean? When you say universal background checks,
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:46.200]  you're saying that let's say you did something 20, 30 years ago and you've been an outstanding
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  citizen, you paid your debt to society. That means that you're never going to be forgiven
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:57.280]  for that crime. Why send someone to jail? Why make them pay for that debt to society if they're
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:04.160]  not going to get their rights back? I was about to say it's worse than that. The Democrats
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:08.040]  are saying just extra judicially, if somebody thinks you're scary, you'd even make a threat.
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:12.960]  You lose your guns. And then it gets even worse than that. They're talking about these
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:19.600]  red flag laws. Well, take the universal background or the gun show loophole. That means that
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.320]  a father can't give his son a shotgun. That is correct. That's correct. You can't pass
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:29.880]  it down to your father, the son, or, you know, to an uncle or brother or anything like that.
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.480]  You're going to have to walk into a gun store and do a background check first just to give
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.360]  someone a gift. Central Texas gunworks.com. And there's not that many homeless people.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:41.840]  It's not bad there, but it's bad pretty much everywhere now. It's like day of the dead.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:45.440]  If Joe Rogan is crabbed in Los Angeles, it's getting worse. So we're trying to bring attention
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.960]  to the blue city blight. Thank you so much. Central Texas gunworks.com. Michael Cargill.
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.800]  Thanks for coming in, my friend. Absolutely, Alex. Thank you very much for having me. You
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.800]  bet. We'll be back with your call.
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:59.200]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:03.280]  control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:08.360]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.

[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:21.080]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality

[02:45:53.960 --> 02:46:00.880]  Tyler. Yes. I got a plug for the Patriot points. I get $180 so far this year. And I feel like
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:04.560]  I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to give
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:07.040]  that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:10.600]  it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money to you. And they're getting
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:15.360]  quality products. The products that I do receive have changed my life. I mean, the X2 has really
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:19.640]  done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. My kids, they use
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:24.400]  the toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.680]  it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:29.520]  Tyler. Well, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:34.400]  a good price. But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:38.520]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:42.560]  the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when people
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:46.280]  get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:50.280]  already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off. And then
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:53.920]  you do something like that. We have Patriot points. We lose money, but that's okay. Thanks
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:47:06.120]  for the support.
[02:30:41.920 --> 02:47:39.440]  troopers that have been holding since last hour's topic. It's so critical.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.640]  Communist China is down control of Apple. It's control of the iPhones and all the devices
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:46.480]  have been given the code keys publicly.
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:51.160]  Huawei is admittedly spying on us. Trump said no. They're holding Hong Kong hostage threatening
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:55.640]  to invade declare martial law. They've infiltrated the colleges, the government that they have
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:00.880]  back doors and the chips. And the media is siding with China. The Washington Post is
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:05.880]  signing with China. This is a big deal. What do you think about that? Let's see who's been
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:11.040]  holding the longest here. Chad in Washington. Thank you so much for holding. I'm gonna go
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:13.880]  to Josh, Adam and others. Go ahead, Chad.
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.840]  Yeah, a couple points, a lot of me here. First, what I just want to ask you, what do you think
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:24.240]  of the Foxconn factory that's about to open here in the U.S.? I remember you years ago
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:27.880]  always talking about those factories and the suicide nets. And it just sounds like we're
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:32.960]  turning into China slowly. And then I would like to make another point about the Second
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:40.520]  Amendment and Donald Trump and Crenshaw. Everyone is in lockstep right now for gun control.
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:45.160]  There's not really a politician out there against gun control, particularly when we're
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:50.800]  talking red flag laws. And remember, Crenshaw isn't just talking rhetoric. He's a co-author
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:55.960]  of the TAPS Act. He helped write that. And this is what they're gonna be pushing when
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:01.080]  they go back in the session in September, Congress, that is. And I think when it comes
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:05.960]  to the Second Amendment, Trump is a complete failure. He's done more damage than Obama.
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:11.240]  That's now history now. And sadly, truth is stranger than fiction. That's really all I'm
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:15.360]  out with. And I don't think I'm voting at all in 2020.
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.520]  You know, I hear you. Trump's big failing is that he's never been a gun guy. His son's
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:22.280]  told him he's wrong. Nobody used the bump stocks. They're pieces of junk. So they're
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:26.440]  like, oh, let him do that. But it creates the idea that taking guns means we're gonna
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:32.280]  be safer when that's a fraud. And it's one of Trump's biggest failings. He's doing a
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.000]  good job on a lot of other things. I'm glad it's not Hillary, but you're absolutely right.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  Why should we try to appease the Violence Policy Center and million moms for gun confiscation
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:47.640]  and why did Crenshaw, like you say, co-author the really draconian bill that they support?
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:51.960]  You're right. And then separately, we have regulations and things for safer factories
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:57.720]  than China. Foxconn is coming here under pressure from Trump, but they're only giving us one
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:01.120]  out of, I forget how many, but they got a whole bunch of factories. It's like a hundred
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:06.640]  or something in China. And so they're only bringing one to Wisconsin. And so I don't
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:10.640]  see that as us becoming China. I see that as the pressure to bring a lot of jobs back
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.120]  to the US, but you bring up really, really good points. Thank you for the call.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  You know, again, listeners have been really angry about the red flag stuff. And I told
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.560]  you if they pass it or try to pass it, I'll get really mad. I've been told by NRA board
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  members, not one, but two, that have met with Trump that he said, watch, I'll tell them
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.600]  because it's all emotional that, okay, we'll do something. And then they'll ask for everything
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:37.840]  and won't get it. But I just don't think you should play politics like that. And I was
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:41.600]  right. He took, he took it down from pressure. I mean, maybe you're right. Maybe the pressure
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:47.400]  made Trump pull it. Maybe he really wants to take our guns. That's just insane. And
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:51.120]  people are not going to accept it. The first amendment, the second amendment are more important
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:57.720]  than Trump. And remember, he wrote in, he surfed in on a wave of nationalism and populism.
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:05.040]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to who's the holding longest now. That would be Ben in
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:11.880]  Canada. Ben, you're on the air. Welcome. How's it going today? Good, brother. Couple things
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:16.800]  I want to talk to you about. I want to give you a Canadian perspective of the stuff you're
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:22.320]  talking about. Everything you talk about is happening in Canada as far as guns being
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:29.560]  taken away. The drug problem, if you've ever seen Hastings Street in Vancouver, BC, terrible.
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:37.480]  One of the worst streets in North America. And on the topic of Trump, as far as Alberta
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:47.120]  goes, Canada has done a survey on Trump and Alberta leads Canada in Trump support. I just
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:54.640]  want to let you know that. And through our China goes, I support Trump myself on the
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:52:02.440]  China situation. However, Trudeau, we've dealt with China quite a bit in our trade. And as
[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:08.400]  you know, where your farming community is suffering slowly because of China cutting
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:12.560]  your farming off. And we're doing the same thing in Canada. But the first
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:15.640]  Oh, you're right. We're in a war, brother. So people are gonna get hurt. Go ahead.
[02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:24.760]  Oh, we're in a war. We're in a war. And as far as China goes, the first chance Trudeau
[02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:29.840]  gets to start dealing with China again, regardless of what Trump does. And let me say again,
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:35.480]  I support Trump more than any Trudeau, which is sad. But I'm not gonna hate Trump. I just
[02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:42.680]  hate Trudeau. But the first chance Trudeau gets to deal with China again, he will just
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:48.080]  for his own, you know, political gains, you know, just so he can stand power. He doesn't
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:53.720]  really give a crap. I think that's an understatement on Trudeau. Ben, you're awesome. Thanks for
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:58.160]  holding. And thanks for calling from the beautiful country of Canada. Okay, let's go ahead and
[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:02.720]  go next to California and Adam. Adam, thanks for calling. And thanks for holding you're
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:09.320]  on the air. Alex, this is Adam with no more news.org. I've been one of your biggest fans
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:15.200]  for 10 years and perfect topic today to talk about treason in China. Because ever since
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:20.880]  the rise of Trump, I really studied it deep and realized that all the accusations and
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:26.320]  rumors about you being a Zionist, apologist, propagandists are all right. And Trump is
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:33.480]  a completely a Zionist agent, owned by Adelson, a pack, ZOA, bailed out by the Rothschilds
[02:53:33.480 --> 02:53:38.720]  in the early 90s for billions of dollars with Wilbur Roth, who's now our commerce secretary.
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:44.900]  He got the top Zionist award in 1983 from the JNF, the Jewish National Fund, founded
[02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:50.760]  by Theodore Herzl. He's totally controlled by Netanyahu and Kushner. Trump donates to
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:56.560]  Kushner, who is Habad. He donates to Habad. They consider Christianity idolatry. That's
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:03.120]  who that's who Trump supports. And you, blaming everything on China, deflecting from who really
[02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:08.680]  is controlling and conquered this country is treason. George Washington would accuse
[02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:13.320]  you of being a traitor and you should be ashamed of yourself for covering up for who
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:21.880]  really can. Can I can I talk now, Adam? I barely think about Israel and I've seen the
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:26.840]  mental illness of people out there that say that I work for Israel or I get talking points
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:32.120]  from Israel. Israel is again a diverse group of people, different parties, just like the
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:35.960]  West, just like Russia. I've been accused of working for Putin. I've been accused of
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:41.520]  working for the Vatican, Israel. I'm an American. I'm a Texan that believes the Bill of Rights
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:47.120]  and Constitution. I'm trying to create a big tent to bring everybody around Americana and
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:52.000]  stop all the racial and cultural division that the left is using. And I've seen the
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:59.520]  extreme left, like the four horsemen, you know, Tlaib and AOC and, you know, all those
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:07.120]  folks, peanut head from Somalia, whatever name is, all that literally constantly saying
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:12.840]  the same thing that Israel needs to be overthrown, that Israel runs America. And so what you're
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:21.120]  saying is I'm the bad guy and AOC and Tlaib and Omar and other folks and Presley, they're
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.600]  the good guys. That's what you're saying. People have been saying this about dying isn't
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.520]  it? Listen, stop it, stop it for a minute. I answer my question, okay, because I support
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:34.560]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Second Amendment. I want to protect the unborn.
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:41.480]  I'm a Christian and I have experienced the lies and the fetish, the fetish that people
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:48.360]  that obsess on Israel, people that obsess on masons and all this stuff. It's crazy. I'm
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:54.560]  trying to create unity around the Bill of Rights and Constitution and making our sovereignty
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:00.120]  great and believing in our country again. And I mean, China does own our debt, the biggest
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:05.040]  part of it. China has bought up the big production companies. Chai Kong propaganda is everywhere.
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:09.400]  The Washington Post is saying we hope Xi crushes Trump. I mean, that happened at Davos. They
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:15.120]  said Xi will crush Trump. I mean, these are real things. I mean, you're telling me that
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.320]  the Chai comms, that the CFR doesn't say that the Chinese century is here and that America
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.280]  is done and the Economist owned by the Rothschilds. You won't talk about Jews all day. I mean,
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:32.400]  you understand like the Rothschilds tried to unseat Netanyahu. You understand that the
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.100]  Jewry worldwide is not one block. I mean, you've actually read real history books, right? Not
[02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:38.600]  just Nazi books.
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:43.640]  See, you were talking about red flag laws and you say anybody that criticizes Israel
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:45.600]  is mentally ill and you call them.
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.120]  Well, that's not a hold on. That's not a real. I don't believe if someone says they think
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.200]  you're mentally ill, that you should have your guns taken. Now, now that is that is
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:57:01.640]  a ad hominem attack. That is twisted. That is a fraud. You know, now I do not believe
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:04.680]  anybody should have their guns taken. Unless they're saying, I'm going to go kill these
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:08.880]  innocent people. Then that's a terrorist threat. They should be arrested, taken for mental
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:14.560]  evaluation. I'm saying people that fetishize the Vatican running everything, people that
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:18.040]  fetishize Jews running everything, people that fetishize this or that group running
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:19.040]  everything.
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:23.600]  I'm going to hold you over so you can finish up. And I got to be fair to Justin and Josh
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:29.320]  and Rex because we got Mike Adams coming up. This is divide and conquer. If you've got
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.960]  APAC supporting uncontrolled, I've come out against APAC when some of their people supported
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:34.960]  it.
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:39.760]  I go off issues here. Do I not like some of the Israel lobby manipulating the U.S.? Absolutely.
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.760]  I don't want the Chinese lobby either, but you say the Chinese aren't powerful, pure
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:45.760]  crap.
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:52.320]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:58:05.960]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or m4wars.com.
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:11.680]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President, we need your
[02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:15.960]  help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:22.440]  They saw m4wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:28.600]  populist organization. So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:32.920]  say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:37.840]  Their way to fight back is to support m4wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:41.840]  of freedom and free speech. Understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:45.480]  take everybody else down.

[02:59:48.040 --> 02:59:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:58.040 --> 03:00:08.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:08.040 --> 03:00:14.280]  I'm going to jam in a few final calls here. My guidance is taking over. But sometimes
[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:19.080]  I go into YouTube and I type in Alex Jones just to see what videos they're allowing
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:24.040]  on is it's only the negative predominantly and I'm not allowed to respond to a tax. And
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:29.120]  a couple of times I've seen I think this is the same guy video and I saw one just like
[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:34.640]  a week ago or something and it was like five minutes long off a 20 minute rant. I did all
[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:39.960]  edited selectively show that it would make it you know sound like I was just purely
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:44.920]  supporting Israel. And that's called being deceptive and intellectually dishonest and
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:49.520]  I watched it. I didn't feel bad. I'm glad even the negativity will bring people to
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:54.760]  the show to find the truth of what's really being covered here. But that type of intellectual
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:01:00.720]  midgetry is not good. And then I had the producer go oh yeah this guy's been on with
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:09.440]  Owen to debate him. So we have let this guy on the shows before and he can't even like
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:13.920]  a normal person to have a debate. We're all guilty of treason and you know we're we're
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:19.280]  getting orders from the Zionists. Nobody gives me orders. And so you're going to pick
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:23.000]  is it the Russians. Is it the Jews. Is it the Vatican. Is it the you know Masonic clubs
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:27.320]  blah blah blah. Jones admits he's an intelligence agent. He admits he's talked to people in
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:33.360]  government. I know more than the generals that call me up. I mean it's it's a it's a
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:40.920]  mental midgetry. I'm the Maverick. I'm the original. I call the shots. I set this up.
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:47.120]  I believe in freedom. I'm not like other men who only follow the directives of others or
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:54.400]  other people's ideologies. I've rebooted Americana 2.0. I'm not bragging. I am me. See. Here
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:02:03.240]  I am. And so if you watch C-SPAN and you watch Senator Blumenthal whose law firm is trying
[03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:09.200]  to destroy me in just hellish things you can't imagine and the and the ADL coming after me
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:13.600]  none of that means anything to the mental midgets because they don't know the Southern
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:17.840]  probably Law Center and others run them and run their ideology to keep the division going.
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:22.200]  They don't know that Israel's bomb Jewish enclaves to make Jews then go to Israel under
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:26.280]  corrupt regimes in Israel. They don't know I've made films on that. It isn't about real
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:32.080]  mental understanding. It's about the thought of superiority where everyone else is a shill
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:36.600]  of some group. But you you're the truthful one. You're the pure one. You're the one
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:40.880]  that knows you're the trailblazer. You're the Maverick. That's why you can spew attacks
[03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:47.360]  on me all day all day long with all these other thousands of groups and it's monetized
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:53.280]  and pushed on everyone. But I can't be heard because I'm the real one. It's really cares
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:58.520]  about black babies and white babies and Hispanic babies and Christian babies and Jewish babies
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:03.320]  and Muslim babies. I care about humanity. I want a pro human future. And while you're
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:11.320]  obsessing all day on Jews the globalist are you Genesis planning a post human world. That's
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:14.720]  what's really happening while we're divided and conquered. Now I got to go to break and
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:19.280]  I'll take Josh Justin and Rex's calls and I got to move quick as Mike Adams is loaded
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:24.160]  for bear. But you've got a minute and 20 seconds to finish up. Go ahead Israel and
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:28.560]  BB are selling us out to China with the Belt and Road Initiative. And if you care about
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:33.460]  American you're a patriot. You will cover the tech transfer Netanyahu and Paul Singer
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:38.840]  Trump supporter all of the tech ADL Apple Intel factories Ford factories. It's all
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:43.000]  being covered all over Israel that's dominating in cybersecurity. And then you're going to
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:47.120]  say that Epstein is controlled by the chai comms in a video the other day. It's the mega
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:52.720]  group. It's Wexner. It's Bronfman. It's all of these dynast groups connected to Mastod
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:58.960]  connected to mega group connected to birthright. Going back to Roy Cohn. All these things. You
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:03.440]  want to talk about China getting into school. Look at the algae zero. I thought you said
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:09.080]  I'm making it up that China is our big adversary. All you can do is mute people and then and
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:14.560]  then talk forever. Debate me on my show. Give me an hour without muting me any time to try
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:18.960]  to win the debate. I've only found giving you guys attention only makes you live more.
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:23.520]  You're not you're not looking for real discussions. You're looking to be superior. You're looking
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:28.200]  to lie about and misrepresent so you can be the only person that tells the truth. And
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.960]  that's good. Enjoy being on YouTube. I'm banned there because I'm not a chosen one like you.
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:38.080]  You are chosen. David Duke is allowed to operate. You're a chosen one. I'm not a chosen one
[03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:43.360]  like you Adam. I understand you're superior. You're better. Have fun on YouTube. I'm banned
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:55.360]  from there. I'm Alex Jones with the night. Robert Barnes. What does big tech become a
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:58.640]  big tech or big babies that have become big bullies. And the way they did so is because
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:03.080]  they face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities
[03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:07.200]  over two decades. And because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members
[03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:10.720]  of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public and
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:15.000]  the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.080]  to their course of conduct. Otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:22.120]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:26.400]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:31.240]  the Great Depression. The inforce audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty
[03:05:31.240 --> 03:05:35.760]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[03:05:35.760 --> 03:05:40.600]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:44.560]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:48.040]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate
[03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:52.240]  form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just
[03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:53.240]  saw.
[03:05:53.240 --> 03:06:11.200]  Welcome back. My Gathams have taken over here in just a few minutes. At naturalnews.com.
[03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:14.200]  I'm Alex Jones of newswars.com and infowars.com. Take a few of your calls right now. We just
[03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:17.480]  joined us. There was a caller who has a YouTube channel and he was saying that I'm engaged
[03:06:17.480 --> 03:06:22.840]  in treason with the Jews for saying that China is our big adversary. But then he said
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:28.200]  no the Jews run China and then he listed Jewish companies that have been involved in China.
[03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:32.120]  Yeah Israel sold them weapons secrets. You name it a bunch of countries have it. It's
[03:06:32.120 --> 03:06:35.800]  wrong. Our governments are corrupt. Whether it's Israel the U.S. you name it. We're trying
[03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:42.920]  to fix it. But his claim that Trump is working with China to screw us over for the Jews.
[03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:47.840]  Trump has broken China's ribs. Trump is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:55.960]  hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs a year. He's stopping it all. So the Jews
[03:06:55.960 --> 03:07:03.160]  sold us out to China through Trump and now Trump's who just got in office is taking a
[03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:07.680]  baseball back to China's teeth. It's just you heard him floundering around. It was very
[03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:14.960]  very sad. And again I'm not interested in obsessing on Jews. I don't worship Jews like
[03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:20.160]  Adam does. I love God and I love freedom and I love humanity and I want to build a human
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:26.480]  world for us all based on ideas like Martin Luther King said that unify us around a tenant
[03:07:26.480 --> 03:07:33.200]  of ideas. Being good being honorable building good society not killing the unborn not dehumanizing
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:38.720]  ourselves knowing we have a connection to God and the left's creating racial and cultural
[03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:44.320]  division and then ruling over us with it. I reject the left. I reject all the things
[03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:52.360]  they're doing. I reject all their bigotry. And that's what I'm doing. Now is there a
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:59.000]  consortium of very vicious people in Congress and rich and powerful coming after me? Absolutely.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:04.120]  And they're mad that I'm unifying people and that's just the way it is. So it's going to
[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:08.320]  continue to happen. Now this is a powerful video. We've had it up for an hour. I should
[03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:12.720]  have gotten to an hour ago but that's some great guests on video. Biden apparently forgets
[03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:20.480]  Obama's name. Get Daniel's story up on infowars.com and newswars.com. I said it months and months
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:27.960]  and months and months and months ago. I said that Biden's had another stroke. He's slurring
[03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:34.920]  all his words. He'll never make it until the end of the campaign a year plus away a year
[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:39.360]  and three months away. He's never going to make it. He's neurologically just everything's
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.200]  a calf. Everything's marbles in his mouth. And so who's going to come in at the last
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:48.880]  minute? Michelle Obama? Hillary? I know they've been in talks. Told you that a year ago. I
[03:08:48.880 --> 03:08:53.960]  don't make this stuff up. She's basically still on the campaign trail. Nobody's showing
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:09:01.320]  up but their arrogance is incredible. So here's that clip of Biden. Because they invaded another
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:09.840]  country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimean. He's saying that it
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:16.400]  was President, my boss, it was his fault. My boss, he can't even say Obama and the gaffes
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:24.480]  just keep rolling. Let's take a few final calls here. Who's been holding longest? Rex.
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:28.120]  Rex in Texas. 84 year old info warrior. If I'd have read that earlier and I got you on
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:37.120]  first, I apologize. Rex, welcome, sir. Recently, I took a look at your documentary about the
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:46.240]  UN having taken over the national parks and the Presidio. Yes, sir. And how we gave the
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:56.280]  deep water ports in LA, Costco and at China. And then it ended up with you being in Austin,
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:01.320]  refusing to give your thumb print for a driver's license. Yes, sir. That's America destroyed
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:06.960]  by design made that in 1997. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. And you talked today about
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:13.160]  another right or other rights being taken away. Well, you know, they're trying to implement
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:22.600]  the real national real ID act right here in Texas. Very dangerous. Yeah. And when you're
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:28.040]  applying for a driver's license renewal, you have to have a birth certificate or passport.
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:35.040]  But the illegal aliens don't need that. Oh, that's right. That's exactly right. And I
[03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:40.160]  think we really need to push back about that. I'll hardly agree with you. What do you think
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:44.760]  about Trump taking on China? You think he's really doing it? That last caller says Trump's
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:55.120]  basically run by China? No, I think he's taking him on. And I kind of like you. There are
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:11:03.760]  things that I'm questioning. I think he should be a little more forceful about protecting
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:10.080]  the borders and things like that. But he's the best we got right now. And they're sure
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:15.360]  as hell trying to take him out. Rex, God bless you. I appreciate you calling. Ray points.
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.080]  Love that guy's voice. Let's go ahead and talk to Justin in Ohio, Justin, and then Josh.
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:24.680]  Go ahead, Justin. It's a pleasure to talk to you. At least this is the first time I
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:29.600]  actually had the opportunity to talk to you, brother. So there's three different things
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:35.640]  that I wanted to cover. One being with China. The other thing with China and Hong Kong was,
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.120]  you know, how much deep state in the cabal is kind of against Trump? What do you think
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:44.760]  that the chances are that they'll try doing an arm arming the Hong Kong civilians under
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:49.920]  the United States name and then blaming on Trump kind of pushes us into like an armed
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:53.720]  car. That's a great point because there's a lot of martial law in Hong Kong now. Could
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:58.400]  the chai com stage a false flag to make it look like the Hong Kongers are the bad guys?
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:02.800]  That's the exact type of car they may play. Because right now the chai comms pull anything
[03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:07.040]  big or get violent. The New Tiananmen Square word is the whole mainland may collapse because
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:14.640]  they're in a state of rebellion already. Correct. The other points, one was going to be on the
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:21.920]  red flag laws. What do we have? Like 22,000, you know, gun laws. They're already on the
[03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:28.840]  books or maybe more than that. And red flags wouldn't say these people exactly. Exactly.
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:31.960]  So why are we going to put one more on? It's like beating a dead horse and expecting to
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:35.480]  win the race. Well, Trump wants to make it look like, in
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:39.680]  Crenshaw, to the soccer moms, that they're doing something. They're going to vote against
[03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:44.240]  them regardless. Crenshaw is a lightweight. He still thinks big corporate media is powerful.
[03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:48.040]  Believe me, that guy sticks his finger up to which way the wind blows. And then Trump's
[03:12:48.040 --> 03:12:51.960]  listening to advisors saying, sir, you need these women in blue state areas that went
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:55.680]  for you that are purple areas and at least act like you're doing something, sir. No,
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:12:59.240]  we should come out and blame the psychotropic drugs they're on. And the fact of all the
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:04.200]  warnings and make that the issue, that's what we've got to do. Thank you, Justin. Thank
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:08.280]  you so much for holding. These are amazing calls to them. Josh in Washington, you're
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:15.120]  on the air. Go ahead. Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new Info Wars t-shirt
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:20.840]  instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:28.760]  your brain on 5G. Oh, yeah. Showing your brain getting fried. Then I have some ideas
[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:34.760]  for or some comments on your supplements, man. Totally changed my life. I use turbo
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:41.160]  force bodies, alpha power, brain force, the fish oil, ultra 12 daily X2 every several
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:50.680]  days now. And what I found is, is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:56.920]  feeling that I get by combining all your products. And I just want to urge all your listeners
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:02.040]  who haven't tried them. I just want to say why not. Well, you're right that all of these
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:05.960]  things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil
[03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:10.360]  or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ 10 and bio PQQ and all the rest
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:14.520]  of it. All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. People think just
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:19.000]  dumping energy drinks on it will do something. No, if your base isn't there, none of it works.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:23.480]  But you take these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now you can build the
[03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:27.400]  big strong temple. It's not that I'm perfect either. I treat my body really bad. But with
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:31.240]  these products I take when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:35.400]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. So thank you. What was your
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:40.920]  point on Trump taking action? I just want to say to Trump, not to telegraph everything,
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:44.200]  it's like a quarterback letting the defense know where you're about to throw a pass.
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:48.120]  And then the defense picks it off and runs in to the end zone. I wish Trump would just
[03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:53.720]  take legal and lawful action, get things done. Don't let everybody and especially his enemies
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:59.720]  in the media and globalists know exactly what he's going to do. Just do it. You don't have to
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:02.760]  spend all this time on Twitter letting everybody know what you're going to do.
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:08.600]  Trump, just take action legally and lawfully. You're the commander in chief. Get it done.
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:16.440]  And once it's done, it's done. I totally agree with you. I mean, I think Twitter is still very
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:20.840]  useful. You should do more fireside chat stuff like Ross Perot would do showing graphs and things,
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:25.480]  not just his chopper talks, but just don't become Dan Crenshaw. I think that's the moral of the
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:31.000]  story. Thank you so much. God bless you. We got to all the calls today. I probably took like 40 of
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:35.480]  them. Good job to the crew. Good job to everybody. Now, Mike Adams for the next 40 minutes,

[03:17:55.720 --> 03:17:59.960]  Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:04.600]  here out in New York City. And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:09.080]  wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:13.080]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public,
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:17.160]  the approaching 2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:20.600]  presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's
[03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:24.280]  a time to be praying, my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:28.840]  is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love
[03:18:28.840 --> 03:18:32.680]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:38.600]  80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles. And
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:42.680]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're going to
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:46.600]  keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:51.640]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:59.480]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:04.520]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually work for a living
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:08.920]  that would end up saving the nation. And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:14.920]  farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:19.480]  and what he's doing in this trade war. Once China put pressure on our farmers,
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:24.600]  that's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied, and we aren't going to back down. So to
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:29.160]  the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world that want to intimidate people and tell
[03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:34.040]  us to back down, we're never going to give up. And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:39.240]  The human spirit lives at info wars.com and news wars.com. And I'm asking listeners,
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:43.960]  whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light, the dark of the night,
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:47.480]  we are the resistance, we are 1776 worldwide.
[03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:19.720]  All right, Mike Adams, a natural news stepping in here for the remainder of the fourth hour
[03:20:19.720 --> 03:20:26.760]  on the Alex Jones show this day, this what is August 28. Wow, time is flying. It's always great
[03:20:26.760 --> 03:20:32.360]  to be here. And I appreciate your attention to the urgency of the issues that we're now facing.
[03:20:32.360 --> 03:20:36.680]  I've got some bombshell items to share with you over the next couple of segments.
[03:20:36.680 --> 03:20:42.920]  Let's just get right to them. First of all, a big question about is Andrew McCabe going to be
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:48.200]  charged? Is anybody in the deep state going to be charged for the criminal coup attempt
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:54.280]  against President Trump, the illegal surveillance? Is Barack Obama going to be charged or Hillary
[03:20:54.280 --> 03:21:00.280]  Clinton and the corruption of the Clinton family or the Clinton Foundation that took money from
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:07.560]  international sources as a kind of pre-purchased bribery of what she thought would be her presidency
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:13.720]  in the White House? Because the question is, if these people aren't going to be charged, then we
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:20.840]  have a lawless society and we are living under a deep state dictatorship. I mean, we either charge
[03:21:20.840 --> 03:21:26.920]  these criminals for the treason that they committed for the FISA court fraud, for the lying and the
[03:21:26.920 --> 03:21:32.600]  illegal leaking of people like James Comey. We either charge these people or the rule of law
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:37.640]  does not exist in this country. And I hope, and I believe that William Barr understands this, by the
[03:21:37.640 --> 03:21:44.040]  way, and I think that President Trump understands this as well. But we cannot let these criminals
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:49.320]  get away with what they attempted to do. They tried to overthrow the country, they got caught,
[03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:57.160]  they have been stopped, and it's time to charge them, to criminally indict them. Otherwise,
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:22:03.800]  what do we have? Why would any citizen follow any law ever again in this country if the people with
[03:22:03.800 --> 03:22:08.760]  the most power can't even be held accountable for the most malicious crimes carried out against
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:14.120]  this country? So that's the first item. Watch the news to see if Andrew McCabe gets charged
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:20.440]  in the coming days. A second item that's very important. There's a new program that has been
[03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:27.880]  pushed by an organization called the Suzanne Wright Foundation. This is being pushed onto
[03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:34.600]  President Trump as a new form of monitoring the mental illness of people to try to assert red flag
[03:22:34.600 --> 03:22:42.360]  gun control oppression. This program is called HARPA, H-A-R-P-A. And again, it's the Suzanne Wright
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:47.880]  Foundation that is pushing this. What's crucial to understand about this, and I know that I think
[03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:52.040]  it was Troyer covered this the other day as well. But what's important to understand is that this
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:59.800]  program calls for the government to monitor the mental health of all Americans by surveilling you
[03:22:59.800 --> 03:23:06.600]  through all of the tech company devices that you are installing in your home, such as Amazon Echo
[03:23:06.600 --> 03:23:12.600]  or Alexa or the Google Nest devices that have microphones in them, and they listen to everything
[03:23:12.600 --> 03:23:18.440]  that you say in your own home. So by the way, if you are installing any of these devices in your
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:24.520]  home, you're a fool because they're just spy devices. Why would you pay Amazon to install
[03:23:24.520 --> 03:23:30.920]  a spy device in your home? I mean, Amazon actually sells, or at least they did, a video camera that
[03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:36.520]  you're supposed to install in your bedroom to watch you get undressed so that Amazon can make
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:47.160]  recommendations on your wardrobe. Who buys that? What kind of sheeple buys a spy camera from Amazon
[03:23:47.160 --> 03:23:52.120]  and installs it in their bedroom? And I tell you, there are probably millions of people willing to
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:57.240]  do that because, I don't know, they're fluoride damaged, they're lead damaged, they're medicated
[03:23:57.240 --> 03:24:01.800]  to death. They've lost the ability to think for themselves. They don't understand what it means
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:07.400]  to be free or to have privacy. So they're buying these devices from Google and Amazon and other
[03:24:07.400 --> 03:24:13.720]  companies and installing them in their homes. Apple, Apple Siri is always listening to what you
[03:24:13.720 --> 03:24:20.600]  say. I mean, Amazon has been caught monitoring all your private conversations. They have entire
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:26.040]  teams of people that sit there and listen to what you say. They record and archive everything you
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:33.000]  say. It's a spy device in your home. In any case, the push here is to have the government archive
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:39.320]  all of that audio and video, in some cases, from your private home and then to do what they would
[03:24:39.320 --> 03:24:45.720]  do a transcription of what you said. They would convert it into text and then they would use a
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:53.080]  keyword density search algorithm to score the text of what you're saying and to score it for red flag
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:25:00.920]  keywords such as, of course, Alex Jones or AR-15 or whatever keyword they want to put in there.
[03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:07.880]  So if you're talking at home and you say Alex Jones and you say Second Amendment and you say
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:12.600]  President Trump, whatever, you're going to get red flagged and they're going to say that they have
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:19.720]  to take away your guns and that they're using mental illness profiles now to help prevent mass
[03:25:19.720 --> 03:25:27.080]  shootings. That is harpa and that's what's being pushed. Now, fortunately, President Trump so far
[03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:31.560]  has rejected that program. I don't think he will push this, but I just want you to understand that's
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:37.480]  what's being pushed through and it's a very dangerous program. Okay, the next thing, Ruth
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:44.520]  Bader Ginsburg. I've talked to some other doctors about Ginsburg and her condition and based on
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:50.440]  the information that has been publicly released by the U.S. Supreme Court about her, well, it was
[03:25:50.440 --> 03:25:59.560]  a laser ablation tumor removal surgery, a kind of radiotherapy for tumors on her pancreas and
[03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:06.280]  she had a bile duct stent installed as part of that procedure. Well, according to the physicians
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:11.400]  that I've talked to who are very familiar with cancer surgery, this is a very strong indication
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:18.360]  that Ruth Bader Ginsburg probably does not have long to live and I've been told the chances are
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:25.480]  about 90 percent that she will not make it to Christmas of this year. And of course, we're
[03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:32.680]  going to be very saddened to see anybody die of cancer, especially when those of us like my website
[03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:39.000]  Natural News, you know, we promote natural holistic cancer cures, but we are censored
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:44.920]  by Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter. And so even if Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted to have
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:50.360]  access to natural cancer cures, which by the way, I'd be happy to share with her, she would not be
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:56.280]  able to find that information through Google because of the extreme tech censorship. So the tech
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:03.000]  giants are actually killing Ruth Bader Ginsburg by denying her and people like her access to
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:07.480]  natural remedies, natural cures, holistic cancer treatments and so on that could very well save
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:15.320]  her life. In other words, Ruth Bader Ginsburg appears to be going down with the system that she
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:24.680]  helped create this oppressive tyrannical radical left wing system is actually in a sense exacerbating
[03:27:24.680 --> 03:27:29.880]  her own cancer, which is very sad to see. Now the upshot of all of this, you know, as much as I don't
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:34.120]  want to see anybody suffer, pancreatic cancer is a very, very painful type of cancer. You wouldn't
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:39.880]  wish that on your worst enemy. It's very painful to go through that and the prognoses that are out
[03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:47.960]  there for pancreatic cancer, you know, diagnoses are very poor. So but the upshot is that if she
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:54.280]  does pass or whenever she does pass, President Trump is likely to nominate Amy Barrett. So of
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:59.320]  course the left is already anticipating this and they are right now trying to come up with ways
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:03.480]  to smear Amy Barrett. So they're trying to come up with the same kind of smears that they leveled
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:08.920]  against Kavanaugh, where they just completely fabricated all these accusations of rape,
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:14.600]  just they and they they had, you know, actors come forth, all these fake accusations and fake
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:20.440]  memories was just a big theatrical false flag by the media. They're going to do something very
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:27.400]  similar to Amy Barrett. And they are working up plots and plans in order to do that. And the
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:34.280]  entire left wing media will have a coordinated campaign to try to destroy any nominee that
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:40.040]  President Trump puts forward if Ruth Bader Ginsburg passes away during Trump's presidency,
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:44.360]  which looks very likely. So I'll have a lot more straight ahead. We'll be back after this
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:47.720]  break here on the Alex Jones show. Don't go anywhere. Be right back.
[03:28:47.720 --> 03:28:58.280]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs,

[03:29:53.560 --> 03:29:57.720]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going
[03:29:57.720 --> 03:30:01.640]  to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago before all the
[03:30:01.640 --> 03:30:05.400]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the
[03:30:05.400 --> 03:30:09.000]  products are and how they were the best and why they were. And I'd have doctors on an experts
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:12.760]  to explain why they were so good. And instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:16.120]  support us or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because
[03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:19.400]  they know how great they are and how wonderful they work. And the left always has headlines
[03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:25.080]  everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No under federal
[03:30:25.080 --> 03:30:30.680]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no
[03:30:30.680 --> 03:30:34.680]  jurisdiction and won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:39.080]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:42.680]  different things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects not with mother nature,
[03:30:42.680 --> 03:30:48.760]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info or store.com or triple
[03:30:48.760 --> 03:30:56.840]  eight two five three three one three nine. As we witness the most disastrous geological activity
[03:30:56.840 --> 03:31:03.080]  in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for
[03:31:03.080 --> 03:31:11.000]  civil war. Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:17.400]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system
[03:31:17.400 --> 03:31:24.520]  fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores
[03:31:24.520 --> 03:31:31.000]  could be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:36.920]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes

[03:32:57.960 --> 03:33:19.640]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[03:33:22.200 --> 03:33:26.760]  The bombshell story put up by the Wall Street Journal just a few days ago. The title is
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:33.480]  quote Amazon has seated control of its site. The result thousands of banned unsafe or
[03:33:33.480 --> 03:33:41.080]  mislabeled products. Now the Wall Street Journal in its investigation found over 4,100 products for
[03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:48.920]  sale on Amazon.com that were blatantly fraudulent. Many of them violated heavy metals limitations
[03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:53.960]  for supplements or children's health. Many of them violated state law. Many of them had
[03:33:53.960 --> 03:34:00.600]  falsely claimed to be FDA compliant. Many of them were blatantly illegal. They have been products
[03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:07.720]  that were banned by states or the federal government. And this it's extraordinary. The Wall
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:11.640]  Street Journal. This is really a great piece of journalism by the Wall Street Journal. I commend
[03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:17.400]  them for the story. What I find fascinating is that at natural news we had a story I think
[03:34:17.400 --> 03:34:24.200]  three or four days before this that talked about Amazon.com selling a supplement with very high
[03:34:24.200 --> 03:34:28.360]  levels of lead and aluminum. And you don't have to the producers. You don't need to show that on
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:38.440]  the screen. My point here is if you wonder why infowars store is a better place to buy supplements
[03:34:38.440 --> 03:34:44.920]  than Amazon.com. This just underscores it. The Wall Street Journal has just confirmed what we've
[03:34:44.920 --> 03:34:51.000]  been saying at natural news for years which is that Amazon.com is and you can quote me on this.
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:59.720]  Amazon.com is a marketplace of fraud. A marketplace of toxic heavy metals. A marketplace of illegal
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:04.440]  products that even confirmed by the Wall Street Journal products that are banned. They're illegal.
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:10.040]  They're fraudulent with false claims. And yet you know you look at infowarsstore.com in contrast
[03:35:10.040 --> 03:35:17.800]  is fully compliant with all the regulators is incredibly tightly run. The labels are reviewed.
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:22.840]  The ingredients are reviewed. We even do lab testing of many of the infowars products just
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:27.160]  as another layer to check everything and everything's great. Some of the products we've
[03:35:27.160 --> 03:35:33.080]  tested have been just extraordinary. And of course I do that for all my own products as well.
[03:35:33.080 --> 03:35:38.040]  The point is that Amazon.com is a place where you're going to get into heavy metals. You're
[03:35:38.040 --> 03:35:45.400]  going to get into illegal products. And if you want safe supplements or safe superfoods you need
[03:35:45.400 --> 03:35:51.160]  to get them directly from the sources you trust like infowarsstore.com. I mean it's just another big
[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:55.800]  reason to do that. Again proven by the Wall Street Journal and here's something just shocking.
[03:35:56.360 --> 03:36:00.600]  And I'm not going to mention any brand names and guys don't show anything on the screen here.
[03:36:00.600 --> 03:36:07.080]  I don't want you to get dragged into any kind of issue here. But we found a product sold by
[03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:16.120]  Amazon.com that contains basically two ingredients. One of the ingredients is a mined oxidized coal
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:21.480]  and the other ingredient is an industrial fertilizer. And it's put into capsules and
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:29.640]  it's sold to the public. And it is blatantly, outrageously out of any kind of compliance
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:35.560]  with regulations. But it's sold by Amazon.com and it falsely claims to be Prop 65 compliant.
[03:36:35.560 --> 03:36:40.920]  We ran all the tests on that supplement found it's wildly out of compliance has extremely
[03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:46.200]  high levels of lead and aluminum and it's marketed to children. So isn't it interesting
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:52.840]  that the left-wing media never, never goes after Amazon.com. I mean this story by the
[03:36:52.840 --> 03:36:57.800]  Wall Street Journal was a rare exception. And Wall Street Journal you can't argue,
[03:36:57.800 --> 03:37:02.520]  they're not really left-wing corporate controlled media. They're you know finance media, Wall
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:09.720]  Street media. But the mainstream media will attack infowars and they will attack independent media
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:15.960]  but they will never expose the truth about the massive fraud and heavy metals and illegal products
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:22.680]  that are sold on Amazon.com. Isn't that interesting? And of course now you know why. But once again
[03:37:22.680 --> 03:37:27.240]  just underscores the truth about what we're talking about here. You know Wall Street Journal,
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:34.520]  116 products falsely labeled as FDA approved. 43 listings for a pain reliever that lacked FDA
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:40.920]  labels warning against use on children. 80 listings of an infant sleeping wedge that the
[03:37:40.920 --> 03:37:48.600]  FDA has warned can kill children. And 1400 electronic listings that falsely claimed
[03:37:48.600 --> 03:37:56.200]  to be UL certified. It just goes on and on and on. The truth is Amazon.com runs virtually
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:02.200]  no quality control and they don't check the compliance of almost anything they sell. A third
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:07.720]  party seller can go on to Amazon and they can make any claim they want and they can put anything in
[03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:13.320]  a capsule. They can dig up gravel and put it in a capsule and sell it and Amazon will sell it.
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:19.400]  That's the truth. That's the cold hard truth about what we've found and what the Wall Street
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:26.120]  Journal has found. So again if you want quality, safe, clean, compliant supplements you shop at
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:31.880]  at infowarstore.com and the independent sites that you know and trust. That's what you do.
[03:38:31.880 --> 03:38:36.760]  That's how you solve that problem. It's crucial to understand that this is what's happening.
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:44.680]  Okay moving on to another issue here. We've got now confirmation from several sources. You know I
[03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:52.120]  have a lot of different sources in various realms of we'll say defense or self-defense.
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:57.560]  We now have confirmation that there are a new technology exists for drones.
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:06.120]  Drones have now been outfitted with not only rifles, essentially sort of customized rifles
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:13.640]  that go onto the drones, but they now have ballistics software coupled with rangefinders,
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:24.040]  thermal imaging that in essence drones can now engage human targets at night from altitude,
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:31.960]  from 500 to 1,000 feet of altitude while they are moving. And the ballistics software in these
[03:39:31.960 --> 03:39:37.640]  drones compensates for the movement of the drones, compensates for all the ballistics properties
[03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:42.600]  that you normally have in ballistics software. You know density, altitude, barometric pressure,
[03:39:42.600 --> 03:39:46.520]  temperature, spin drift, all these things that you normally do if you're a long-range shooter you
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:52.440]  know about all this stuff. This is all now programmed into the drones. They have a rangefinder
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:57.640]  and a thermal imaging system and they can lock on to a human target. This now exists.
[03:39:57.640 --> 03:40:02.760]  It has been confirmed. They've been tested at night. Obviously not on human targets, but
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:08.920]  you can probably imagine what kind of targets they might be tested on. And the technology
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:16.520]  works and it puts rounds into specific organs of specific targets on the ground
[03:40:16.520 --> 03:40:23.800]  from altitude at night. Now the reason I mentioned this is because well you know the
[03:40:23.800 --> 03:40:29.080]  InfoWars listeners are very informed, very intelligent audience. You can probably connect
[03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:34.760]  the dots on this. You can do the math on this about maybe how the next big false flag event
[03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:43.080]  might be constructed. I'll just leave it at that. Okay, next comment changing the subject here.
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:50.360]  Dave Chappelle has a new special on Netflix. I encourage you to take a look at this even
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:55.400]  though I don't support Netflix. Netflix puts out a lot of horrifically bad propaganda to
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:02.760]  indoctrinate children into Satanism and liberalism. But Dave Chappelle really deserves I think a
[03:41:02.760 --> 03:41:09.400]  round of applause for his latest special where he takes it to the transgender community. And he
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:15.000]  says in fact in his special that every black man and woman in America should register to legally
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:20.440]  own a firearm. And he talks about the firearms that he owns and why he needs them and how he
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:26.760]  uses guns for self-defense. And again Dave Chappelle who says he doesn't like guns but he's
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:30.600]  got them and he's explaining to his audience why you need them and why every black person
[03:41:30.600 --> 03:41:37.160]  in America needs a gun. Of course every free citizen needs a gun regardless of your color.
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:42.040]  And you may not agree with Dave Chappelle on everything of course no one ever would but
[03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:49.880]  Chappelle has courage. He has real courage to get up on stage and to criticize the transgender
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:56.120]  indoctrination of children to criticize the political correctness indoctrination and brainwashing
[03:41:56.120 --> 03:42:02.200]  of the masses of our country. And he's got the guts to say that he needs to own some guns for
[03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:08.920]  self-defense. Whatever you think of Dave Chappelle and you know again he's done some a few crazy
[03:42:08.920 --> 03:42:15.880]  things in the past but so what he's he's he's speaking his truth and he's not being censored.
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:20.680]  And he's refusing to kowtow to the thought police and the speech police of America.
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:25.240]  Meanwhile you have Taylor Swift who is nothing but a brainwashed puppet who says whatever the
[03:42:25.240 --> 03:42:31.720]  globalists want her to say. So compare those two. Dave Chappelle he deserves credit for speaking
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:38.200]  the truth. Taylor Swift deserves condemnation in my view for being a puppet of the globalists
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:41.960]  and saying whatever they want her to say. Interesting contrast isn't it.
[03:42:41.960 --> 03:42:46.120]  There's more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams we'll be right back
[03:42:46.120 --> 03:42:47.240]  after this break with more.

[03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:13.960]  what are we waiting for take this
[03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:19.000]  win
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:42.040]  win
[03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:54.040]  win
[03:47:55.720 --> 03:48:01.080]  it's alex jones and now your host mike adams
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:06.840]  i'm interested in the video we were just watching there bernie sanders
[03:48:07.480 --> 03:48:14.680]  trying to run a punching bag a drilled bag there and getting getting the slapped in the face it's
[03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:20.040]  a good metaphor for socialism every time socialists try to control the economy they get slapped in the
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:26.120]  face every every time they try to run a city the city collapses into destitution and filth and if
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:30.040]  you put socialists in charge of the country they're going to collapse america just like they've
[03:48:30.040 --> 03:48:35.800]  collapsed all their left wing cities i mean it's it's a reasonable question to ask how do you
[03:48:35.800 --> 03:48:41.720]  democrats think you can run the country when you can't even you know keep feces off the streets
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:48.440]  of san francisco and you can't even keep all the the homeless addicts drug abusers from
[03:48:48.440 --> 03:48:52.200]  you know defecating all over the streets of austin or every liberal city how do you think
[03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:58.440]  you can run the country they can't of course but continuing with some of our food research today
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:02.280]  here's a couple more important things i have to share with you and then i'm going to get to project
[03:49:02.280 --> 03:49:08.920]  scopex which is the bill gates project he's funded it that's going to try to drop calcium carbonate
[03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:14.200]  and lead all over the world to block out the sun and contaminate the soils i've got some new information
[03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:20.760]  on that to share with you but uh first there was breaking news over the last couple of days or five
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:28.520]  days or so about a farmer in the midwest who was convicted of organic fraud and he committed
[03:49:28.520 --> 03:49:33.800]  suicide to avoid going to prison the associated press covered this i believe his name is randy
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:42.120]  constant and he was a farmer in missouri and i think iowa anyway he carried out organic fraud
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:49.000]  for eight years producing millions of bush bushels of organic so-called organic soybeans and so
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:54.760]  called organic corn that actually was not organic and what he did is he laundered those grains
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:50:02.280]  through animal operations to feed all those fake organic grains to cattle and chickens and so on
[03:50:02.280 --> 03:50:09.640]  and then he sold and advertised that meat as being organic meat it was all a fraud and he
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:13.720]  eventually got caught and he got convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison some of the other
[03:50:13.720 --> 03:50:19.720]  farmers that he was associated with also got sentenced to a shorter prison sentences but
[03:50:19.720 --> 03:50:24.120]  the the real question here is and what this this has everything to do with where you get your food
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:30.440]  and where you get your supplements why didn't the usda catch this why did it take eight years
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:35.960]  i mean this guy produced up to eight percent of the soybeans grown in the united states of america
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:41.080]  of organic soybeans and it was all fraud how come he got away with it for eight years
[03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:46.760]  and i've come to the realization as a food scientist and running a lab and doing all this
[03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:50.680]  testing and just like the amazon.com story from the last segment wall street journal
[03:50:51.240 --> 03:50:57.480]  found amazon selling all these high lead high cadmium products i found that certified organic
[03:50:57.480 --> 03:51:04.920]  organic to me doesn't i don't trust it anymore you have to go beyond organic you have to have
[03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:09.960]  your stuff really lab test you have to get your products from a clean source you know again
[03:51:09.960 --> 03:51:16.040]  info wars store is very credible they do the research they do the work they check their sources
[03:51:16.680 --> 03:51:22.520]  but if you went out and bought organic meat at a grocery store for the last eight or 10 years
[03:51:22.520 --> 03:51:27.160]  that might have been fraudulent organic meat wasn't organic at all you were paying double price
[03:51:27.160 --> 03:51:35.320]  or triple price and it was stamped usda organic but it wasn't organic the usda has big lapses
[03:51:35.320 --> 03:51:41.480]  in its program and by the way it's even worse in china so of course once you get dishonest
[03:51:41.480 --> 03:51:48.280]  deceptive communists having certified organic products exporting to the united states a lot
[03:51:48.280 --> 03:51:53.080]  of that stuff isn't organic at all either but this problem exists both in the united states
[03:51:53.080 --> 03:52:01.080]  and in china and it just brings home the point i mean who can you trust well not not the usda
[03:52:01.800 --> 03:52:07.640]  and not amazon that's for sure so i just want to underscore all that because i promote organics
[03:52:07.640 --> 03:52:13.000]  you know i promote nutrition and i i've encouraged people to buy organic but now i don't even trust
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:18.120]  it anymore you have to go way beyond just organic in other words gosh are we surprised the government
[03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:23.720]  screwed up the organic program wow what a big surprise that the government is incompetent
[03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:27.880]  we've made another astonishing discovery what do you know the government can't run the organic
[03:52:27.880 --> 03:52:34.280]  program without allowing all kinds of fraud to persist for almost a decade in the marketplace
[03:52:34.280 --> 03:52:42.200]  is anyone surprised at all of course not okay project scopex this is the bill gates funded
[03:52:42.200 --> 03:52:49.480]  project i believe involving a harvard scientist to try to block sunlight because leftists hate the
[03:52:49.480 --> 03:52:55.640]  sun so bill gates has this massive depopulation scheme of course to collapse the ecosystem
[03:52:55.640 --> 03:53:01.320]  destroy the biosphere and this they say they have to do this for global warming or to stop
[03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:08.200]  climate change so they're going to poison the atmosphere to accomplish this goal but the calcium
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:13.400]  carbonate that bill gates wants to put into the atmosphere is always contaminated with lead
[03:53:14.040 --> 03:53:20.280]  we've done these tests we've seen this before so he's actually talking about dropping lead all over
[03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:26.920]  the crops and all the soils of the world along with the calcium carbonate so you're talking about
[03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:33.640]  massive lead contamination of the soils which means some of that lead gets taken up into the plants
[03:53:33.640 --> 03:53:39.080]  so you're talking about lead contamination of the plants now when you combine this with the new
[03:53:39.080 --> 03:53:44.760]  findings from the journal of the american medical association about fluoride causing brain damage
[03:53:44.760 --> 03:53:49.720]  and this was covered extensively by alex jones and others on info wars over the last week or so
[03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:58.200]  you realize that this is a binary weapons system it's fluoride to damage the brains and then it's
[03:53:58.200 --> 03:54:04.440]  lead to cause what what does lead cause well according to the state of california lead
[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:11.160]  causes not only cancer not only damages developing brains but is also responsible for what's called
[03:54:11.160 --> 03:54:17.880]  male reproductive toxicity and female reproductive toxicity so what we're talking about is an
[03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:23.240]  infertility heavy metal that's going to be literally dropped out of the sky by bill gates or a bill
[03:54:23.240 --> 03:54:30.360]  gates funded operation in order to contaminate the entire food supply with no exceptions because
[03:54:30.360 --> 03:54:33.880]  you can't avoid the air if you're growing crops everything falling out of the air is going to
[03:54:33.880 --> 03:54:39.320]  fall on your crops so you're getting if you drink water you're going to get brain damage from the
[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:44.920]  fluoride and if you eat food you're going to get brain damage from the lead and this is all on
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:51.400]  purpose because they have to dumb down the population to such a low IQ that people can stand
[03:54:51.400 --> 03:54:58.360]  to watch cnn and you have to really lobotomize people to get somebody to be able to watch cnn
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:05.480]  without physically vomiting it's you know it's so obnoxious to any intelligent person to even attempt
[03:55:05.480 --> 03:55:10.840]  to look at someone like brian stelter make some kind of an argument or gosh how do you get a
[03:55:10.840 --> 03:55:16.520]  population to vote for joe biden who can't even remember the name of the president under which
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:23.960]  he served i'm coming soon joe biden won't even be able to remember his name is joe or how to spell
[03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:31.480]  it or how many letters are in the name joe i mean he's gone his neurology is gone of course he had
[03:55:31.480 --> 03:55:36.760]  brain tumors and so on i feel sorry for the fact that he's had this damage i don't wish suffering
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:41.720]  upon anyone but he's certainly he doesn't have the neurology to run the country but how do you get a
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:48.200]  population to vote for him you brain damage him and you do it through the deliberate mass poisoning
[03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:55.400]  of the food supply so it's the fluoride it's the lead and it's also the toxic chemicals that are
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:01.480]  deliberately added to the food supply which include by the way atrazine the chemical hormone
[03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:07.480]  disruptor it's known as a castration chemical you've got atrazine you've got glyphosate you've
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:14.360]  got estrogen mimickers estrogen disruptors you've got chemicals like astrogen astrazine that actually
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:22.840]  do turn the frogs gay they actually literally cause uh distortions in the endocrine system
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:28.520]  that are related to gender expression in both amphibians and humans it's a scientific fact
[03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:35.080]  so this is a deliberate mass poisoning of our planet so that democrats can win
[03:56:35.080 --> 03:56:40.600]  because the population is dumbed down enough to actually support democrat policies that do not work
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:48.040]  so the real quote utopia of a democrat run world is a world of literally
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:56.280]  crapping retarded zombies shooting up drugs running around trying to recruit all the autistic
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:57:03.160]  kids to be transgenders so they can have their drag queen transgender drug addiction
[03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:10.840]  bc story hour and then saying that it's all the fault of trump i mean the the utopia of democrats
[03:57:11.480 --> 03:57:19.720]  is a crap whole world a dystopian collapsed destitute society of mass mental retardation
[03:57:19.720 --> 03:57:25.880]  of neurological damage of cancer mass contamination of the food supply that's the hell that they will
[03:57:25.880 --> 03:57:32.840]  bring you if you vote for democrats ever again think about that it's all true well that's a
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:37.720]  wrap for today stay tuned for ova shroyer coming up next thanks for watching this is mike adams
[03:57:37.720 --> 03:58:03.720]  here for info wars till next week take care you
