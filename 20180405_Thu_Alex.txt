[00:00.000 --> 00:29.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, the 5th day of
[00:29.300 --> 00:36.980]  April 2018 and the Infowar is in high gear and very proud of the fact that we are the
[00:36.980 --> 00:44.080]  most hated, derided, lied about, demonized broadcast in the world by globalist, by criminals,
[00:44.080 --> 00:50.840]  by communists, by Nazi collaborators, by failing media empires and by every other form of degenerate
[00:50.840 --> 00:59.980]  child molester you can imagine. I am on cloud nine right now and you've seen a lot of globalist
[00:59.980 --> 01:08.020]  disinfo and operations the last few weeks. Well, starting next week, the rebellion strikes back.
[01:08.020 --> 01:15.700]  So things are going very, very well. Doesn't mean we're not in the fight of our lives. We've got
[01:15.700 --> 01:21.340]  to be focused. Eye of the tiger got to be committed. But if we're committed, we take action. We
[01:21.340 --> 01:26.140]  can't lose with God's help. Notice you're not hearing about the tragic YouTube shooting anymore
[01:26.140 --> 01:30.980]  a day and a half after it happened because it was a leftist just pull side tidbit. Look at this
[01:30.980 --> 01:37.020]  headline Twitter transgender critic questioned by police and banned from leaving the UK for saying
[01:37.020 --> 01:42.540]  there's two genders and his child abuse to take young children out of the country and have them
[01:42.540 --> 01:49.180]  castrated. Yes, you cannot make that up. Meanwhile, London's hospitals look like war zones due to
[01:49.180 --> 01:57.060]  gun and knife crime epidemic. City Khan responds, blames the Tories for not banning knives. Meanwhile,
[01:57.060 --> 02:04.020]  78 year old man arrested for murder after stabbing arm burglar to death in his home. That's right,
[02:04.020 --> 02:10.460]  arm burglar in your house. You fight back. You go to prison in the UK, which is a
[02:10.460 --> 02:17.380]  anti free speech authoritarian hellhole. And the legislature, the parliament needs to move
[02:17.380 --> 02:24.780]  to remove this, ladies and gentlemen, it needs to be done ASAP. Now that said, Trump signs
[02:24.780 --> 02:30.300]  proclamation, sending National Guard to the Mexico border immediately. Oh, all you folks that
[02:30.300 --> 02:34.580]  flipped out about DACA. He was trying to be reasonable. Like you said during the campaign,
[02:34.580 --> 02:38.860]  since we're 40 year old guys have been deported three or four times and at a criminal record,
[02:38.860 --> 02:43.260]  you're gone. Yeah. Okay, you really been here 20 years and you got a job. You're on a criminal.
[02:43.260 --> 02:47.060]  Yeah, we'll fast track you. Absolutely. We'll make you a citizen. Democrats make it too hard to
[02:47.060 --> 02:52.140]  make those folks citizens. I think we should make it easier for law abiding people that work and
[02:52.140 --> 02:55.300]  have a record of working to become citizens. But the Democrats want to make you a permanent
[02:55.300 --> 03:02.060]  underclass. Meanwhile, the big news, caravan disbands for Trump, deploys military to the border.
[03:02.060 --> 03:08.740]  But turns out they're actually now reconstituting it was a faint. 50 plus thousands stopped
[03:08.740 --> 03:14.660]  at Mexican border last month alone up 203% from March of last year. So the numbers are big.
[03:14.660 --> 03:21.580]  And the board patrol is is completely outgunned. This is a collapse in Latin America, in Central
[03:21.580 --> 03:26.860]  and South America. Just pouring up. It is just a nightmare scenario for everybody involved.
[03:26.860 --> 03:32.580]  We'll get swamped if we take them all. They're there in hell. It's just a real bad situation.
[03:32.580 --> 03:37.140]  More than a million undocumented immigrants have received California driver's license, Sacramento
[03:37.140 --> 03:41.940]  B. And under California law, that lets them vote. Of course, the Democrats say they want
[03:41.940 --> 03:48.460]  them to vote. And Obama famously said in 2016, Oh, if you live here, it's your duty to go
[03:48.460 --> 03:53.500]  vote. He said, if you live here, you're a citizen. Yeah, Mexico starts giving caravan
[03:53.500 --> 04:00.300]  migrants transit visas. But don't worry, Robert De Niro slams the NRA things in our country
[04:00.300 --> 04:05.100]  are so bad and it comes from Trump. Yeah, stock market still up 2 million new jobs, lowest
[04:05.100 --> 04:10.500]  unemployment level, biggest startup for new businesses. All sorts of great things happening.
[04:10.500 --> 04:17.980]  That's just terrible. Another virtue signaling individual, ladies and gentlemen, absolutely
[04:17.980 --> 04:21.900]  disgusting. So that's just some of the news we're covered on that front. And then of course,
[04:21.900 --> 04:27.820]  the really big news that's out of control is so serious. Democrats across the country
[04:27.820 --> 04:33.140]  are moving and some areas passing laws to confiscate all semi autos and then find you
[04:33.140 --> 04:38.340]  $1,000 a day when you don't turn them in. So it's all coming up. And of course, it's
[04:38.340 --> 04:44.980]  in states like Illinois, where they have the firearm owner registration guard. So they
[04:44.980 --> 04:50.100]  know what you got and right where to come. So we always say do not register because register
[04:50.100 --> 04:55.940]  everywhere is the next step to what the C word and it didn't cookie for cookie monster.
[04:55.940 --> 05:04.520]  It's confiscation. Get ready for Alex Jones to invade the swamp. Jones is set to give
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.660]  a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on April 10, during which he'll make
[05:09.660 --> 05:15.300]  a statement on the raft of anti free speech lawsuits targeting his First Amendment rights.
[05:15.300 --> 05:19.100]  Numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting media attention and
[05:19.100 --> 05:24.620]  defaming Alex Jones and Info Wars' reputation. Jones will address the left's new tactic
[05:24.620 --> 05:30.100]  of trying to bury Info Wars under a deluge of lawsuits, several of which do not rest
[05:30.100 --> 05:35.660]  on any sound legal basis. While the mainstream media and many on the left routinely celebrate
[05:35.660 --> 05:40.500]  these lawsuits when they're first filed, those same people are noticeably silent when the
[05:40.500 --> 05:45.660]  lawsuits collapse. These lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech and
[05:45.660 --> 05:51.140]  they are doomed to fail. Alex Jones will go live at 9 a.m. Eastern from the National Press
[05:51.140 --> 05:57.460]  Club in Washington, D.C. You can find live streams of the press conference at infowars.com.
[05:57.460 --> 06:21.060]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[06:27.460 --> 06:51.060]  If you want to know the spirit that dominates the U.K., Europe and the United States, Australia,
[06:51.060 --> 06:57.300]  New Zealand, Canada to a great extent, it's a spirit of conformity, a spirit of cowardice,
[06:57.300 --> 07:03.300]  a spirit of being bullied by the political correct gods. All the time I've seen news
[07:03.300 --> 07:12.700]  reports about why has this particular pop star not criticized Trump yet? Why are they
[07:12.700 --> 07:18.820]  keeping their mouth shut? Are they racist? Are they bad? Are they evil? You've seen
[07:18.820 --> 07:26.100]  that with a lot of people and then suddenly you'll see that individual come out and start
[07:26.100 --> 07:31.180]  attacking Trump. That hasn't happened with the number one star in the world, Taylor Swift
[07:31.180 --> 07:34.940]  yet, but boy, they are putting the pressure on her. But I remember a few months ago I
[07:34.940 --> 07:42.140]  saw a few articles about where's Mike Myers now? And why hasn't Mike Myers come out and
[07:42.140 --> 07:46.700]  attack Trump? Well, you know, some of the other late night hosts, they almost lost their
[07:46.700 --> 07:54.580]  jobs remember because they weren't attacking Trump enough, but now they are. And so sure
[07:54.580 --> 07:59.300]  enough this morning I was scrolling through the news and I saw Mike Myers playing Dr.
[07:59.300 --> 08:07.140]  Evil and talking about how I'm an advisor to the presidents and we're helping make America
[08:07.140 --> 08:14.940]  evil again. And it's not even funny. So he came out of retirement. I guess he owns like
[08:14.940 --> 08:22.940]  a hockey team and something else. He came out of retirement, not been seen in years
[08:22.940 --> 08:28.580]  to bash Trump so they get off his back. And I've talked to folks in Hollywood that they
[08:28.580 --> 08:34.700]  get told you come out against Trump or you're not going to work again. James Woods, one
[08:34.700 --> 08:39.420]  of the top actors in Hollywood, made hundreds of millions of dollars, just so many top films,
[08:39.420 --> 08:45.500]  incredible actor. When he decided to go ahead and go public for America and for Trump, they
[08:45.500 --> 08:53.140]  told him you will never work again. So the headline, if you want to go watch it is Dr.
[08:53.140 --> 08:57.220]  Evil gets fired from the Trump cabinet. We're going to play excerpts of it later. And it's
[08:57.220 --> 09:07.020]  not our top story. It just is an illustrative piece to show how pathetic these folks are.
[09:07.020 --> 09:10.900]  And since we're at this point, I got a ton of incredible breaking news, gun confiscation
[09:10.900 --> 09:17.940]  from the beginning in some areas, just so important. Trump deploying trips to the border.
[09:17.940 --> 09:20.820]  He's now officially signed the order. We've got the latest developments there. But since
[09:20.820 --> 09:26.820]  I mentioned Dr. Evil, let's talk about the real Dr. Evil. We've played these clips before
[09:26.820 --> 09:34.860]  from 60 minutes back in 1999 with George Soros. But I thought we would just go ahead and play
[09:34.860 --> 09:40.620]  it without even the graphics of the death camps and scary music. I thought we'd just
[09:40.620 --> 09:46.460]  play the clips themselves and then cut right into the last few months, Anderson Cooper,
[09:46.460 --> 09:50.420]  Sink, Uggur of the Young Turks named after a genocide group that killed a million and
[09:50.420 --> 09:58.460]  a half Christians. I mean, that's a fact. Just like David Hogg on his Reddit says,
[09:58.460 --> 10:03.860]  I want to see billions die. Thank God mosquitoes are killing people. That's what they're all
[10:03.860 --> 10:09.820]  into. And George Soros meets with the big eugenics organizations, David Rockefeller,
[10:09.820 --> 10:13.060]  Ted Turner, Bill and London Gates. And it was in the Wall Street Journal, the New York
[10:13.060 --> 10:16.780]  Times, that oh, they wanted the public to know it. She's a secret meeting, but they
[10:16.780 --> 10:22.100]  want to depopulate the planet through a world government. And then famously Bill Gates gets
[10:22.100 --> 10:30.660]  up in front of teachers and says that he gets up on Ted TV. Because we can show Soros as
[10:30.660 --> 10:34.580]  a caricature and make fun of him, but actually looking at his actions and just real photos
[10:34.580 --> 10:47.460]  of him is more frightening. So we've got the real Dr. Evil who they admitted the last James
[10:47.460 --> 10:53.940]  Bond movie is based on him. It's even named after his company, the Quantum Group, who's
[10:53.940 --> 10:58.580]  a private corporate guy that's really behind Spectre and behind the terror groups and trying
[10:58.580 --> 11:03.340]  to get Russia in the U.S. in a war. I mean, they really told you and they admit that British
[11:03.340 --> 11:10.020]  intelligence, MI6, good factions of it helped write the last script that was in the news
[11:10.020 --> 11:13.780]  and that they don't like George Soros for trying to crash the pound repeatedly and almost
[11:13.780 --> 11:25.340]  bringing the UK down. So that movie is a statement about it. I guess now it's two films back.
[11:25.340 --> 11:32.660]  So Hillary is his minion. So when we talk about real Dr. Evil here, ladies and gentlemen,
[11:32.660 --> 11:37.940]  it's him and what he does and his family and his son, the documents came out where they're
[11:37.940 --> 11:43.100]  funding Antifa to engage in violent riots, criminal activity, how they work with blue
[11:43.100 --> 11:50.380]  state police, blue city police, blue state areas to then let them attack and burn and
[11:50.380 --> 11:54.180]  corral crowds into them so they can attack them. Those documents came out what three
[11:54.180 --> 11:59.020]  months ago, no news coverage of it. Just like five years ago, we broke the Stingray documents
[11:59.020 --> 12:04.060]  nationwide from DC to Washington state and exactly how they work. But AP, they're saying
[12:04.060 --> 12:11.260]  is might get a Pulitzer prize for their report about it two days ago. So let's go ahead now
[12:11.260 --> 12:16.100]  and play the clip that Soros doesn't want you to hear. He thought he would just somehow
[12:16.100 --> 12:21.620]  sell us on this idea. And then you've got the young turds and you've got Anderson Cooper
[12:21.620 --> 12:25.580]  following behind him like he's a dog going to the bathroom on the sidewalk trying to
[12:25.580 --> 12:30.620]  pick it up for him. Here it is. My understanding is, is that you went out with this protector
[12:30.620 --> 12:38.500]  of yours who swore that you were his adopted god son. Yes, yes. Went out in fact and helped
[12:38.500 --> 12:47.580]  in the confiscation of property from the Jews. That's right. Yes. Was it difficult? Not at
[12:47.580 --> 12:56.940]  all. Not at all. Maybe as a child, you don't, you don't see the connection. But it was,
[12:56.940 --> 13:02.300]  it created no, no problem at all. No feeling of guilt? No. It was actually probably the
[13:02.300 --> 13:08.340]  happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation. For me, it was a very positive
[13:08.340 --> 13:13.860]  experience. It's a strange thing, you know, because you see incredible suffering around
[13:13.860 --> 13:21.300]  you and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself. But you're 14 years old and you
[13:21.300 --> 13:27.300]  don't believe that it can actually touch you. You have a belief in yourself, your belief
[13:27.300 --> 13:33.100]  in your father. It's a very happy making, exhilarating experience.
[13:33.100 --> 13:38.100]  George Soros is one of those people that actually helps, you know, back these individuals. Who
[13:38.100 --> 13:42.580]  is he? I think he's from Hungary. I think he was Jewish and I think he turned in his
[13:42.580 --> 13:48.140]  own people to the Nazis. Do you think George Soros funded the neo-Nazis who marched in
[13:48.140 --> 13:50.340]  Charlottesville? Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[13:50.340 --> 13:55.380]  His conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones. The idea
[13:55.380 --> 13:59.660]  also that the way that congressman is saying is like, well, we're learning this or, you
[13:59.660 --> 14:03.860]  know, we're finding this out as if it's sort of the full weight of his office or the U.S.
[14:03.860 --> 14:09.060]  Congress when in fact it seems like he's just getting stuff from Alex Jones. That seems
[14:09.060 --> 14:14.220]  to be where the news is coming from. Alex Jones claims to have sources all throughout
[14:14.220 --> 14:20.300]  the government, but George Soros did not fund these people. What he's saying is not true.
[14:20.300 --> 14:25.380]  He's deeply anti-Semitic. Now, why do I say that? For a number of reasons, he has attacked
[14:25.380 --> 14:32.140]  George Soros over and over again with references to his background. He attacked Michael Wolfe
[14:32.140 --> 14:37.660]  who wrote the book about Donald Trump. They both happen to be Jewish. You'll see it in
[14:37.660 --> 14:43.020]  a second as well. It says that Soros worked with the Nazis. It's just like, do you say
[14:43.020 --> 14:47.660]  someone who, I don't know if you know, Soros survived the Holocaust. Alex Jones, the worst
[14:47.660 --> 14:53.580]  guy on earth. He called George Soros a Nazi collaborator. Of course that's not true.
[14:53.580 --> 14:59.620]  Of course he's done it. And Soros was a kid at the time. The guy survives the Holocaust.
[14:59.620 --> 15:06.180]  And this clown, and I'm trying not to use worse words against him, but he has more
[15:06.180 --> 15:12.900]  than earned it, then turns around and calls a Holocaust survivor and Nazi collaborator.
[15:12.900 --> 15:17.460]  And you're named your organization off the young Turks who were the brown shirts that
[15:17.460 --> 15:20.740]  carried out the extermination of a million and a half Christians and your program is
[15:20.740 --> 15:25.500]  anti-Christian. We get it. That's what the globalists are all about. Hating flyover
[15:25.500 --> 15:29.820]  country. They hate me because I'm Americana. They hate you because you're Americana. That's
[15:29.820 --> 15:34.700]  it. They hate us. Accept it. Know it. He wrote a book. His dad wrote a book. They helped
[15:34.700 --> 15:41.300]  round up for years. Over a thousand Jews and steal their money with the Nazis. It's well
[15:41.300 --> 15:44.700]  known the Nazis would recruit Jews that would work with them to help round people up. That's
[15:44.700 --> 15:50.140]  a fact. Poland talked about that and Netanyahu flipped out on them. I'm not against Netanyahu,
[15:50.140 --> 15:54.780]  but Netanyahu gets your history straight. Poland is right. There are a lot of people
[15:54.780 --> 16:00.660]  like Soros that help round up other Jews. They're called Judas Goats.

[19:00.340 --> 19:05.540]  InfoWarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[19:05.540 --> 19:10.740]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:10.740 --> 19:17.580]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[19:17.580 --> 19:23.460]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.460 --> 19:28.820]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[19:28.820 --> 19:34.220]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[19:34.220 --> 19:40.420]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[19:40.420 --> 19:45.020]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[19:45.020 --> 19:50.300]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[19:50.300 --> 19:56.620]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[19:56.620 --> 20:06.220]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:26.620 --> 20:36.060]  I'm going to be announcing two lawsuits next week against enemies of the Republic, enemies
[20:36.060 --> 20:40.860]  of free speech and then eight more the next month after that. So all you folks that sent
[20:40.860 --> 20:44.620]  me letters asking for money, you're going to get sued for big money. We're coming after
[20:44.620 --> 20:49.780]  you. We're going to win. So all you folks licking your lips out there that got induced
[20:49.780 --> 20:53.660]  to sign on to all these fake lawsuits against us, you got all the top law firms look at
[20:53.660 --> 20:57.940]  it. Even the Daily Beast says this is very dangerous for the Democrats and they've opened
[20:57.940 --> 21:05.020]  themselves up to millions in real damages. So bon appetit. You think you're going to
[21:05.020 --> 21:11.580]  destroy our First Amendment? Get ready. I'm not some knuckle-dagger looking for money
[21:11.580 --> 21:16.460]  and not looking for a fight. I'm looking to defend the Second Amendment, the First Amendment
[21:16.460 --> 21:26.260]  and the whole nine yards. So you want to fight? Better believe you got one. You know, playing
[21:26.260 --> 21:36.520]  that George Soros clip last segment of him talking about how much he enjoyed rounding
[21:36.520 --> 21:43.740]  up Jews and how invigorating it was and how it formed his character. It was so dangerous.
[21:43.740 --> 21:49.500]  That's why he's so ruthless and crazy. If you're 14, 15, 16 and then not just during
[21:49.500 --> 21:58.180]  the Nazi occupation, but after they were involved when the Soviets came in and all that corruption,
[21:58.180 --> 22:04.060]  making hundreds of millions of dollars involved in different scams and different criminal
[22:04.060 --> 22:08.860]  activities and then you do it all over Europe and all over America and you're involved
[22:08.860 --> 22:14.900]  in every form of corruption under the sun. He was known as a supervillain in the 1980s
[22:14.900 --> 22:20.100]  when my mom would watch Lair News Hour. George Soros attempted to crash the pound of the
[22:20.100 --> 22:24.260]  day. George Soros attempted to crash the Argentinian. George Soros successfully crashed this, you
[22:24.260 --> 22:27.580]  know, causing millions to build bankrupt. I mean, there are countries that never recovered
[22:27.580 --> 22:32.780]  after him. And by the mid-90s, it was like controversial figure, George Soros. But by
[22:32.780 --> 22:44.100]  the 2000s, the angel, the baby cake, the sweetie pie. And that's what's crazy is CNN, MSNBC,
[22:44.100 --> 22:52.540]  the young turds, all of it. Why, George Soros doesn't fund any Antifa. And we have all the
[22:52.540 --> 22:57.900]  documents where his son running an organization funds them to riot. Can we pull that article
[22:57.900 --> 23:11.260]  up? Documents Obama planned, civil emergency in Maryland, martial law, and then it's the
[23:11.260 --> 23:18.500]  Soros group, his son Alexander, and family quarterbacking. And those are real documents.
[23:18.500 --> 23:21.940]  They never said they weren't. We made phone calls, called the FBI, you name it, and they
[23:21.940 --> 23:25.380]  said, no, those are real documents. And people are just waiting for Trump to move against
[23:25.380 --> 23:30.980]  them on stuff like that. It's incredible. So we pull that article up. It was the exact
[23:30.980 --> 23:40.140]  headline. It was, I don't think it was a Don Salazar wrote the article. There's a video
[23:40.140 --> 23:52.980]  I did on it. Soros funded Antifa in Maryland. Soros funded plans for riots in Maryland.
[23:52.980 --> 23:59.700]  Soros planned to trigger civil war caused by race riots, and it's got 20-something pages
[23:59.700 --> 24:08.420]  of the documents, how they work with the police, the whole thing. I bet I can find it. Gotta
[24:08.420 --> 24:16.700]  click web to find it, though. Let's go to a clip while we find that. Let's go ahead and
[24:16.700 --> 24:21.540]  there it is. Oh, thank God. I'm so OCD now. I had to have a thank you. Oh, good. It used
[24:21.540 --> 24:26.660]  to be OCD. I've developed it when it comes to documents and articles. Great job, crew.
[24:26.660 --> 24:30.380]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore. Leaked documents
[24:30.380 --> 24:34.900]  purport to show, and now they're confirmed, detailed plan to trigger nationwide unrest,
[24:34.900 --> 24:39.180]  allowing Obama to declare martial law. And that's what we surmised at the time, because
[24:39.180 --> 24:44.100]  the Justice Department got caught in Florida, in Maryland, and all over financing it. And
[24:44.100 --> 24:49.100]  if you scroll down to the documents, it explains how they basically fund people, how they train
[24:49.100 --> 24:53.580]  as actors. Doesn't mean they're actors in the street, but that's what the police even
[24:53.580 --> 24:57.300]  in training call it. Your role is this, your role is that. And you've got their Action
[24:57.300 --> 25:09.820]  BW10418, 2015, Final Operation Order Summary, Friends of Democracy, Confidential. And the
[25:09.820 --> 25:15.380]  brother of this other guy's brother that ended up in some trouble, gave us the documents.
[25:15.380 --> 25:18.460]  And folks, if you've got family that's been in Antifa and they're in prison or they committed
[25:18.460 --> 25:23.900]  suicide or whatever, or drug overdose, it is critical that you get those documents and
[25:23.900 --> 25:28.860]  mail them to us, because that's why they fear info wars and want it taken down. We get the
[25:28.860 --> 25:35.700]  right documents, it could blow the Death Star. I mean, they know they sit there every day
[25:35.700 --> 25:39.940]  with sweat running down their foreheads, knowing that I'm sitting here with sweat running down
[25:39.940 --> 25:45.580]  my forehead, not because I'm nervous, but because I'm so fired up half the time that
[25:45.580 --> 25:50.940]  I start sweating in here when it's 68 degrees. By the way, I can be sitting in the hot sun
[25:50.940 --> 25:56.260]  and barely sweat, but when my brain starts going, I get in a very aggressive mode to
[25:56.260 --> 26:00.220]  start sweating, because this is real. And I sit here and I start looking at the things
[26:00.220 --> 26:04.900]  they've done, the things that have been involved in, it makes me angry. We have a new article
[26:04.900 --> 26:09.340]  about all those documents are confirmed media blackout on that media blackout on David Hogg
[26:09.340 --> 26:15.060]  almost a week later and him wanting billions to die. I mean, this is sensational information.
[26:15.060 --> 26:21.860]  All right, when we come back, stop linked on drudgerport.com sex workers to expose politicians
[26:21.860 --> 26:28.940]  for passing anti trafficking bill. I will also look at what's really in the WikiLeaks.
[26:28.940 --> 26:34.260]  They always distract us with who leaked them. And that was exactly the big issue and all
[26:34.260 --> 26:37.100]  this garbage that Roger stones the Russian agent, but let's kind of look back on what's
[26:37.100 --> 26:43.220]  in the WikiLeaks and then video. It's up on info wars.com deranged Texas Councilwoman
[26:43.220 --> 26:49.940]  Huston charge for verbally attacking teenage girl in Trump shirt disturbing his peace screaming
[26:49.940 --> 26:54.060]  yelling frothing. And this is what happens when you wear a Trump shirt and now it's expanding
[26:54.060 --> 26:58.940]  to pro gun shirts. Well, I'm not letting these people intimidate me. I think it's more important
[26:58.940 --> 27:02.460]  people start wearing make America great shirts in four shirts and get the same thing in these
[27:02.460 --> 27:07.620]  areas. And then we go around in groups just to let them know just like open carry that
[27:07.620 --> 27:12.940]  we're not going to be intimidated by their deranged activity. So that's Steve Watson
[27:12.940 --> 27:18.140]  article. That's coming up. All right. First off though, we have some huge announcements

[32:59.900 --> 33:15.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the Information War, it's
[33:15.540 --> 33:24.380]  Alex Jones. I'm going to get off the George Soros kick. Now he's got PR firms and others
[33:24.380 --> 33:28.300]  out there saying he was never working for the Nazis. He was never a collaborator. Even
[33:28.300 --> 33:33.100]  when his father wrote a book, he wrote a book. He's given countless articles, radio interviews,
[33:33.100 --> 33:38.580]  TV interviews. In the mid- and late-90s admitting it, but saying he was proud of it, best time
[33:38.580 --> 33:43.820]  of his life, he filled an economic void. Someone else would have done it if he didn't. That
[33:43.820 --> 33:47.780]  taught him how to be ruthless. It's the most cold-blooded group of interviews I've ever
[33:47.780 --> 33:54.180]  heard. Even Nazis in Nuremberg didn't talk like that. They said they were sorry. But
[33:54.180 --> 33:59.140]  not Soros, he's not sorry. And then he has people like Sink and others through different
[33:59.140 --> 34:07.900]  foundations he's given money to, reportedly, saying that I'm the worst guy in the world
[34:07.900 --> 34:13.900]  and that I'm just nose-diving because I'll talk about their God. That is true evil in
[34:13.900 --> 34:19.780]  my view. Now, I was just in the coffee room getting a cup of Joe's. I forgot to have one
[34:19.780 --> 34:22.860]  this morning. That's how much energy I've got. I'm bounced off the walls with no coffee,
[34:22.860 --> 34:26.740]  but I wanted some. And I was watching Fox News. They were playing a clip of Zuckerberg
[34:26.740 --> 34:31.580]  that we already had, and it reminded me that we had the clip. He's like, oh, you can pretty
[34:31.580 --> 34:37.940]  much be assured that we did scrape your data. And everybody's hearing Scrap. They went,
[34:37.940 --> 34:42.020]  oh, they got rid of your data. No, they never get rid of it. It's in the terms of service.
[34:42.020 --> 34:47.940]  They use it. They share it, whether it's Samsung or whether it's Apple or whether it's Sharp
[34:47.940 --> 34:53.740]  or whether it's Microsoft or whether all of these companies now in their terms of service
[34:53.740 --> 34:58.220]  tell you, they watch you in your house. They listen to you with AI. They sell all the data.
[34:58.220 --> 35:06.580]  It's incredibly valuable. You, like the folks in Troy, brought in the Trojan horse. We
[35:06.580 --> 35:10.940]  don't know in history if the Trojan horse is legend or real. We know there was a Trojan
[35:10.940 --> 35:19.140]  war at that time, but we do know these are Trojan horses, don't we? Web scraping. Let's
[35:19.140 --> 35:26.900]  let's define it. Scraping. Web harvesting or web data extraction, usually with a spider,
[35:26.900 --> 35:30.860]  is data scraping used for extracting data from websites while web scraping can be done
[35:30.860 --> 35:36.100]  manually by software user. The term typically refers to automated process in a minute using
[35:36.100 --> 35:45.060]  a bot or web crawler. Now, I remember in high school, they were teaching us about the internet
[35:45.060 --> 35:50.100]  in the computer class and I learned all about scraping and they called them spiders and
[35:50.100 --> 35:58.260]  crawlers. I mean, I'm not a tech guy. I just read the tech journals. And the internet was
[35:58.260 --> 36:05.380]  set up to do this. Google is an NSA spy tool from the 80s. Set up by NQTEL, the Geospatial
[36:05.380 --> 36:11.540]  Center. It's run by Space Command. Google is the U.S. government with a private offshoot
[36:11.540 --> 36:15.260]  that's controlled by the leftist and the globalist. You notice, Smith's had to resign. All the
[36:15.260 --> 36:18.700]  rest that's happening now is there's a war inside Google and that's why Steve Pacenek,
[36:18.700 --> 36:23.220]  people say, are you with the CIA or they were CIA? No, I'm not with any of that. I'm with
[36:23.220 --> 36:28.140]  the free market in America and freedom. But Pacenek said that day before my YouTube channel
[36:28.140 --> 36:32.660]  was put back up, the strikes taken off. He said, I've talked to people upstairs inside
[36:32.660 --> 36:37.820]  the agency and you will have your strike back by tomorrow. This will not be tolerated. You
[36:37.820 --> 36:41.940]  did not do what they say and the Google will not be authoritarian. It was set up to defend
[36:41.940 --> 36:48.180]  the Republic and promote our values worldwide. And that's really what went on. And that is
[36:48.180 --> 36:52.780]  it. So they had all the Soros people that got hired and all the Southern Barber Law Center,
[36:52.780 --> 36:57.820]  10,000 of them brought in. Think about how Twilight Zone, they start taking everything
[36:57.820 --> 37:02.340]  down. YouTube goes, oh, it's not us. Sorry. But it was other executives mid-level being
[37:02.340 --> 37:09.220]  mutinous. And now reportedly more than 100 executives are out of Google. Trump's telling
[37:09.220 --> 37:13.220]  them, you stop it right now or I'm going to break you up and they can't stop. They can't
[37:13.220 --> 37:20.140]  stop. They can't stop. They can't stop. They can't stop. They can't stop. Any more than
[37:20.140 --> 37:24.620]  a city councilwoman walks up and starts screaming at and grabbing at the hat of a little girl
[37:24.620 --> 37:30.580]  wearing a make America great hat in Houston. I'll walk down the street and a woman with
[37:30.580 --> 37:34.540]  little kids will go F you, you piece of crap Russian and start coming out and their husband
[37:34.540 --> 37:38.940]  will drag them back. My daughters were up in Connecticut after we went skiing for a week.
[37:38.940 --> 37:43.340]  Their mom took them skiing. Probably been a better place they went to. You go to Colorado.
[37:43.340 --> 37:46.340]  It's like you're at 10,000 feet. You got to Connecticut. You're at 2,000 and it's just
[37:46.340 --> 37:52.220]  as nice. Anyways, and my 10 year old daughter's up there and she's talking to this other girl
[37:52.220 --> 37:55.660]  and the dad finds out they say, oh, Texas blah, blah, blah. She said, yeah, my dad's
[37:55.660 --> 38:00.220]  Alex Jones. He began screaming at her and getting in her face as if it's my fault then
[38:00.220 --> 38:06.220]  when it gets fun that they're deranged that full grown men bully little girls. These people
[38:06.220 --> 38:16.340]  are out of control, but I'm digressing here, ladies and gentlemen. They're all been spying
[38:16.340 --> 38:20.460]  on you. I told you exactly how they've been spying on you. It came out congressional
[38:20.460 --> 38:26.060]  hearings 17, 18 years ago. The telecommunications act set all this up and legalized it just
[38:26.060 --> 38:33.020]  like Obama signed those executive orders before he left letting Google starting last November
[38:33.020 --> 38:39.060]  a year and a half ago. November 2016, right after Trump won, he signed all those directives
[38:39.060 --> 38:42.500]  where they can discriminate against conservatives, libertarians, you name it. And that's when
[38:42.500 --> 38:46.860]  Facebook suddenly started listing in your control panel, are you a conservative? Are
[38:46.860 --> 38:52.180]  you a liberal? Are you labeling you like Nazi Germany? You know how dangerous that is? For
[38:52.180 --> 38:59.100]  advertisers. When a lot of people that call themselves Trump supporters are not conservatives.
[38:59.100 --> 39:03.980]  They just don't like Hillary Clinton and her crime network. So that's what this has gotten
[39:03.980 --> 39:10.100]  to. And just like they have the PR firms out there telling you Soros in the Nazi, it's
[39:10.100 --> 39:14.300]  the same thing. We're trying to confuse it like, well, does Facebook really look at your
[39:14.300 --> 39:19.140]  data? Does Google? They started all this Cambridge Analytica thing thinking they could just burn
[39:19.140 --> 39:25.340]  Trump for publicly scraping some stuff to try to contact conservatives on Facebook.
[39:25.340 --> 39:28.460]  Cambridge Analytica does a lot of illegal stuff. It's come out for whoever will hire
[39:28.460 --> 39:31.620]  them, Democrats, Republicans, dictators and third world countries. You know, it's just
[39:31.620 --> 39:37.380]  another big computer company outlet. But the fact that Democrats thought they could compartmentalize
[39:37.380 --> 39:45.980]  and only burn that area, it brought down their whole house of cards. They're so stupid. Can't
[39:45.980 --> 39:50.060]  put the genie back in the bottle, Bob. As I said, the day it broke, I predicted it all
[39:50.060 --> 39:54.100]  not because I'm a rocket scientist. I know how history works. I know how this stuff unfolds
[39:54.100 --> 39:59.260]  and understand Trump's algorithm now and how he operates. And you can predict what Trump's
[39:59.260 --> 40:04.580]  going to do, but these people walk into the trap every time. So let's go ahead and go
[40:04.580 --> 40:08.020]  to that clip of old Zookie.
[40:08.020 --> 40:13.740]  During today's disclosure and announcements, Facebook explained that the account recovery
[40:13.740 --> 40:19.060]  and search tools using email and phone number could have been used to scrape information
[40:19.060 --> 40:26.460]  about all of Facebook's users. When did Facebook find out about this scraping operation? And
[40:26.460 --> 40:33.540]  if that was before a month ago, why did Facebook not inform the public about it immediately?
[40:33.540 --> 40:39.420]  We looked into this and understood it more over the last few days as part of the audit
[40:39.420 --> 40:55.140]  of our overall system. Again, they're trying to make when their whole business model is
[40:55.140 --> 40:58.840]  tracking everything you do, giving it to everybody, selling it, letting third parties
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.860]  come in. They're trying to all make it about one company again. And they just discovered
[41:02.860 --> 41:09.780]  this last month. This is ridiculous. Continue that controls. It's right in your privacy settings
[41:09.780 --> 41:14.340]  that controls whether people can look you up by your contact information. Most people
[41:14.340 --> 41:19.100]  have that turned on and that's the default, but a lot of people have also turned it off.
[41:19.100 --> 41:25.180]  So it's not quite everyone, but certainly the potential here would be that over the
[41:25.180 --> 41:29.820]  period of time that this feature has been around people have been able to have been
[41:29.820 --> 41:36.300]  able to scrape public information. If you have someone's phone number, you can put
[41:36.300 --> 41:42.620]  that in and then you can get a link to their profile which pulls up public information.
[41:42.620 --> 41:48.020]  So what they're doing is they're trying to conflate public scraping or spiders, web
[41:48.020 --> 41:52.940]  crawlers, that's what search engines do, with what Google does having all the things you're
[41:52.940 --> 41:57.220]  looking up and you're doing and scanning your private emails since Gmail started and
[41:57.220 --> 42:02.260]  collating that data and listening to over the web microphone since 2006. They told shareholders
[42:02.260 --> 42:06.940]  they were. We wrote about it and people couldn't believe it. They said, this is a lie. Jones
[42:06.940 --> 42:13.060]  is insane. They're not using the web audio in your computer to listen to you. And it
[42:13.060 --> 42:17.460]  also said in the press release to shareholders. And now we're having a pilot program to watch
[42:17.460 --> 42:24.460]  them over the webcam. And they had an example. If a dog barks, we even though you're not
[42:24.460 --> 42:30.700]  searching for dog food, we know to then direct advertisements for dogs. Oh, what a sweet little
[42:30.700 --> 42:35.460]  thing. They're just listening about the dog. They're listening to you. And now ESPN goes,
[42:35.460 --> 42:38.740]  hey, let's dial into somebody's smart TV and see what they're doing. Hey, look, there's
[42:38.740 --> 42:47.900]  your parents. They're over there in Serbia watching now. I told you this 20 years ago
[42:47.900 --> 42:54.780]  because I'm the bad guy. See. No, you get next decade's news today today, but it's a
[42:54.780 --> 43:01.460]  double edged sword. The prostitutes have data as well. Get ready for Alex Jones to invade
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.940]  the swamp. Jones is set to give a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[43:06.940 --> 43:12.300]  on April 10th, during which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti free speech lawsuits targeting
[43:12.300 --> 43:16.700]  his First Amendment rights. Numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting
[43:16.700 --> 43:22.340]  media attention and defaming Alex Jones and Info Wars' reputation. Jones will address
[43:22.340 --> 43:27.860]  the left's new tactic of trying to bury Info Wars under a deluge of lawsuits, several of
[43:27.860 --> 43:33.020]  which do not rest on any sound legal basis. While the mainstream media and many on the
[43:33.020 --> 43:37.780]  left routinely celebrate these lawsuits when they're first filed, those same people are
[43:37.780 --> 43:42.740]  noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse. These lawsuits are yet another attempt to
[43:42.740 --> 43:48.460]  shut down free speech and they are doomed to fail. Alex Jones will go live at 9 a.m.
[43:48.460 --> 43:53.820]  Eastern from the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. You can find live streams of the press
[43:53.820 --> 43:59.100]  conference at infowars.com. Leigh-Anne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[43:59.100 --> 44:02.940]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[44:02.940 --> 44:09.140]  in Full Wars Live. It'd take hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[44:09.140 --> 44:13.980]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[44:13.980 --> 44:19.460]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone.
[44:19.460 --> 44:23.100]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body. Then it's got all the minerals
[44:23.100 --> 44:27.140]  and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it. Our latest product that goes
[44:27.140 --> 44:33.220]  great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super
[44:33.220 --> 44:38.060]  blue silver immune gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement
[44:38.060 --> 44:44.180]  with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it.
[44:44.180 --> 44:49.940]  So thank you all for remembering infowars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[44:49.940 --> 44:53.380]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake. It's so essential to spread
[44:53.380 --> 44:59.780]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[44:59.780 --> 45:04.180]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.180 --> 45:08.900]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:08.900 --> 45:14.620]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[45:14.620 --> 45:20.500]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[45:20.500 --> 45:25.300]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360
[45:25.300 --> 45:29.500]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year. And now
[45:29.500 --> 45:34.980]  we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:34.980 --> 45:38.740]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future
[45:38.740 --> 45:43.820]  of this country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[45:43.820 --> 45:49.340]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[45:49.340 --> 45:53.220]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[45:53.220 --> 45:56.980]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[45:56.980 --> 46:03.700]  with Z Shield and infowarslife.com. Info wars life brain force plus is our number one selling
[46:03.700 --> 46:07.580]  product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason. Going back about five years ago, we
[46:07.580 --> 46:11.900]  did research on what top selling new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best,
[46:11.900 --> 46:16.940]  what people liked and we made it even stronger. Then we cut the price because leading competitors
[46:16.940 --> 46:23.540]  have five to seven times markup. We only have 150%. Then it helps funder operation. Well,
[46:23.540 --> 46:31.740]  now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real
[46:31.740 --> 46:36.540]  red pill that takes about seven days to kick in brain force takes about 30 minutes, but
[46:36.540 --> 46:42.820]  the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge. They're both 50% off individually
[46:42.820 --> 46:49.660]  or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo and infowarslife.com. But it's
[46:49.660 --> 46:54.500]  got to end in a couple of days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out
[46:54.500 --> 47:04.300]  infowarslife.com to get your brain force plus and real red pill today. You're listening
[47:04.300 --> 47:14.780]  to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.780 --> 47:23.460]  Yeah, Trump just signed the order deploying troops instantly to the border, actually constitutional.
[47:23.460 --> 47:32.540]  Yes, that means hell's freezing over. But don't worry, Mueller's looking into Russian
[47:32.540 --> 47:36.340]  oligarchs now and looking into the United Arab Emirates and looking into Canadian deals
[47:36.340 --> 47:42.060]  and looking into stuff 20 years ago and just still can't find anything. Doesn't know what
[47:42.060 --> 47:47.060]  to do. He's got a few of his informants they put in the Trump campaign, very low level
[47:47.060 --> 47:51.420]  who they are doing a little fake, you know, one month sentencing stuff on them and other
[47:51.420 --> 47:57.500]  things so they can not everybody know that they were little super canaries put in there
[47:57.500 --> 48:04.500]  who found nothing because there was nothing. Roger Stone's joining us in the third hour.
[48:04.500 --> 48:10.180]  I'm sick of the whole Russian thing like you are, but I want to go back over the WikiLeaks,
[48:10.180 --> 48:15.380]  the top 100 things that are in there because look at how they've singallied or misdirected
[48:15.380 --> 48:22.100]  again with a magic trick. It's not the hundreds of thousands of emails and Alistair Crowley
[48:22.100 --> 48:26.980]  rituals and fixing the debates and giving Hillary the questions or Hillary and her people
[48:26.980 --> 48:32.900]  talking to CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times every day
[48:32.900 --> 48:40.580]  having daily meetings with Google. How exhausting is this? You asked how Strock and his girlfriend
[48:40.580 --> 48:47.020]  had something like 50,000 messages to each other in two years. These people are just
[48:47.020 --> 48:57.300]  like typing away to each other. It's insane. They're like maniacs and when you pull back
[48:57.300 --> 49:03.380]  from it, they have hoisted themselves on their own petard. They've dug their own pit for
[49:03.380 --> 49:09.380]  themselves and at the same time though, just like they've gone, oh, everybody publicly
[49:09.380 --> 49:14.300]  has spiders and webcrawlers. We didn't do anything at Facebook. No, you just use everybody's
[49:14.300 --> 49:19.260]  personal data and sold it and let groups in 5,000 times worse than anything Analytica
[49:19.260 --> 49:26.380]  ever thought of over in Cambridge. And you just hope everybody's such country bumpkins
[49:26.380 --> 49:30.460]  that we don't figure it out. It's like my lawyers looking at all these fake lawsuits
[49:30.460 --> 49:35.260]  with my father like, we've never seen anything like this where it's like 60, 70, 80 pages
[49:35.260 --> 49:40.060]  of lies about you. None of it's even true. The exhibits aren't even right. It's not
[49:40.060 --> 49:46.100]  even your website. We did do our attraction. We did pull it the day of the event. None
[49:46.100 --> 49:51.420]  of that's true. The slapback provision means we could have all these attorneys fees and
[49:51.420 --> 49:56.340]  then get them for all those and then damages and even lawyers tell the Daily Beast, man,
[49:56.340 --> 50:04.020]  you really screwed up. What are you doing? These lawsuits and they don't care because
[50:04.020 --> 50:08.900]  I think they think I write to work on a horse. I'm like, oh my God, I'm getting sued by another
[50:08.900 --> 50:16.060]  Hillary Clinton law for what am I going to do? She sucks. I better shut down and go away.
[50:16.060 --> 50:21.540]  They say they said they're going to come after me if I don't go away and then put my tail
[50:21.540 --> 50:27.500]  between my legs. I didn't know the globalists were bad, mean people. Why, they just threatened
[50:27.500 --> 50:42.300]  me. I better go away. I'm scared. Yeah. Your fools, fools, idiots have no idea. And the
[50:42.300 --> 50:44.900]  people that really don't know what they're doing are the plaintiffs that they've jacked
[50:44.900 --> 50:51.620]  up to do this. But after all of your running around wearing a hammer and sickle t-shirt,
[50:51.620 --> 50:58.820]  you're a grown man. And that tells you a lot, doesn't it? Hammer and Sickle's got 200 plus
[50:58.820 --> 51:10.140]  million deaths under its belt. I mean, that's the symbol of pure death, the red terror right
[51:10.140 --> 51:16.580]  out of the globalist loins. I have Communist Party USA suing me in Cleveland. I have a
[51:16.580 --> 51:21.260]  guy wearing a communist shirt suing me here in Austin. It's just, it's like, you know
[51:21.260 --> 51:31.980]  a man buys enemies, don't you folks? So what can I say, my friends? I came to fight bullies
[51:31.980 --> 51:36.420]  and well, they found me and I think they're used to messing with people that aren't here
[51:36.420 --> 51:42.660]  to fight. I came to fight. Once the fight starts, I don't have any butterflies. I don't have
[51:42.660 --> 51:50.740]  any anxiety. Once the crocodiles y'all start brain turns off, fight mode kicks in and then
[51:50.740 --> 51:56.180]  the winning starts happening like it always does with you guys. You always pick a fight
[51:56.180 --> 52:01.820]  with the good guys and you always can't believe what happens when they stand up and then the
[52:01.820 --> 52:06.900]  begging for mommy always kicks in. I don't know why they always beg for mommy. They always
[52:06.900 --> 52:14.740]  beg for their mommies. They always cry when their head metaphorically is bouncing off
[52:14.740 --> 52:22.940]  the concrete. I don't know why, but that's antipathoria, little scrubly creatures running
[52:22.940 --> 52:28.140]  around delusionally beating up men, women and children. We're fighting fascism by beating
[52:28.140 --> 52:34.380]  people and committing arson. So here we are talking about Antifa in the general. Let me
[52:34.380 --> 52:37.500]  just get into the big news here because it's not just Antifa going around beating people
[52:37.500 --> 52:42.340]  up deranged Texas councilwoman charged for verbally attacking teenage girl in Trump
[52:42.340 --> 52:47.780]  shirt. Let's go ahead and go to the Houston TV station with the report on a deranged liberal
[52:47.780 --> 52:53.500]  in Texas. So flipped out their little bully bases. Houston's now blue that they think
[52:53.500 --> 52:58.860]  you're not going to make America great again. This is the hatred of America. Here it is.
[52:58.860 --> 53:02.780]  Tonight a teenage girl tells us that one of our local council members screamed obscenities
[53:02.780 --> 53:08.340]  because one of the girls with her was wearing this shirt. Now West University place councilwoman
[53:08.340 --> 53:14.260]  Kelly Burke is being charged in the case. It was Saturday night at tiny's milk and cookies
[53:14.260 --> 53:20.740]  for teenage girls buying cookies for kids at their church when a tall short haired blonde
[53:20.740 --> 53:29.460]  woman came up to them and screamed at them. Grab them by the girls. That woman the family
[53:29.460 --> 53:35.620]  later learned was West U councilwoman Kelly Burke and she wasn't finished. She yells it
[53:35.620 --> 53:42.380]  again. At that point the girls are getting kind of scared and then the woman starts you
[53:42.380 --> 53:48.740]  know going mega, mega, mega. Mega means make America great again. You see one of the girls
[53:48.740 --> 53:54.940]  was wearing this Trump make America great again shirt. The girls left without a word.
[53:54.940 --> 54:06.660]  They were scared. They were absolutely scared. My little girl essentially wanted to know
[54:06.660 --> 54:10.900]  if this woman was going to hurt her. West U police referred the case to Harris County
[54:10.900 --> 54:16.100]  which filed a disorderly conduct charge against the councilwoman who when we knocked at her
[54:16.100 --> 54:22.220]  door asked what are you doing at my house. You know I were here at your house. She said
[54:22.220 --> 54:27.860]  she had no idea because of the disorderly conduct charge. She said I'm putting my kids
[54:27.860 --> 54:35.300]  to bed. Go away. Adults can't behave towards children like that. Period. I would be just
[54:35.300 --> 54:41.940]  as angry if any parent said this to my child but as an elected official I mean I'll let
[54:41.940 --> 54:47.860]  you know her voters handle this matter. But of course she then lied and said I don't know
[54:47.860 --> 54:51.900]  what you're talking about. That's exactly how they act. It's like babies. They either
[54:51.900 --> 55:00.520]  scream murder, criminal, communist, Russian, traitor. We're going to get you. You've seen
[55:00.520 --> 55:03.460]  the videos all over the country and then they try to pour coffee on you or they attack
[55:03.460 --> 55:09.260]  you or they go Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump stuff like that. It's like a three year old
[55:09.260 --> 55:16.220]  attacking you and they love to go after women and children. I mean I had a couple of these
[55:16.220 --> 55:19.300]  guys trying to start a fight with Rex. He's still a pretty big guy but they didn't start
[55:19.300 --> 55:22.580]  the fight with me off the airplane. I'm getting the luggage. He's taking his luggage. He's
[55:22.580 --> 55:26.740]  like 30 feet away and two grown men walk up and go one to throw down. Told you that story
[55:26.740 --> 55:32.300]  just when we got back from Colorado three weeks ago. And then they said after your family,
[55:32.300 --> 55:36.100]  there were my daughters and my wife and they looked at my family because they wanted to
[55:36.100 --> 55:40.780]  say I don't have your kids. They always say that. I'm like, oh yeah, dude. And they just
[55:40.780 --> 55:44.740]  F your family. In fact, he said that to Rex right there. I saw that by the time I got
[55:44.740 --> 55:52.260]  my luggage was coming over. Just F your family. F your family. Because again, the globalists
[55:52.260 --> 55:57.060]  have a religion. Even if they have kids, they hate your kids. They hate Christians. They
[55:57.060 --> 56:02.900]  hate America. They hate, make America great again. It triggers them just like American
[56:02.900 --> 56:09.300]  flags because they see it as the dominant culture. They see themselves as the counterculture.
[56:09.300 --> 56:12.900]  They're the dominant culture. They're funded by the big banks. They're the globalists.
[56:12.900 --> 56:16.220]  They're the problem. I haven't gotten the story linked on drugsreport.com yet, but I
[56:16.220 --> 56:21.220]  will. It's an info wars.com Jamie White article. Sex workers who expose politicians for passing

[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:26.580]  run on. I need to be judicious about this because the news is all so important I've
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:32.060]  only skimmed over 10 or 15 articles I need to drill into some of these and then get even
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:37.660]  deeper into the others but subversion dem governor rebels against Trump moving National
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:47.540]  Guard to border. This is this is this is what we predicted with Matt Bracken a couple days
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:54.660]  ago would end up happening and it all runs together so much is happening was Bracken
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:02.020]  on yesterday no he was on the day before yesterday so he was on Tuesday and I had him on for
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:08.180]  like an hour and we've got to have somebody go over the notes or scan through that audio
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:14.700]  what we call chipmunk speed you know five times faster where I say I'm worried that
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:19.740]  the Democrats will try to block the military going to the border and he concurred we've
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.460]  already seen the subversion this addition in California and all they're doing is try
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.300]  to have a border Mexico has a border if you're a felon and I got a bunch of criminal convictions
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:33.900]  you're you're out of here and this is just spiraling out of control we're going to get
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:38.980]  to that in the next segment I haven't gotten to this yet sex workers to expose politicians
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:46.100]  for passing anti-travelling bill Twitter transgender critic question about police
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:51.020]  banned from leaving the UK you got people being arrested for defending themselves in
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.780]  the UK when their houses are being robbed has been famous cases of that there's new
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:00.540]  ones these are just insane articles and I'm going to be a good boy when we come back in
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:06.380]  the next segment and just go into all of them several of these I've I've already really
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:16.860]  covered like I should but it's just crazy how the whole YouTube shooter thing went away
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.060]  if it had been a right winger oh my god it would be you'd be seeing who the victims were
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.580]  that were shot you'd be hearing from their families it would be the end of the world
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:31.700]  it would be just all gun owners are to blame turning your guns but because this person
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:43.380]  was passionate about fitness veganism with left-wing signs that's the LA Times and who
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.900]  left major warning signs and of course the dad said I think she's violent I think she's
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:55.820]  going to attack nothing was done what is it about these blue states where they just let
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:00.860]  people run wild that are threatening folks I mean it's one thing if you said boy you
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:09.620]  said that to my face I'll call you out the street kick your butt that's clearly figurative
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:14.580]  like slapping somebody with a leather glove thrown on the gauntlet and people shouldn't
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.820]  talk like that I shouldn't talk like that but I've said things like that before but
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.660]  then the next day I've said I didn't mean that obviously I was mad that my dog died
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:27.740]  that day and you know that's why I said that's about congressmanship and man the left they
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:33.940]  ran around and said oh my god we need him arrested they called the state attorney general time
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.100]  magazine called up federal prosecutors they said we want him arrested you're the one saying
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:46.180]  hashtag hunt republicans democrat strategist on TV you're the one saying kill trump everywhere
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:52.660]  and where the secret service visits your Madonna I want to blow up the White House I don't want
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:04:00.780]  any harm on YouTube or on Google or on Twitter or on Facebook or against David Hogg I would
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:04.500]  really hate for something to happen to him because that would turn him into a martyr
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:10.540]  I'm doing this for my family in the information war and we're winning it's the globalist funding
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:15.220]  ISIS in al Qaeda and getting violent and the Antifa attacked people with bike locks and
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:20.820]  burning things and doing all this they only do it in blue cities where they control the
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.220]  police and that's in the Antifa documents from George Horos's son's group that we covered
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:30.260]  last hour think about how sensational that is that they are working with the police in
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.220]  those areas to stand down some of the cops may be good but they're ordered to stand down
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.780]  which I still says their election duty even if you're a low-level cop you do that and
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.060]  then they go around and they are told how much to attack what to do what to break it's
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.620]  why it's always the same simulation break a window knock out something burn and trash
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:52.980]  can kind of simulate everything because it's all trying to get other people to commit crimes
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:58.620]  the leftist are just Judas Goat leaders trying to get others to carry out an attack you
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:02.900]  know if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have it in Fuller's

[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:49.180]  any of the news items we've covered.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:07:00.340]  Long time callers first-time callers agree disagree 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 877-789
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:08.700]  Alex 877-789-2539 let's just start here we knew this was coming I predicted this with
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:17.620]  Matt Bracken on Tuesday because it's just par for the course on the left coast subversion
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:23.740]  governor rebels against Trump moving National Guard to the border but Trump has ways to
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:30.820]  federalize the National Guard dot dot dot kit Daniels article needs to get out there
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:36.700]  Oregon governor Kate Brown Democrat will refuse to deploy state National Guard troops to the
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:41.900]  border if asked by President Trump if at real Donald Trump asked me to deploy Oregon Guard
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.820]  troops Mexico border I will say no yeah there's just Mexican troops down there but that's
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:51.980]  okay Brown tweeted as commander of Oregon's guard I'm deeply troubled by Trump's plan
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:57.700]  to militarize our border well lady you don't have a say during national emergencies and
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:04.660]  we're in one Brown's statement however is trivial and it also Eric is probably doesn't
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:09.140]  even know our powers as governor but it's not a bully conservatives the president has
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.900]  the power to federalize National Guard troops through a variety of ways such as 10 US code
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:22.140]  252 use of militia and armed forces and force federal authority yeah you see how Eisenhower
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:27.740]  had the National Guard looked a little black girls into the schools and Oklahoma and Arkansas
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:33.340]  and Alabama those should pull up some photos of National Guard escorting little black girls
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:45.260]  to school well the president considers that unlawful obstructions combinations or assemblages
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:51.300]  or rebellion which is what California's in against the authority of the United States
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:09:00.900]  make it impractical to enforce the laws of the United States in any state or the ordinary
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:06.540]  course of judicial proceedings like a court order little black kids in he may call into
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:14.100]  federal service such as a militia at any state and use such of the armed forces as he considers
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:24.780]  necessary to enforce the laws or to suppress the rebellion
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:31.460]  and that's George Wallace for the state police yeah let's pull up the National Guard or federal
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:41.060]  troops escort children for desegregation that's the ones I'm looking for now let's continue
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:49.380]  here previous presidents have federalized the National Guard perhaps most famously when
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.860]  president John of Kennedy did so to Alabama's National Guard during the integration of the
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.420]  University of Alabama in 63 a move which took control away from Governor George Wallace
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:05.580]  who we just showed an image of who had opposed the move well you've got a Soros globalist
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:11.460]  UN illegal alien funded operation similar to the one carried out by the UN and Soros
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:19.300]  and Sutherland that smashed in to Europe with 10 million military aged men who are running
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:26.020]  around wreaking havoc imagine you're in small towns you know they got this wild wild country
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:33.780]  hit show out and you watch in the program left this is pretty scary but you think about
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:39.620]  that's a town the middle of nowhere in Alpine Oregon that had these Maharajee people come
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:47.220]  in imagine Germany where there are towns of a couple hundred old retirees and I've seen
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:53.500]  articles where they bring in 4,000 Muslims 80% of military aged men and then order people
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:02.220]  to let them in their house same thing in Italy everywhere else I mean it is cuckoo nest level
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.540]  but it's an invasion and to see what they get away with the globalist and the zodiac
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:11.900]  boats hundreds of day hundred foot long ones literally hundreds and hundreds of day sixty
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.300]  foot boats hundred foot black Zodiacs Soros publicly funds it the media is always like
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:22.940]  Soros doesn't fund that Joe just says Soros Soros Soros no look it up and then Italy
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.860]  finally said we've had enough it's killing tourism it's like a half billion came in
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:32.180]  this year last year they said we're putting an Italian Navy out there to turn these back
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:38.780]  at the hundred mile marker the 12 mile mark from them and boom it was on there it is German
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:44.500]  town of a hundred yeah I show that that article and then we'll show the video German town
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:50.500]  of a hundred gets enriched by 750 migrants but I saw one where it was 4,000 and the town
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:56.220]  of like 200 and something yeah this is Spain famously invaded by North Africa it took the
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:06.860]  crusades the evil crusades to kick them out they had about 80% of it and they sold reportedly
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:12.140]  they think probably more during their couple hundred year occupation a large percentage
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:20.140]  they estimate of the women into slavery all over the Middle East and all over Africa so
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.620]  imagine your town gets grabbed the men get killed your boys get put as galley slaves
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:35.220]  and your girls and your wife get shipped on a galley to be in a sultan's lair but you
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:42.420]  wonder why North African rulers are part white you know why because they had children with
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.780]  the kidnapped Spaniards the Spaniards were blonde haired blue-eyed until that invasion
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.500]  hey whatever the color they are imagine you get invaded you get raped you get taken over
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.300]  that is a form of total domination and that's what Islam did but you go to college they
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:13:02.220]  go the West is evil for the crusades invading the Middle East the West never invaded the
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:09.340]  Middle East until they drove all the way into Poland and all the way into Austria and finally
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:27.020]  people said we've got to do something and so you have the retaking the Larica of Spain
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:32.300]  okay I already read that article there it is I've got so many to get to that's just
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:40.340]  one of them the subversion Trump signs proclamation sitting National Guard to the border 50,300
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:48.700]  Nates stopped at Mexican border March alone up 230% or 203% from last year that's the huge
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:55.860]  surge happening Mexico said they were disbanding it but the evidence is they aren't more than
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.580]  a million undocumented immigrants have received California driver's license Sacramento be so
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:06.700]  they can now vote it is incredible and it's all you in directed these people aren't even
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:14.700]  our enemies but they're getting brainwashed is the problem so that's what's going on on
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:21.300]  that front okay speaking of invasion London's hospitals look like war zones due to gun and
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:30.260]  knife crime Westminster cons London spiral out of control cons response to knife crime
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:35.060]  surge blames Tories London mayors responded to the city's growing crime wave and calls
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:41.340]  for his resignation by once again blaming those on the political right as well as promoting
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:47.060]  a hashtag on Twitter but don't worry 78 year old man arrested for murder at restabbing armed
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.700]  burglar to death in his home he'd been robbed of course repeatedly was sick of it so fought
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:57.780]  back and now he is the ultimate criminal and then that ties into when we return these little
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:05.820]  giblets that I have been mentioning since we're on the subject of the UK Twitter transgender
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.980]  critic questioned by police banned from leaving the UK and they admit they do this they admit
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.260]  they block journalists from coming in journalists going out but if the UK thinks you're going
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:19.580]  to go out of the country to go speak on a subject oh then they try to block you it is classic
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:24.200]  authoritarianism that's coming up and then finally before I get to your phone calls report
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.780]  sex workers to expose politicians for passing anti-travelling bill and then of course the
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:37.660]  big fat super in shallota the big in shallota the gun confiscation has begun in democrat
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:41.780]  controlled zones of the country but they hadn't already gotten the guns all semi autos to
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:48.460]  be banned and $1,000 a day fines until you turn them all in Mr. and Mrs. America because

[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:30.460]  them it's better than pumpkin pie but if they can abuse children out in the open and call
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:37.820]  it medical or call it the rights then they can have the whole world the transhumanist
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.820]  movement said how are we gonna get people to accept brain ships augmentation we're gonna

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:22.260]  in the eighties that only stuff happened in berkeley you pay for that you pay for the
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:29.660]  abortion you pay and then now you've got to watch the procedure sometime it's on youtube
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.380]  now they want to take children as young as six because the mothers and the fathers tell
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.700]  them you're a little girl you're a little boy when they really have the chromosomes the
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:42.660]  genitals another person they can't make a decision they're not of at age if their parents

[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:01.460]  now subversion dem governor rebels against Trump moving National Guard the border but
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:12.220]  first we did a big run of it it's sold out in just two weeks alpha power vital male
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:19.940]  androgen biosynthesis promoter increases physical and mental energy boost sports performance
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:27.660]  helps reduce fatigue and causes amazing in my case libido and I'm gonna be honest super
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:32.220]  no vitality is amazing some of like that formula better we have the anthraplex that
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:36.140]  is so hard to get the ingredients we're basically out of that and won't have it probably for
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:42.460]  a long time and around the office folks have taken the out the power women can take it
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:47.260]  as well and they have said without a doubt it is the strongest thing they've ever run
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:51.420]  into and it's it's also generally seen as safe and healthy and all the rest of it but
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:58.140]  I wanted to have the super souped-up formula of all the known Chinese medicine herbs but
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:04.900]  also the latest science and this is the souped-up Lamborghini Coontosh this is the funny car
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.820]  of these it's really strong it's really organic it's really concentrated and it's got the
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:17.020]  key amino acids and things so that your stomach actually absorbs it of course the capsules
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:20.820]  I forgot a lot of the stuff we have is the capsules that actually also this is designed
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.900]  to go into the stomach but others go into the intestine it's just I mean our stuff's
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.100]  all cutting edge and people that know about these type of things enhancement you name
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:34.060]  it they are just like crazy loving this because again other leading competitors mark things
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:41.140]  up 500 to 700% is the average really they say 700 but I found some of the other competitors
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:46.740]  talking to some of the big companies out there it's like 500 and they say wow you're actually
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:55.180]  putting on average 40% of the cost is in the bottle is in what's actually in the product
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:36:03.860]  not not one seventh but I mean it's incredible so we mark things up 100 150% depending on
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:10.900]  the product and they mark it up five to seven times that's 700% in many cases and we that's
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.420]  why ours are also great it's why they're top rated all over the place on third-party sites
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.220]  because we know we're already a target we know they're already grabbed everything intestine
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.300]  we know they want to demonize it and they don't know what to do bees those doesn't know
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.180]  what to do he's a big supplement seller a bunch of crap most of the time and you know
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.500]  Whole Foods is falling apart the quality is going way down it's all over the news yeah
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.300]  so in many cases I don't want to say snake all they got a lot of great products to Whole
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:36.140]  Foods just that his own Washington Post attached me for selling high quality supplements and
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:41.700]  the left traditionally one thing they got right was how good supplements are how good
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:46.900]  iodine is for you how good I mean it's just crazy absolutely crazy so that never works
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:52.340]  that attack never works can also earn double Patriot points in the month of April Tim had
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.820]  the idea because Patriot day is coming up for the rest of the month instead of 5% on
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.220]  every purchase you do you just click the box and it saves it an account for you for your

[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:10.740]  20% off the already big specials nobody can top that up for reward systems 10% is unheard
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:18.540]  of 2 or 3% is great 5% is on the top end of the standard 10% is redonkulous so again
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:24.100]  out of power back in stock vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter you'll read about all
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:31.180]  the stuff that's in it find out what sold off sold out so fast it is 25% off ladies and

[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.740]  not mad at Tim and I'm not they get busy they didn't take down the brain force and the real
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.420]  red pill 50% off special even though brain force will sell out by next week we won't

[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:12.660]  the next hour than Roger Stone joins us well he's the center of attention right now man
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.620]  and it's the only hope they've got they think to bring down Trump and it's ridiculous and
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.580]  we have all the proof that they've had to change their story now as he produced receipts earlier
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:27.460]  this week that he was in California not in England they said he met with the signs so
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:35.860]  now they go oh we moved our timetable we still have the proof so it's gotten crazy I'm gonna
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:41.060]  demystify this to everybody in the next hour look I'm going to do it I was there I know
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:46.020]  what was really said behind the scenes I know what was said publicly on air and at the FBI
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.700]  questions me which you notice they have and I will tell them exactly what happened but
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:55.820]  I remember what happened and I guess it's a different way of looking things the way Roger
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:01.220]  looks at it versus the way I look at it but I everyone was fighting to get you know what
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:06.340]  I'll do it next hour I'll do it next hour but I told Roger on air when he's on a few weeks
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:17.300]  ago I said Roger remember what you said on my show and I said by the way that proves you
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:23.540]  didn't do anything and he's like well that's not exactly how they're saying it was and I'm like
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:29.380]  dude you didn't do anything they're gonna tie up the knots over how you position that or how
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:35.060]  you see something it's so minuscule how they're saying he's wrong and what he said and it doesn't
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:38.740]  matter Trump when they asked about WikiLeaks he said I don't know who has him the Russian some
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:44.580]  fat guy in his bed in New York I don't know if it's the English and tell no nobody knows you can
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:48.900]  say that somebody did something from Russia it's from South Africa and it could really be happening
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:57.300]  you know from California that's all come out about the CIA planning that on people and setting
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:03.380]  people up in the whole vault seven releases but Trump said if Russia's got it release it isn't
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:08.020]  about who gets the WikiLeaks it's about the illegal crap the Democrats did in there and
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.940]  we're all supposed to just forget and move on from all that well I've pulled up the WikiLeaks
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.860]  and a bunch of the top things that are in there we're gonna have a little time capsule thing here

[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:12.340]  bleep off the stage she basically says arrest people that call people fat but she can say it to me
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:17.700]  they spit ice tea in my face we walked by they said hey alex come over here and i said well
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:21.140]  we're going over to interview first but i'll come back later then i kind of got lost where am i at
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:24.740]  laying goes no they're over there so they're doing a break i see him go to break i jump hey how you
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:30.260]  doing he's acting nice he sees roger stone blows up freaks out then they took our videos down 10
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:36.100]  minutes after it happened because it was the google stage they were on youtube stage as you can see
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:42.420]  right there on screen for tv viewer 2 million views young kerks flip out on alex shones and so
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.260]  that's what happened everybody was jumping on everybody's stages too it wasn't like i was in
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:51.380]  their building on their facility it was in a huge parking garage air conditioned they closed up with
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.540]  hundreds and hundreds of just open air booths and like 10 feet from where i'm sitting there's another
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:02.740]  booth so everybody's everywhere but they said he broke into our studio and came into our building
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:06.900]  and got on and misrepresented it because again they're about preying on their audience but see
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.020]  it's all just open air there's other booths just right over there if you're watching on tv
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:16.020]  but then i showed the right bill clinton shirt and they went crazy and said okay get out of here
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.860]  and then roger stone was 20 feet away not even on their stage they said roger stone's trying to
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:24.020]  take over roger stone's trying to take over get him out of here roger's like if you i'm not coming
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:30.500]  on your show so that's what happened of course it would get big ratings but i would destroy him
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:34.100]  just like you go to a leftist march none of them can talk none of them are allowed to talk they
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:39.780]  have talking points they can't have real debates he named his show after the armenian genocide group
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:46.020]  go ahead adam their total hypocrite morons and he really showed it when they tried to fat shame you
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:52.900]  and every time they every time he bring you bring up your every time chank here's your name the first
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:58.100]  thing he does is oh the lizard people men on mars and things that you never said it's his only he
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:02.660]  tries to just you know kind of almost like hillary does when you call her out on something real she
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:06.660]  just starts to laugh like it's a joke but he'd like to change the subject to something you've
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:13.140]  never done to try to discredit you it would have huge ratings and i would love because i'm not in
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:16.740]  that good a shape or whatever uh and he doesn't look like he's in the best shape but i'm lost a
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:22.340]  lot away from what i used to be i would love to do three rounds mma with him however he wants it
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:29.540]  and we could wear gloves and i would donate two hundred thousand dollars in charity of his choice
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:33.060]  if he'd do it i would the event would raise a hundred million dollars probably on paper
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:36.100]  view but he doesn't want a hundred million dollars he wants to work for soros he wants to work for
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:42.100]  the globalist but yes i challenge how do you say his name i can never say it right i don't even know
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:48.980]  i i just know that ugar the ogre last part he's just known as sink the ogre and then the other
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:56.020]  one's called harpy red red lip harpy and so i challenge them to a paper view event first a
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:02.020]  two hour debate and then a three round if he wants to go bare knuckles we could you know go to some
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:06.180]  state where it's legal too i'd really actually like to do that better who knows he might be a good
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:11.460]  boxer he might beat me if the gloves are he's not gonna win if there's there's no gloves man i
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:18.580]  love to do it believe me so uh we'll see we'll see if the turk can take on the texan that's a
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:26.500]  great idea adam we love you head on of a jones threatens to beat the wonderful young turk up

[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:47.220]  toothpaste my whole family loves it uh i just got a point to make uh my daughter brought to my
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:54.660]  attention my wife and i was uh last night um on facebook and she said dad go to settings and go down
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:54:03.220]  to um ad tracker and then go to go to your um ad information went through all this you know
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:10.500]  and down there under it's back in in the settings hidden it lets me know i've never put on there any
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:18.100]  my political views um for my profile but i you know i do share a lot of your stuff and a lot of
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:24.740]  different things um on trump and it actually puts you in categories oh yeah john gonzalez
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:29.940]  that's one of our social media guys he it lists him as a liberal because his profile is just fun
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:34.100]  he's really just a libertarian he's like me but he has fun on his page he's got some videos with
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:39.220]  you know 10 million views he's a real talent in and of himself he's put a lot of memes out for us
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:42.820]  but he pointed this out to me this week i didn't even know it was announced last year i had something
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:48.980]  i missed that or year and a half ago during the election it told advertisers out of a few dozen
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.220]  categories we had to shoot a video though and show people the control panel beyond what the
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:58.980]  new york time showed him because that's so nazi to tell you what you are and gonzalez is not a liberal
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:04.180]  if you call it what these people are but they say he's one just because he wants to have fun
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.660]  and they recommend people advertise with his facebook but not with the conservatives and so
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:12.980]  they also misrepresent and over sample liberals and say that you know like three quarters of the
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:17.220]  country's liberal spent like 20 minutes in his in the in the interface the other day so they're
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:21.940]  also just like they miss sample and polls they claim everybody's a liberal that isn't again to skew
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:28.580]  advertising over into that to create a feedback loop right well uh a point i wanted to make on
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:35.940]  that is i'm not sure if you broke it years ago when i first heard of um illuminati the one world
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:39.780]  order or any of this stuff which back then i didn't really believe it thought it was just like a
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:48.020]  hoax um there was talk of one day they're going to mark our mailboxes with a red yellow or green
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:54.260]  sticker and that will identify the family that lives there as if they're you know if they're
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:56:01.220]  a threat to the global government if they are they need to be worked on or if if they're yeah
[01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:06.180]  what are those called they're called tacka some things and it was been proven that it is uh
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:10.980]  engineering directive points in some cases some cases it's not some types of it's just the type of
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:15.380]  sign um you're absolutely right but but here it is here is political labeling of who you are
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:20.260]  and through facebook it's saying like a yellow star who you are absolutely it's it's insane

[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:30.660]  you brought that up because nico uh costa brought it up to me a few days ago and he brought it up
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.260]  to me like a year ago and i forgot to cover it or just forgot it was happening and i was like
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.860]  print articles on this it's incredibly goes yeah we told you about a year and a half ago
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.660]  so people don't think i know everything there's a lot i don't know that's why calls
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:47.060]  are so important because you just reminded me of that i remember steve quail
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:55.780]  filled 15 years ago no it's like 18 years ago i guess it was the 2000 census man time's flying
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:02.100]  saying that they were getting drone locations for military to place artillery or missiles
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:09.540]  with the census with gps at your doors in a select level the 2010 expanded and then later it was
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:14.180]  admitted homeland security and all that actually uses that for drone coordination satellite
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.900]  coordination the original zip code is artillery coordination systems uh and our highways were
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.660]  built to move troops everything that's actually true under eisenhower so then i just saw all
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:30.420]  that later get admitted that they were under obama they had drones doing simulated attacks
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.900]  but yeah but there it is there's the different us political segmentation according to facebook
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:39.460]  and of course it says that 75 percent of people are democrats which is another giant fraud of a

[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:34.740]  resist you already got the city's mayors like oakland saying oh ms 13 they're coming to rage
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:42.420]  you they've got warrants but you you can resist that is absolute criminal activity it's sedition
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:48.100]  against the constitution it is racketeering it's organized criminal activity but of course nothing
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:53.540]  happens because they have packed the fbi since the days of clinton and torch dubby and obama
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:57.380]  with globalists doesn't mean there aren't some good fb agents but my god the proof's in the
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:02.500]  pudding here isn't it i mean this ridiculous witch hunt hillary after eyeballs with russians but
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:08.100]  nothing happens it's just it's insane so subversion dim governor rebels against trump moving
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:13.460]  national guard to the border but us code says trump can block that big time but this just shows
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:19.140]  like the city council woman attacking a little girl wearing a make america great shirt these people
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:22.820]  hate the country and if you like a cell doesn't have a wall it doesn't have a cell
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.940]  mexico's got troops on its borders every other country does this is how you conquer a nation
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:37.460]  is no borders this is insane george from california hey alex how's it going good my friend um i don't
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:44.660]  think if you remember me i um i was called like about a two months ago talking about identity
[02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:49.460]  politics and how that affected my family yes i do remember you're more of a libertarian conservative
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:54.900]  you're hispanic uh i i misunderstood you said you were from new york you were from california
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:59.620]  and you talked about people getting your face and all this and and and what it's like to be a free
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:07.060]  thinker yeah it's actually getting worse with my family but that's a different subject i'm looking
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:13.220]  at what's going on california and when are the california people kind of wake up the governor
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:19.780]  is allowing hiv to be transmitted with no punishment or little to no punishment i gotta
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:25.380]  interrupt you i see i can't believe we just speed bumped over that and forgot they said you can give
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:32.260]  people hiv so it's not politically hurtful the folks that have it it'll kill you just like hepatitis
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:36.500]  and and the point is i don't care what it is hepatitis hiv if you knowingly give me that
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:41.140]  you ought to get in trouble that it and they he said you can give blood and then they keep
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:45.620]  tainting the blood supply with it and people little kids get it but again it's like a weird
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:50.980]  vampiric sacrament just like taking six years old to have the genitals cut off and their mommy's
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:58.580]  telling them you're a girl it's a vampiric activity sorry go ahead yeah and that we have
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:05.380]  high level of chemicals that are affecting our children and everyone else and on top of that
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:10.820]  we have forced vaccination and now they're allowing immigrants to grow freely when are we
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.660]  going to wake up when are we going to see the real problem that it's not immigration or anything
[02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:24.340]  like that the problem is democrats and their agenda behind what they really stand for is your
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:29.220]  family still mad at you for supporting trump the economy coming back and and he did a reasonable
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:35.060]  DACA and they said no he went total open borders i mean is your family still mad at you my father
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:44.260]  has not talked to me since i voted for trump he's still ignoring me he doesn't even want to have a
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:51.060]  conversation or anything he keeps it real short when we see each other face to face well that's
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:55.860]  his fault not yours he is truly deranged i don't mean insult your father that is a that is a
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:00.740]  derangement that he gets into the media and all these lies and then it doesn't even trust or love
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:05.700]  his own son i mean even if my son became a liberal or something i wouldn't i wouldn't disown them or
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:09.700]  not talk to him i would convince him otherwise let me guess though was your dad already somewhat
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:18.340]  distant and things to you yeah he's always been on the left he's always been you gotta stick with
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:25.220]  the DACA you you can't go anywhere else the white people are racist well let me ask you this then
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:31.220]  does he's does he support the forced inoculation of hispanic girls with Gardasil i have articles
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.860]  about it killing people and sterilizing them today i mean because i the middle of loraza and
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:41.540]  matcha actually tell hispanics uh that uh corn syrup genetically is like a death sentence for you
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:46.980]  or that you shouldn't take Gardasil particularly hurts hispanics i mean does your dad care about
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:50.260]  that does he actually care about hispanic uh aborting their kids or is he pro abortion
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:55.300]  no he doesn't he doesn't care about any of that of course he wants exactly for killing little
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:05:00.500]  mexican kids again the department of homeland security has acknowledged the discovery of a
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:06.020]  rogue network of cellular eavesdropping devices discovered throughout washington dc the devices
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:12.020]  can be mounted in vehicles drones helicopters and airplanes and are often used by spies and criminals
[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:17.700]  to track an eavesdrop on private cellular devices the agency did not say how many devices were
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:22.340]  detected or where they found them american intelligence and law enforcement agencies
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:27.540]  routinely use similar eavesdropping equipment in the field the stingray units operate by
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:32.820]  tricking a cellular device into locking onto them instead of a legitimate cell tower stingray
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:38.180]  devices allow the user to gain highly specific information on the location of any particular
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:43.780]  phone down to a particular apartment complex or hotel room more sophisticated versions can
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:50.340]  eavesdrop on calls by forcing phones to step down to the older unencrypted 2g wireless channel
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:59.700]  some stingray devices can even plant malware on a phone leon macadoo info wars dot com
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:16.180]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so does he lie
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:32.660]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:40.660]  the
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:46.660]  information uncovered by cnn's k-file raises new questions about long-time trump confidant
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:52.980]  roger stone and his links to wiki leaks on the same day he sent an email claiming he had dinner
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:58.260]  with the wiki leaks founder julie lasange stone warned that quote devastating information
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:03.300]  from wiki leaks would soon be released he said the information involved wrongdoing by the clinton
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:10.820]  foundation stone made of the comment in an august 4th 2016 interview on the info wars radio show
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:19.220]  the clinton campaign narrative the russian favor donald trump and the russians are leaking this
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:26.580]  information this is an opulation because as you said earlier they know what is coming and it is
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:33.940]  devastating let's remember that their defense in all of the clinton foundation's scandals has been
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:40.900]  not we didn't do it has been you have no proof yes but you have no proof well i think julie
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:47.220]  lasange has that proof and i think he's going to furnish it to the american people that same day
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:52.420]  his source says the stone sent an email to former trump advisor sam nunberg saying he had dinner with
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:59.380]  julie and asange the night before stone now says the email was sent in just that he never met or
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:05.380]  spoke with julie and asange our chief political analyst gloria borgers with us our cnn k file
[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:11.460]  senior editor andrew kazinski broke the story for us andrew what can we glean from all of this
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:18.820]  about roger stone and wiki leaks so this uh exchange with stone and alex jones actually provides the
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:25.060]  earliest example of stone claiming to know about forthcoming wiki leaks uh my team had
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.580]  pretty much put together this very extensive timeline uh showing that stone repeatedly claimed
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.380]  to know about wiki leaks drafts on clinton that we're going to be coming we had previously pegged
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:40.340]  the first date he had talked about that is august 10th when he said he had spoken to asange this
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:46.660]  showed him speaking about it on august 4th nearly a week earlier and couldn't simply enough um the
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:53.700]  same day he sent that email claiming to have dined with asange now we're going to go back to your
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.900]  calls the bottom of the hour to come to the waterfront with roger stone who'll ride shotgun
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:03.620]  with us but he's here former head of the trump campaign i remember back at the time because
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:09.540]  sean handy was having julie and asange on the new york times was interviewing julie and asange
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.020]  right after this they all stopped interviewing him because then they said oh he's a russian even though
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:19.060]  there was no proof of that and i remember constantly talking to roger and i remember sending emails to
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:27.140]  asange and others saying hey come on my show come on my show and that's what you do as a journalist
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:32.180]  asange has talked to hundreds and hundreds of publications and been on hundreds of tv shows
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:36.420]  i'm like why don't you come on ours one time he was on with jones dotte here like six seven years
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:41.460]  ago in the camera shot with her i guess he was dating her or something from rikeavec
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:44.900]  and he still wouldn't come on so he's kind of technically been on the show but only sitting
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:50.020]  behind her i'm like hey asange come on that was before he was like the mega huge thing was when
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:54.820]  wikileaks was first going i guess it was like eight years ago time flies but i remember
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:02.420]  just from my memory the conversations with stone and he's like well i've got to go between
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:06.260]  that talks to him sometimes and i hope i can find out what's in there but you know obviously we know
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:09.380]  the clintons are up their eyeballs with russians that's why they're blaming them with the russia
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:15.460]  we know she's in uranium one because the new york times reports 2015 2014 we know that got killed
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:19.780]  so we have all those hours of shows where we accurately predicted what was coming
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:23.380]  they were in deep with the russians so they were going to put that on to trump
[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:29.620]  so because we're there describing all of this they then try to spin it that he met with asange
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:35.380]  and then he had dinner with asange i remember him saying i'm trying to get my contact he told me off
[02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:39.780]  record is a radio talk show host turned out that's come out in the news in new york who does know asange
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:43.780]  to have dinner with him and then they said that he was in the uk but he released his receipts this
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:48.420]  week where he wasn't he was in california so now they've changed it all around and and now
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:51.940]  they're they're in the united era of emirates talking to muslims and they're they're they're
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:57.060]  trying to win canada there there's nothing there it's crazy mewler is on the tarmac with uranium
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:01.540]  samples uh when he's not even the fbi director to the russian intelligence agencies they're the
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:07.060]  ones transferring the iranian i mean you look it's so incredible that stone accurately predicted
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:12.420]  that they were going to go with this whole russia gate thing and so he exposed russia gate before
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:17.860]  it happened so they made him the central figure in russia gate as a punishment is that an accurate
[02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:24.500]  way to say this roger alex uh my favorite part of this is the way that they pull down an interview
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:32.180]  that we did on august 4th and their headline says uh newly discovered uh exposed and so on it's been
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:38.740]  hiding in plain sight uh on our exactly they act like big syndicated shows with more viewers and
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:44.100]  listeners than them are secret well it's on our youtube channel it's been available through the
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:50.260]  info word site we have a lot of great stuff there that julie asange uh said that i predict this is
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:57.620]  devastating is because as early as july he's been tweeting that charles or tell told me that he had
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:04.980]  heard it from james rosen of foxwood of fox news and it was uh it was or tell who i have enormous
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:11.300]  respect for as a researcher and analyst of the corruption of the clinton foundation uh it was
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:16.180]  centered around the clinton foundation and i remember our private conversations i remember
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:20.580]  our private conversations and i said well then how do you know and you said fox news you told me
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:26.020]  all the names off record i remember all these conversations now ironically or tell turns out
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:32.260]  to be uh incorrect yes i say in my speech that i have been i've communicated with asange
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:36.740]  there's some showmanship there i'm overselling it but i do have a confirming source who was
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:41.460]  sure i mean technically if if you're communicating through another journalist with someone that in
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:46.020]  a way that is communication but but then they're going oh you lied you said you were in communication
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:51.780]  but you weren't it go ahead well it's and it's why i did not want to disclose this journalist's name
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:57.140]  to the committee i resisted initially when congressman trey gowdy appealed to me to give it in the
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:02.100]  best interest of clearing the whole thing up i gave his name i feared professional reprisal
[02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:08.100]  against him in fact he was fired and by the way i said any work and the story broke i want to be
[02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:14.020]  clear we are always very honest on the show but i will not give up sources and many times i will say
[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:18.020]  we've talked to well if i know a journalist who's trusted and they've talked to this person for me
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:22.500]  i say we've talked to because we're just leaving sources completely out of it that is completely
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:28.500]  normal well so and then in my speech to the southeast rower republican club i say that i
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:33.060]  have been in communication while technically yes through the black channel through the
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:38.180]  confirming source and i believe the disclosures pertain to the clinton foundation information
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:45.300]  i learned on july 25th it turns out to be at best partially accurate that was not the focus of the
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:53.860]  disclosures uh again the they have to recycle at cnn in the washington post the padesta falsehood
[02:13:53.860 --> 02:14:02.180]  my tweet says the padesta's the that's two people the donald is one thing the padesta nobody calls
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:08.980]  john padesta they the padesta is referring to john and tony's time in the barrel will come what does
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:14.740]  this mean precisely the Panama papers brought to my attention by dr jerry coursey completely
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:20.980]  exposed the russian business deals of john and tony my tweet refers to both of them i know this
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:27.620]  grows tedious it's tedious for me too alex but the libtards like to recycle the same crap well
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:30.980]  sure i get sick of hearing about it because i lived it and i heard it we wrote the articles
[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:34.900]  and the videos are there and we're all on record and you said they're going to go after trump for
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:38.500]  russia because they're up to their eyeballs and that's all true and you said Mueller's never
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:42.180]  going to stop he's lying to their lawyers yeah and they're going to tell him in january and
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:46.100]  trump's going to get mad and that was true and you said mcmasher will be gone and you said this
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:50.340]  guy'll be gone you picked the months you've got the sources we know that we don't like to give
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:56.180]  up our sources we knew that he was going to go after uh facebook twitter uh amazon it's all
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:01.540]  happening just like we said and again we're doing it for america we have nothing to do with russia
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:08.500]  but it just seems to be going into overdrive now what does this signify out of muller well it
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:13.220]  signifies that he doesn't have anything else look i know that this is a dead end it doesn't matter
[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:20.340]  what i said in an email i'm in the fabric of american politics my i have one million emails i
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:27.220]  guarantee you that's a cornucopia of smoke in mirrors and ideas that never materialized and

[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:01.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:11.300]  sam nunberg
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:21.140]  sam nunberg global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:27.220]  we set the trends but they had uh calbert attacked me again a few weeks ago these they were talking
[02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.140]  about jones keeps bringing up all these weird trends and they come out of nowhere and then
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:35.940]  comes the big trend of the country and the trend of congress that's our real power it's not even
[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:41.060]  the broadcast itself it's the ripples in the pond like our investigative journalist got the
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:47.380]  secret documents from a whistleblower about the total grids in russian dc to seattle washington
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:57.540]  and the stingray systems in 2013 that all broke two days ago in ap with the same documents
[02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:06.500]  yeah get the news today you'll be learning about this five years that's why they hate us
[02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:12.180]  and so stone's in trouble for saying they're going to go after trump on russia gate
[02:21:14.180 --> 02:21:18.740]  from the earliest days because he's been on their butt and it's podesta john podesta that
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:23.860]  writes the talking points that you see them still attacking me with today hillary is still
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:29.300]  in charge of the mainstream media and no matter how bad she hurts that party the media still follows
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:34.180]  her orders no matter how low cnn's ratings get along no no matter what happens msnbc
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.700]  it just continues to unravel now there's this particular rayburn character and you know people
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:48.500]  saw our emails or our text messages half of them are our jokes um i'm not going to show any of them
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:53.060]  because there's a little bit profane mine and yours it's just a little joking back and forth
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:57.780]  we do have time to joke now but it's the exact time of joke you made here when people keep asking for
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:02.740]  things sometimes when i keep asking for things you give me a smartass answer uh but i i never
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:06.500]  heard you say you met with the signs i heard you say you were getting intermediary trying to get
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:10.180]  through to him but again that changes the subject will cover in a moment of what's in the wiki leaks
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:17.220]  but speaking of the joke it's a clear joke that cnn is having a stroke over that they're hyperventilating
[02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:23.700]  over and explain the joke to people it's really simple you have to understand i recommended uh
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:28.980]  sam nunberg at a time when donald trump wanted somebody to work with him on speeches talking
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:36.980]  points scheduling outreach to the republican party uh uh uh speech memos and so on very rarely did
[02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:42.020]  donald trump ever work from a prepared text but he did like to look at memos with statistics and
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:46.900]  factoes and he liked to have a background memo telling him who he was meeting and what the meeting
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:52.020]  was he digest a bunch of stuff and then what what matches up with his own research and gut he goes with
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:58.100]  that essentially the role that young pat new cannon played for a resurgent richard nixon
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:04.740]  sam was fired when he gave too much access to a reporter named mckay coppins at marlago and
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:10.180]  coppins wrote a withering piece which angered trump saying that trump would not only never run
[02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:15.380]  before president but he would never be for president be president how's that story looking
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:22.420]  today mckay in any event uh that got sam fired it was his lack of judgment of letting this viper
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:27.860]  fake news journalist get too close to trump and it wasn't insulting peace trump went on to win the
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:35.460]  presidency i convinced among others uh the the president now to rehire sam uh because he was
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:43.700]  a talented man and capable when sober unfortunately uh during the campaign cori lewdow lewdowski had
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:50.500]  one of his minions go into sam's computer find uh facebook emails that were racist but five years
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:57.940]  ago uh and leaked them my advice to send he denigrated uh uh the reverend al sharpton in those
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:24:03.220]  emails my advice to sam was to call sharpton and apologize and seek his forgiveness
[02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:09.780]  sharpton is a christian man i once used a racial slur regarding roland martin i've apologized for
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:16.180]  it i realized now it was hurtful people make mistakes we are christians uh and sam did that
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:22.180]  but sam was not rehired and he is was virally opposed and bitter over his termination and frankly he
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:29.860]  was for hillary clinton uh when he left my side he went to work for steve bannon uh he became an
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:35.940]  acolyte of bannons he began showing up at bannon's white house office and all the gossip sam had was
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:42.260]  about steve and what steve was up to sam spoke openly alex about steve's presidential campaign
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:47.700]  steve running in the place of trump uh and like uh sir but why does he matter at the point there's
[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:54.020]  a joke email why does this even matter well the reason it matters is motive when i wrote a piece
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:25:00.260]  for info wars saying that bannon should step down which was also carried across many platforms
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:06.260]  uh bannon three days later was a fighter late that night nunberg called me at three o'clock in
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:12.180]  the morning and said that i was a piece up and he would take me down there you have the background
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:16.340]  moe and then he goes into the email where you're horsing around as he quit bugging you about wiki
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.780]  leagues like like i was everybody else was you did the joke oh yes i'm having dinner with him
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:26.100]  yeah and here's the great park in in his response he says that's great can i have his email i'd like
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:32.340]  it to pass it on to charlie gasprino about fox who wants to interview him he took the bait he's a
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:38.580]  chump he bought it but that doesn't mean it happened as you know it's an attempt to reinflate
[02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:42.980]  the entire russian collusion narrative and distract us from what is really let's go back in
[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:46.580]  fact can you guys pull it up trump says release the wiki leaks tells rush to release the wiki
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:49.780]  leaks trump's like i don't know anything about rush i'm not getting money from them but i don't
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:54.740]  care who has it whoever has killery doing all this illegal stuff whoever's got the missing emails
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:26:00.500]  release emails why don't we talk about what is in there in fact we'll do this summer we take calls
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:06.500]  we should go back into what's in this this is damning stuff this is russia gay this is manipulation
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:12.020]  this is media control i don't care who who who released the wiki leaks how does that matter
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:17.300]  we have the crimes they committed this is an important distinction though when donald trump
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:22.340]  goes public saying russia if you have donald trump if you have hillary's emails release them
[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:28.500]  those are not the emails that are ultimately published by julina sanj no one has those missing
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:35.860]  emails this is like going to war with iraq over their role in 9 11 it makes no sense whatsoever
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:41.140]  but that doesn't stop chuck todd from asking me i meet the press you didn't tell trump what was in
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:46.980]  these emails before he called on russia to release them they're not the same emails it's typical fake
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:51.620]  news look this is all a distraction from the fact that the biggest fight in the country right now
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:56.900]  is their attempts to silence us in the face of this onslaught they not only want to attack us but
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:02.980]  they want to take away our voice to defend ourselves that's the real fight today my facebook post
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:08.820]  don't reach the hundreds of thousands they used to i've been banned at bitter at at uh at twitter
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:14.100]  they are monkeying with me on youtube as they are with the with the war room as they are with the

[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:30.660]  why is info wars so powerful why are we so effective why do the global status
[02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:38.660]  not because of me because of you the huge audience and the fact that i studied classic americana
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:42.980]  i studied actually what made the country great i read alex entered the toqueville
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:46.900]  i read the writings of thomas jefferson and george washington benjamin franklin
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:52.100]  because as a young man and as a child it was so entertaining thank god my mom was in history so
[02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:57.540]  was my dad my mom of course went to college and has a degree in history and archaeology but
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:02.260]  uh the point is is that i just grew up hearing all about history going to famous places going to
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:07.300]  the spessonian many times you know and just thought it was great and it wasn't like i was a bookworm
[02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:12.580]  either i was street fighting and playing football in the whole nine yards and uh it was a somewhat
[02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:18.020]  of a hand with the ladies it's just that i wasn't reading comic books i was reading books written
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:23.540]  by julia caesar because every page was a war every page was how many kings he executed and
[02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:28.180]  and how many i mean it was just it was so interesting and then i read all about you know all the
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:35.140]  Pulitzer prize winners of world war two so i got a hand on how stuff works all these fake phd's and
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:39.540]  stuff these were enough books to get the professor to let them pass so they go drink beer and eat
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:44.820]  pizza and play volleyball or you know play frisbee golf or whatever liberals are not knocking frisbee
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:50.100]  golf i play sometimes too the point is is that i really have studied this stuff i'm not a fake
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:54.100]  intellectual people that call themselves intellectuals it's like a title they give themselves
[02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:59.140]  and the globalists want to destroy this country they want to enslave you and your family they want
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:06.580]  total control and i have read their writings i have studied them i know they're in game i know
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:14.340]  their operation as much as hillary clinton does because i've read their writings most of them are
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:18.740]  very very lazy they're just sellouts they'll do the evil stuff i've interviewed all the top
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:24.340]  scientists the professors the patriots all the angles and they hate us because we know their
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:30.660]  blueprint now my only smart side guess was you know how important history was and actually decide hey
[02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:35.940]  i better know this so i don't repeat it but i'm not that big a deal and i want people to know
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:39.940]  they didn't like rocket science we're learning here if you know about globalism and how politics
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:45.700]  and real politic works you're gonna be successful in any business or life you're in how journalism
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:50.980]  works how the real rules of work not burning sources being honorable in business paying your bills
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:56.420]  not stabbing people in the back and in some alpha exercise real alphas don't do that
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:02.340]  i even let people screw me over and stuff because i won't even get the fight with them because i
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:08.020]  want the smart people to go that's who we want to work with that's who we want to trust that's who's
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:15.140]  smart so we're just here telling you how it works folks and they're pissed because they listen and
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:20.980]  they go yeah he really knows in fact the globalist i'm told listen to kind of even figure out how
[02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:25.620]  their own system works because most of them don't even know really i've been told what we cover here
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:30.420]  in the wrong hands could be very dangerous i mean seriously i guess some people learn the
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:34.980]  stuff decide to join the other side but i'm betting on you humanity i'm gonna go to these
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:39.860]  calls roger's bounce the hour with you riding shotgun on cornucopia of issues but but watch
[02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:46.100]  Mueller's endgame here and uh other key tedbets well here's where i think their vulnerability is
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:55.780]  alex see i have believed since uh uh january 20th of 2017 that i was a subject of a fysal warrant
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:37:04.340]  an illegal unconstitutional warrant now confirmed had a probable cause therefore my emails are
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:10.180]  you know be most likely being poured through in the manifold case the government is specifically
[02:37:10.180 --> 02:37:15.540]  denying the manifold was ever under surveillance even though numerous news organizations that are
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:21.380]  reputable have reported otherwise that he was then it was turned off then at the time he went to
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:27.860]  work for donald trump guess what the deep state turned it back on so uh that is where their
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:33.060]  vulnerability is i may have to go into the federal courts to get the facts here ed Klein
[02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:37.860]  confirm them independently from the new york times and therefore my civil rights have been
[02:37:37.860 --> 02:37:43.620]  violated my civil liberties have violated there is no probable cause that ties me to the russians
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:48.740]  i'm being uh i'm under surveillance because i support donald trump for president because i'm
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:55.300]  on info wars and i tell people the truth and it drives them crazy that's what this is really about
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:38:01.380]  muller appears to me to be a man still looking for a process crime he can examine this all he wants
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:06.740]  we and i you and i know this is a dead end we don't have any advanced notice of the source
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:11.940]  contents or exact timing of the wiki leaks disclosures in fact you and i expect them to be
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:18.420]  october 1st they're not they end up being october 6th and guess what just as james rosen a fox told
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:27.300]  charles or tell they turn out to be devastating yeah i mean remember i was mad at a son i was
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:32.260]  mad at a son with you on the show for not coming on the show or contacting us back when i was
[02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:37.220]  contacting him i called him a butt plug i know you were very upset when he didn't immediately
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:42.580]  come forth but many didn't read what he said on october 1st he held oppressive ed many expect
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:47.860]  there would be disclosures at that time no he announced a schedule of disclosures that began
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:54.660]  the following week october 6th he drops a payload so our sources are essentially right he ultimately
[02:38:54.660 --> 02:39:00.260]  does produce we're wrong about the day at that time i was told that his one of his attorneys
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:04.900]  daniel ellsberg had concerns about assange's personal safety remember what's moving to the
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:10.500]  calls they tried to drown drone this guy let me just say this we ought to make a documentary all
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:14.100]  of us should make a big deal about what's in the wiki leaks because it all turns into roger
[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:19.060]  stoner did he talk to assange which didn't happen who cares instead of the devastation of their
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:24.260]  criminality that is in these things we should be talking about what's in the wiki leaks but you
[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:28.820]  are absolutely right the whole thing is in effort to distract from the content of this devastating
[02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:34.900]  material it shows the epic corruption and greed of the clinton's it shows the manipulation of the
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:41.780]  system to cheat bernie collusion with the medium collusion with the media collusion with the u kranians
[02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:47.860]  collusion with some russians it's not donald trump will get 145 thousand dollars from the russians
[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:53.620]  for his foundation it's not donald trump will get a half million dollars in a speaking fee from a
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:40:00.420]  russian oligarch who's close to vladimir putin no that's bill and hillary clinton so these emails
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:06.740]  are devastating and you know the key thing alexis no one has ever questioned their authenticity or
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:12.580]  their accuracy all they try to do is distract us from the content shows that america was right
[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:17.060]  when they rejected this corrupt klepto that's right now they're just throwing now they're just
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:21.060]  throwing fits on us while the country comes back the border comes back when we deliver i want to
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:24.740]  go to george we're going to the other college as well thanks for being patient folks george got
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:28.500]  caught up before you came on it was something about his dad that's really mean to him because he's
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:32.820]  Hispanic uh shing how dare you vote for trump you're a bad guy blah blah blah and i just said
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:37.620]  where is mecha and la raza that say everything for our race those outside the race nothing's the
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:41.700]  motto well okay well then stop have the left try to get your babies aborted because i don't care
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:45.300]  what color your baby is please don't abort him yeah i'm not enough for killing babies i mean i'm
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:52.020]  a real bad guy and don't take Gardasil shots or in mexico they say it's mandatory for all girls
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:56.260]  11 and older and i've got articles right here where it's killing more people just today
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:01.460]  and where it's connected to sterilizing people and reducing fertility so see i'm such a racist white
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:05.220]  guy i don't want hispanic women sterilizing themselves yeah i don't want a big centralized
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:10.420]  government doing that that's pure evil i don't go oh gee some leftist hispanics get turned against
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:14.900]  because i'm white so let's just kill all of them that's the leftists that are actually using the
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:20.420]  Hispanics that live as a weapon against the free market in america and the west but trying to kill
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:23.940]  as many as they can along the way so george that you got cut off by the break i want you to have
[02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:28.500]  the floor shortly to talk about your dad that's how you think outside the box i would challenge him
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:33.460]  on Gardasil on the left pushing abortion and just say okay if you're for the raza i'm for the whole
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:38.740]  raza the whole human race then explain to me pop why you just think uh the el diablo is el gringo
[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:44.980]  of el norte go ahead that's the thing that i've been trying to argue with him but again he does
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:51.780]  give me the time of day the thing that i find ridiculous is uh where's la raza with all the
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:57.300]  killings that have been going to mexico where's la raza with all the kidnapping child trafficking
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:04.180]  and drugs smuggling that's been going on in mexico you know that that's totally pop no no no
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:07.460]  they've been hooked him with they've caught la raza and mentioned members here in austin
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:12.020]  with slaves in their basements because the family didn't pay the extra money to coyote him up here
[02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:16.980]  they demanded more they've caught them you know the city council members brothers you name it
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:22.580]  exactly they are the mexican mafia preying on hispanics that try to keep hispanics in line

[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:16.900]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:22.820]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:28.820]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting

[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.540]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:45.220]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:50.900]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info worse life

[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:53.300]  know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support
[02:46:53.300 --> 02:47:01.780]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:20.980]  by the way i'm not at liberty to get into this but i am going to follow a big lawsuit
[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:24.420]  the next few days to counter people a little bit attacking me and lying about me but most
[02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:32.020]  importantly hurt my family and then i am preparing to file counter motions and then and then and then
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:39.540]  injunctive relief with a bunch of these cases i can only tell you this we didn't figure this out
[02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:43.380]  it's about a year ago what was going on we've got about three deep of these lawsuits they're not 13
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:51.700]  where they would say we don't want anything just say you're sorry
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:59.540]  so i'd say okay and they'd say okay we're suing you we don't want anything to say you're sorry no
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:04.580]  i'm not going to do that okay we'll give you money no and the number went up so i want to explain
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:10.180]  something they just want the pr but i realized they were saying the precedent that i'm a bad guy
[02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:14.420]  i'm fake news i'm being sued so then i started saying no i'm not gonna do that so the number went
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:19.220]  up and the lawyers are like my god take the money you know just so i'm being sued and paid money
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:24.820]  but then i said watch the third one or the fourth one will be bigger and then and sure enough it
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:33.380]  happened so now i figured this out so i'm getting all the litigators all lined up and they're pretty
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:40.180]  much lined up and we're going to hit people hard and even daily beast with this latest lawsuit
[02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:46.500]  said this is really dangerous he's got total slapback provision there's not a lawsuit here
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:51.380]  the word was dangerous and said why did these lawyers even let this guy do this
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:58.020]  they even used exhibits that weren't our website we did retract a little picture that
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:01.620]  wasn't the shooter like everybody else did and we did remove it we did do a retraction
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:06.660]  with it the statutory time but they say we don't in the lawsuit i mean it's it's it's it's it's
[02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:11.940]  crazy but what it's designed to do is create the illusion that i'm in trouble i'm going down we're
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:17.460]  going down we're frauds because cnn is going down ms mbc is going down their ratings are flatlined
[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:23.300]  everything in the globalist system is collapsing so it's just intimidate and tie up people that are
[02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:26.980]  fighting for freedom but all it does is show americans wait they're not just going up our second
[02:49:26.980 --> 02:49:33.220]  amendment they're going at our first amendment as well but let me just say this we've been able
[02:49:33.220 --> 02:49:40.740]  to knock out six of these suits and it's probably cost us two hundred thousand dollars to knock those
[02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:47.220]  out that sounds like a lot it's not with lawsuits these others now the university of georgetown
[02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:52.900]  suing me that is the vatican the law department and the lawyers look at they said we can't believe
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:58.580]  a lot of departments never done this they follow the 70 page anti-free speech things saying overturn
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:04.500]  the first amendment that's what it does i'm doing a press conference on a lot of issues coming up
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:11.620]  next weekend dc i'm not going to get to it until then but this is big and i'm quite frankly honored
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:14.980]  that we've been chosen for destruction not everybody else because we are getting the
[02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:19.060]  main serving of the attack i want to go to the calls we're gonna go to sam and jay and dan and
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:24.260]  michael and cabin and we'll go to all of you before uh the great john rubbport comes on so i'll go
[02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:28.020]  the next hour get your calls i swear i'm getting to him so thanks for holding but just briefly roger
[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:33.140]  it's a blessing and a curse there's people rally to us they get it but then the globalists just
[02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:37.780]  think people are going to get punched drunk to the assaults but it's open season on you and i
[02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:43.380]  particularly info war just in 60 seconds why do you think it's such open season well because they
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:49.860]  have nothing else uh and because they desperately want to control the internet for 2018 and 2020
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:56.580]  that requires silencing us silencing us requires phony trumped up lawsuits that can then be pointed
[02:50:56.580 --> 02:51:04.260]  to saying i you see jones is being sued for grooming a young man for gay sex for example
[02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:10.180]  the smears are ubiquitous uh you know and by the way the complaint says he never said
[02:51:10.180 --> 02:51:15.220]  anything sexually to me and he was here 14 years but i just felt like it because they
[02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:20.900]  walked in an editing studio and saw a picture of a man flexing muscles that that's the eoc
[02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:26.580]  complaint and they want to meet with me and i just said just sue me let's go this is insane crap
[02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:32.260]  it's it's character assassination but i remind you of what i said in the yeah believe me i ain't
[02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:39.780]  got a groom nobody and i'm not into men it's it's it's asinine alex uh you need to revel in their
[02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:45.620]  hatred if you are not so effective on info wars they would not hate no no my energy levels way up
[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:51.460]  i actually am reveling in it i just don't like people i've been nothing but nice to making up
[02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:59.620]  crap it's it we wear nazi shoes no no they're public i wear black shoes that's what i always
[02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:04.980]  wear cowboy boots or combat boots this is what i wear i don't wear freaking shoes with swastikas
[02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:11.060]  on it it's just who the hell comes up with this crap the democratic party does that's who you know
[02:52:11.060 --> 02:52:17.220]  so i go to los angeles i stay at the london hotel the only piece of the get correct about this whole
[02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:22.500]  thing so they say you're in london i know i saw that i may have to put up with it with the with
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:28.100]  these limtards who are just constantly regurgitating this stuff the hatred that is spewed out at you
[02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:34.420]  uh is the most it's like a torment of hate but it's because you imagine actually walking around
[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:41.700]  with swastikas on your shoes i mean why do they come up with this weird stuff well look we're
[02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:47.300]  talking i really think owens shawar had a great analysis of this the fake news media the day the
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:57.540]  daily beast the the salon huffle slate and so on msnbc cnn they're like drug dealers they're
[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:02.820]  constantly kerning out product all of which is recycled and discredited but dressed up for another
[02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:09.700]  cycle the libtards liberal democrat progressive lunatic masses the trump haters they're like
[02:53:09.700 --> 02:53:14.660]  they're like crack addicts they need this crap because they're so stupid they believe it they
[02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:21.140]  really think there was russian collusion they really don't understand that hillary clinton uh was
[02:53:21.140 --> 02:53:27.460]  an enormous turnoff to the american people and that she ran a lousy campaign and that she is
[02:53:27.460 --> 02:53:34.100]  epically corrupt as is her husband and the american people finally got hip to it they reject all of
[02:53:34.100 --> 02:53:40.660]  that reality for their own world view in which donald trump could not have possibly have one
[02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:46.020]  without the active assistance of the russian state exactly let's go to some calls you're right

[02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:05.460]  yes she felt rejected it's very odd the whole case is odd initial reports say that it had to
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:10.500]  do with a domestic dispute with her boyfriend but she appears to have some grudge against google
[02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:15.460]  as many americans how do we know she's not mark from orc or whatever his name is nano nano

[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:32.340]  on the border no like george washington i know trump and i vote a form or form i'm a new yorker
[02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:38.580]  in fact i have a cousin who's very good friends with uh president trump and um every other country
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:45.860]  has their military on the border not only that he's got to andy jackson great president all in all
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:53.780]  and george washington though he's a guy that set the set the uh proper trend for all presidents
[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:59.940]  stay out of foreign entanglements and protect the country and so it's long overdue to get the troops
[02:56:59.940 --> 02:57:04.740]  down on the border number one and let's recall when gw was president how vincenty fox with that
[02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:10.900]  north american union push over here he was lining up people from south of the border giving them
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:16.980]  backpacks right there himself president vincenty lining up an invasion force giving them survival
[02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:21.780]  gear to make the trek into our country i mean it's literally an invasion if there's any country we
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:27.140]  should be invading it's mexico and show him a look teach him a little respect again and then
[02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:32.980]  we can be good neighbors that again uh second point on the parkland school shooting you know

[02:59:55.540 --> 03:00:14.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he live from austin
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:22.500]  texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and the great john rap report of no more fake news
[03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:26.340]  dot com is coming up roger stones was gonna ride shotgun was for two more segments but looks like
[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:31.060]  he just the skype just got out the miracle of skype has its problems we're talking to michael
[03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:35.300]  new york who's on fire he was just getting into it's normal to have trips on your border and you've
[03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:39.940]  got the globalist and i remember for sent a fox saying invade invade invade if you don't let us
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:44.020]  your racist it's just like what now the democrats have it where legal aliens are voting in a bunch
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:50.260]  of states it's just insane and and again they bring people here put a chip on their shoulder
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:54.580]  then try to soup them up against the government the country it's it's it's it's got to stop ladies
[03:00:54.580 --> 03:01:01.300]  and gentlemen uh but michael in new york finish up your point nation activity essential alex my
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:06.740]  second point regarding the school shooting down in parkland the primary uh blame falls strictly on
[03:01:06.740 --> 03:01:12.260]  the school administration everything else is secondary because after 10 plus years of school
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:17.540]  shootings around this nation and a public school a government school still doesn't have the safety
[03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:23.540]  nets in place to prevent anything happening in their schools that's incredible incompetence by
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:29.140]  the entire school administration principal assistant or the whole you know i've been talking to a lot
[03:01:29.140 --> 03:01:34.660]  of people that that that work within the rower county service department and they tell me that
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:41.460]  there has been a stand down and that the police chief of the sheriff excuse me will be fired by
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:47.460]  the governor that's i i'm i believe that's all true for sure i think the evidence is overwhelming
[03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:52.820]  proving that but even the school administration how does it how does somebody with a gun stroll in
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:56.500]  especially supposedly armored who'd been kicked out who'd been kicked out of here before we're
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:02:01.460]  saying they'd mass shoot who the police all knew about you can see it all it's sick imagine we're
[03:02:01.460 --> 03:02:06.260]  not tough guys but i carry a gun in my car or whatever imagine you're visiting your kid bringing
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:11.780]  him a pizza at lunch something out of the sometimes when i'm not working and or coming to see him after
[03:02:11.780 --> 03:02:16.340]  school or whatever at athletics or whatever he bring him you know some food and you hear shots
[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:21.220]  going off you grab your gun you go in i'm not a coward i'm afraid of kids dying i mean it's
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:27.940]  isn't an instinct for almost everybody to go rush in i mean or are we weirdos just like a house on
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:31.780]  fire you're going strolling by you're going to go try to do whatever you can to see if anybody's
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:37.460]  in here and save whatever you can but you know the schools after 10 plus years of school shootings
[03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:43.380]  around this country and all public schools still do not have safeguards in place to prevent it from
[03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:50.180]  happening in 30 years brother columbine was in like 99 it's almost 30 years and so these people
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:55.300]  this administration is totally to blame they're overpaid they should be fired or fired and salaries
[03:02:55.300 --> 03:03:00.020]  revoked as well as their retirement everything should be revoked and put pressure on the remaining
[03:03:00.020 --> 03:03:04.820]  school administrations they better start earning that overpaid salary they're getting this should
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:11.540]  not be happening in our country at all anymore and last sir i'd like to just say that i hear
[03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:17.700]  yeah i love you guys and dr group he's wrong about not having an herbal means of stem cell

[03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:35.620]  hey i we're going to go to break come back in one more segment take calls but roger briefly
[03:03:36.260 --> 03:03:39.460]  you're there in broward county your sons of sheriffs deputy have met him had dinner with
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:44.820]  him great guy your daughter your wife all of mausam i know you can't get into inside baseball
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:48.980]  you haven't get any info from him but from other people what's it looking like from your intel
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:53.380]  what happened with the stand down or did it not happen well it was a complicated question
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:58.420]  recognize that the previous sheriff albertia republican essentially lost because he was
[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:05.940]  corrupt and tied to a local ponzi scammer scott rosty i uh supported scott israel over him because
[03:04:05.940 --> 03:04:11.060]  he was corrupt even though i had supported the sheriff lamberti in the previous election in fact
[03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:17.860]  i had engineered both their elections uh i hear two different things at the highest level of bso
[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:23.620]  sources tell me that there seems to be some confidence that all the videos and all of the
[03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:30.500]  other tracking systems the radio transmissions the eyewitness reports will exonerate the bso
[03:04:31.060 --> 03:04:35.380]  others on the force tell me that that is not the case and that we're going to learn that
[03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:42.020]  some officers have stood down what's interesting is now suddenly the coral springs police department
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:49.940]  who got the call first and arrived at the high school prior uh to bso i believe uh is it refusing
[03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:54.820]  to answer questions from fd le let's talk about that when you get back one minute get ready for
[03:04:54.820 --> 03:05:00.420]  alex jones to invade the swamp jones is set to give a speech at the national press club in
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:06.020]  washington dc on april 10th during which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti-free speech
[03:05:06.020 --> 03:05:10.900]  lawsuits targeting his first amendment rights numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise
[03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:16.820]  of attracting media attention and defaming alex jones and info wars's reputation jones will
[03:05:16.820 --> 03:05:22.740]  address the left's new tactic of trying to bury info wars under a deluge of lawsuits several of
[03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:28.900]  which do not rest on any sound legal basis while the mainstream media and many on the left routinely
[03:05:28.900 --> 03:05:34.020]  celebrate these lawsuits when they're first filed those same people are noticeably silent
[03:05:34.020 --> 03:05:39.220]  when the lawsuits collapse these lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech
[03:05:39.220 --> 03:05:44.980]  and they are doomed to fail alex jones will go live at nine a.m eastern from the national press
[03:05:44.980 --> 03:05:51.140]  club in washington dc you can find live streams of the press conference at info wars dot com
[03:05:51.140 --> 03:06:10.340]  leon macadoo info wars dot com waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live
[03:06:10.340 --> 03:06:30.980]  from the front lines of the info war all right roger you were getting into
[03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:37.620]  roger county and i understand you you helped get rid of the last sheriff your son's on the
[03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:41.460]  sheriff's department there and what is now known as coward county that you were getting into your
[03:06:41.460 --> 03:06:47.460]  son's a great guy a great patriot of annoying well but but getting back to this whole situation
[03:06:47.460 --> 03:06:53.940]  with uh the other town standing down uh it's just crazy these mass shootings keep happening
[03:06:53.940 --> 03:07:00.020]  in san bernadino or in brow in or in broward county there are or in denver or littleton
[03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:05.220]  they're always in blue areas everywhere it's a red area garland or wherever people shoot the
[03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:10.020]  shooter in a matter of minutes sometimes 60 seconds i mean the school resorts guys are
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:14.100]  they don't play games in red state they kill you in seconds but but but but they always
[03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:20.180]  stand down in blue areas let's recognize that broward county is the single most liberal county
[03:07:20.180 --> 03:07:26.260]  in florida this is a democratic liver liberal bastion with a very large african-american uh
[03:07:26.260 --> 03:07:32.580]  hispanic and jewish population this is the most liberal progressive politically correct county
[03:07:32.580 --> 03:07:38.500]  in the state uh the question here there are two questions one the country the the county does not
[03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:44.580]  have a consolidated 911 emergency service the sheriff is argued for one but some towns have
[03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:50.900]  refused to opt in insisting on taking their own 911 calls that's why the initial call about the
[03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:58.820]  shooter at parkland goes to the coral springs police and they dispatch officers coral springs
[03:07:58.820 --> 03:08:04.180]  police now refusing to cooperate with the state inquiry their officers will not be deposed under
[03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:09.780]  oath by the state unless they are subpoenaed to do so so some kind of cover-up appears to be
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:15.140]  going on the sheriff's office what about the one guy that ran the school safety who stood outside
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:21.460]  of the video i think in his case that we already know the answer he he was a coward despite the
[03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:28.500]  fact that he had 37 years in training for just this moment despite the fact that he taught swat
[03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:34.580]  tactics in these situations to other bso officers despite the fact that his own training had been
[03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:42.820]  upgraded post columbine he froze he went yellow the sheriff said it the president said it sadly they
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:49.540]  appear to be right but are there others we don't know yet sickening sickening i mean i just know
[03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:55.700]  somebody's in a building shooting young people i'm gonna go in uh as you couldn't get while it's not
[03:08:55.700 --> 03:09:00.260]  even like a courage thing it's like an instinct people are killing innocents i want to kill them
[03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:04.660]  and i'm not blood thirsty except when that's happening it's like i want to go kill him you
[03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:09.940]  know what i mean roger it's like a it's it's it's i don't know how you wouldn't go kill this guy you
[03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:15.380]  know i mean i think the good news is that unlike las vegas where there's so many missing pieces no
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:20.820]  videos and so on there's an indelible record of everything that happened in parkland there are
[03:09:20.820 --> 03:09:25.540]  cameras there are sound systems there are monitor i hope they don't tear the building down like they
[03:09:25.540 --> 03:09:31.140]  did in in sandy hook uh let's go ahead and talk to jay in california jay thanks for holding i appreciate
[03:09:31.140 --> 03:09:40.580]  that go ahead that caller's gone let's go to uh another caller but home along is kevin kevin
[03:09:40.580 --> 03:09:45.620]  in the great state of west virginia here on the air go ahead sir hey um alex hey roger i got a
[03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:51.220]  couple things for you alex and then i have a uh a pretty wild curveball question for mr stern a
[03:09:51.220 --> 03:09:56.660]  couple part of question go ahead um number one um with david hog i just agree with you a tiny
[03:09:56.660 --> 03:10:03.620]  little bit on who he is um i think he's a crisis actor and i also believe he's a sacrificial lamb
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:09.060]  i think something's going to happen to him and i fear not i hope nothing does but i have a feeling
[03:10:09.060 --> 03:10:14.660]  they're going to use him well that's what matt bracken says because i've never seen such censorship
[03:10:14.660 --> 03:10:21.380]  to criticize him and misrepresentation there's something weird swirling around him yeah absolutely
[03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:26.340]  um and i know in texas this weekend there's going to be a first and second amendment auditors there's
[03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:34.260]  about 500 of them coming to audit a um a police department that put an ar-15 on a guy that was
[03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:39.860]  walking along and just had his pistol hosted they were not um try to audit that police department you
[03:10:39.860 --> 03:10:44.740]  know and and flesh it out but i'm a little bit concerned with uh the border patrol of the national
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:49.380]  guard coming down at the same time that this is going to happen is that cj grisha you're talking
[03:10:49.380 --> 03:10:58.100]  about i think so yeah we should get him on by the way go ahead um and then for um mr roger um a few
[03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:02.260]  months ago i've been trying to get a i wanted to talk to you about this mr well you're talking to him
[03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:08.660]  now go ahead a few months ago you have been quoted by a miss linda moulton howell of earth files
[03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:16.500]  dot com and uh and and this is in reference to um to uh richard nixon um about uh project houston or
[03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:23.540]  or um project or operation houston i was curious to know if anything if you knew anything about that
[03:11:23.540 --> 03:11:28.100]  and about the three secret meetings that nixon had underneath the white house yeah let's talk about
[03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:32.500]  that yeah they said you were nixon's best friend the last 15 years of his life uh a lot of other
[03:11:32.500 --> 03:11:36.500]  stuff the point is you were in the nixon white house all the only one of the plumbers didn't go
[03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:41.700]  to prison did nixon ever talk about space aliens secret government breakaway civilizations that's
[03:11:41.700 --> 03:11:47.540]  a great question did nixon ever talk about any of that uh there's a story that i think is relatively
[03:11:47.540 --> 03:11:54.020]  credible that comes from one of jackie gleason's wife's uh gleason lived in miami was a great
[03:11:54.020 --> 03:12:01.220]  pal of nixon's they played uh uh uh uh golf together regularly more importantly they drank
[03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:08.660]  together jackie had an enormous capacity for alcohol nixon had almost none uh gleason's wife
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:14.340]  told a credible reporter that her husband told her that gleason once asked the president whether
[03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:21.540]  there was extra extra terrestrial life whether there were ufo's what was the story nixon who'd
[03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:28.500]  had a few pops arranged for a car to take them out to uh the western part of this of the county
[03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:35.300]  near homestead where they went to a government facility and jackie said he saw actually captive
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:42.820]  space aliens and other fragments from space that indicated other civilizations this is in my book
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:48.660]  tricky dick uh the rise and fall and rise of richard m nixon which you can get uh you know
[03:12:48.660 --> 03:12:54.420]  through amazon or through barns noble i think he may even be on the infowars site this is a new book
[03:12:54.420 --> 03:13:00.580]  that i have just uh put forward so we're talking about to the moon without a rocket here exactly
[03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:06.020]  as jackie gleason would say uh so i recently went to a restaurant there was a great picture of
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:11.540]  there it is this is a great picture on the left the great one on the uh pardon me on the left
[03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:20.420]  the one on the right the great one what a couple characters huh well gleason had endorsed uh nixon
[03:13:20.420 --> 03:13:27.620]  in the 68 campaign nixon uh gleason was a wild man when it came to wine women's song and find
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:36.180]  tailoring and he moved his show uh to uh miami beach the fun and sun capital of the world he he
[03:13:36.180 --> 03:13:42.740]  never was dabbled in politics but he made a very effective endorsement spot for nixon in 1968
[03:13:42.740 --> 03:13:47.380]  and which he said look i'm in show business but i'm an american and why dick nixon was right for
[03:13:47.380 --> 03:13:53.380]  america great man jackie gleason loved america you know thanks kevin they're just mad that we
[03:13:53.380 --> 03:13:57.540]  were right and picked trump and now the country's come back so much is happening troops are going
[03:13:57.540 --> 03:14:04.180]  to the border normal stuff's happening i mean they are just so pissed that i guess dad came back home
[03:14:04.180 --> 03:14:09.940]  i mean i don't i don't know what are they gonna do next roger look i still think that the they're
[03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:16.420]  trying to lay some process crime on the president pertaining to comey or or uh oh you know they are
[03:14:16.420 --> 03:14:21.540]  they keep saying like a former prosecutor says that the president can be indicted in put in jail
[03:14:21.540 --> 03:14:26.100]  when that's not true in the constitution he has to be impeached first he's or you'd have every you
[03:14:26.100 --> 03:14:30.900]  know group out there doing it every day so they're you know you're right you've been proven right so
[03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:35.700]  he's gonna announce crimes against kushner or somebody else they're gonna announce the president
[03:14:35.700 --> 03:14:39.620]  a grand jury's indicted and they're gonna try to beat the drum about that that's where it's going
[03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:46.260]  and i guess the president just sits there and lets muler be on tar max with uranium well here's
[03:14:46.260 --> 03:14:50.500]  the point though the president's gaining strength as the economy gets stronger he gets strong and
[03:14:50.500 --> 03:14:54.420]  you're right there's approval writing even their skewed polls is going up which makes him go even
[03:14:54.420 --> 03:15:01.540]  more crazy if he pulls off a peace deal or the denuclearization of north korea uh this is by the
[03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:08.500]  way where the real pity that the tax cuts weren't done earlier weren't done first because they still
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:13.220]  won't have their full effect by the 18 elections they are going to turbo charge this economy
[03:15:13.220 --> 03:15:18.580]  but it will take some time uh it's a little trying to bring down the economy too uh we've
[03:15:18.580 --> 03:15:24.180]  got ravenport coming up after this break we had 20 seconds i my gut tells me trump's unstoppable
[03:15:24.180 --> 03:15:29.220]  unless they assassinate him i think they're gonna try to kill him well we pray against that every
[03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:35.300]  single day we pray for the safety of the president and his family uh but but just getting as many
[03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:40.820]  death threats as i get as many as i know you get alex threats against my wife my children
[03:15:40.820 --> 03:15:48.100]  even in texas they hate this my dogs it's outrageous that they are they are prone to violence
[03:15:48.100 --> 03:15:52.500]  and they're extraordinary but they're only waking us up so they better get ready for the serious

[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:31.220]  john rappa four here sitting in for alex in the fourth hour at info wars
[03:20:31.220 --> 03:20:38.580]  is going to be talking a lot about the bill of rights what is that
[03:20:39.780 --> 03:20:45.300]  certain parts of it but let's start with the story not out of america out of england
[03:20:45.300 --> 03:20:56.420]  richard osborne brooks 78 year old man living in a house on april fourth
[03:20:56.420 --> 03:21:02.020]  week shortly after midnight two thieves enter the house
[03:21:05.940 --> 03:21:14.340]  brooks wife sleeping upstairs there's a fight brooks 78 years old gets into a fight
[03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:21.780]  with one of the thieves the other one runs away during the fight the one thief is stabbed
[03:21:21.780 --> 03:21:25.620]  he's in critical condition
[03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:39.620]  scotland yard tells the press in the aftermath of this that they arrested brooks 78 year old
[03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:53.460]  homeowner on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm the thief dies now says scotland yard
[03:21:55.140 --> 03:22:05.060]  they are arresting the homeowner richard osborne brooks on suspicion of committing murder
[03:22:05.060 --> 03:22:18.820]  what who how what are they talking about a person doesn't have the right to self defense
[03:22:18.820 --> 03:22:23.380]  in his own home suspicion of murder
[03:22:27.460 --> 03:22:29.460]  this goes to the whole issue
[03:22:29.460 --> 03:22:36.660]  the perpetrator becomes the victim the victim becomes the perpetrator
[03:22:38.420 --> 03:22:44.500]  reversing the truth turning it inside out and selling it
[03:22:46.900 --> 03:22:55.460]  selling it hard selling it for decades selling it to a half asleep maybe totally asleep public
[03:22:55.460 --> 03:23:06.100]  under the guise of turning around the obvious i mean forget even traditional okay the obvious
[03:23:06.100 --> 03:23:12.980]  values and principles upon which any sane society is based
[03:23:12.980 --> 03:23:27.220]  selling the idea that property is theft right owning property somehow means a prior crime
[03:23:27.220 --> 03:23:30.500]  must have been committed otherwise how could you possibly own property
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:39.380]  and somebody who invades that property that home well they must have been oppressed
[03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:48.340]  in the past that goes without saying their motives the motives of thieves are clear
[03:23:49.540 --> 03:23:56.740]  but you see the motive of a 78 year old man richard osborne brooks in london has to be
[03:23:57.300 --> 03:24:04.500]  analyzed and poured over by the cops and by prosecutors and so forth to detect if there's
[03:24:04.500 --> 03:24:14.180]  any slightest hint of unreasonable aggression on his part before deciding whether to release him
[03:24:14.180 --> 03:24:25.460]  or prosecute him for murder murder this is where we're come to this is where we are this is
[03:24:27.060 --> 03:24:31.780]  the secret society formula really of turning everything upside down inside out
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:39.540]  motive destroying society destroying you destroying me destroying everybody destroying
[03:24:39.540 --> 03:24:51.300]  whatever there can be that's good honest right correct obvious straightforward meaningful about
[03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:57.940]  life that's where they're going that's where they've been going that's the whole idea behind this
[03:24:57.940 --> 03:25:07.620]  otherwise in this particular case why would they say we're arresting this homeowner on suspicion
[03:25:08.260 --> 03:25:16.660]  of murder now neighbors in that area are in an uproar they're saying give this guy a medal
[03:25:17.780 --> 03:25:24.020]  he defended his house there have been other robberies in this area this is great and he's 70
[03:25:24.020 --> 03:25:32.580]  year old terrific and it's also sending a message but no no no no no no that opinion
[03:25:32.580 --> 03:25:40.260]  can't be allowed to stand as the headline of the story no the headline of the story has to be
[03:25:42.900 --> 03:25:46.740]  destruction of what is good and true and right
[03:25:46.740 --> 03:25:55.220]  to that's the mindset of evil
[03:25:58.180 --> 03:26:04.340]  how else is there to put it how else can you describe it that's what evil wants
[03:26:05.140 --> 03:26:12.500]  that's what evil people want they want to invert and reverse and destroy all values
[03:26:12.500 --> 03:26:17.860]  I see for those of you that are watching there's a few pictures on the screen of cops in the area
[03:26:17.860 --> 03:26:24.180]  and so forth I saw photos earlier it looked like somebody had released a biological weapon
[03:26:25.220 --> 03:26:30.020]  there were all kinds of as they call them forensic investigators around this house in
[03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:42.260]  London wearing blue puffy almost look like hazmat suits right what are they looking for it looked
[03:26:42.260 --> 03:26:46.820]  like there were you know a dozen of these guys in addition to Scotland you there there's a few of
[03:26:46.820 --> 03:26:56.820]  them what is that what is that uniform these are forensic investigators they look like creatures
[03:26:56.820 --> 03:27:03.620]  from another planet and then in addition of course you had uniformed police officers
[03:27:05.460 --> 03:27:12.500]  on the scene it really looked like okay well somebody decided to set off a dirty bomb or somebody
[03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:18.580]  had a biological warfare agent in the house and so forth and so on meanwhile crime is
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:26.820]  rising like crazy in London with stabbings and so forth you've had stories recently about that
[03:27:28.100 --> 03:27:33.140]  but they've got to focus on this guy Richard Osborne Brooke 78 years old
[03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:40.420]  why because the issue of private property is at stake
[03:27:40.420 --> 03:27:52.740]  if he becomes celebrated if there is a huge groundswell of public opinion on his side
[03:27:53.300 --> 03:28:01.060]  much larger even than now if people rise up and say we're sick and tired of this and that's it
[03:28:01.060 --> 03:28:13.300]  then you get a revolution overnight people wake up they say what is going on here
[03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:23.460]  what's happening when it's so simple a family owns a house people break into the house
[03:28:24.580 --> 03:28:28.180]  we don't know what they're going to do we know they're going to steal something
[03:28:28.180 --> 03:28:36.420]  owner defense the house arrested on suspicion of hurt be back after the break

[03:32:26.900 --> 03:32:32.420]  locking onto them instead of a legitimate cell tower stingray devices allow the user to gain
[03:32:32.420 --> 03:32:37.940]  highly specific information on the location of any particular phone down to a particular apartment
[03:32:37.940 --> 03:32:44.180]  complex or hotel room more sophisticated versions can eavesdrop on calls by forcing phones to step
[03:32:44.180 --> 03:32:49.940]  down to the older unencrypted 2g wireless channel some stingray devices can even plant
[03:32:49.940 --> 03:32:53.300]  malware on a phone leon macadoon for wars dot com

[03:34:17.860 --> 03:34:32.420]  info wars store dot com this is called capitalism what a dirty word right capitalism oh my god
[03:34:32.420 --> 03:34:40.900]  god capitalism somebody has a product and sells it and somebody else buys it
[03:34:43.620 --> 03:34:51.300]  this is now of course superseded by much more sophisticated and complex economics where
[03:34:52.020 --> 03:34:59.060]  everything is going to be free for everybody and nobody works and it's all utopia right
[03:34:59.060 --> 03:35:05.620]  this is where it's going and we can thank the technocrats and the globalists that this is the
[03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:11.860]  utopia that we're entering where there there is no longer an exchange where somebody works to
[03:35:11.860 --> 03:35:18.420]  actually earn money i mean isn't that horrendous no no no no no no you'll be given everything
[03:35:19.220 --> 03:35:25.060]  you'll be given everything in the new society it'll just be laid out on a silver platter for
[03:35:25.060 --> 03:35:31.460]  you and you won't have to worry about anything ever again nothing will be a problem to you
[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:37.060]  you'll wake up in the morning secure in the knowledge that you can sit and watch television
[03:35:37.060 --> 03:35:43.220]  for the next 30 years and nobody is going to bother you and things will be delivered to your door
[03:35:43.220 --> 03:35:50.260]  and food and so forth and so on and the whole concept of work which was you know ancient and
[03:35:50.260 --> 03:35:56.580]  outmoded will be just gone and everybody will be serenely happy isn't that what everybody wants
[03:35:56.580 --> 03:36:06.340]  isn't that what you want isn't that the new world that is waiting for you yes huh no more
[03:36:06.340 --> 03:36:14.820]  private property you'll have a sign on your door that says whatever i have here is yours for the
[03:36:14.820 --> 03:36:25.540]  taking yeah whatever i have here is yours for the taking you can have it so theft will be gone
[03:36:25.540 --> 03:36:31.380]  it's just erased as a concept the way borders will be erased and countries will be erased
[03:36:31.380 --> 03:36:36.340]  and there'll be one all embracing loving authority at the top of the food chain
[03:36:37.140 --> 03:36:43.140]  that will run the entire planet on this basis of course certain things will be happening you'll
[03:36:43.140 --> 03:36:48.100]  have no guns i mean there won't be any need for guns because no more self-protection that's out
[03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:56.740]  nobody will have guns except the government and the criminals but we don't talk about that
[03:36:59.220 --> 03:37:07.220]  nobody will have the right to their own body because after all you can't think of your body as
[03:37:07.220 --> 03:37:14.580]  as being invalid or a piece of property no your body belongs to everybody so when the next
[03:37:14.580 --> 03:37:21.940]  generation of vaccines comes in which is being tested right now and this is not science fiction
[03:37:21.940 --> 03:37:29.140]  i'm making up they will be synthesized genes that will be injected into your body april 15th 1995
[03:37:29.140 --> 03:37:37.220]  new york times look it up and these synthesized genes you see they say will make you immune to whatever
[03:37:37.220 --> 03:37:43.700]  the disease in question is and for every vaccine instead it'll be genetic therapy and these genes
[03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:52.980]  will be injected into your body and won't that be wonderful wonderful except for one thing except
[03:37:52.980 --> 03:38:05.620]  for the fact that your dna will be permanently altered by these injected genes so you might
[03:38:05.620 --> 03:38:12.260]  have some question about being stuck with new altered dna for the rest of your life and you
[03:38:12.260 --> 03:38:20.820]  might have some question about everybody on earth in this next generation of vaccines
[03:38:20.820 --> 03:38:28.500]  who receives any vaccine of this type having their dna altered permanently for the rest of their life
[03:38:29.380 --> 03:38:38.420]  but these are just peripheral questions you see that are melt away in light of the fact
[03:38:38.980 --> 03:38:45.380]  that the medical cartel which is the strongest arm of the globalist movement has your best interest
[03:38:45.380 --> 03:38:51.140]  and your health in mind and they really only want to heal you and do the best for you no matter
[03:38:51.140 --> 03:38:58.900]  what the circumstances why else would they have invented this revolutionary technique called dna
[03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:08.340]  vaccines which inject you with genes and permanently alter your dna and by the way not in entirely
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:14.420]  predictable ways but in ways that nobody can predict because there is a ripple effect when you
[03:39:14.420 --> 03:39:19.780]  start tinkering you see with the genetic structure of humans and you say well we're only going to cut
[03:39:19.780 --> 03:39:26.340]  this much that's all there is going to take this little slice of the dna out we're going to put it
[03:39:26.340 --> 03:39:31.060]  over here and then we're going to substitute a few genes here which we know are tremendously
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:38.180]  beneficial and then everything will just kind of smooth out but then it turns out you know we
[03:39:38.180 --> 03:39:45.220]  didn't do it right or somebody in the lab made a mistake because now it appears that there are
[03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:52.100]  after effects and ripples that go on and on and on and on and on we don't know where or how or why
[03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:59.780]  or what the effects are going to be but don't worry about it and that's why the United States
[03:40:00.580 --> 03:40:07.700]  Department of Agriculture has suddenly decided that they are not going to regulate the next
[03:40:07.700 --> 03:40:16.340]  generation of GMO food crops yes there is going to be a next generation this was just the beginning
[03:40:16.340 --> 03:40:23.620]  when Ponsanto did starting in 1996 no no no no no this is going to be a whole different ballgame
[03:40:23.620 --> 03:40:32.020]  you see because many more changes will be made in the genetic makeup of fruits and vegetables and
[03:40:32.020 --> 03:40:40.340]  grains and so forth by breakthrough revolutionary gene editing techniques you see a little snip here
[03:40:40.340 --> 03:40:46.980]  a little snip there put that in take that out glue it all back together and so forth oh yes
[03:40:48.340 --> 03:40:52.820]  and it turns out that this technique called crisper crisper
[03:40:52.820 --> 03:41:03.940]  is very cheap oh very available anybody with a lab and an idea can get it
[03:41:05.540 --> 03:41:12.420]  so they can just experiment to their hearts content Pandora's box is wide wide open and the
[03:41:12.420 --> 03:41:20.020]  U.S. Department of Agriculture is saying we will not be regulating any of this new food
[03:41:20.020 --> 03:41:29.700]  because it is kept this identical to food produced by traditional breeding mechanisms
[03:41:32.580 --> 03:41:41.780]  wow these guys have some huge you know what to be able to lie like that openly
[03:41:41.780 --> 03:41:51.620]  you mean the ancient techniques of breeding food are no different from snip snip gene insertions
[03:41:51.620 --> 03:41:59.940]  and deletions and changes and ripples that's the same food wow what would be the next step along
[03:41:59.940 --> 03:42:07.860]  that insane road into the glorious future that we're all looking for well it would be that big
[03:42:07.860 --> 03:42:16.100]  companies would say agri-companies we want this kind of genetically engineered edited food to be
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:23.460]  labeled organic because you see we don't need to use pesticides anymore we just modify the genes to
[03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:36.900]  reject the pests organic really huh be back after the break don't go anywhere defending the republic

[03:47:18.660 --> 03:47:28.820]  John Rappaport here in the last segment the fourth hour just a quick reminder about brain
[03:47:28.820 --> 03:47:39.860]  force plus 50 off at info wars store dot com boosting your mind your thinking process that's
[03:47:39.860 --> 03:47:54.660]  the new atropic brain force plus at info wars store dot com private property the ability to say
[03:47:54.660 --> 03:48:11.380]  this is mine i earned it you can't take it that's at the heart of a great deal of things
[03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:16.420]  now people say well that's you don't want to talk about that because that's really
[03:48:16.420 --> 03:48:19.540]  politically incorrect i mean don't you think that's kind of harsh
[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:30.180]  no it's not even harsh for liberal snowflakes if you dig deep enough into their bags to find out
[03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:38.100]  what their most precious possession is whatever that is it'll be there somewhere oh my cell phone
[03:48:38.100 --> 03:48:45.620]  i've got to have my cell phone or whatever that is and you say that's not yours it belongs to me
[03:48:45.620 --> 03:48:57.140]  because i'm taking it no you're not you can't have it it's mine so even the liberal snowflakes if
[03:48:57.140 --> 03:49:03.380]  you dig down deep enough they're going to find something that they truly believe they own that's
[03:49:03.380 --> 03:49:10.340]  there as you see now they'll never really admit it in any principled form certainly not in the form
[03:49:10.340 --> 03:49:16.580]  of the bill of rights or the constitution etc they're not going to be looking at anything at that
[03:49:16.580 --> 03:49:22.020]  level because those are just worthless pieces of paper that are blown away in the wind but
[03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:30.900]  on a visceral emotional level you can find something that they consider is their private
[03:49:30.900 --> 03:49:41.060]  property they own it it's theirs you can't have it so at that level even they understand
[03:49:42.100 --> 03:49:50.180]  something that is basic now whether they actually earned it or not that's a whole other question
[03:49:50.180 --> 03:50:01.060]  right earned the money to buy the phone we'll leave that out for the moment but that's a deal that's
[03:50:01.060 --> 03:50:09.940]  been struck through the struggle of history your land does not belong to the king your land does
[03:50:09.940 --> 03:50:16.500]  not belong to the monarch your land does not belong to the queen your land does not belong to the
[03:50:16.500 --> 03:50:26.420]  priest class of ubladi whatever the you know ruling priest classes your land does not belong to the
[03:50:26.420 --> 03:50:40.180]  vassal the baron it belongs to you much blood has been shed over that simple fact and now of course
[03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:47.060]  on many levels including as i discussed in the last segment your body we're going to give you this
[03:50:47.060 --> 03:50:52.980]  DNA this new DNA it's going to be incorporated into your DNA and you're going to be changed so
[03:50:52.980 --> 03:51:02.900]  your body is not really your own it belongs to us the state now the globalists have to try to turn
[03:51:02.900 --> 03:51:10.580]  that all around why do you think they want to take the guns all the guns not just a few of the
[03:51:10.580 --> 03:51:18.820]  guns they're looking to take all of the guns because they don't want people to have the ability
[03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:30.100]  to say this is mine you can't take it no matter what all of that has to be turned around because
[03:51:30.100 --> 03:51:36.100]  the propaganda for globalism is everything belongs to everybody whatever that means you see
[03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:40.820]  everything belongs to everybody everything is connected to everything and therefore everything
[03:51:40.820 --> 03:51:48.340]  belongs to everybody and nothing belongs to nobody and whatever we say goes and we're just
[03:51:48.340 --> 03:51:58.100]  going to have one giant cheese glob of consciousness in this new society of planet earth one nation
[03:51:58.100 --> 03:52:04.500]  for the entire planet ruled from above by the new world order the global management system
[03:52:04.500 --> 03:52:12.180]  whatever you want to call it the elite who know what's best for you and me and everybody else
[03:52:12.180 --> 03:52:28.820]  and what's best is that nobody owns anything anymore that's gone has to go by their premise right and
[03:52:28.820 --> 03:52:39.060]  so if you don't want that to happen then you have to dig deep and discover your own understanding
[03:52:39.060 --> 03:52:49.860]  of what your private property means and what is yours undeniably irresistibly yours
[03:52:52.580 --> 03:52:59.540]  but I don't like that because that's too harsh I like share and care better well you can share
[03:52:59.540 --> 03:53:04.900]  and care whatever you want but if everything is taken away from you then you have nothing left
[03:53:04.900 --> 03:53:14.260]  to care right think about oh well just I'll give you know I just want to give everything to everybody
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:19.860]  and and be a nice person and everybody likes me and it'll be wonderful and so forth no it's not
[03:53:19.860 --> 03:53:31.460]  going to be nice it's going to be nasty very nasty unless you get down in your mind in your
[03:53:31.460 --> 03:53:43.780]  soul what it means to actually own something own it OWN don't shirk away from it don't run away
[03:53:43.780 --> 03:54:00.500]  from it don't back off from it not only accept it not only admit it be satisfied be very very
[03:54:00.500 --> 03:54:11.220]  satisfied about it nothing wrong with it whatsoever if you don't have that you don't have a declaration
[03:54:11.220 --> 03:54:15.460]  of independence you don't have a constitution you don't have a bill of rights you don't have
[03:54:15.460 --> 03:54:25.860]  anything nothing which must be what this guy Richard Osborne Brooks who I started out with
[03:54:25.860 --> 03:54:33.620]  at the top 78 years old homeowner in London must be thinking about now as he's sitting in his jail
[03:54:33.620 --> 03:54:39.780]  cell wondering whether they're going to release him or prosecute him for murder because he defended
[03:54:39.780 --> 03:54:46.740]  his home he defended his life he defended his wife's life against two thieves and in a battle
[03:54:46.740 --> 03:54:56.420]  with one of the thieves one of the thieves died while this man was defending what he owned his home
[03:54:56.980 --> 03:55:08.260]  and all that that meant to him not just just the physical but everything that it meant
[03:55:08.260 --> 03:55:18.740]  to him as well that's what he defended and that is ultimately why they put him in jail
[03:55:20.100 --> 03:55:26.900]  now they may release him then they prosecute him we'll see what happens but that's why they arrested
[03:55:26.900 --> 03:55:33.300]  him on suspicion of murder and why they put him in jail because everything in the new world order
[03:55:33.300 --> 03:55:41.380]  is inside out and upside down and that's on purpose folks that's one of the secret society
[03:55:41.380 --> 03:55:56.260]  formulas turn everything that's right and good upside down make the true and the good and the
[03:55:56.260 --> 03:56:03.620]  decent and the wonderful and the fantastic horrible and repellent and disgusting and vice versa
[03:56:05.060 --> 03:56:13.060]  that's the formula that's the deal that's the piece of the puzzle in psychological warfare
[03:56:15.220 --> 03:56:25.300]  and all that's necessary is that we go back to the basics the basic is this is ours this belongs
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:35.460]  to me I own it I take pride in ownership and no you can't take it away from me period it's very
[03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:44.740]  simple when you get down to it it's not the whole story of life no but if you take that piece out
[03:56:44.740 --> 03:56:54.820]  what you have left is something that truly 99% of the people on this planet do not want
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:57:01.620]  whether they know it or not and some of those people will only understand it when it's all gone
[03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:09.860]  but for the rest of us we know now what it means and we know that what the globalists are aiming
[03:57:09.860 --> 03:57:17.060]  for is to take it all the way and say see it was just all provisional it was never really yours
[03:57:17.940 --> 03:57:24.660]  oh yes it was and it still is see you next time at info wars thank you
[03:57:24.660 --> 03:57:35.860]  you
[03:57:43.380 --> 03:57:48.500]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that
[03:57:48.500 --> 03:57:54.340]  their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[03:57:54.340 --> 03:57:59.860]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to
[03:57:59.860 --> 03:58:06.980]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[03:58:06.980 --> 03:58:13.380]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[03:58:13.380 --> 03:58:19.780]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[03:58:19.780 --> 03:58:26.980]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way
[03:58:26.980 --> 03:58:34.500]  we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
